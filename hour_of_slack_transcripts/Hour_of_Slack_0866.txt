What is God good for?
Call now and I'll rush you a free tape.
That's what we can count on God for.
A free tape.
No. No.
Yes. He did it.
Mm-hmm.
By which we measure
our pain.
I'll say it again.
God is a concept.
By which we measure
our pain.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I don't believe
in magic.
I don't believe
in itching.
I don't believe
in the Bible.
I don't believe
in talent.
I don't believe
in Hitler.
I don't believe
in Jesus.
I don't believe
in Kennedy.
I don't believe
in Buddha.
I don't believe
in mantra.
I don't believe
in Gita.
I don't believe
in yoga.
I don't believe
in kings.
I don't believe
in Elvis.
I don't believe
in Elvis.

in Timberman.
I don't believe
in Beatles.
I just believe
in me.
You'll call
me
dumb.
That's reality
The dream is over
What can I say?
The dream is over
Yesterday
I was the tree weaver
But now I'm a bone
I was the walrus
But now I'm a bone
And so, dear friends
We'll just have to carry on
The dream is over
But, dear friends, somebody else is just starting up.
Look!
I know who it is!
I know who it is that doesn't belong among us!
I swear, I know who it is!
It's...
It's...
The Subgenius Hour of Swag!
Oh, that's not true!
S is for the suckers that live all around
U is for us, they're always putting us down
B is for Bob
He gives us our bread
G is for the guns they put to your head
E is for the eunuchs they want you to become
N is for the nuts they wish they had some
I is for that eye in the back of my head
U is for you
They wanna see you dead
S is for the shit that's all around
I'm a subgenius motherfucker
and I ain't no fucking clown, but...

In order to rule the world, you must first conquer it.
Only on those bold terms can this total war result in total victory.
Well, don't you think it's a little late?
No.
Well, I do.
I don't give a damn.
Dead center.
Yes, liberty ring.
I can't stand things that don't make any sense.
Come on, let's get out of my brain.
Yes, yes, of course you can.
That was actually originated for people who were tired of pointing.
Healy after Jesus was originated for your right brain.
That's true.
He's in a little can and we open him every 45 minutes.
Now he's just squeaking.
Be scary, Colin.
Stand back, stand back.
Okay, I'll steer in the ship toward the left.
And you will be able to now look out the window,
see the light.
See the little people there?
See them?

They're actually not people.
They're not bad Jesus.
They're there to scare you.
They're in the human scrapyard.
Please, if you're coughing all over your speaker,
you're saying we've got to clean it up here at the station.
It is true there is a thing here I do not understand.
There is a pain between my ears.
For those who don't understand,
perhaps they're always on the short poopy,
the end of the stick.
Yes, the short poopy.
There's a lot of short doggy poop around to put on the stick.
But if you want to live like a real man or woman,
you must, you must, you must.
It is later than you think.
It's later than you think.
It's later than you think.
It's later than you think.
It's more hard.
It's more hard.
As chimpanzees are to humans,
humans are to us.
You're improving, Jack.
You just can't seem to get rid of that streak of honesty in you.
The one that ruined you was that damned Indian old teepee.
You know, Laskin.
He gave you a vision of moral order in the universe
and there isn't any.
Those stars twinkle in a void, dear boy,
and the two-legged creature schemes and dreams beneath them all in vain.
All in vain, Jack.
Do you hear anything?
Listen to me.
Two-legged creature won't believe anything.
And the more preposterous, the better.
Whales speak French at the bottom of the sea.
The horses of Arabia have seen it.
Silver wings.
Pygmies mate with elephants in darkest Africa.
I have sold all those propositions.
They were all fools and none of it matters.
Ah.

I watched a world from an alien place
From a desert plain so far away
I hear the sound of a starlit night
Of an angel's song in a brilliant light
Your world of people has no place for me
I've read the flea from an ancient
saying key
Your world of people suffocates me
It prisons me, it drowns me in ice
I watched a world from an alien place
From the tides of time and the shore
of the sea
I stumbled on one in a fever dream
In a landscape of lies
Shaking a silent scream
Your world of people has no place for me
I've read the flea from an ancient
saying key
Awaken world of little men
Of hateful deeds and evil hands
You are never amoning our fate
Swallowed away all theisters
Stgotaku with a sword
Nos ring, has been broken
Last chorus but never towards the end
No worries, it is not the one
No causality
No whole world
Hits a死

And God bigger than the all

Steal away the flower九
Money and not break over andadel we've seen
Stillita you left a scarate 방법
BONUS TWARMY 7'0 nedaw proof
I watch the world from an alien place
From a desert plain until far away
I hear the sound of a starlit night
Of an angel's song and a billion lights
Your world of people has no place for me
I'll forever flee from it, insane king
A wicked world of little men
Of hateful deeds and evil hands

Abortion, the murder of unwanted pregnancies
Produced by immoral lepers
Is also affecting 1 million women annually
These so-called culture
But barbaric sinners think nothing of it
Having their little bundles from God
Packed to pieces and flushed
Never mind that God says
Thou shalt not kill
Exodus 20-13
Sinners have taken the matter into their own hands
But remember God holds the final trump card
The judgment
Revelation 20
Verses 11-15
10
Mercy killers are also on the ascendancy in America
They are progressive abortions
Who have become hard to killing
And now wish to include the mommies and daddies
Along with babies
Water my father in the boat
Who have been bitten
God's commandant
Exodus 20-12
Interferes with her
Her responsibility is so great
The world comes to her
These sick words must be related to his word

Flunk God's rules?
What makes people think they can do that Dave?
I dunno
I don't know, flunking is easy, but flapping is harder.
Who do we think we are?
Go!
I got away with it so far.
I got away with it because Bob gave me something to get me off.
I got away with it.
Bob got me off, and I got away with it.
I got away with dogs.
I got away with old ladies.
You got away with the bitches.
I got away with barbers with one eye.
I got away with three people's hands.
I got away with men who think they're Jesus Christ.
Then our brazen disregard of God's laws will be judged.
Revelation 22.15 declares,
Outside of heaven are dogs, sorcerers, whoremongers, murderers, idolaters, and whosoever loveth.
These are all the people from the lodge.
The dogmongers and the whores and stuff.
The day of the Lord is at hand.
And he shall come like a thief in the night.
Or he shall come somewhere or another.
The Lord cometh, and the Lord goeth.
Come unto me, Bud.
This here's your sugar daddy.
From his catty.
In the ever-loving great beyond.

So prick your ears up.
And be quick like to respond.
Cause daddy ain't too happy.
None too happy.
What did I ever create you for?
You ain't done nothing.
But make your daddy so.
It looks like evolution's no solution.
You just keep falling ever further behind.
You may be tanned and clean-shaven.
But ain't with little bit of hair in time.
Big hairy situation.
Every nation.
About to bring your daddy to his knees.
I just keep crying.
These people bleed.
You damn dirty apes.
What the hell are you doing?
You damn dirty apes.
Look at what you have done.
You damn dirty apes.
Who do you think you have been fooling?
Cause I'm gonna catch you.
Gonna catch you.
Every one of you.

Very frightening
Oh, but that's just a little nervous twitch

All you need's a little self-esteem
To turn this nightmare
Into a sweet, sweet dream

That's D-R-E-X-E
L-L-E-N-T
And now back to
well, some
Lemur-ish cut-up
collages, puzzling evidences,
howling over men,
lonesome cowboys, and
Chaz right here.
This is the night of the whole hand.
So there's been all this talk
in science.
Let's talk science for a minute.
Well, can I ask you one question?
Kind of a scientific question.
Is it true that you've heard
that there is a dangerous sorcerer
or a demon, perhaps it speaks from
Dick Cheney's navel?
Really? I don't think that's scientific.
Well, I don't think it is either.
I think it sounds like superstition.
It couldn't possibly be true.
It has nothing to do with it.
That sounds like an urban legend to me.
Oh yeah, that's not science.
That's pseudoscience.
That's false science.
But now, scientists are pretty convinced
that...
We've been talking all about this lately.
The day of the Lord is at hand.
They're pretty convinced that
we need to deprovincialize ourselves
one step further.
We thought that this universe was the only one
and it turns out that they're pretty convinced
that there's just multitudes
of varied universes all
existing.
They're real convinced of that, huh?
Well, if dogs can have multiple orgasms,
why can't we have multiple orgasms?
Why can't we have multiple universes?
Have you ever done the math
with your slide rule and your calculator?
No, but I'm open to whatever.
You know, people come up with just as valid
as anything I come across anywhere else.
You know as well as I do
that for all you know, all that math
that they keep talking about
might as well be the same as the totem pole
that some medicine man
tells everybody to worship.
Maybe, but it's the best bet we got.
I mean, it's led us farther
than any of those other things have.
We've been to the moon.
We have probes going all over the universe.
What telephone poles have taken us to the moon, Larry?
I've been to the moon.
Not on a telephone pole.
Not the way you're talking about.
Yeah.
And I don't see no weird like eagles
or thunderbirds on top of any ladder of numbers.
We're building a space station that got, you know,
science, you know, we understand a lot about a lot of things, DNA.
Well, Hitler almost built a science station
with the world of fire and ice.
So it's gotten us a lot farther than all the other, you know, religions.
But Hitler built, almost built, a science station with the world of fire and ice.
He actually got things out of it.
He built science with fire and ice.
Science is the most exacting religion.
They don't know what I'm talking about.
The theory of fire and ice, Hitler's theory of science was totally whacked out.
And yet he produced all this weird stuff.
Well, he didn't produce anything.
Well, they had the best Nazi flying saucers in the whole hollow earth.
Well, they believed in all this anti-grav stuff, but you know, it didn't have any...
And they came out with that movie, Ilse, She-Wolf of the SS.
Well, that was pure science right there.
They work for the CIA now.
Who does?
Ilse?
Islan?
Islan.
Islan.
Islan.
Islan.
Islan.
Your island paradise on the moon, attended to your every wish by a Nazi scientist from
the year Zip.
Here's Klaus Freudrich, an early inventor of U2, preparing to offer you a jelly donut.
And here's you spending over log in the hot sun as Ilse, the She-Wolf of the SS, is






handing you her slide roll.
What?
Klaus will make you his jelly donut.
And he has to.
In a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution, anything
is likely to develop.
Enter the Church of the Subgenius, filling itself as the weirdest cult on earth.
What do they believe in?
Everything.
Everything.
Do they believe in?
A mysterious character named Bob.
Bob.
Bob.

Bob is the culmination of that to which man has aspired throughout his long and slackless

I know if Bob's looking in the window
are you the servant that opens it
so he can piss in
weep no more
I know about that
onions will no longer provoke tears
I only know about it
because I had to seek out
the magic towel that night
for Bob has arisen
well you shouldn't have
you should have been able to contain yourself
again and again and again
it makes me want to go to

Don't tell me you're the future.
You'll be lucky to catch on at the phone company.
You parents up there, you know what I'm talking about.
20, 25 years ago, they were telling us,
you are the future.
You kids want to see the future?
Look at your folks.
Fat butts, baggy tits, beer, television.
That's the future.
Look at me, I'm supposed to be a big success.
I build taco stands for a living.
What kind of bullshit future is that?
You got any sense?
Give them back their damn diplomas.
Give them back their silly fucking hats
and stay 18 for the rest of your life.
You don't want to be the future.
No, no.
Forget the future.
Future sucks.
There he was.
Big as life.
Right there at the foot of my bed.
Jesus.
Jesus?
And he looked me straight in the eye
and he said,
Want a game?
There's more to love
than just fornicating.
Sure.
That's like eyes in the back of your head.
...into even the purest research.
These mud-gobbling giant worms
which live on the edge of volcanic vents...
...gorging themselves on massive, huge piles of mud.
Just like those tremor worms.
Just like the ones in Dune.
Only this mud is wet.
This is truly wet mud.
Not like the kind of mud we used to have back when we were kids.
It was dry mud.
We used to have to make mud pies
and to make them stick together we had to spit on them.
We'd have dirt in one hand and a big pile of spit in the other hand
and we'd...
like...
roll them together until we had us a good mud pie.
And that was the only thing we had for moisture back in those days.
Just spit.
We didn't have candy back then either.
We had to just take a bag of sugar
and carry it around a big old five-pound bag of sugar in our back pocket.
A big old tablespoon.
And when we needed some candy,
we just stuck it into the bag and just took about four or five big tablespoons,
...of the rogue bacteria...
...shoveled it down.
And that was all we had for candy back in those days.
...each one genetically engineered to make a difference in RNA.
Now when a worm dines on one of these babies...
You gotta have...
Those worms have to have limbs to see underground when they're eating through the dirt like that.
They carry little...
little like little miners helmets that let them mine through the dirt.
They're chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing.
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug.
They chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away.
Oh, I can't see where I'm going, said Mr. Worm.
And he looked ahead and he had his little pointed yellow helmet on,
shining the way into the back of the goose, as it were.
The pteranodon...
The end of the goose...
...was a Cretaceous flying reptile.
Flying...
They thought it was a reptile, but actually it was a bird.
It was a bird.
...wings spread, it heaved more than 27 feet.
They found that it was only a simple bird.
It was a bird like...
...a reptile bird.
...its body was only that, the size of a goose.
And yet its wings were 900 feet wide at their...
Oh, well, it's a...
...widest proportion.
27 feet, or 30 actually.
Where is Bozo?
Larger specimens recently discovered.
What the heck is...
It's the Twinkie bike.
What a wonderful, wonderful Twinkie bike.
And so the Twinkie bike headed out into the desert, carrying the little show people.
They asked me about...
Twinkie bike, Twinkie bike.
They asked me about Twinkies on my show.
And they asked what the ingredients were.
Of course, all I could tell them was...
That's when I got fillings.
...golden sponge cake and creamy fillings.
That's all you need to know.
You don't need to know anything more than...
That is all on Earth ye know and all ye need.
...golden life.
That's good enough for Thor.
The United States of Spawn.
...cold golden...
Yes, little caller, you have won the United States of Spawn.
...going everywhere in the valley...
...as we continue to look for your requested songs...
...from the valley of the sun...
...squeezing the erupting core...
...of the United States of Spawn...
...from within the confines of its donut-like hole.

Is it a bird?
No!
Is it a plane?

The Black Dog Singers and now...
LEMUR!
Now you listen to this!
Can I still have my dog?
NO!
Oh no! Please!
Hey Bugs!
I have a special report on the camps to make to the Ministry of Education.
For the children.
Teletubby!
You get 152 hits.
It may sound silly to you, but...
Something bothering you, boy?
Nuclear death.
Oh. Okay.
I take it this place, this Maple Street, is not unique.
By no means.
But it's still a place where we can all be happy.


























swat it to the ground and scream, I don't think so.
I'm just trying to take a bite out of crime.
The Lord took the child.
He died a horrible death.
The awfulness of it staggers the imagination.
We're merely using this corpse for demonstration.
And she looked at me and said...
I said, what do you mean?
She said...
I said, I went out of my mind.
And she looked at me and said...
I went to see the others.
And she said...
What do you want?
You don't have to.
Don't be afraid of him.
That's all there is to it.
No, I can't take it anymore.
Friends, are you going to let this happen?
Are you just going to sit by and watch this corpse rot?
Are you going to scrub its buttocks with a dog brush?
Are you going to get down and apply mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
to this rotting corpse in his WCSV college radio?
Which do you want?
I want to prefer.
Don't you want to get down there and apply the kiss of life?
You guys are worthless.
I know we are.
We're totally worthless.
Get out of my radio station.
I'm going home.
Man, we cannot get one love in carnivution.
My friends, I was in the spirit.
And Bob said to me, he said, I'm going to have to call you home, Reverend Stang.
And I don't think he meant home to Texas.
How about...
I think he meant home to heaven.
A beautiful home away from home.
Home away from home.
Home away from home.
Home away from home.






Home away from home.
I'm going to call a signal to these people because they don't seem to believe.
Look at this.
You can travel there on a signal.
I'm being called home, friends.
A beam of light.
Bob's calling me up.
Now, I see the rocking chair of eternal slack up there on that beautiful cloud.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yes, brother.
Look at how beautiful it is.
There's beautiful creatures of the desired sex gyrating around the heavenly excremeditation throne.
And then just when you're in the gate, you thought you were in the gate in the heaven.
You made the ultimate mistake.
You didn't call 68769.
Oh, you could have.
That's the funny thing about it.
Your friend was thinking about it now.
Or if he only would have sent his contribution.
You could have.
It could have had a coffee mug.
A beautiful logo shirt on.
Maybe even a new twinter hat.
You blew it, you fool.
You fool.
Yeah, you totally blew it.
You fool.
God, I can't believe what a geek.
How could anybody totally, totally, totally, utterly, utterly.
All I remember was he had a chance to get one of those warm sweatshirts on.
And you were warned.
You were told, don't blow it.
Don't mess up.
And you messed up because you didn't call 6900 in the 216 area code.
Oh, man.
Did you blow it, dude?
So that sweatshirt.
No, no, he didn't get that either.
And so he told.
Well, you know, and that 6900, the number itself you will get if you're not having sex and you don't have anybody loving you lately.
If you just call that number 6900, 6900, because it's like, that's it.
It's synergy.
No, no.
69 means belly rubbers.
Yeah, 69.
We each get something out of it.
You know what I mean?
Oh, there he is again.
Here they come.
Here they come.

Here they come again.
Oh, let's walk us out.
They never come around for long.
We don't reach out to touch you.
We want to rub your little round belly, listener.
We want to reach out with our fingers over these hair waves.
We don't reach out with our fist and bust you in the face if you don't call.
And a fist you.
We're gonna fist you, my dear friend.
We're gonna fist you right in the face.
But we can't do it without your help.
From all the way across the Escaleta.
Vino, v-v-vino.
Yes, I believe that Jesus Christ is a succulent dude.





Delicious, flavorful, juicy, tender son of God, the Messiah.
And I'll tell you what, because I was that desperate.
And this other male, he's being stimulated by the mating activity and he wants to have
a go too.
Oh, that's so sweet.
And everybody knows that.
Arusha Control speaking.
Go ahead.
We have a rhino.
Anything else?
No, that's all.
I saw these guys at a roller rink.
I saw the, um, who's this now, the Fletcher and Angels?
It's, um...
Andy and the Walls.
Dick Clark.
Yeah, Andy and the Warhols.
I saw the plastic exploding bananas at a roller rink in Columbus, Ohio when I was a sparse
lad of nearly 58 years old.

I had...
I was wearing chicken shoes at the time and Nico noticed me in the front row.
She waved and threw some barbiturates to me.
She also rubbed that hefty groin of hers with a large red Italian scarf.
I wonder what that meant.
You think it could mean anything?
No, right.
She was...
Stop trying to see, you know, deep hidden meanings in everything.
In what she does and everything, I guess.
Yeah.
Anything.
I guess you should stop.
Yeah.
Reality, you know.
There is no reality.
No, I guess there is no...
I thought you were saying...
I thought you were saying...




I thought you were going to say all reality is interpretive, but you said there is no
reality.
No, everything is relative.
Right.
We're not talking about Homeland Security or the black holes that could envelop us in
a hundred billion years.
Who even knows which universe we're in at any given moment?
Right.
Right.
I mean, that...
You know, right.
You know, you're here, you're there, you know.
Speak for yourself, man.
I've been stuck in the same one this whole time.
Yeah, talk about strange.
I'm pretty sure of it.
Except for that one time when alternate universe man did his trick just to prove he could do
it.
Okay.

All right.
Let's go.
All right.
All right.
Okay.






Our next witness is Paul.
Oh.
R-O-T-S.
Thank you.
Close.
We look forward to your testimony, Mr. Miller.
Today's hearing is important to the office furniture industry for four reasons.
Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by saying thank you.

You took a leave of absence with three children and a wife and a girlfriend on the side?
Bless his little heart.
How could you afford a leave of absence?
I'm pretty drunk.
Thank you, Minister Donald De Rossi, who was established in 1927.
Thank you.
And so there they are.
Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by saying...
Teletubby!
Oh, no, please!
Eyes burning like holes.
The bloodsucker affects him more.
Holy catfish, that's awful.
Where would my dad get rid of a body?
There's just one little thing you're forgetting, college boy.
You buried him, too.
That was funny.
How are you doing on time?
I will wrap up very quickly.
Thank you.
The purple dinosaur who has been called everything from refreshingly sweet to nauseatingly nerdy
Stupid old stupid head.
Well, once again, rule toddler TV, menacing the Teletubbies.
I believe that the Teletubbies are...
Their time is on this...
They're definitely...
Never seen them, actually.
Their days are numbered.
They may as well put a fork in the Teletubbies once Barney gets the scene again.
Did you see this subgenius hooded robe?
Subgenius hooded robe?
Clearly made to intimidate and impress, and I'm guessing it dates 1980, maybe the beginning of the 60s.
It's all...
Origin.
The best item of its kind I've ever encountered.
Unfortunately, we have no information identifying the subgenius.
The robe is of excellent quality, in thin black wool, 58 inches long from the neck, nine button front, buttons are silver colored.
Permanently affixed to the neck is a 14-inch tall hood which comes to a point at the top rear and then goes 10 inches forward to its front, which falls the face mask with...
Wow.
One size fits all, huh?
For the men that want something extra...
Which would be at the top of the forehead...
It's not available in stores.
Two and a half inch by two and three quarter inch embroidered Dobbs face.
This is not amazingly boring stuff.
This is the real thing.
No, this is amazing.
Has wavy white embroidered edge...
Yeah, this thing is...
On the back is a 12-inch high red inverted pipe...
Does it have the flap in the back?
How much does it cost?
That's the important thing.
How much are they charging?
It's 475 bucks.
Does it have the pyroflatulation flap in the back?
But it may be so aged that it would fall apart.
It sounds like it's actually real.
Because if you didn't have that flap...
And it costs 475 bucks, you could risk actually igniting it if you weren't careful.
It's a mysterious subgenius robe.
Yeah, from some secret society or order.
Look at this piece of hood.
With a skull and crossbones.
He thinks they like him, but when the UFOs come, the ladies are going to kill everybody but me.
Well, you know, of course they'll spare the righteous.
That's what all subgeniuses think.
I'm helping channel the thoughts of all subgeniuses...
That means no one will be spared.
And no one will call.
They don't need to go to Brushwood.
The saucers will come and pick them up wherever they are.
They'll be instantly materialized.
It'll be like a rapture of subgeni.
And they'll clap.
This is...
Right now, we're looking at the picture of all the subgeni sitting in their pretend first-class seats on the space shuttles, ready to leave.
Mysterious and threatening secret clans.

Or society hooded rogues.
I was just telling you, it's a subgenius robe from the early 70s.
Well, it certainly looks like a terrifying and intimidating...
It does, it does.
That's back when they used to paddle the pledges and all that stuff.
Yeah, we used to make them run the gauntlet.
The bobbies?
We had the famous naked woman gauntlet.
We used to run them through.
They hated that.
Those bobbies, they always hate stuff because they're nerds.
And they're so competitive among themselves.
That's what's so pathetic about it.
They fight for it.
Just because the average weight of each of those women was well beyond 300 pounds, that shouldn't have any effect on it if they were, you know...
Or where Philo has worked for a million years.
Thinkers.
Thinkers.
Thinkers from beyond the sun.
The competitive world.
On the backside of reality.
Conspiracy biz.
Forbidden fantasies that boil up in a drenched sunburst of fun and relaxation.
Rest and relaxation at last.
I don't feel relaxed.
I don't feel relaxed.
This show makes me all tense and itchy.
From rest and sleep.

Okay, okay, I'll tell you.
Here, write this down.
All right, all life on Earth
is going to be dead in five years.
Now, skip over to the other side
and write this down.
What's this?
This is what they want.
Just write it down.
All the flowers,
all the trees,
all the little birdies.
Oh, and all the children.
That's it?
Yep.
Yeah, they're not as dedicated
as we are, Bob.
You know, they have no incentives,
no motivation.
What's this?
It's the final map
to show us where we're going
to pick them up.
Well, we better not lose this.
I'd say, Bob.
I'll turn this story
into a hurry if you don't mind.
Stargate.
One million forgotten B.C.
Monsters.
Captain's Lord.
Monsters have taken over
the interface once again.
And I and Mr. Spook
are helpless to do anything about it.
Visitors are requested
not to throw coffee into the basin.
Irritating, Captain.
The sensors have eliminated
all the blue passages
from my sex novel.
Still poking that big nose of yours
in the things that I'm concerned.
You fly Lutonohuru.
I fail to see
what the size of my nose
has to do with the problem
that we are facing now.
You can be like the queen
on sex planners.
It makes you constantly comment
on its prodigious size.
I forget.
You know, I never did watch Star Trek,
so I don't know all the different characters.
What is it about my nose
that constantly brings me down?
It brings great attention.
Its fader was on Star Trek.
Blast you, Spook.
You know that your nose
is in front to all decent Earth men?
Weird.
I'm picking up things.
That's what you keep telling me.
Are you out of your Vulcan mind, Spook?
Oh, I get it.
He doesn't have a mind, right?
Is that the joke?
A mind is a terrible thing to waste.
When the baby is done drinking,
it must be unscrewed

I'm sorry.
I just...
I think I just sat on the racist peanut butter cups.
You did that on purpose.
I saw you.
Just so I could have them all.
Oh, he figured out my point.
To boldly split infinitives

Voyage to see what's on the box.
Space.
The final frontier.
And then a bunch of old crafty stars.
Pretending to go like this.
These are the voyages of the starship KPFA.
Its continuing mission.
To boldly explore.
To smash up the entire...
It's once.
To see what's on the bottom.
Break everything.
The bottom is erupting.
The entire studio.
That's the monster that comes out
and attacks the whole ship.
Oh, some monster, didn't they, Kirk?
I've heard that one before.
What kind of ship is that?
Every week there's a Kirk out.
And the ship pitches and rolls.
Everyone falls out of his seat.
Here's a harder one.
Ow!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Hard is right.
Oh, my seat!
Well, friends, Dr. Howell and the show there on KPFA.

This is a hymn dedicated to the grinning, giggling monkey guru.
No!
Now, this is bliss consciousness.
Now, we have the roots of the tree.
This is the trunk of the tree.
These are the branches of the tree with the pretty leaves.
Now, in order to get bliss consciousness, we must water the roots of the tree.
When the roots are watered, the bliss rises up the trunk of the tree into the branches of the tree into the leaves.
When this happens, we have bliss consciousness.
Now, bliss consciousness is something that your mother will approve of.
Unlike sex and other said things, this fits right on in with her.
She loves bliss consciousness.
Uh, pig.
Pig.
There is a happy land far, far away where little piggies grow three times a day.
Oh, you should see them run when they see the butcher come to cut slices off their bum three times a day.
This is dedicated to bliss consciousness.
Ha!
