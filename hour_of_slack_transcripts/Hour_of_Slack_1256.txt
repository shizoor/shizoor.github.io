From here on out, it's up to you, Mac.
All right, Mac.
You got it?
Yeah.
Okay, now, it's coming at you, too.
And a little gentle now.
All right.
I've got it.
Here.
All right.
One, two, four, three.
The subgenius power of switching.
I'll crawl in first.
Good luck.
Okay, now, let's get to work.
Here.
Here are the time bombs you rigged up.
Six grenades.
Yeah, that ought to do it.
All right.
We're the type.
A bomb room.
The Bizarro Bomb.
No light.
Slug.
The Bizarro Bomb.
The Idle Slug.
The Idle Slug.
The Idle Slug.
The SMG bomb.
Oh, my God.
I want to join Islamic jihad.
I just want to kill for God.
Praising Allah is the life for me.
The Idle Slug.
The Idle Slug.





I'll use pipe bombs, what the fuck?
Killing Hebrews brings good luck.
Gotta make Khomeini proud of me.
Load a car with dynamite and drive into a synagogue without any brakes.
Nothing could be better than impaling your intestines on a big rusty stake.
Hand grenades and cattle prods, let's go out and kill for God.
I can hear Mohammed calling me.
Yowza, yowza, yowza.
smT0 💥 joke
a town is all it takes is a search of sexual Sindh
No Bam engineers andujahide im like wow
Let me play a few in the night
philosophize
Though the Koran seems quite odd
I still want to kill for God
Praising Jesus is the life for me
Fuck those pagans, they're such cynics
Let's bomb the abortion clinic
Jerry Falwell is my cup of tea
Never thought I'd make it big by selling God to idiots on cable TV
What the fuck, it's not GE
But still a better way to use my business degree
Use a rifle, spare the rod
Let's go out and kill for God
Praise the Lord and hand that gun to me
From PR News in Washington, I'm growing dimmer by the hour,
but Australian officials still aren't happy.
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev is in Moscow subway stations.
Russian security officials say Dmitry Medvedev
is one of Russia's biggest domestic problems.
Analysts say security officials ripped through
one of the world's biggest metro systems at rush hour.
Officials say there aren't PR news in Moscow.
Wall Street 6-10-8-8-10-6
Australia's foreign minister says this is PR news.
The Commerce Department is still recovering, but slowly.
Clearly, economists should please the Federal Reserve on Friday.
A wrecked South Korean warship inside a sunken ship in Moscow.
Military divers sank into the Yellow Sea on Friday,
but received no response.
The South Korean government could have drifted into South Korean waters,
trapped inside North Korea.
Congress has adjourned without conspiring to kill PR News in Washington.
Thanks to Lee Murr for PR News and for our title sequence
and for the song destruction's bracketing said title sequence.
Although the large did the hour of pinks part.
That song, Kill for God,
is by Reverend Joe Newman of the Rudy Schwartz Project
from the CD Remembering a Summertime Rash,
which is a collection of greatest hits, you might say,
released by DCJamRecords.com.
You can also own this CD,
even though I intend to play pretty much all of it on the show eventually.
The Rudy Schwartz Project album Bowling for Appliances
has also been released,
and we'll be hearing that as well,
all from DCJamRecords.com or MySpace slash RudySchwartzProject.
And as far as I know,
Reverend Joe Newman is still looking for somebody
to make a music video of that song, Kill for God.
For details, see Stang at Subgenius.com.
Zappa died so that he could be replaced
by such...
as Reverend Joe Newman.
But now, an artist shown to us by Reverend Tater Gumphreys,
the artiste Amit Lesak.

Stinks and sucks
I know what you are but what am I?
I hope you die soon
I know what you are but what am I?
I'm gonna hit you with a rock
I know what you are but what am I?
I know what you are but what am I?
I know what you are but what am I?
I know what you are but what am I?
I know what you are but what am I?
Mr. Rection did that collage of calls left on my message machine by the good Reverend Bernard
who recently had a setback in that he was forced to move to a new boarding house due to foreclosure.
And now he only makes his 20 calls in a row every week or so.
And now...
Ten minutes to meltdown, I'm having a drink
I don't think you care, no I don't even think about
Who were the hands that you saved?
I don't think you care, no I don't even think about
Ah! you don't love
Cause you hold them so tight
While the sky up above
Opens, up and rains down with a known holy pour
And there's holes in the ceiling
And holes in the floor
There's holes in these walls, ones so covered with grout
Hey? baby. Its the end of the world
Have a good time
Degtonically speaking, integrity's lost
I don't feel foundation was ever at cost
Just some old bricks and mortar, some holes to be filled
This plywood and brief that can all be rebuilt
It's just two licks and twines, some mad sticks and plates
But it's all too late now, oh my God, what a waste
When I feel the ground shaking, I hear a strange sound
Hey baby, it's the end of the world, I will see you around
Affection is earthbound, our crushes of stone
These all fall away, still you're never alone
One mode of function, steadfast deconstruction
Of attachments once forged, one mode of function

With our fiery ramparts
I can't help but think, way before the big sing
That the streets of Atlanta's already held a stake
I can't help but know, way deep down in my soul
That the best is already coming, now it's time to go
So sign all your yearbooks, give a last glance
We've all missed the prom, but you're used to this dance
So no figureless shadow will drown out
the sun
Hey baby, it's the end of the world, I hope you have fun
I hope you have fun
I hope you have fun

I hope you have fun
I hope you have fun
I hope you have fun
I hope you have fun
Come as free as the flow
How about you?
Come as free as the flow
And the world is there to die
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah ha ha ha
Ah ha ha ha ha
Ah ha
The Rudy Schwartz Project did that song
Leonard Skinner Memorial Tractor Pull
from Bowling for Appliances,
praised Joe Newman,
and before that,
the incredible end-of-the-world song
Meltdown was by a North Texas band
called Slobberbone,
which my son turned me on to.
Slobberbone.
They're Google-able by that name,
Slobberbone.
That song is my new
Shorterper brain worm.
And now, a large view
of puzzling evidence.
Dobbs, Ferry, Dobbs.
Dobbs, Ferry.
That's your cue, caller.
You are Piltdown, man.
Go, caller.
Yes, just a minute.
Just a minute.
Just a minute.
All in the valley of death.
Oh, he's in the extra meditation chamber.
I thought so,
but then I thought it was the Kraken.
Not the Kraken.
They're already there.
Oh, yeah, I see.
They're next day already.
Hey, Kraken, that wasn't too bad.
You're already there.
Yep, he's already there.
Yes, if you have been there,
I will show you the way
where the air is so rare.
If you have been there already,
just stand relaxed and steadily.
It's very relaxing.
Relax, settle back,
and enjoy our future.
You can't have my people
to your pants, my dear friend.
The joy of
two bugs and
you are into that kind of stuff.
I've got,
like,
to point out that
none of these
are the official sponsors.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry, caller.
I had to break with a ringer.
And I left my
my big wind of
spinach dip
over at Chicken's
in the research video.
They're a little bit, uh,
under the mistaken belief
that there was going to be some
dinner service
or having sex with one another.
Oh, yeah, they're pipes, man.
Now I've got to go back
and get my spinach dip
while it still exists.
I'm feeling.
But on the other hand,
a great feeling of
lassitude,
despair,
and ennui
seems to paralyze my will
so that I may not make
a separate extra trip
to retrieve the spinach dip.
You might not want to.
You might not want to.
What, don't eat the spinach?
Is that what you're saying?
I fight to the finish
because I eat my spinach.
Spinach.
Spinach.
Spinach.
Spinach.
Spinach.
Spinach.













Okay, so opening up
and in drops the little pellet.
Yes.
Wow.
That's delightful.
And it goes with the curtains.
They're adorable.
It's so cute.
And that's how we feed the show.
Green.
Yeah.
So the kraken won't surge up
from the depths
and consume the entire show.
Might do it anyway.
Which would be ugly.
We are reading literature
about chair mop dogs right now.
These two gentlemen
know more about dogs
than I do.
They're going to start
some play.
Probably all the other
sub-Deenies combined.
Yes, and who
does that?
Calm yourself, please.
Okay, let's
throw the
constant sphere.
They're worried over there
about free expression.
I'm worried more about
free explosions.
Really?
They're free explosions?
Yeah.
They're in the sack
over here.
Take a pick.
Do you want
media?
Do you want media?
Do you want media?
Small or large?
Large.
Pants.
Why?
These large-sized
comics.
Name for Bob?
Yeah, I named her for Bob.
Celebrate seven weeks, Michael G and Swet and we took the holiday with all our friends
It was a time to relax and let your worries behind
Exactly seven weeks and something crossed my mind
It was the sign of the time we'd never forget
One morning our parents kicked us out of the bed
We told them it was stupid, don't play the fool
But the answer was shot, you gotta go to school
G's running up and down and everybody know
Rapping, rocking, popping in the street kids show
Michael G rocked the house and you don't know what I'm saying
Now when he's on a mic there will be no delaying
So you better run to see him in your neighborhood
He's rapping, rocking all the way to Hollywood
Hey check it out, these are the words we sing
Yo scream with us, we need a holiday
We're gonna ring-a-ring-a-dong for a holiday
Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say
We're gonna ring-a-ring-a-dong for a holiday
Put your arms in the air, let me hear you say
We're gonna ring-a-ring-a-dong for a holiday
Michael G and Swet were here to stay
We're gonna ring-a-ring-a-dong for a holiday
Hey check out the new song we just played
We are going on a
If you want to go you
Go into London and
Take a little piece of Amsterdam
We are going on a
If you want to go you
If you want to go you
Go into London and
Take a little piece of Amsterdam
I want a holiday
I've screamed a lot
Your only thing is cool
The only thing I've got
I swear it's very slow beat
I better know
Take another beat
Take another beat
What a party

Let me see where you're going
Ring a bell
What a party

Ring a bell
I'll say you're fine
Give you a call and scream some snow
Thank you.

The money you've wasted on your muscle tone

The Fog and the Dew and also Colgate Clean, both by the Rudy Schwartz Project.
That song, The Fog and the Dew, has been covered by ancient subgenius bands,
The Swinging Love Corpses, as well as Doctors for Bob.
Sorry about the censorship I had to apply for our broadcast listeners,
as opposed to our internet listeners and home subscribers.
But now, the news.
From PR News in Washington, I'm drooling a hole to get inside.
Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan is suspected in Monday's explosion
that killed 25 people during a hearing of the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission.
Greenspan said there was a lot of amnesia.
Greenspan said amnesia, that is, he suggested, that is emerging.
He said emerging currently.
Greenspan led to an explosion of bad homo sub-PR news.
Greenspan is kept back by flammable poisonous gas.
On Wall Street, 2210-947.
Automaker General Motors reports you're listening to
PR News.
Company officials say they've scratched their asses.
The space shuttle Discovery has erupted in violence.
The shuttle's crew pilot reports it lost more than $4 billion in the last half of last year.
The seven-person crew say they can turn a profit this year.
Shuttle Commander Alan Poindexter and his crew use devices to connect to PR News.
Today in Washington.
Hello, friends, and welcome.
The sermon tonight...
is entitled...
What...
If.
It is called that for good reason.
Because, you see, everywhere I go across this great nation...
everywhere I tour, every performance I give...
some sincere but misguided Christian accosts me in the parking lot...
and barks a curse we've all heard a million times for the last 2,000 years.
Sinner!
They shriek...
with eyeballs bulging and bony finger pointing.
You may laugh now...
but come Judgment Day...
what if...
you're wrong?
If I had but a dime for every time that thinly veiled threat was hurled towards the subgenius...
I'd have more money than all the trial lawyers in California and New York combined.
laughter
Yet, as mean-spirited as this rhetorical question sounds, it is in fact a legitimate challenge.
What if, Bob forbid, we are wrong?
Such a premise is difficult for subgenies to contemplate because one of the cornerstones of good salesmanship is confidence in the product.
laughter
We will succeed because we know we will succeed.
It is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
To even question the outcome is not only defeatist and anti-Dobbsian...
it is subgenius sacrilege.
And yet, in the interest of open theological debate, we will consider just this once...
the question of what if we're wrong.
Now, theoretically speaking, not that it is statistically probable, but hypothetically imagine if you can...
a world come July 5th, 1998...
where there is no excess invasion.
laughter
Oh, it's painful, it's painful, dear friends, I understand.
But remember, this is only theoretical.
A planet that is not surrounded by an angry alien spacecraft.
A globe not littered, a globe not completely polluted with the corpses of conspiracy dupes.
laughter
Oh, dear friends.
laughter.
A sick society, still dominated by paints and normals.
An earth where corporations, governments and well-equipped armies still loyal to the system...
continue to uphold the status quo.
sigh
They fight to maintain their tight totalitarian grasp on the very throat of freedom.
Oh, it's a nightmarish vision indeed, one that makes my head spin.
But one we will contemplate nonetheless in the interest of free and open debate.
laughter
Yes, dear friends.
laughter.
The dark future of Dobbsian defeat and conspiracy conquest.
This desperate future where the last subgenius forces are holed up in the underground bunkers awaiting the final onslaught by conspiracy mercenaries...
is a vision we do not want to contemplate but will this one last time.
As the Kelvin bombs explode far above on the planetary surface,
Stey and his subgenius generals huddle beneath a flickering light bulb,
pouring over maps of subgenius tunnels, subway tunnels and underground sewers, examining any and all possible attack routes.
They will be determined, determined to fight to death and take the maximum number of normals with them.
Yeah!
laughter.
Why?
Because we hate you!
laughter.
They will be dedicated to honoring Bob through a dignified Dobbsian death.
It is even...
It is then that some weak of heart heretic will step forward,
probably some Bobby who always dreamed of being a real subgenius warrior for a long time.
But when the chips are down for Dobbs wants to cash out,
this weak-willed wannabe Bobby will show his first real courage when he steps forward and whines,
But Reverend Steyn, you promised we'd have something to show for our membership fee.
laughter.
The bunker will fall silent like a tomb.
The collected gas will cause the barometric pressure to plummet.
The bobbing above will pause in divine reverence.
Steyn will slowly turn to the trembling traitor,
glare into his frightened little face,
and with the thunder of Daniel Webster will proclaim the same answer I gave the Christian in the parking lot.
And that is this.
Even in hell, we'll have the one thing the conspiracy tried to deny from us all our living lives.
The one human right they'll never be able to take from us again,
no matter how much they lie about what we did or what they didn't do.
It's the one virtue Christians will never obtain,
no matter how much they beg, pray, or grovel to their God.
I'm talking about respect! Self-respect!
The only commodity that can't be bought, traded, negotiated, or stolen in any of the conspiracy marketplaces.
Praise Jack! Hallelujah!
applause.
It's a concept foreign to all pinks and normals who serve the system.
They may have stolen our freedom, our slack, and even our lives,
but by virtue of our very defiance to them and their ways,
we've earned a self-respect they can't even pretend to want.
And you want to know why?
Why?
Because their religion is based on submission,
while ours is based on independence!
applause.
Praise Bob!
applause.
Give me a praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
Praise Bob!
So that, dear friends, is our answer.
That's what we get even if we're wrong come Judgment Day.
The honor and dignity of self-respect earned through a lifelong fight for independence and freedom.
Only the devil could possibly resent a man for wanting to be free.
Any god that wouldn't want his followers to be free is no savior,
but a tyrant, an enslaver of souls, a devil in disguise.
applause.
And that leads me to my question to the Christian.
laughter.
It's terribly original, so brace yourself for it.
laughter.
What if, what if you're wrong come Judgment Day?
applause.
Please think carefully before you answer, dear friend,
because remember, your very soul dangles in the balance.
And that is the word of our praise Bob!
Amen!
applause.
Praise Father Joe Mama!
Oh yes, dear friends, praise Father Joe Mama.
A beautiful, beautiful sermon there from the Pittsburgh revival a couple of weeks ago.

That hardcore edit called Who is Behind the Mask is by The Large, under his other musical
name, Schranz Ferdinand.
Not normal for an hour of slack, but I like it.
I like hardcore techno.
Princess We Are Doe, to whom I am consort, does not like hardcore techno.
She says it sounds to her like a marching band.
Drives her crazy.
Of course, she's usually hearing it from downstairs, so it's just a muffled dub.
Eh, princesses, what you gonna do?
You are listening to The Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius.
For more information, you can check out subgenius.com, which goes on forever.
The music in the background here is by Perry Kingsley.
And now to close the show off.
I'm gonna run a prolonged inside joke that you might enjoy even if you're outside.
Reverend Susie the Floozy created a...mix in which she drops the names of all the subgeniuses
currently utilizing the secret internet forum Scrub Genius, which was started up by Reverend
Tater Gumphreys of Kern's Holler when alt-dot slack became so top-heavy with pink coots
that we needed a kook-proof forum where the real subgenie could gossip about the unreal
non-subgenie without being flooded or otherwise de-enslackin'.
Anyway, it's one of those tours de-forcing.
Susie, take it away.
I wanna tell y'all about Kern's Holler.
Kern's Holler's the nicest little whorehouse you ever...wait a minute, that's the wrong
intro.
It's the nicest little piece of land you'd ever wanna find up in the hill country in
Internetville.
Oh yeah.
There's this good-hearted guy named Dr. Tater Gumphreys.
He's kinda somewhere halfway between a brilliant lunatic and a crack-pop visionary and a feed-shoveling
guru.
And Kern's Holler's where he set up this kinda artist colony and game preserve for subgenius
freaks.
It's way out in the cyber sticks and it's high security.
So everyone can let their freak flags fly without no trolls or national guardsmen to
ruin our vibe.
Anyhow, I dropped in at the farmhouse the other day looking for Tater and I couldn't
find him nowhere.
Doc Holocaust and Xanatos, Satanicos Bombasticos and Dr. Dark were all busy chatting in the
kitchen over milk and cookies.
I don't know who that is.
They didn't know where he was.
I don't know, man.
In the entertainment room, Dr. Phineas Narka was hanging out with Nico and Nikki and Narka.



I don't know who they were.
I think they were watching The Good gleiche drip'd Love for Hilarious Meal...
I'll be darned if I don't know what they were saying when I sectioned the list out.
And of course, ongreat să chef Michael, shh that's my name, and the anyway it is Jennifer
Stank and Christoph Michael, maybehodef���選en each dank weeding isde
much.
and hell, they was both losing somehow to crazy Reverend Jim Jones.
I stepped over Reverend Andre Gravel and Reverend Dr. Crash
and made my way onto the lawn where Reverend Anna Dynamite's
Kernthaler Ladies Garden Club and Splatterfilm Appreciation Society meeting was underway.
As I panned around the assemblage looking for Tater,
I could see Tula, Ubiquitous, and Subgenius Spice and Reverend Popa's pockets were there,
but then it morphed into a Manchurian candidate, Cyclorama,
Dr. Mr. Sister, and White Ruffled Madam Spidey-Trag,
and then his face erupted into Hideous Rictus, and he was laughing, laughing, laughing.
What is it with the laughing today? I gotta get out of here and fight Tater.
I fell to the ground and crawled out between everyone's legs,
and when I was clear, I just broke into a run.
There was a shimmer of gossamer wings, and Popa's pantyhara fluttered past.
I didn't know she could fly, but I had a feeling she didn't realize it either,
so I didn't distract.
St. Reverend Alex strolled by, and I was about to ask him about Tater,
when all of a sudden a lightning bolt hit right between us,
and then there was his truly laughs and the sound of high fives.
It was Reverend Ramona backing on up, and Priestess Pisces,
holed up in a futuristic treehouse, shooting lightning bolts off their fingertips for a kiss.
My broken field ran out of range as it ebbed with me with taser shots.
Oh, girls.
Then I almost damn near stepped on Gleep,
the hen.
She was running past like a chicken with its hat off,
and then I almost stepped on Curtis, who'd lit after her,
and then come a whole pastel of ferrets with Paul Jamison
trying like hell to get him back in his pockets before they got to Gleepy.
Oh, that noise knocked me back into the big mushroom in the middle of the yard.
Chuck Key and Bob Corr and Dr. Topper come falling off the top of a laughing worsen stank.
I cussed and kicked a shroom, only here come Reverend Quaalude,
and I'm going to get you.







I'm down, too, and he almost pancaked me.
Oh, what?
Meanwhile, out on the giant fire ant mound,
Ankara and Embidger and Artemia Salina and Zapanes were discussing the finer points of kook baiting
over a wailing, screechy, alt-slack kook who they'd crucified on the anthill.
I went over and watched the hideous, greasy thing monkey dance for a while,
but I had to go.
I had a mission, and Reverend Diva Schematic was up on the towering plinth drawing.
I yelled up, tried to ask her if she'd seen Tater,
but...
Little Theodore was on the other plinth playing loud as a bastard,
and on the third plinth, Reverend Baylor Trucks was playing loud as a son of a bitch.
But then I got snarled on the cables lying around on the ground.
DJ Shaver and Two Beans and Maynard Brainerd were wiring up the plinths,
which it turned out were colossal speakers 20 feet high.
I backed off and ran like hell before they could plug those suckers in.
Oh, in the shed, Leonard the Committed and Rock Roswell and the sicker Vicar and Patter Nostril were shooting,
with the dead Dr. Legume's knuckle bones.
Though Dr. Legume wasn't dead yet, but that didn't stop him.
Witchfinder Colonel Christopher Lee had set up a portable cocktail bar to cash in on the action and was popping the tops off of some sub-Genesis homebrews with an evil grin,
only the Reverend Dr. Mabotami had the balls enough to coiff it then.
A jeep sped by, driven by five satages of Reverend Suds riding shotgun.
They were on patrol, making sure Kern's holler was secure,
with Agent Lloyd riding high,
I on back, leafily fingering the trigger of that huge swivel-mounted machine gun.
I know I felt safe.
Out in the woods nearby, Rasta Billy Bob and his primate were having a sweet romantic moment.
They sat on a throne made of stacks of ancient books,
and a huge snowy owl sat above them.
Flames reflected in his unblinking eye.
The fire came from a pile of burning books.
The flames sputtered a bit.
The owl grasped a copy of Pilgrim's Progress in its talons
and flew over the flames and dropped it on the pyre while the happy couple laughed.
In the barnyard, Reverend Bork Cowcatch and Reverend Johnboy were practicing their human pyramid thing
with the livestock for the Tri-County Fair up in Humber.
Oh, they's coming along real fine, but I think this boar's ought to be putting the bulls on the bottom.
I made damn sure I didn't distract them.
I strolled on into the barnyard.
And that's when I saw it.
Oh, the thing you cannot unsee.
It was that international sex bandit, James Spurter.
And he was fornicating with Tater's Prize Livestock Crossbreeding Experiment.
The hog to bust.
And the other ice-sweet toilet pepper was obligingly holding its head wherever the hell that was.
And Reverend Angry Larry and Bull Zombie was eagerly filming it all for the next installment of the day.
And I was like, oh, my God, this is a dead Dave show.
Oh, yeah.
And leaning against this tall wall and drinking another sub-gibbon.
It was Dr. Lepotomy again.
Just because he'd won his damn name to be mentioned twice, the egomaniac.
Anyhow, I never did find Tater.
But that was my own damn fault.
I stayed and did some hog to bust with the rest of them until the smell got to be too bad.
So at least tonight wasn't a total wash.
Good night.
Good night, Seekers.
And thanks for the music, Rastabilly Bob.
Still tastes like bacon sushi.
Thank you, Susie.
And now, the Psychoskeletons.
J HYLYAU!
