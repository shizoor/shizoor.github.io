1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
Usually radio announcements merely recommend a product, but this station provides its clients with a special service.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,820
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

3
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:17,100
In the radio studios of Bob, the technicians, the entertainers, the commentators, the administrative personnel

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,440
daily unite their efforts in the creation of programs to please and entertain a vast radio public.

5
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:31,120
The wide variety of broadcasts include group discussions, political speeches, and comedy.

6
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:36,860
On this program, frank opinions are expressed in response to their leaders' questioning.

7
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,100
For there is keen interest in a radio program that invites personal participation by the public.

8
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,440
This is independent radio in a democracy.

9
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,840
Okay, we're trying it. We're trying to call Dave.

10
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:53,420
Okay, we're trying it. We're trying to call Dave.

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,840
The show's starting.

12
00:00:55,780 --> 00:00:57,420
I think the show's starting.

13
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,460
It's so exciting when the show is starting.

14
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,340
Hello?

15
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:04,720
Uh huh, I thought so.

16
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:05,720
Hello?

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,700
You thought so as if you were capable of having such thoughts.

18
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,580
Oh, I'm capable of having all kinds of thoughts, Dave.

19
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,620
I've gotten in trouble just for thinking.

20
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,500
As you have too, Dave.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,420
Yeah, you're not supposed to think too much.

22
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:25,220
You can drain your propocities.

23
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,880
Your lower extremities can be drained by too much thought.

24
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:36,060
Well, as Bob said, act like a dumb person and they'll treat you as an equal.

25
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:42,140
I can't say what he originally said because of the new laws here in the Patriot camp.

26
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:44,480
I'm sorry, I'm laughing.

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,920
You have any kind of guilt for talking to me.

28
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:48,660
It's not funny, Wee.

29
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,960
I know. I'm sorry.

30
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,400
We could all be in re-entertainment.

31
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,540
I'm in the camp square now having cramps and everything.

32
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:59,020
And it's really what most people call it.

33
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,680
The great baboon or the orang, the orange orangutan.

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,400
Or the pink orangutan. He has many names, you know.

35
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,220
They changed them to entertainment camps, huh? That doesn't sound so bad.

36
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,020
Well, it's not so bad at first, but then they'll have you run around the barracks.

37
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,100
Like in a 1950s movie or something.

38
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:19,660
Black and white movie.

39
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,880
And then a spotlight will come in and you're like,

40
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,280
Wee, wee, wee, stuff like that.

41
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:26,620
It's a jailbreak.

42
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,240
Yeah, and they're making like open sticks.

43
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,820
They're going to snuck in wagons.

44
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,620
You know, stuff like that.

45
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:38,660
And then you see like a real astute belly button or a hand.

46
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:42,480
Sort of like, you know, an American lieutenant.

47
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,180
Look over his shoulder.

48
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,440
Over his shoulder shot of him looking back like,

49
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:48,900
Ha ha, take that, you Jerry.

50
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,780
Well, I guess we got the screenplay now.

51
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,740
Yeah, that was a pretty good installment.

52
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,720
Or the opening scenes anyway.

53
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,300
I mean, that's not really going to happen, is it?

54
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,260
All that bad stuff.

55
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,960
The re-entertainment camps and all that.

56
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:09,740
Well, I guess it's kind of up to you, so to speak.

57
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,340
It's like one of those things where, you know, it's an observer creative reality.

58
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:18,040
Like in the Rennie Descartes, you know,

59
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,700
Cogito ergo sum.

60
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,340
I think therefore I am. Screw you.

61
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:24,420
It's me versus the universe.

62
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:28,780
Oh, so in other words, if I just have the right attitude,

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,960
they can do anything they want to me and I should be happy with it, right?

64
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:34,980
Is that what you're saying?

65
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,100
I didn't say you should be happy with it.

66
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,820
You said that.

67
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:39,540
Oh, okay.

68
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,040
I guess I misunderstood where you were going with that.

69
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,140
Do you have any more of those pills that would make me happy here in the camp?

70
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,200
I'm scared.

71
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:50,900
If I had the pills left,

72
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,600
I would give them to you rather than shoving them all down my throat.

73
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:58,120
Well, believe me, Mr. Short's danger.

74
00:03:58,500 --> 00:03:59,560
You don't know.

75
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,880
Well, thanks for the offer of the pills, if you ever find your pills again.

76
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,460
Pills.

77
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,080
Oh, yeah, well.

78
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,420
Indeed, I do believe you.

79
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,200
What is the word?

80
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,900
I believe in pills.

81
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:13,980
I believe in pills.

82
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:18,860
It showed that you're nice, too, like Angela Merkel.

83
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,560
And, uh,

84
00:04:20,900 --> 00:04:22,640
Prince Leroy or whatever his name is.

85
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,080
The guy with the big eyebrows.

86
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,460
Now, say what?

87
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,620
I know about Merkel.

88
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,500
Oh, Nosferatu, they used to call him for short.

89
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,820
I'm pretty sure he was having the brain hemorrhages.

90
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:40,660
Are you talking about Dracula, Khrushchev, Hitler, or Angela Merkel?

91
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:45,080
Who, by the way, used to look really hot with her clothes off.

92
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:45,540
I, uh,

93
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:50,080
Susie the Fleece found a picture of a bunch of German nudists,

94
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,040
jogging and said,

95
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,840
which world leader is in this picture?

96
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,820
And I took a wild guess.

97
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,140
I said, is that Angela Merkel?

98
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,700
It was.

99
00:04:59,200 --> 00:04:59,840
Is that true?

100
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:00,560
Yeah, yeah.

101
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:09,060
Well, you know, what country that has a lot of nudism and naturalists in it

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,180
also has a woman world leader?

103
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,800
Was Angela Merkel wearing a merkin in the photo?

104
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,560
How would I know?

105
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,660
It wasn't in 3D.

106
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,140
It wasn't in VR.

107
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:26,040
It wasn't 360 VR, which, by the way, I had to swear off.

108
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,680
See, I wouldn't understand such a thing,

109
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:34,340
in which case you'd be seeing both Angela Merkel's butt and her front at the same time.

110
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,980
No, no, it was just her front.

111
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,460
And it was a whole bunch of other people.

112
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,460
I guess at one point she was a...

113
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:39,320
Nobody needed VR.

114
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,160
She was a naturist, you know, like any good German.

115
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:44,840
The good Germans.

116
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,160
We've got a lot of good Germans in this country again.

117
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,640
Hitler was a vegetarian.

118
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,360
That's the residents you used to always see in their homemade movies.

119
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,740
You know, the residents with the big eyeballs?

120
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:57,100
Yeah, so therefore...

121
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,420
What?

122
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,720
If Hitler was a vegetarian, therefore...

123
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,240
Fill in the blank, listener.

124
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,620
He loved his little dog Shotzi, too.

125
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:12,220
Or not Shotzi, that's a made-up term in the Yiddish name, but...

126
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:17,540
He had a little Schnauzer that he was so devoted to.

127
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:28,920
He had a little dog named

128
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,880
Well, we're not going to give Chekers up.

129
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:36,060
And I don't care what the Russians do, we're not going to give...

130
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,140
In fact, we'd rather capitulate.

131
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:43,800
Give all control over America, American Internet to the Russians,

132
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,460
just so checkers can sleep easily under the White House rug.

133
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,220
I know, it's chapping my groins as well.

134
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,840
Just everything you hear is so incongruous.

135
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,540
It doesn't make no sense to me.

136
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,120
Well, that's what the pills are for, Dave.

137
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,020
You're not supposed to question these things.

138
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,280
That's what the TV is for.

139
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,840
That's what the radio is for.

140
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,080
Just listen to other people's talking opinions.

141
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,720
You don't need your own testicularities.

142
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,240
You don't need balls.

143
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:25,620
All you need is a strong leader to listen to on the podcast or the radio or the, you know, the soapbox.

144
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,060
You see it would be kind of like a big brother to us.

145
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:33,720
We'd reach out to it, reaching out to us backwards and forwards.

146
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:38,340
You feel its innermost pains and feel its abnormality.

147
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,380
I love big brother.

148
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,660
He can't be wrong.

149
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,700
And if he is wrong...

150
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,620
If he's wrong, he's better than anybody else.

151
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,260
They're even wronger.

152
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,320
Mr. Smith, you ex-smoker.

153
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,740
How many Winstons am I holding up?

154
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,360
Or am I just a peckerwood, you know?

155
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:55,760
Stuff like that.

156
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:56,540
It's really cool.

157
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,480
It's not like Tennessee Williams or anything like that.

158
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:02,400
But you can certainly have swampy 1984.

159
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:05,620
Swampy 1984.

160
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,040
Well, it's more of a cowboy.

161
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,820
Out here, it's more of a cowboy 1984.

162
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:10,780
Yeah.

163
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,060
Yeah.

164
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,820
The big sheriff is watching you.

165
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,280
He's your buddy.

166
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:17,500
I'm sorry, bro character.

167
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,760
That big sheriff is watching me, man.

168
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,180
It tickled my enthusiasm a little bit.

169
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,480
Caused me a paltry bone.

170
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,680
Or whatever it is.

171
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:27,940
Well...

172
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,620
Oh, I forgot to say,

173
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:37,020
happy numerical advance in chronological measurement unit.

174
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:40,860
The chronological...

175
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,040
The chronological...

176
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,760
The chronological measurement units underwent a numerical advance

177
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,580
at changing from a six to a seven.

178
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:51,200
Meaning we're now in yet another future.

179
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,440
Therefore, he gives you a happy greeting for this new measure.

180
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:55,780
Right.

181
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,400
Well, some people think that that increment increases

182
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:05,720
causes magical changes to happen and ends some sort of previous pattern.

183
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,700
When in fact, I think what it really is, is a great excuse

184
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,840
to get real drunk.

185
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,200
Right.

186
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,960
On a cold, cold December night.

187
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:20,920
And then shoot off firecrackers, fireworks, and nuclear weapons.

188
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,600
And blow up that funny stuff you were reading about last night.

189
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,380
Oh, Tannerite.

190
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,440
Blow up Tannerite.

191
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:26,700
Yeah.

192
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:29,140
He's a vulture too, right?

193
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,740
Or was he the guy dressed up as a Portuguese gentleman?

194
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,300
No, actually, this is a practical and informational thing

195
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,800
that all jihadists will want to know about.

196
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,540
There's this...

197
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,420
I would disqualify what you just said before you get in trouble down there.

198
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,320
No, I'm serious.

199
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,160
There's this explosive that anyone can buy at a hardware store.

200
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,420
I could go around the corner to Higginbothams and buy this stuff.

201
00:09:52,600 --> 00:10:00,000
A few teaspoons full of it will blow a pumpkin up as if it was JFK's brain.

202
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:05,940
And an ice cooler full of it will blow up a really big barn.

203
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,760
I've been watching YouTubes of people doing this.

204
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,340
And I've been watching them.

205
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,100
Here's the trick.

206
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:17,500
It can only be set off, this explosive that you can buy at the hardware store,

207
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:21,020
it can only be set off by like a high-speed bullet.

208
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,800
Not a shotgun, not a handgun.

209
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,840
It has to be like a deer rifle.

210
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,420
And that's what it's for.

211
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,720
It's for putting a minute amount of it in targets

212
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,960
and then testing your aim with a scoped rifle, a deer rifle.

213
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,200
The reason I know this is my brother sells these things.

214
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,420
And my nephew...

215
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:43,380
These have been experimenting and playing with it.

216
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:46,960
Other people have blown their legs off with it

217
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,480
in order to make impressive YouTube videos.

218
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:51,520
Tannerite.

219
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,220
T-A-N-N-E-R-I-T-E.

220
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:58,320
You're not supposed to give a description or else the police will come and visit you.

221
00:10:58,440 --> 00:10:59,480
You're not supposed to...

222
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,520
Men in black will come to your house again.

223
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,780
It's not illegal.

224
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,760
Anybody can buy this stuff.

225
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,280
You don't need a license.

226
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,580
Yeah, but people have reached a level now where they don't even want...

227
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,360
You know, it's part of the first...

228
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,340
It's part of the first amendment for you to be able to remind people to do some research.

229
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,140
Oh, that's right.

230
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:16,900
Well, I am telling people...

231
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,760
You're not a member of the approved media.

232
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,060
You're just...

233
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,860
You know, you're a potential terrorist.

234
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,620
Yes, they don't want you to spell it out for them.

235
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:30,380
Well, anyway, that's spelled T-A-N-N-E-R-I-T-E.

236
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:33,820
And the people who live out in the country,

237
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:38,260
and especially people who repair rifles,

238
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:43,240
find a lot of funny uses for it besides target practice.

239
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,800
It reminds me of tannin leaves.

240
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,140
Tannin leaves.

241
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,760
That keeps the mummy alive.

242
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,040
Tannin leaves.

243
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,920
Tannin leaves.

244
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:58,620
Strangely enough, tannin is the main ingredient that was used in the time machine,

245
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,900
the original time machine of 1899.

246
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,680
Tannin leaves or tannin?

247
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:06,240
Tannin leaves keep the mummy alive.

248
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,060
Those are completely different things.

249
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:11,720
Although, if you happen to have any tannin leaves on you,

250
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,040
I would certainly choose.

251
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,900
Oh, I'm sorry. I missed that.

252
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:19,900
You wouldn't happen to have any tannin leaves on you, would you, Dave?

253
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:22,080
Well, that's what I was wondering.

254
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,020
Is your mummified, putrefied body starting to recalcitrate itself back into the earth,

255
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,740
mind you, kids?

256
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,480
Uh, yeah.

257
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,220
Yeah, I'm 63.

258
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,660
What are you talking about?

259
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:33,940
You're going to want some of those tannin leaves,

260
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,240
and you're going to be calling me and asking me if I got any cherry pie.

261
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:40,260
Do you have any cherry pie?

262
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,420
I've heard your cherry pie is the best.

263
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:42,840
Mm-hmm.

264
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,380
Mm-hmm.

265
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,360
Rumor has it.

266
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:47,780
I've heard your cream pie is amazing.

267
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:51,420
I need the tannin leaves on the bottom to wake up the mummy in you.

268
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:54,480
Mummy.

269
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:01,080
By the way, Universal is doing a reboot of their old mummy franchise,

270
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:04,200
and the gimmick this time is the mummy's a girl.

271
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,560
The mummy's a girl?

272
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:06,980
Yes.

273
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,320
Yes.

274
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:07,620
It's a mummy.

275
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,480
It's a girl mummy.

276
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:15,620
Imho Tep is now Imho Tepa, or Tepas, or something.

277
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,160
I don't know.

278
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,880
I don't even know who's starring in it.

279
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:22,360
All the great, edgiest things was before him.

280
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,720
Before the mummy?

281
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,060
Yeah.

282
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:28,560
Sartre was convinced that the mummy was an allegorical one,

283
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,820
so much like the crocodile,

284
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:36,320
and he inhabited the swamp and the backyards and the smaller memories of your mind.

285
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,600
People thought...

286
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:37,600


287
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,240
He maintained.

288
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:39,520
Yes.

289
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:39,880
Yes.

290
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:40,100
Yes.

291
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:48,760
I was just going to say that Sartre maintained that all existence is a bad bowel movement,

292
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:56,160
and that's why, therefore, we as surrealists and Popeye's thinkers and radio manufacturers

293
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,280
and all those people involved in the communication arts need to...

294
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,620
That all goes without saying.

295
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:06,640
Everything you said.

296
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:06,940
Yeah.

297
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:07,020
Yeah.

298
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:07,160
Yeah.

299
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:07,400
Yeah.

300
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:07,600
Yeah.

301
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:07,600


302
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:07,600


303
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:07,600


304
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:07,600


305
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:07,600


306
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:07,600


307
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:07,600


308
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:07,600


309
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:08,860
That's common household knowledge.

310
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,280
Indeed.

311
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,920
Dave got excited.

312
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,300
He sounds like our dog, Dammit, when we...

313
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,100
I thought it did.

314
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,040
Yeah.

315
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,460
Yeah.

316
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:31,980
We're slowly trying to train Dammit to lay down and sleep during long, boring car rides.

317
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,520
He's never done that before, and we're going to have to bring him back to Ohio alive,

318
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,080
much like King Kong, who...

319
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,160
Another thing that people thought was a myth, like the mummy.

320
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:42,420
Sure.

321
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,080
They thought, oh, well, that's just made up, because they made a movie of it, so it must

322
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,840
not be real.

323
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,160
Whatever.

324
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:48,180


325
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,160
That guy had my mother's grandmother's...

326
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,620
My mother's mother's name, named that Driscoll guy.

327
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,420
Oh, Jack Driscoll.

328
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:57,080
You're related to the famous Jack Driscoll?

329
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:00,160
No, not the poet Jack Driscoll.

330
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:00,660
No.

331
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,260
Kevin Neely, Mick...

332
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:03,560
No.

333
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,740
Jack Driscoll, the guy who saved...

334
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,500
No.

335
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:06,500


336
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
The guy who saved Ann Darrow from Kong, or actually...

337
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,220
No, yeah, the sailor, right.

338
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,660
The guy in King Kong.

339
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:15,580
Actually, the guy who cock-blocked King Kong, is what it amounts to.

340
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,080
Yes.

341
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,280
Yeah, it's a sad story.

342
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,560
I'm not kidding.

343
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:22,000
He made me cry like a little baby.

344
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,680
That was the last Mega Primatus Kong, too.

345
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,300
The very last one.

346
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,060
Mega Primatus?

347
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:29,440
Yeah, that's his first name.

348
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,940
The scientific name.

349
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,340
He made me cry, too, Dave.

350
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:34,800
Cry, cry, cry.

351
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:35,600
Mega means baby, and King Kong means baby.

352
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,180
Yeah.

353
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:36,440
Yeah.

354
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,440


355
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,440


356
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,440


357
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,440


358
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,440


359
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,440


360
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,440


361
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,440


362
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,440


363
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,440


364
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:36,440


365
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,520
And Primatus meaning primates.

366
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,160
Of course.

367
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,720
Well, you know, there might be some subgenies who might not know what that Mega meant, more

368
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,420
than like mega death or something like that.

369
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,280
Mega Primatus.

370
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,640
Yeah, that was a great band.

371
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:50,780
Death metal.

372
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:51,660
Kong metal.

373
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,400
It was one of those Kong metal bands.

374
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:54,060
They were big.

375
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:54,640
Yeah.

376
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,520
They were real big in the 40s.

377
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:56,680
Yeah.

378
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,040
Real big.

379
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,980
They stinked, too, like their feet.

380
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,500
That's why, as a Christian, I can't find their foul names.

381
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,500


382
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,500


383
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,500


384
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,500


385
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,500


386
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,500


387
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:06,500


388
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:11,160
S больше or menos, continuos.

389
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:12,280
Continuos.

390
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:17,220
Yeah, but the...

391
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,220


392
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,220


393
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:17,680
I don't do S înTONS sesi.

394
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:17,940
I don't do that, you know.

395
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,560
Let's say, stock matarás, you know.

396
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,920
One to the S people can come in.

397
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,160
Itikheidê' I don't know.

398
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:34,680
Interesting, isn't it, S in Tong?

399
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:35,240
I don't even know who Chester A kid?

400
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,120
and cook me in a baby.

401
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,440
Look for the wet spots, huh?

402
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,160
Yeah.

403
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:42,820
That's a sad fate for old Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

404
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,380
who's a pretty skinny guy.

405
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,100
Not much use for that.

406
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,460
I was allowed to study the great Hispanic writers

407
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:53,380
like Unamuno and Marcus and stuff like that

408
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,880
to test my knowledge.

409
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,920
And just like any other simpleton fruitcake,

410
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,360
I was disavowed.

411
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,880
Dave, you sure have been dropping the names

412
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:08,160
of a lot of foreigner writers and philosophers.

413
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,740
Is it Sharpie, the Chartreux guy?

414
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,080
Oh, yeah.

415
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,420
I forgot about...

416
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:16,420
Hey, I can...

417
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:16,720
Marcus?

418
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,740
You know, The Stranger by Camus?

419
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:22,020
By Camus?

420
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:22,520
Camus.

421
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:23,960
Camus.

422
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,440
I can say that first line of that book in French.

423
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,660
It's like,

424
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:30,060
Où est-ce que je suis, ma mère et moi?

425
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,800
Où est-ce que je suis, ma mère et moi?

426
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,380
Oh, yeah, I can say the first sentence

427
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,940
of Book of the Subgenius in Latin.

428
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,660
Morite temporum volumthicus.

429
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,960
Sure, I've used that one myself, too.

430
00:17:43,080 --> 00:17:45,560
Especially at arbitries and picnics

431
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,120
where you have to maintain order once in a while.

432
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:50,540
You just say it like a magician.

433
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:55,000
Well, it just means kill time or don't save it.

434
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,800
Kill time, don't save it.

435
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:58,400
I think.

436
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:02,040
But to the average person who doesn't know that,

437
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:03,860
they think they're being threatened,

438
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,600
with actually being killed by signage,

439
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,460
by stop signs and barbecue aprons.

440
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:13,580
I think a lot of people feel like they're being threatened

441
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,800
with death by knowledge,

442
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,120
and so they really don't want any of it.

443
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:20,240
It scares them.

444
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,680
It's a libtard professor,

445
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,380
commie Marxist professor kind of thing,

446
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,360
this knowledge stuff,

447
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,720
and they don't want to have anything do it.

448
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:30,880
And if...

449
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,580
I mean, if it's...

450
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,860
If a libtard lives,

451
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,200
if a regular libtard likes it,

452
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:34,980
then it must be bad.

453
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,620
And if just a regular tarred likes it,

454
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,280
then hey, he talks like me.

455
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,900
Although I hate to use that term tarred,

456
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:48,160
because that harkens back to the term retard,

457
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:51,840
a slur for the mentally...

458
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,520
the differently sained or the differently abled.

459
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,320
Right, the mental...

460
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,880
goes with mental diphtheria.

461
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,700
And most of my best friends are actually of that caliber.

462
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:03,860
Right.

463
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,620
Most of our best friends.

464
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:07,520
Yes, we have a little diphtheria.

465
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,200
Well, some of them.

466
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,060
Or a lot of mental increments.

467
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,120
I know some normal people.

468
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:12,680
I don't...

469
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:17,160
I don't hate normal people.

470
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,340
I really don't.

471
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,420
That's nice.

472
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,640
I don't envy them.

473
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:21,640
I don't pity them.

474
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,740
They're just there.

475
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,960
They're just a thing.

476
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:29,100
They may be ascendant most of the time,

477
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,780
ass up, as it were.

478
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:33,200
But you're just living

479
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:33,860
and letting go.

480
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,540
You're just trying to live with them.

481
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:35,200
Right.

482
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:35,980
Well, no.

483
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,800
I'm trying to rip them off every chance I get.

484
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:44,600
Lurk between the walls, spy on them, learn their weakness,

485
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:49,420
and eventually sow the seeds of their complete and utter destruction.

486
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:51,700
But you have to be...

487
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,500
a delicate.

488
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:58,440
It's a destruction of all normals.

489
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,860
It's a delicate thing.

490
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:03,920
You don't want to...

491
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:08,000
Yeah, you don't want to karmically pay too far ahead, so to speak.

492
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,820
You don't want them to think you're not kidding.

493
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,740
You want them to think you're kidding.

494
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,040
It has to be done today.

495
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,240
It's funny.

496
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,220
Everybody wants to kill all normals, right?

497
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,260
You know, everybody roots for the abnormal.

498
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,980
You just get an egg in your pocket and you gristle your teeth and you say,

499
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:23,060
this is for Captain G.I.

500
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:23,800
Jobo.

501
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,300
In the movies...

502
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:28,620
In the movies, they root for the abnormal.

503
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,200
In the real world,

504
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:30,840
they root for the abnormal.

505
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,360
In the real world, they just root.

506
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,120
That's all there is to it.

507
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,620
Just root.

508
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:38,000
Right, like the root of Vegas or a common turnip or something.

509
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:42,860
It's like dragging your knuckles on the ground and growling like a primatist in Vegas.

510
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:44,920
Rooting for false slack.

511
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:52,540
Or, in the case of the smart ones, they're rooting for gum bemelia or Texas snot.

512
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,960
Or plenty of titties.

513
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,360
Or a whorehound, like you.

514
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:58,720
Whorehound?

515
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,480
Watch your mouth.

516
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:00,660
Watch your mouth.

517
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,120
I'm plenty of titties.

518
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,420
Actually, Dave, I'm not doing a Firesign Theater type surrealist thing,

519
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,100
but I've got a...

520
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:13,800
Princess, we and I have been trying to learn about the flora and fauna of this area.

521
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:17,760
And since it's a great big old weird goat ranch,

522
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:19,360
it has...

523
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,800
All the plants have funny names that sound just like they were made up.

524
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,640
Texas snout bean is real.

525
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,260
Slick seed wild bean is real.

526
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,560
Yeah.

527
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:30,800
The Bailey Cup says...

528
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,320
The

529
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:36,880
Yeah, I think that's true even in Ohio and stuff like that, too.

530
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,480
Once you start, you know, you open that big fat book up and start looking those names past the Latin names,

531
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,700
there's some pretty silly names.

532
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:50,340
Walk through plumbing supplies part of a plumbing supply store.

533
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:57,700
You'll find the most amazing sexual innuendos just in the names of little nuts and bolts and pumps.

534
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,740
Very true.

535
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,380
And cummers and pumps.

536
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:00,960
And cummers.

537
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:03,160
It's all sexual in a hardware store.

538
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:05,400
Yeah, suckers and that kind of thing.

539
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,580
Everything's male and female.

540
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,860
So, they're on the scrotal...

541
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:15,140
In the scrotal atmosphere, or as they used to call it on planet Saturn, the scrotal realm.

542
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:21,660
Well, all hail the great god Balzac.

543
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,460
And the great philosopher Balzac.

544
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:26,120
He's a French guy.

545
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:30,020
But really, there's all these...

546
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:38,760
I don't know if these are scientific names, but did you know there's actually something called limp leaf slack seed?

547
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,920
Yes, we have drawn up a list.

548
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:41,860
No, but I'm glad you know it now.

549
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,580
For your entertainment.

550
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,420
Quail like to loaf.

551
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,860
It's loafing cover for quail.

552
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,720
Limp leaf slack seed.

553
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,520
Texas slack leaf.

554
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,180
Bladder pod.

555
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,260
I have heard of that, I think.

556
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:59,200
And hell, our president-elect...

557
00:22:59,200 --> 00:22:59,940
I think you told her you...

558
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:00,640
The white...

559
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:01,700
Prickly poppy.

560
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:03,380
The white what?

561
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,440
Yeah, there's a ground cover called the white prickly poppy.

562
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,440
Sounds like a president, doesn't it?

563
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,060
Why, that's silly.

564
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:20,740
To make fun of plants and flowers and onions like that is to be disarmed and unafraid.

565
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,120
I think that's wrong.

566
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:27,940
I think you should give some of these plants some important names like...

567
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:29,800
Chex presenta mozzarella.

568
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:30,680
Chex presenta mozzarella.

569
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,360
Or jockstrap of the angel.

570
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,820
Oh, that's a pretty important one.

571
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,620
Those are good.

572
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:40,620
We seriously thought, well, we should make up funny names for the show.

573
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,160
But you don't need to.

574
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,340
This one is...

575
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:48,580
The old man's beard has a Latin name of Clematis drumundi.

576
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,460
And that's its real name.

577
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,440
That's not made up.

578
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:56,320
And Philo actually has an old man's beard growing on his face.

579
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:56,840
Yes, he does.

580
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,360
The Clematis...

581
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,540
Whoa, I've got older...

582
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,840
The Clematis drumundi.

583
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:02,000
There's still cheese on my back.

584
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:03,500
Is this a real one?

585
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,660
Pink smartweed?

586
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:05,820
Yes, pink smartweed.

587
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:06,360
That's a...

588
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,940
I did not make that up.

589
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:09,340
That's a contradiction in terms.

590
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:09,680
That's...

591
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,680
Pink smartweed.

592
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:11,880
That's from...

593
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,200
Just like Dutchman's britches, that's from the book.

594
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:18,080
Hey, pink, you want to buy some weed that'll make you smart?

595
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,480
You want to buy some smart weed?

596
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:22,340
It comes in the form of these little round brown pellets.

597
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,260
We call them smartweed pills.

598
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,120
Take one.

599
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:25,660
How about a little piece?

600
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,360
You'll learn something.

601
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:27,540
A little piece of pork snout.

602
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:28,500
Man.

603
00:24:29,060 --> 00:24:29,520
Snout bean.

604
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:30,380
That tastes like poo.

605
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,460
Dutchman's Britches. That's the actual name of a Texas plant.

606
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:37,060
Dutchman's Britches.

607
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,080
I'm glad to use that, especially when I'm having a torpor.

608
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:47,840
Sometimes in the torpid state, as for instance, when the bridges fall down

609
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,000
and they collapse into the gorge some 70 feet below.

610
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,740
Who's left around to blame things on except for the Native Americans?

611
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,280
You know, that's at least what they used to do.

612
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,140
That's what I thought.

613
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:04,940
But you can blame it on the Native Americans.

614
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:10,140
You can blame it on the local little old herbalist ladies.

615
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:13,660
There's all kinds of witches you can burn.

616
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,740
Witches and verbalists.

617
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,420
That's what I'd like to burn.

618
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,960
Uh-oh, you're in trouble then, Dave.

619
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:22,660
Right, yeah, I just remember that.

620
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,860
I saw your hand trying to figure out how cold one of them witches' things was.

621
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,840
Dave was talking about things.

622
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,720
Things being torpid.

623
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:38,280
There are four kinds of lovegrass listed in this compendium that we got these from.

624
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:39,660
The plains lovegrass.

625
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:40,480
Cheers for torpor.

626
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:42,600
Red lovegrass.

627
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,180
Sand lovegrass.

628
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:46,280
And tumble.

629
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,600
Tumble lovegrass.

630
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,880
That sounds like the best one.

631
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,300
That makes me want to go pick some erect dayflowers.

632
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:56,280
It sounds like only a mega primatus would dare go near it.

633
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:00,640
Or even perhaps do calisthenics aboard deck number one.

634
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,080
Lovegrass.

635
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,680
Especially if the dreams were already fading into the background real quickly.

636
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,800
And, you know, people, their ears would just get really huge and hairy and stuff.

637
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,040
That's what it was like back in the middle institution.

638
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,640
Little good broke friend, you're going to have to get some erect dayflowers for Pappy

639
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:24,220
so he can get his lovegrass going with the white prickly poppy.

640
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,640
You little farcoberry.

641
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,260
Right on my forehead.

642
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:28,820
Farcoberry.

643
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,520
That's a real name of a real person.

644
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,820
That's a real name of a real plant.

645
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:34,200
Farcoberry.

646
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,200
Possum haw.

647
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:35,780
Farcoberry.

648
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,940
Farcoberry, yes.

649
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:42,640
You just mix up a farcoberry pie and have some possum haw and some Texas hog plum.

650
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,660
Now you've got you a green spangled top.

651
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,940
Right, and then you have some elbow bush there.

652
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:50,400
It's with elbow bush jam on the side.

653
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,820
Those are all real names.

654
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,380
Yes.

655
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,980
Tom Wolf said you can't come up with better stuff than it's reality.

656
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:58,900
You know what I mean?

657
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,780
And that was the end of the great America.

658
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,920
No, because there was no more fiction because reality was weirder than fiction.

659
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:11,420
And now these names, you don't even have to make fun of them by being humorous or bleary-eyed

660
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:15,020
or maybe if you have like a block gland or something like that.

661
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:18,740
Actually, one of the ones I mentioned was made up.

662
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:19,800
Pardon?

663
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,020
One of the ones I mentioned was made up.

664
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:28,280
And the listener who can tell which one was made up will get a free subgenius pamphlet number one.

665
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,420
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding.

666
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,520
That is a good idea.

667
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:31,300
Mm-hmm.

668
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:39,480
And if they already have a subgenius pamphlet number one, we'll send them a rock from Stang Ranch if they can answer that question.

669
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:40,440
Which one of the names?

670
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,280
Wait, I think we have a caller right now.

671
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,340
It sounds like a woman lady.

672
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,520
What did you want to tell the river?

673
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,580
Did you hear Stang?

674
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,980
Did you hear Stang?

675
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,160
Hey, listen.

676
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:51,600
Hey, wait.

677
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,400
The Boston Stangler.

678
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,440
Yes.

679
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:54,940
Yes.

680
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,580
Yes, you were supposed to pick up the cue there where I laid there.

681
00:27:58,720 --> 00:27:59,660
Well, I didn't actually.

682
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,100
Stang.

683
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,380
Stang laid the cue up.

684
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:06,080
And then I came along and I kind of slightly more developed the cue when I turned it over.

685
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,100
And I just like left it just laying there and I just didn't even stumble over it or anything?

686
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,500
I'm sorry.

687
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,760
No, you were playing the banjo and you had your thumbs in your eye.

688
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:18,680
I'm terribly, terribly sorry.

689
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,960
Didn't mean to do that, Dave.

690
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,980
Help me somebody.

691
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,420
Kill me somebody?

692
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:26,980
No, help me somebody.

693
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,000
Oh, you don't want to kill anybody.

694
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,060
You might want to, you know, bite them like a branch.

695
00:28:32,060 --> 00:28:34,100
He's got killing on the brain.

696
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,220
Yes.

697
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,140
It's like having Bob on the brain.

698
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:43,780
It's better to chew on them like an irate chihuahua, you know, just bite on their nose and you're not going to let go and stuff.

699
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:49,820
No, she said help somebody and everyone needs hearing aids except me.

700
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:51,760
Now I'm the one with super hearing.

701
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,280
All I have to do is turn the volume up on my hearing aids and I'm the new super villain.

702
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:57,680
The hearer.

703
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,420
Or what was the other one?

704
00:28:59,480 --> 00:28:59,800
The Eve.

705
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:00,420
Fropper.

706
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,300
Eve's Fropper.

707
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,580
Yes, I can hear anything.

708
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:03,320
Eve's Fropper.

709
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,220
I can hear and record anything.

710
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:08,700
Oh, I definitely want to buy one of those.

711
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,720
They sound so official and whatnot.

712
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,380
Do I get a little uniform I can wear with them?

713
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:14,980
You can't buy me.

714
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,740
Well, not with...

715
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,220
Well...

716
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,280
You don't have enough.

717
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,080
Somebody could...

718
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,780
You are for rental, aren't you?

719
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:23,860
At least part of the time.

720
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:24,580
Oh, hell yeah.

721
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:25,440
Absolutely.

722
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,220
You are a mouthpiece of the capitalist imperialists.

723
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:28,960
I know that fact.

724
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,080
I'll do anything for five bucks.

725
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:30,680
Five hundred dollars.

726
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,700
I actually...

727
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,100
I actually used to say that and sort of mean it.

728
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,840
But I needed five hundred bucks so badly then.

729
00:29:40,620 --> 00:29:41,060
I understand.

730
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,760
Thank God nobody took me up on it.

731
00:29:43,080 --> 00:29:45,100
I mean, privyet, Tovaris.

732
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,620
That's Russian music.

733
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:49,160
I understand.

734
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,740
Only, no, in Russian you say spasibo.

735
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:55,840
Spasibo.

736
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,440
Privyet.

737
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,480
Or dasvidaniya or something like that.

738
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,540
The spasibo effect.

739
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,620
We used to wear the weasel costume.

740
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,640
This is the time of year, man.

741
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:10,280
Everybody's having kolachki and bolachki and punchki and stuff like that.

742
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:17,240
And dipping things in weird tea samovars and getting into big fights with the rest of the people down the hall.

743
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,620
Especially since they don't all have the same holidays at one time.

744
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:25,040
I think Dave's reminiscing.

745
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,880
He's lost.

746
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:27,520
He's bullgathering.

747
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:29,600
He's lost in his memories.

748
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,280
Sipping on a samovar.

749
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:32,580
I've lost my memories.

750
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,200
I make them up as I go on.

751
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,940
Same as everyone else, like you, Stane.

752
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,920
Well, that's what they say.

753
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,060
Memory is about half made up.

754
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:48,740
And the sad thing is a lot of memories are memories of memories.

755
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:54,440
You don't really have the direct memory anymore, but you can remember remembering things a lot.

756
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:55,620
Right.

757
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,020
You remember looking at a picture of it.

758
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,720
You get your Rashomon.

759
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:01,120
You get your thing going there.

760
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:02,700
Oh, it is.

761
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:03,680
No, it's not.

762
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:05,060
It's Chinooka.

763
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,020
Chinooka?

764
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,680
Yeah, it's not.

765
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,680
It's not Rashomon.

766
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,940
It's Chinooka.

767
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:13,820
It's Chinooka.

768
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:14,420
Uh-huh.

769
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:14,860
Like Chinooka?

770
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,640
Or Zafrod.

771
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:18,540
Or let's see.

772
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:19,760
Kwanzaa.

773
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:22,140
That was another of them.

774
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,300
I can have any holiday I want.

775
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,620
If I pay for the pants.

776
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,760
And I'm wearing them.

777
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:34,620
Then it's my own business.

778
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:41,480
Dave, I wish that you had a Twitter account so that you could be president instead.

779
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,460
Me too.

780
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:47,140
Because if you were Twittering for all those tweets, they'd probably follow you.

781
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:49,540
Anywhere.

782
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:50,660
Right off the edge of a cliff.

783
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,420
I wouldn't blame them if I did either.

784
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,500
I think that would be very...

785
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,720
Yeah, vote for me and I will truly, truly...

786
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:05,040
Well, you know, whatever the rest is.

787
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:14,100
Yeah, do the most deplorable things you ever wanted somebody to do to get revenge on those smarty pants people that think they're so smart.

788
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,780
But they never work and never have worked and they don't know what it's even like.

789
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:21,980
Because they have disgust for the American worker.

790
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:26,120
No one with a brain has ever had a job.

791
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,420
Yeah.

792
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,060
Well, you know what I mean.

793
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,460
Something like that.

794
00:32:34,520 --> 00:32:36,860
There's a little bit more substance to it.

795
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:43,580
I don't want to get into the vast culture of the Napoleonic cold, you know, or fishmongering at any age.

796
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:46,740
But you just feel like popping out like this.

797
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:51,860
Like you're just, you know, forced to reiterate from your mom's womb.

798
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,800
Now, Dave, don't cover your phone up with your sock.

799
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,140
You know, like this thing, shiny and stuff and wet and everything.

800
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:58,800
Wouldn't that be kind of stupid?

801
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,900
Are you covering your phone with your sock?

802
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,660
Or is it because I turned the background music up?

803
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,880
No, I think he has some gumdrops in his mouth along with speaking.

804
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,280
No?

805
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,900
No, can you hear me or not?

806
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,980
That's what I was wondering.

807
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,900
I can hear you.

808
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,240
We can hear you.

809
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:23,680
It was just sounding like you were talking into your armpit instead of the phone for a minute there.

810
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,880
Did it still sound like a smelly sock?

811
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,920
A little bit.

812
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,160
It was a little muffly.

813
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:29,840
Yeah.

814
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:33,960
I could turn down this John Carpenter music in the background that you can't hear.

815
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:44,180
We've been playing, in the background, we've been playing John Carpenter's compositions of movie themes for his movies, his own movies.

816
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:50,200
He's one of the few filmmakers that also is the music composer a lot of the time.

817
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:55,840
Sometimes the music is better than the movie itself, although in most cases they're all good.

818
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,800
So you're saying that one...

819
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:08,800
One of the few moments when I was actually a sequential square, I'm going to sound mufflerated, and you won't even be able to hear it.

820
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,400
Oh, I won't be able to...

821
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:14,520
All we eat are cans of beans just to be ready to light the match.

822
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,320
Well, be careful with that tanner right there.

823
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:19,820
It creates some new morality.

824
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,800
Dave, I'm not one to judge whether you sound good or not.

825
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:29,480
I can understand you because of my...

826
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,340
Mega...

827
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:38,240
My implants, but I can't say whether what you're saying is good or sounds good.

828
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:41,800
I can understand it, though.

829
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,200
That's the curse of the eavesdropper.

830
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,240
He hears everything, but he...

831
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:49,500
And he understands the words.

832
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,700
Where are those eavesdroppers right now?

833
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,020
The eaves...

834
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:57,000
Well, no, actually, I'm waiting for it to come on.

835
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,500
Right about the end of the show.

836
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:00,200
That's when it comes.

837
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,400
Oh, wait, I forgot to take my eavesdropper.

838
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:03,820
I totally forgot.

839
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:10,300
I was going to take an eavesdropper before we started recording, and then I was going to, like, right towards the end, I'd start going...

840
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,540
But now I have to just fake it.

841
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:17,080
Yeah, you're right.

842
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:19,220
You totally forgot.

843
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:24,560
You know, you're going to show up on the set wearing a pair of underpants going, man, what a weird dream, you know?

844
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,400
Well, yeah, right.

845
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,940
I hate it when that happens.

846
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,380
Oh, I hate it.

847
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:33,440


848
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,060
Yeah.

849
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,440
It makes me feisty, as my old mammy used to say.

850
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:40,140
It made them all feisty.

851
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:44,320
I feel one time we strangled that woman and threw her head off the bridge.

852
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:45,240
Yeah.

853
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:53,320
One time he was walking around bare naked in Columbus, Ohio, and claimed he was arguing with the Pope about something.

854
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,180
I don't know if it was good.

855
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,700
Once again, whether it sounded good or it smelled bad or it was...

856
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,420
Good or bad.

857
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:08,600
But I know I heard him talking about hamburgers and excitement to the Pope, even though the Pope wasn't there.

858
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,240
You know, I don't know.

859
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,920
It's pretty good to be able to do that.

860
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:18,840
We will understand someday.

861
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:20,060
Someday.

862
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:21,000
On the playback.

863
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:26,340
After the rupsture, then comes the playback.

864
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:29,440
And when you play it back the second time, that's when you go, oh.

865
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:31,460
I think I know what he was talking about now.

866
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:36,600
I can examine what it is that Dave was saying now, and I can understand.

867
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,360
You slow it down and play it back.

868
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,320
And you can see where the bullet came from.

869
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:49,640
You play it backwards, and you play it over and over again until you want to shoot somebody or strangle them.

870
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:51,420
There it is right there.

871
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,060
There it is right there.

872
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,480
I want to smack my mammy ten times.

873
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,540
Can you hear it?

874
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:57,920
Back to the left.

875
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,460
Can you hear it?

876
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:58,820
Back to the left.

877
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,620
I want to smack.

878
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,960
My mammy ten times.

879
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:05,360
And then somehow you believe that, and that's your life.

880
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:08,560
Just like the old orange orangutan would say.

881
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:14,660
We all believe what we need to believe, as Pappy, the old Pappy said.

882
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:20,300
While sitting in the chair, Princess Wee is occupying right now.

883
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,300
And you know, it's so blasphemous.

884
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:29,240
We took his command center, his command module, and turned it into Tarzan's radio station.

885
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,600
And I think he would approve.

886
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,380
Yeah, but he wouldn't listen to the show.

887
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:35,880
No, he wouldn't listen to the show.

888
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,260
I don't think he ever heard a single hour of slack.

889
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:38,800
No.

890
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:46,020
I don't think he ever, you know, like, went into a store in the right frame of mind and started trying on brassieres.

891
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:48,980
And like, getting real upset and excited and stuff.

892
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:53,000
And you can hear him, her, behind the, you know, in the dressing room.

893
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,940
Actually, I have to.

894
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,100
This is never going to work.

895
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,180
Or, this is never going to, you know.

896
00:37:58,740 --> 00:37:59,540
I don't know.

897
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,400
There's different ways they had of doing it.

898
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,380
Well, it's funny.

899
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:11,720
My father, Pappy, hadn't, for his generation, had an unusual sympathy for what we now call transgender people.

900
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,800
Cross-dressers.

901
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,660
Oh, not just cross-dressers, but full, you know.

902
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:19,760
I thought you said Pappy was a cross-dresser.

903
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:20,780
No.

904
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:21,860
No.

905
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,260
No.

906
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:23,040
No.

907
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:23,500
No.

908
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:28,740
Well, actually, there are some funny pictures of some Lions Club skits.

909
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,300
Plays.

910
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,280
That he was in.

911
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:33,620
And which he did, in fact, address us.

912
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:33,920
In high heels.

913
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:34,920
Yes.

914
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,560
But didn't we all?

915
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,520
Didn't we all?

916
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:37,860
Yes.

917
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,980
Remember Dr. Drummond and Philodena?

918
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:42,500
At the Knights of Pythias, we used to wear girdles.

919
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,300
Because we were like knights at some time.

920
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:49,040
Throw away that truss, Dave.

921
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,300
You don't need that truss anymore.

922
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:53,320
I don't need it.

923
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:56,420
Jack Armstrong's course in bodybuilding.

924
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,720
Throw it in this shiny bin over here.

925
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:02,720
That's about to defecate all the materials and recycle everything.

926
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,780
Toss that truss under the bus.

927
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,960
There you go.

928
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,160
Don't that be a ton.

929
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,440
That's a pretty good slogan.

930
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,020
Yeah.

931
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,220
Yeah.

932
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:12,700
You ought to tell that one to our crown.

933
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:22,120
Toss that truss under the bus and jump on that shark and ride away into the sunset.

934
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,100
Blow them all off.

935
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,480
You're so synchronistic, man.

936
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,120
You're talking about truss buses?

937
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:28,700
Yes.

938
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:35,200
I just had to do a little bit of research on a truss bridge that fell apart near where

939
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,040
I live 140 years ago.

940
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,020
They're marking the anniversary of the 140th occasion of it.

941
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,320
Of the collapse of the truss bridge?

942
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:44,620
Yeah.

943
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,220
Princess, you're a bridge expert.

944
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,680
What do you know about truss bridges?

945
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,560
I don't know if they ever collapsed.

946
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,160
I don't trust them.

947
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,200
Don't trust them.

948
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:56,440
Well, that's pretty much the thing.

949
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,700
The engineer, once he realized that, he said, I don't trust them.

950
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:58,780
He said, well, you know, you're a bridge expert.

951
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:58,780


952
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:58,780


953
00:39:58,780 --> 00:40:04,460
But that's the iron truss, the whole iron truss bridge built by Cornelius at the behest

954
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:10,140
of Cornelius Vanderbilt was gonna eventually cost someone's life.

955
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:14,780
It did nothing about it because it was a robber baron corporate culture.

956
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:16,560
Cornelius badly built.

957
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,000
Yes.

958
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:21,720
That's the thing.

959
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:28,560
Well, we're gonna build a wall or a fence or some tunnels or a highway or something.

960
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,540
We're gonna build something.

961
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,240
Right, we're gonna have sports parties.

962
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,540
That's gonna be the best one, too.

963
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,480
You know.

964
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:34,120
You can believe me.

965
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,300
Just believe me.

966
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,160
Just believe me.

967
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,440
Believe me.

968
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,940
Because when I talk, I listen.

969
00:40:43,260 --> 00:40:46,720
And I know everything I say and I love it.

970
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,520
And my women are more beautiful.

971
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:53,480
Yeah.

972
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,580
I'm glad.

973
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,840
I'm so glad we all voted for him.

974
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:01,540
Yeah.

975
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,300
I did.

976
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:02,700
I did.

977
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:03,480
Of course I did.

978
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:05,780
I don't want to be lined up against the wall and shot.

979
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:06,900
I voted for him.

980
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,400
Sure.

981
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,120
Sure I did.

982
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,540
They don't have any record of what I really did.

983
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:12,080
I didn't talk about it on the show.

984
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:18,180
About how I desperately rushed to get my vote by mail in at the last half hour.

985
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:23,460
And was one of those three million people that got counted out.

986
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:23,460


987
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,520
After all the beep went down.

988
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,540
And down it went.

989
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:33,080
Down, down, down, down, down.

990
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:37,780
That's why you put the mud and the mud veins in your hair.

991
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,060
And the mud flaps.

992
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,080
Made you scrimp for the whole head.

993
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:46,160
And you know, just ate all those crawfish and gave it a brand new name.

994
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,960
Eh, eh.

995
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,480
Eh, eh.

996
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:51,640


997
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,160
My new name.

998
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:53,460
Eh, eh.

999
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:53,460


1000
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:53,460


1001
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:53,800
Eh, eh.

1002
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:54,920
Our poor Dave.

1003
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,620
Hey, we renamed our grandkids this Christmas.

1004
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,820
Their new names are age six and age seven.

1005
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,460
And that's going to be their names forever.

1006
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,640
Their mom agreed with me on that.

1007
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,840
In fact, that was her idea.

1008
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:11,680
The grandkids.

1009
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,120
Age six and age seven.

1010
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:19,600
Oh, Dave, I never got to say on the show that I made, the previous last show we did, I was

1011
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,840
bragging about how I was, even though I'm an old man.

1012
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:29,740
I was trying out VR headsets and trying out VR phone apps and having ever so much fun.

1013
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:39,060
Well, the punchline is when I got to this one game called Incel, it was just the wrong

1014
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:45,560
thing to set off my seasickness, carsickness, motion sickness.

1015
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:51,440
Yes, I got virtual reality motion sickness from a phone app.

1016
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,820
And it lasted three weeks.

1017
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:53,140
Three days.

1018
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:58,260
And when I finally felt better, I went out to try my hand for the first time at playing

1019
00:42:58,820 --> 00:42:59,280
Pokemon Go.

1020
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:04,360
And when I went to downtown Glen Rose and started catching Pokemon monsters with my

1021
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:07,340
virtual app, I got motion sickness again.

1022
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:09,100
He was hurt right back into it.

1023
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:11,920
Man, I didn't know it would last for three whole days.

1024
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,520
So you were right.

1025
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:19,700
Everything electronic is evil and is out to control your mind and make you nauseous with

1026
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:22,800
existential nausea at the fact that you've been waiting for three whole days.

1027
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:29,740
And you're wasting your time pursuing virtual made up tricks, ghosts invented by some software

1028
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:36,320
company, instead of out plowing the field and sowing wild oats that we may live for

1029
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:36,900
the future.

1030
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:37,580
Yes.

1031
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:38,520
Yes.

1032
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:46,040
But instead, I was just jacking around with a bunch of virtual reality in the matrix.

1033
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:48,100
And sure enough, it made me sick.

1034
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:49,840
It made me really sick to my stomach.

1035
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:50,060
Yeah.

1036
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:50,800
Yeah.

1037
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:51,560
Yeah.

1038
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:54,940
As soon as I get over it, I'll get back in that helmet.

1039
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:56,920
I'll get right back in the matrix.

1040
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,920
I'm going to have that lobster and that steak that doesn't really exist.

1041
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:02,740
It's going to taste just as good as the real thing.

1042
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:08,240
And as long as I don't do that one game, I'll be fine.

1043
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:12,620
You made my court an awful whole part of the yard where you're allowed to go and bounce

1044
00:44:12,620 --> 00:44:14,060
around by yourself and stuff.

1045
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:16,520
You put big behemoth bees on it.

1046
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:21,540
Or not bees, but substandard equipment all over the yard.

1047
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:26,160
And you have to push air in so that if you were to unwrap your hernia belt real quickly,

1048
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:30,580
you'd know exactly what direction you were going.

1049
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:37,060
Well, the funny thing is my son-in-law was showing me a video of this new product that's

1050
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:45,140
like a crib for you when you're doing your VR so that you can be standing up and literally

1051
00:44:45,140 --> 00:44:51,260
physically running on this, not exactly a treadmill, something like that.

1052
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,300
I've seen them, yeah.

1053
00:44:52,560 --> 00:45:01,000
The shoes have sensors in them to cause the virtual walking to work with your legs.

1054
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:04,400
And you've got this webbing around you so that you won't fall down.

1055
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:04,940
Yeah.

1056
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:11,040
So you can get really drunk and do your zombie killing game or whatever and be whipping physically,

1057
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:17,300
you know, jumping around and spinning back and forth and waving your arms around and

1058
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:18,660
hitting zombies and stuff.

1059
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:21,520
And all the while, you're really a guy in a bra.

1060
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:21,520


1061
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:21,520


1062
00:45:21,540 --> 00:45:21,980
Yeah.

1063
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,700
In blinders, chained to a crib.

1064
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:26,260
Yeah.

1065
00:45:26,260 --> 00:45:29,340
And just, it's real.

1066
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:30,260
It's become real.

1067
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,280
And what's the next step after that?

1068
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:37,200
If I had an extra room in the house and an extra ranch to sell, I'd be able to afford

1069
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:38,440
one of those game kits.

1070
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:44,440
But you know, to tell the truth, today was New Year's Day where we're recording.

1071
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:49,000
And I could have, I got up in the morning saying, I'm going to play video games all

1072
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,180
day.

1073
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:50,080
But you know what I did?

1074
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,500
I didn't play video games all day.

1075
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:58,860
Princess Wee and I went out in the back 40 and explored and dug up fossils and made some

1076
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:01,960
new trails and laid down some paving stones.

1077
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:06,300
And I feel like I cheated myself, man.

1078
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,640
I did real stuff when I could have been doing virtual stuff.

1079
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:15,200
I could have been doing the fun stuff that the kids do that makes them obesely fat so

1080
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:16,180
they can't even walk.

1081
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:16,640
Not on a day like today.

1082
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,180
Not on a day like today.

1083
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:18,820
Yeah.

1084
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:23,620
See, that's part of my, you know that book, that Neighbor World book?

1085
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:24,480
Yeah, Neighbor World.

1086
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,560
That's the greatest book.

1087
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:26,600
That's coming out pretty soon.

1088
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,340
That's the next step right after that.

1089
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:32,220
It's just like you're in a virtual reality where two plus two always equals 12.

1090
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:39,560
And you know, you can even imagine movements, but you're interacting on a Soly and Christophe

1091
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:42,740
universal insert.

1092
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:48,120
Whatever super genius wrote that soon to be published novel Neighbor World.

1093
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:49,940
He was ahead of his time.

1094
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:55,560
He was ahead, literally just ahead of his.

1095
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:57,260
Oh no, I'm thinking about Bob.

1096
00:46:57,420 --> 00:47:02,200
Bob was the head of his time, the disembodied head of his time.

1097
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:04,180
Yeah.

1098
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:10,200
Especially when he wrote on the bar language and gave you the napkins.

1099
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:10,980
Right.

1100
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,280
Remember when he said you were at the bar?

1101
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,160
Yeah.

1102
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:17,760
And it said, it said the world ends July 5th.

1103
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:18,100
Yeah.

1104
00:47:18,120 --> 00:47:18,600
July 5th.

1105
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:19,860
And you may die.

1106
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,900
Or did it say 8661?

1107
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:30,460
We don't even, we're not sure which angles he was meant to be writing at.

1108
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:31,680
Yeah.

1109
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:37,520
The tear marks on the tape make it almost seem like somebody rearranged it after the

1110
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:37,880
fact.

1111
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:44,200
And we don't know what day this is, what year this is, what chronological measurement

1112
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:47,920
unit has advanced or if it's really going backwards.

1113
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:55,580
Obviously evolution has been misnamed, at least concerning the last couple of hundred

1114
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,920
years since they invented factories.

1115
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:03,160
Of course, some say that it's been going downhill since they invented farming.

1116
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:04,720
Yeah.

1117
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:07,340
Because that was the invention of jobs.

1118
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:09,540
With farming came jobs.

1119
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:13,520
Neanderthals were not necessarily that good at jobs.

1120
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:17,140
Princess, we don't let, damn it, destroy Tarzan's radio station.

1121
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:23,460
Damn it just woke up and he's been, he's flapping around and shaking and going with

1122
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:29,860
his ears and he could easily destroy the whole studio just with his tail.

1123
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,520
That's how big he is.

1124
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:32,960
So don't let him get happy.

1125
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:33,540
Okay.

1126
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:34,940
Don't let him wag that thing.

1127
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,620
It could kill us all.

1128
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:38,480
He's a big dog.

1129
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,300
He is a powerful dog.

1130
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:42,140
He's a very, very powerful guy.

1131
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:45,260
If I can't whoop it, I'll go down.

1132
00:48:45,560 --> 00:48:46,160
I'm going down.

1133
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:46,560
I'm going down.

1134
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:46,600
I'm going down.

1135
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:46,600


1136
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:46,600


1137
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:46,600


1138
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:46,600


1139
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:49,680
Well, who's doing the potatoes at Grattan?

1140
00:48:51,220 --> 00:48:53,900
Those were cooked by Princess We Are Doe.

1141
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:54,320
Yes.

1142
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:55,520
Queen of all the UFOs.

1143
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,760
Well, not just trying to stuff something smelly into a big old fat sock and call it

1144
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:00,860
love.

1145
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:01,520
Call it love.

1146
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:05,620
Stuff it into a fat sock and call it love, baby.

1147
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,900
No, we wouldn't trick you like that.

1148
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,800
We're for real.

1149
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,280
We're the down home for real people.

1150
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,360
I've been in prison for 49 years right now.

1151
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:14,020
I'm not going to lie.

1152
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,040
I'm not going to lie.

1153
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:15,940
I'm not going to lie.

1154
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:18,240
I'm going to lie.

1155
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:18,240


1156
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,140
Why did he just flush the toilet?

1157
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,820
That was a great toilet flush sound effect.

1158
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:27,680
I'm glad he liked it.

1159
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:32,240
That makes me want to go out and pick erect Dave Flowers.

1160
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,820
Dave Flowers.

1161
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,040
Erect Dave Flowers.

1162
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,840
That sounds like Dave Flowers.

1163
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:43,100
Dave Flowers.

1164
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:43,820
Say it fast.

1165
00:49:43,940 --> 00:49:44,820
Dave Flowers.

1166
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:47,320
It's like a holly weed.

1167
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:47,480
It may be.

1168
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:55,040
For instance, if you were to see some fluorescent object that you could not define,

1169
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:01,380
or perhaps any description was disavowed by the Space Administration or the Air Force,

1170
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:04,500
you could tell them that it was a Dave flower.

1171
00:50:05,240 --> 00:50:10,860
And they pretty soon would have to pick up that nomenclature and put it in the book,

1172
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:12,120
even though they didn't want to.

1173
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:12,800
Right.

1174
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:14,400
Dave's flower.

1175
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:17,440
Erect Dave's flower.

1176
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:23,680
And they'd be sure to run all kinds of also known as, AKAs, AKAs, AKAs,

1177
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:26,020
because they'd want to get away from it.

1178
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,800
Like, oh, it's just a usage.

1179
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:29,460
It's not the...

1180
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:31,580
The...

1181
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,680
I can't.

1182
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:34,820
It's hard for me to do that.

1183
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:35,120
The...

1184
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:39,280
He jiggles his jaw, vibrates his jaw when he does that.

1185
00:50:39,380 --> 00:50:39,680
The...

1186
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,380
That's not really that.

1187
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:42,260
That's from...

1188
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,660
I'm wearing Cuban pants.

1189
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:45,080
They call it sometimes.

1190
00:50:45,940 --> 00:50:47,420
They must be really tight, man.

1191
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:51,360
Fresh roasted peanuts and a lot of stuff like that.

1192
00:50:51,740 --> 00:50:52,220
Tight.

1193
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:54,860
Dave's tight.

1194
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,180
Tight again.

1195
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,540
Have you ever heard that song, Peanuts the Peanut Man?

1196
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,280
Money, money, money, money, money.

1197
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:09,500
I wish Wee Ma Ma was here on the show, because she'd probably be able to sing along with it.

1198
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:10,140
She probably would.

1199
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:15,260
She knows every song going back to, well, the beginning of songs.

1200
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,240
Yes.

1201
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:21,980
Well, then just like a little snowball ball, you should take her around to tell you, you know,

1202
00:51:21,980 --> 00:51:25,900
if it's fair tomorrow or ask again later and stuff like that.

1203
00:51:26,840 --> 00:51:27,780
The Weather Mom.

1204
00:51:28,060 --> 00:51:28,880
The Weather Mom.

1205
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:29,500
Yeah.

1206
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:36,480
Yes, and the older and more obscure the song, the more likely it is that she would know it.

1207
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:40,280
Yeah, I get...

1208
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,080
It's kind of weird, Dave.

1209
00:51:42,100 --> 00:51:45,920
I get serenaded by these ladies often in the morning.

1210
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:56,240
I'll come downstairs stumbling, rolling, and tumbling downstairs, and they'll be down here just singing these bawdy barroom songs from the 20s.

1211
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:57,460
Well, what could be better than that?

1212
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,000
What a way to start the day.

1213
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:01,700
Yeah, yeah.

1214
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:03,240
It's actually pretty cool.

1215
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:05,620
Yeah.

1216
00:52:06,140 --> 00:52:12,940
I think I'd die and go to heaven, or it was like a pig in poo or whatever name.

1217
00:52:13,900 --> 00:52:14,520
I don't know.

1218
00:52:14,560 --> 00:52:15,140
I don't know.

1219
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:16,220
I'm...

1220
00:52:17,280 --> 00:52:18,620
I'm an angry bow spouse.

1221
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:20,880
I like bows.

1222
00:52:21,560 --> 00:52:22,460
You have bows.

1223
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:23,460
I like bows.

1224
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:25,420
Well, Dave...

1225
00:52:26,340 --> 00:52:29,980
I've been thinking about scrotums all night, and what a silly word that is.

1226
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:31,400
I noticed that.

1227
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:31,980
Yeah.

1228
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,740
What is the preoccupation with scrotal things?

1229
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,520
That's what I'd like to know.

1230
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,740
I never think of that word.

1231
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:43,980
I mean, I know it can be used as a humorous word or a very descriptive word, but...

1232
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,200
Well, people just say...

1233
00:52:45,200 --> 00:52:46,220
Scrotum, scrotum, scrotum.

1234
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:46,980
Scrotum, scrotum.

1235
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:53,140
Dave, scrotum is kind of the archaic term kids nowadays say scrum.

1236
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,840
They just shorten it to scrum.

1237
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:56,340
Yes.

1238
00:52:56,620 --> 00:52:59,200
Yeah, because it sounds more violent.

1239
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,740
And some people want to have your classic scrotum, as I think Anna Moll was saying,

1240
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:08,860
but, you know, usually they just market the modern-day scrum.

1241
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,900
What's wrong with the classic scrotum?

1242
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:14,300
The picture I'm trying to paint over here is...

1243
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:14,640
It had...

1244
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:15,140
It had...

1245
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:21,100
If you're over 125 seasons, it doesn't mean that you can't have a classic glow going.

1246
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,320
Well, that was the thing that...

1247
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,640
You don't need to be the one that says scrum instead of scrotum.

1248
00:53:25,820 --> 00:53:28,360
The classic scrotum had real hair.

1249
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,560
The scrum has, you know, this...

1250
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:35,960
Well, it's a hair-like substance.

1251
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:39,480
It's actually, you know, a polyethylene material.

1252
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:40,160
Yeah.

1253
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:44,340
It's like little implants that can be very, very risky.

1254
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:46,360
At certain times of the night.

1255
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,620
Not good for pregnant people to use.

1256
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:52,240
No.

1257
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,220
Men or women.

1258
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:53,860
Especially males.

1259
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,340
Either way.

1260
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:58,220
They suffer the worst, you know, worst consequences.

1261
00:53:58,820 --> 00:53:59,920
Well, Dave...

1262
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,480
She-males are also...

1263
00:54:01,480 --> 00:54:03,400
You get into some trouble, too.

1264
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,600
You have to ask my dad about that.

1265
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,520
Dave, it's...

1266
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:12,800
Believe it or not, we're coming down to the end of the hour, the top of the hour.

1267
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:13,260
I'm excited.

1268
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,560
The bottom of the hour.

1269
00:54:14,560 --> 00:54:15,060
I don't know what...

1270
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:17,320
I don't know what all that means, but I guess, you know, I'm excited.

1271
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:21,340
There's the exit wound of the hour of slack.

1272
00:54:25,600 --> 00:54:29,680
The exit hole, the excretion hole of the hour of slack.

1273
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,700
The hole...

1274
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:33,060
Well, it's about to snap shut again.

1275
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:34,300
The...

1276
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:35,320
It's been...

1277
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:42,880
The body of the hour of slack has been oozing us out for the last hour.

1278
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:44,080
Bits and clumps.

1279
00:54:44,140 --> 00:54:44,800
That's its...

1280
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,460
It's mirth point.

1281
00:54:45,680 --> 00:54:53,540
But it's about to snap shut as the tapered end drops down into the listener.

1282
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:54,680
Snap shut.

1283
00:54:54,740 --> 00:54:55,720
Is that like Snapchat?

1284
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:58,200
Not the way we do it.

1285
00:54:58,200 --> 00:54:58,700
Not snap?

1286
00:55:00,360 --> 00:55:00,880
Snap?

1287
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:04,200
See, now you sound like a Republican.

1288
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:07,340
I have to go and look for Grandpapa's shotgun.

1289
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:09,440
Oh, no, Dave, no.

1290
00:55:09,940 --> 00:55:10,940
I know nothing.

1291
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:12,240
I know nothing.

1292
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:12,420
I know nothing.

1293
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:18,560
Is any of you a neo-Nazi or a fornicationist?

1294
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:23,980
Do you believe in fornication as a form of fornication?

1295
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:29,940
Do you believe fornication?

1296
00:55:30,020 --> 00:55:31,680
I love you, big brother.

1297
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:37,600
How many fingers am I holding up, Smith?

1298
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,280
Hey, a lot of my friends were bemoaning.

1299
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:42,220
Be moaning.

1300
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:42,340
Be moaning.

1301
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:49,620
The awfulness of 2016 because so many old rock stars, writers, comic book artists, and

1302
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:50,380
so forth died.

1303
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:59,180
And as if it was any different from any other year, it's just that they're older now, my

1304
00:55:59,180 --> 00:55:59,640
friends.

1305
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:03,340
And so the people they like are starting to croak.

1306
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:06,940
They didn't care when Frank Sinatra croaked or John Wayne.

1307
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:11,120
Oh, but Carrie Fisher or...

1308
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,000
David Bowie.

1309
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:12,220
David Bowie.

1310
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:12,760
David Bowie.

1311
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,240
Oh, God, that's the end of the world.

1312
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:14,500
Prince.

1313
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:14,880
This is terrible.

1314
00:56:15,180 --> 00:56:15,520
Yeah.

1315
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,740
But you know what they're forgetting?

1316
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:19,400
You know what they're forgetting?

1317
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:22,500
And this is a sentimental thing I'm about to say.

1318
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:27,820
They're forgetting that there's a lot more people that were born this year with the potential

1319
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:31,240
of being even better than those great rock stars.

1320
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:38,920
Will we help those newborn babies to reach their fruition or will we sacrifice them on

1321
00:56:38,920 --> 00:56:40,000
the altar of Satan?

1322
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,180
Bob or...

1323
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:42,460
Donald.

1324
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:52,140
Nay, I think we should suckle and succor them until they become the next great inventors,

1325
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:59,400
explorers, scientists, writers, comic book artists, and hour of slack spouters.

1326
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,360
Yes.

1327
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:01,460
Bullshartars.

1328
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:04,100
Bullshartists, as one might say.

1329
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:05,180
That's a new one.

1330
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:06,060
Bullshartists.

1331
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:06,500
Bullshartists.

1332
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:06,780
Bullshartists.

1333
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,160
Psycho-culturalists.

1334
00:57:08,420 --> 00:57:09,420
I sharted.

1335
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,540
I'm a bullshartist.

1336
00:57:12,380 --> 00:57:15,780
No, I thought I said psycho-culturalists.

1337
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,280
That's if you've got a head wound, right?

1338
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:20,660
Yep.

1339
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,100
It's got a head wound.

1340
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:24,320
Back and to the left.

1341
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:25,500
We have to go, Dave.

1342
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:26,100
We have to.

1343
00:57:26,120 --> 00:57:26,420
We have to end it.

1344
00:57:26,420 --> 00:57:27,020
It's got a head wound.

1345
00:57:27,080 --> 00:57:28,060
I can dance to it.

1346
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:28,740
I give it a 10.

1347
00:57:30,660 --> 00:57:31,380
We've got to kill it.

1348
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,640
See, that's what David Bowie would have said if he would have died like Prince.

1349
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,380
Uh-huh.

1350
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,040
Uh-huh.

1351
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,500
Uh-huh.

1352
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:44,140
Uh-huh.

1353
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1354
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1355
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1356
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1357
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1358
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1359
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1360
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1361
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1362
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1363
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1364
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1365
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1366
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1367
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1368
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1369
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1370
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1371
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1372
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,140


1373
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:44,740
Yes.

1374
00:57:44,740 --> 00:57:45,040
Yes.

1375
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:45,220
Yes.

1376
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:45,300
Yes.

1377
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:52,060
It's time for the little listeners to lay their sleepy heads down and don't touch

1378
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:52,800
that dial.

1379
00:57:52,940 --> 00:58:03,160
Just go to sleep and believe everything you hear for the next eight hours, except for

1380
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:10,440
the morning news or anything your friends say on Twitter or Facebook or pretty much

1381
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:11,360
anything else you hear.

1382
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:12,220
Just don't believe it.

1383
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:12,780
Don't believe any of it.

1384
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,020
Don't believe any of it.

1385
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:20,540
Just look at the sun and the beautiful waving grass and the flowers and the, well, the dead

1386
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:21,520
trees, dead grass.

1387
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:22,440
It's wintertime.

1388
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:25,040
And go, nature is so wonderful.

1389
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:27,980
What little there is left of it.

1390
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:34,580
I think I'll preserve this last little square foot of white prickly poppy because it's the

1391
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,980
last nature left on earth.

1392
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,740
And Soylent Green is people.

1393
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,120
Yes.

1394
00:58:42,240 --> 00:58:43,280
It certainly is.

1395
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,480
I mean, yes, it certainly is.

1396
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:52,220
Well, I guess I'm going to get into conformable withdrawal right now.

1397
00:58:52,360 --> 00:58:53,840
You're going to run and get the runs.

1398
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,560
I already have the runs, but I'm going to escape.

1399
00:58:57,900 --> 00:59:04,660
I'm going to take my package, as I'm calling it frequently lately, my package and my little

1400
00:59:04,660 --> 00:59:11,120
blue squirrel sample and some of the other artifacts that I've been generating over the

1401
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:11,480
years.

1402
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:18,960
There's a special with the five, two bridges of many of the native Hungarian people.

1403
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:25,180
They used to spend the epiglottis right around here in the bigger grotto area.

1404
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,820
That was the fade out part.

1405
00:59:30,100 --> 00:59:30,700
I guess.

1406
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:32,660
Oh, wait.

1407
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:37,820
No, we have to say, if you need more information about this crazy show or anything at all,

1408
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,700
check subgenius.com.

1409
00:59:40,760 --> 00:59:41,400
That's one word.

1410
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,720
Subgenius.com.

1411
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,580
S-U-B-G-E-N-I-U-S.

1412
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:45,780
See, you got that.

1413
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:46,460
That was easy.

1414
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:47,980
Subgenius.com.

1415
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:49,640
And that'll explain everything.

1416
00:59:56,240 --> 01:00:01,220
Also, now that the broadcast part of the show is over, I might remind you that even though

1417
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:07,800
the Slack Friday month-long sale is over, you still need to get that Subgenius membership

1418
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:10,380
pack if you're ever going to be cool or go anywhere.

1419
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:11,220
Interesting.

1420
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:12,680
Or meet anyone.

1421
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,600
Or ever get laid.

1422
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,380
No matter how poorly.

1423
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:19,300
That's your ticket, man.

1424
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,080
Subgenius membership pack.

1425
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:22,560
You'll be an ordained minister.

1426
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:27,460
You get pamphlet number one, pamphlet number two, the excuse doctorate, the doctorate of

1427
01:00:27,460 --> 01:00:35,080
forbidden sciences, hundreds of words and little pictures and some great big pictures,

1428
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:40,780
a pen, two decals, and you can be an ordained minister.

1429
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:43,960
You're not committing weddings and funerals.

1430
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:48,220
After you get it, you'll hardly be able to imagine life before you have it.

1431
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:51,800
You'll hardly remember your previous life after you get your Subgenius membership.

1432
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:52,360
Yeah, you don't have to remember it all.

1433
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:53,540
Yeah.

1434
01:00:54,280 --> 01:00:58,280
You'll have bear implants, you'll be mostly in a three-foot bottomed area.

1435
01:00:58,800 --> 01:01:05,700
And people without credit cards or PayPal can eschew the winter net and avoid it and go

1436
01:01:05,700 --> 01:01:11,380
straight to the Summertime U.S. Mail and send us a check for about 30 cents.

1437
01:01:11,380 --> 01:01:16,720
838-75 to, hey, let's give the Texas P.O. Box for once.

1438
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:20,660
Now, this won't be good during the summertime, friends, but for until April,

1439
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:31,460
you can send that check to Post Office Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1440
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:36,440
That's shorter than all the older, longer ones.

1441
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:40,000
Yes, and then your order will get here even more quickly.

1442
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:42,860
Praise Bob.

1443
01:01:43,160 --> 01:01:45,020
Praise Bob, and hail Connie.

1444
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:47,360
Well, no, just praise Bob.

1445
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:47,620
No.

1446
01:01:47,620 --> 01:01:48,400
Fuck Connie.

1447
01:01:48,860 --> 01:01:49,400
Hail Connie.

1448
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:50,340
That's what she's there for.

1449
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:50,820
Hail Connie.

1450
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:52,640
Hail fucking Connie.

1451
01:01:53,080 --> 01:01:53,880
Fuck you.

1452
01:01:55,160 --> 01:01:56,180
Oh, dear, dear.

1453
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,220
See, that's the internet ending.

1454
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,940
The internet ending is different from the broadcast ending.

1455
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,060
Okay, I agree.

1456
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:09,700
I'll agree to what you just said.

1457
01:02:09,760 --> 01:02:10,300
I'll do it.

1458
01:02:10,380 --> 01:02:11,260
If you insist.

1459
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:12,020
Okay.

1460
01:02:12,620 --> 01:02:13,180
Let's go.

1461
01:02:13,400 --> 01:02:14,040
Let's go upstairs.

1462
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:14,640
Yeah.
