1
00:00:28,580 --> 00:00:29,980
Oh

2
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:35,040
Oh

3
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,420
Oh

4
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:07,900
Oh

5
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:08,420
Oh

6
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:11,940
Oh

7
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:12,220
Oh

8
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:12,400
Oh

9
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:12,400


10
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,060
Oh

11
00:01:13,060 --> 00:01:13,100
Oh

12
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,100


13
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,100


14
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:13,260
Oh

15
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,260


16
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,260


17
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:13,260


18
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:15,720
Oh

19
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:29,680
But let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the

20
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:29,980
subterranean

21
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,380
of genius.

23
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,300
Friend, the devil is tearing the family apart.

24
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:39,700
But what the devil uses to do it with is nine to five jobs.

25
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:45,900
Conspiracy, corporate, pink situations where mommy and daddy get up in the morning and

26
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:47,800
go to work and they kiss the kids goodbye.

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:51,880
It's the first time they see them during the day, kiss them goodbye, kind of a simultaneous

28
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,320
goodbye and hello.

29
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,700
Then they get home about seven o'clock, ticked off to use the polite term after a long drive

30
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,020
back out to the suburbs.

31
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,840
They get home, they kiss their kids hello and good night and they go to bed.

32
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:08,720
And the other churches dare to say the breakdown of the family is because the kids see a little

33
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,540
tittering, stupid, sexy gags on television or because of the new permissiveness where

34
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,300
men are allowed to do things with other men.

35
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,400
That's a bunch of holy hooey, I say, my friend.

36
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,500
I say, oh, why not legalize pornography and ban work?

37
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,800
Work is what takes the parents away from the kids.

38
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,720
Most of these kids these days grow up.

39
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,480
They don't have parents.

40
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,740
They got some kind of robot scarecrows.

41
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,340
No, friend, let there be slack.

42
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:40,540
This is the worst crazy sect I've ever been in.

43
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:50,460
You'll soon detect, friends, that this episode, number 1850, is a rerun of coincidentally

44
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:56,080
number 850 from 2002, a time when I was still ambitious.

45
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:03,160
I was desperate and robust enough to go gallivanting all over the country constantly like a crazed

46
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:07,400
cowboy preacher, doing live shows in bars and occasionally theaters.

47
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:16,060
That time is past, but that's okay because you can still learn how to spell the name

48
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:16,800
of Bob.

49
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:41,080
I needed to watch this episode for the Seb No, my friend Bob, the had made this type

50
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:41,740
that everybody said Bob watched too many times.

51
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:41,740


52
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:42,080
He suspended the film by not following his father, Josh.

53
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,540
So we just dropped it, Ken.

54
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,100
I actually got rid of that show, but I was ändging alone, so I survived.

55
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,100


56
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,100


57
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,100


58
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:46,660
Number 1950 back in back, back in the day, used BJ and cunt.

59
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:46,660


60
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,280
We got some quality

61
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,280


62
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,180
We got more flowers for them.

63
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:52,660
Nice one.

64
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,440
He was working on building a tree at home with us, didn't he like going to run the hood

65
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:55,260
scheme.

66
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:55,560
Bettler, before he used a Human Rest Rune.

67
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,540
It's been a while.

68
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:56,620
He was doing what I use as a fresh level.

69
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,100
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, B-O-B.

70
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,500
Pony, Pony, Pony.

71
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,060
B-O-B.

72
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,640
Big Bob.

73
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,180
B-O-B.

74
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,300
One, one dollar.

75
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,860
One dollar, one, one dollar.

76
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,120
B-O-B.

77
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:17,900
Big Bob.

78
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,720
Big Bob.

79
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,700
B-O.

80
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,360
B-O-B.

81
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,640
Big Bob.

82
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,040
B-O-B.

83
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,120
B-O-B.

84
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,860
B-O-B.

85
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:50,760
Big Bob.

86
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,680
Big Bob.

87
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,700
Beep, beep, beep.

88
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,120
Beep, beep, beep.

89
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:14,580
Beep, beep, beep.

90
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:28,060
Beep, beep, beep, beep.

91
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,700
Beep, beep, beep.

92
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,340
Beep, beep, beep.

93
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,240
Beep, beep, beep.

94
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,620
Beep, beep, beep.

95
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:43,820
Beep, beep, beep.

96
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,860
Beep, beep, beep.

97
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:48,580
Beep.

98
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:49,660
Beep, beep, beep.

99
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,140
Oh, nein.

100
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, nein.

101
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:44,900
Yes, friends, that was a total remix of B.O.B.,

102
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:51,020
the song by Dr. Onan's Wotan Band that everyone always thought was Devo.

103
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:55,560
And for not bad reason, as you'll soon see,

104
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:02,780
as we progress into this great spaz music month on Hour of Slack.

105
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:07,000
Yes, this and the next couple of shows will be mostly music, friends,

106
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:09,320
almost like real radio shows.

107
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:17,980
But wait until you hear what has been crammed full length into the church of the subgenius.

108
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,080
Indeed, friends, all the cramming made this particular show late.

109
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,660
And I don't apologize.

110
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:28,500
During the last few weeks, we, that is, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stank,

111
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:34,580
have spouted and spewed our way through the subgenius revival in Indianapolis

112
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,100
and then the week-long 5X Day Drill

113
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,520
and then the week-long pagan hippie event Starwood

114
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:47,720
and then the wedding at Ground Zero in New York City of the sex executioner from Noir

115
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,440
and his lovely bride, Andrea.

116
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,820
And then, then, friends,

117
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:58,700
devotional or Devo convention in Cleveland last Saturday

118
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:03,820
and last Sunday, another revival, by some accounts, the greatest yet,

119
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:08,520
in Akron, Ohio, crucible of mutation.

120
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:12,500
And at each of these subgenius events,

121
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:17,820
about a dozen people each handed me CDs to play on this show.

122
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:22,340
And I downloaded some of my all-time, old-timey music favorites

123
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:23,040
from Blob.

124
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:23,960
And I also downloaded some of my old-timey music favorites

125
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:23,960


126
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,720
All manner of songs and songs, friends, that I couldn't afford when they were LPs,

127
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,140
but now I can in their illegal MP3 bootleg form.

128
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:38,380
And so, tonight, and coming up, we have new and old,

129
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,020
from Occupant, Little Theodore, The Great Groovy Neptune,

130
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:47,740
Johnny Cash, Mark Mothersbaugh, Captain Beefheart, Onan's Wotan Band,

131
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:53,640
Sister Melodious Chops, Elvis Costello, the original cast of Guys and Dolls,

132
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:53,640


133
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:53,640


134
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,040
and this great new band that played at the Akron revival,

135
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:02,900
heard in the background, called the Amino Acids.

136
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,400
And perhaps most startling and X-rated of all, friends,

137
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:13,220
a new album, actually a two-disc set from Reagan's Pollock.

138
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:17,760
Yes, Reagan's Pollock's new album, er, er, set, Love Overdrive.

139
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:18,980
It's kind of a best-of.

140
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:23,620
And before I play this Reagan's Pollock song, I should mention that this is a new album,

141
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:23,620


142
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:28,700
and it's a real album, available on Amazon.com with slick packaging,

143
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,180
including liner notes by none other than me,

144
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:36,580
and the famous folk singer, Bob Dylan.

145
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,280
Very strange, friends, but so is Reagan's Pollock.

146
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,620
This song is called,

147
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,000
Develop Revolutionary Consciousness.

148
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,980
Oh!

149
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:14,340
Desire is evil and I hurt like a gas-soaked dirt

150
00:12:14,340 --> 00:12:18,280
In this swamp of my unborn be-gum

151
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,380
Ooh!

152
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:27,260
I am starved for the touch of this snake

153
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:33,720
I will die if I don't have a taste of the poison arrow

154
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:44,440
Surely with the force of my years of education

155
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,700
I can fend off the needs of the flesh

156
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:51,620
Ooh!

157
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:52,560
Ooh!

158
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,620
With the blood of a yak on my lips I scream,

159
00:12:58,840 --> 00:12:59,540
Ah!

160
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,600
Ah!

161
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:09,600
Ooh!

162
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:15,000
And I know that the face of my dear throne

163
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:19,160
Is a metal mask like the acid line

164
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,540
Ooh!

165
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:22,200
Face of Lana Turner

166
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,060
Bearing down like a horrible machine

167
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:31,180
Rushing my fragile skull

168
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,820
La-la-la-la-la-la

169
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:35,660
Ah!

170
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:39,140
Ah!

171
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:40,600
Ah!

172
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,360
Ah!

173
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:41,480
Ah!

174
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:41,560
Ah!

175
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:42,140
Ah!

176
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:42,180
Ah!

177
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:42,480
Ah!

178
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:45,780
Ah!

179
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:46,260
Ah!

180
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:46,600
Ah!

181
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,180
Ah!

182
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:47,900
Ah!

183
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,000
Ah....

184
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,740
Ah!

185
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,460
Ah!

186
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:51,020
Ah!

187
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,680
Ah!

188
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:53,780
Ah!

189
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:54,500
Ah!

190
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:54,500


191
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:54,500


192
00:13:55,020 --> 00:13:55,460
Ah!

193
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:55,580


194
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,280


195
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:56,800


196
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,380
Hi-yah!

197
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,460
Yah

198
00:13:59,460 --> 00:13:59,460


199
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,260
Y沈

200
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,280
Yeah!

201
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:15,460


202
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,120
Thank you.

203
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:50,540
Thank you.

204
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,280
Thank you.

205
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:57,840
Thank you.

206
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:20,260
Thank you.

207
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,640
Thank you.

208
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:17,420
Thank you.

209
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:45,900
Thank you.

210
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,000
Thank you.

211
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:45,740
Thank you.

212
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:17,960
Thank you.

213
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,500
Thank you.

214
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,360
Thank you.

215
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,420
Thank you.

216
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:19,880
Thank you.

217
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,100
Thank you.

218
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,400
Thank you.

219
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,240
Thank you.

220
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,080
Thank you.

221
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:27,540
Thank you.

222
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:28,980
Thank you.

223
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,260
Thank you.

224
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,360
You can't count on God for Jack.

225
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,220
He pretty much told me so himself.

226
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:40,380
They call you Lady Luck,

227
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,760
but there is room for doubts

228
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:45,440
and time to be brave.

229
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,900
Sometimes you have a very unladylike way of running out.

230
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:53,240
You're on a date with me.

231
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,480
The pickings have been lush.

232
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,000
And yet before this evening is over, you might give me the brush.

233
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,220
You might forget your manners.

234
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,560
You might refuse to stay.

235
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:13,280
And so the best that I can do is pray.

236
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,900
Luck, be a lady tonight.

237
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:21,140
Luck, be a lady tonight.

238
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:25,720
Luck, if you've ever been a lady to begin with.

239
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,720
Luck, be a lady tonight.

240
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,740
Luck, let a gentleman see.

241
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,060
How nice a dame you can be.

242
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,500
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with.

243
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,580
Luck, be a lady with me.

244
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,820
A lady doesn't leave her escort.

245
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:51,140
It isn't fair, it isn't nice.

246
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:57,620
A lady doesn't wander all over the room and blow on some other guy's dice.

247
00:21:58,120 --> 00:22:00,640
So let's keep the party polite.

248
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:04,160
Never get out of my sight.

249
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,500
Stick with me, baby, I'm the fella you came in with.

250
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,100
Luck, be a lady.

251
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,380
Luck, be a lady.

252
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:14,700
Luck, be a lady.

253
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:14,940
Luck, be a lady.

254
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,280
Luck, be a lady.

255
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:15,300
Luck, be a lady.

256
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:15,360
Luck, be a lady.

257
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,360


258
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,360


259
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,360


260
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:15,360


261
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,040
Luck, be a lady tonight.

262
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,940
Luck, be a lady tonight.

263
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,120
Luck, be a lady tonight.

264
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:29,800
Luck, if you've ever been a lady to begin with.

265
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,780
Luck, be a lady tonight.

266
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,960
Luck, let a gentleman see.

267
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,440
Luck, let a gentleman see.

268
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,260
How nice a dame you can be.

269
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,720
How nice a dame you can be.

270
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:44,760
I know the way you've treated other guys you've been with.

271
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:47,740
You can be a male with pride, acted normal lies, or even an empty kid.

272
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,320
You've got a right to be a tsundere.

273
00:22:59,700 --> 00:22:59,700


274
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:03,800
You've got a right to a playboy then.

275
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:04,720
You've got to be a dame to eyelid in a game of parkour.

276
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,260
The way you act cut sheets.

277
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,900
You've got to try to fit your hide into yourself before someone dies.

278
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,980
And it's a line you take, go look at yourself, and see if something suits me.

279
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,280
Luck, be a lady.

280
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:12,880
Luck, be a lady.

281
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,660
Luck, be a lady.

282
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:14,660


283
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:14,660


284
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:14,660


285
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:14,660


286
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:14,660


287
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:14,660


288
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:14,660


289
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:14,660


290
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:14,740
win

291
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:14,740


292
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,240
Luck be a lady

293
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,000
Luck be a lady

294
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,600
Luck be a lady

295
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:21,580
Luck be a lady

296
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,180
What's the matter, roll the dice

297
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:27,360
Roll it up, roll it up, roll it up, roll it up

298
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:28,480
Right, ha!

299
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,480
Robert Alda and the Guys

300
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:38,800
from Guys and Dolls

301
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:43,000
the 1950 original Broadway cast

302
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:45,980
and yes, that was Bob singing

303
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:54,900
Starts with a B

304
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,040
I don't know what it is

305
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:57,320
I knew it when I came in here

306
00:23:58,300 --> 00:23:58,940
Ends with a B

307
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,600
No, don't tell me

308
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:01,820
10 seconds, Bob

309
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:02,900
Bob!

310
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:03,480
Bob!

311
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,040
Bob!

312
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,600
Bob!

313
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:09,660
Bob!

314
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:10,420
Bob!

315
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,260
Bob!

316
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,320
Bob!

317
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:12,680
Bob!

318
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:12,700
Bob!

319
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:12,980
Bob!

320
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:12,980


321
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:12,980


322
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:12,980


323
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:12,980


324
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:12,980


325
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:12,980


326
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,520
Bob!

327
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:16,740
Bob!

328
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,120
Bob!

329
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,580
Bob!

330
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,140


331
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,500
Bob!

332
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,400
Well, it's really great to have you on the show tonight, Bob

333
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:28,840
Bob!

334
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,420
Bob!

335
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,160
Bob!

336
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:36,720
Bob!

337
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,060
Bob!

338
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:39,920
Bob!

339
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:40,520
Bob!

340
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:40,520


341
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:43,500
Bob!

342
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,320
Bob!

343
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:48,040
Bob!

344
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,660
Bob!

345
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:49,660
Bob!

346
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,420
Bob!

347
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:50,420


348
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,660
Isn't that fantastic.

349
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,740
I have long since heard you sing

350
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:52,880
some of your own songs

351
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:53,560
I'm gonna get me a drink

352
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:57,480
Okay, here it is

353
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:11,760
Is that Ross?

354
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:12,740


355
00:25:12,740 --> 00:25:12,740


356
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:12,920


357
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:12,960


358
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:12,960


359
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:12,960


360
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:12,960


361
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:12,960


362
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:12,960


363
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:12,960


364
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:12,960


365
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:12,960


366
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:12,960


367
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:12,960


368
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,960
www.neptune.itgo.com

369
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,040
More from them coming up.

370
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,980
And now, Occupant, friends.

371
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:25,580
Occupant is really Onan Canobite, the great subgenius, and his friend Mitch.

372
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:29,140
And this song coming up is an old...

373
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:37,060
It's actually a song by Devo, which you won't recognize unless you're a real spaz like me.

374
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,160
Occupant.

375
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:49,820
Occupant.

376
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,140
Occupant.

377
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,440
Nothing had done in a fifty-five dodge.

378
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:47,820
Didn't mean to do it.

379
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:53,680
But a sidewalk run in the room, they summoned him, the one he had to lose it.

380
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,340
After you mow down, down in Cape Town, got the Occupant.

381
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,700
I can mow down the Robotech sound, you've got to move your feet

382
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:23,780
It's a retro sound, you can spread around the way the Spartan boys used to do it

383
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:29,700
Now it's time to show that we're all before an occupant's here to prove it

384
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,580
I can mow down, down in Youngstown, bodies in the street

385
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:53,800
I can mow down, noon in downtown, bodies with no feet

386
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,520
I can mow down, down in Youngstown, bodies got the blues

387
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:05,700
I can mow down, noon in downtown, bodies with no shoes

388
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:11,560
An acid head blue and a fifty five dodge didn't mean the doing

389
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,940
Bodies in the street

390
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:12,940


391
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,640
Sidewalk boy in the noonday, something the one he had to lose it

392
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:32,240
I can mow down

393
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:38,360
I can mow down

394
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:50,020
I can mow down

395
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:50,680
I can mow down

396
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,260
I can mow down

397
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,940
I can mow down

398
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:28,740
I can mow down

399
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:40,780
I can mow down

400
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:42,940
Lord, I can mow down

401
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,760
The manager of the largest establishment

402
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,380
He pats them to the back

403
00:29:46,380 --> 00:29:48,520
And puts them to the right

404
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,760
But I never thought they'd put me in the

405
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:51,880
Good squad

406
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:55,500
They come to look you over

407
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,300
And they're giving you the high

408
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,960
Good squad

409
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,680
The white suits are called out to play

410
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:04,900
You better say goodbye

411
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,740
Some grow up just like the dads

412
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:18,160
And some from up to tomorrow

413
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,060
Some go drinking with the lads

414
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,780
Some don't grow up at all

415
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:25,180
You must find the proper place for everything you see

416
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:28,820
But you'll never get to make a lampshade out of me

417
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:32,360
I could join a chain of males

418
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,720
Or be the best of the league

419
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:35,860
But I'm looking for a lucky girl

420
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,260
To put me in the peak

421
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,620
They pats them to the back

422
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:40,780
And puts them to the right

423
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:43,560
But I never thought they'd put me in the

424
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,300
Good squad

425
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:47,840
They come to look you over

426
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,640
And they're giving you the high

427
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,360
Good squad

428
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:55,980
The white suits are called out to play

429
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:57,340
You better say goodbye

430
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,620
Baby, father

431
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,500
I'm doing so well

432
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,480
I'm making such progress now

433
00:31:12,940 --> 00:31:13,880
It's hard to tell

434
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:15,540
Been in a little dedication

435
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:17,360
With one eye on the clock

436
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,180
They got you under medication

437
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,440
You could be in for a shock

438
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,700
Thinking of the alibis

439
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,920
That everyone's forgotten

440
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,560
Just another purpose but gone to the right

441
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,040
They pats them to the back

442
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,220
And puts them to the right

443
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,480
But I never thought they'd put me in the

444
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,700
Good squad

445
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,200
They come to look you over

446
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:41,980
And they're giving you the high

447
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,460
Good squad

448
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,380
The white suits are called out to play

449
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,680
You better say goodbye

450
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,160
Music

451
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,340
Music

452
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,420
Music

453
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,460
Music

454
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:04,200
Music

455
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,200


456
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:04,200


457
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,540
Music

458
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:11,960
Music

459
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:11,960


460
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,420
You can't give up hope just because it's hopeless.

461
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,020
You gotta hope even more and cover your ears and go,

462
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,100
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

463
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,940
Give me that old Thai religion.

464
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,560
Give me that old Thai religion.

465
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,260
Don't give me no affliction.

466
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,700
That old Thai religion.

467
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,380
It's good enough for me.

468
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:48,880
It's good enough for you.

469
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:56,140
Well, come out to show them.

470
00:32:56,460 --> 00:32:58,920
Come out to show them.

471
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,560
Come out to show them.

472
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,200
Come out to show them.

473
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:06,940
Come out to show them.

474
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,560
Come out to show them.

475
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:12,100
Come out to show them

476
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,120
Give me that old time religion

477
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,840
Give me that old time religion

478
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,520
Give me that old time religion

479
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:22,160
It's good enough for me

480
00:33:22,160 --> 00:33:25,120
Without your new affliction

481
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,540
Don't need your new restriction

482
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,100
Give me that old time religion

483
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,940
It's good enough for me

484
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,240
Moonlight on for my heart

485
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:56,780
Nobody wants to play with me

486
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:00,420
Just because I'm never happy

487
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:04,940
All the other kids are going up and down slides

488
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:09,240
While I sit here and philosophize

489
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:14,060
I've got a world of my own

490
00:34:14,620 --> 00:34:17,900
I see things as they are

491
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:23,960
Nobody can tell me what to do

492
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,840
Not even you

493
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:34,680
Nobody wants to play with me

494
00:34:34,680 --> 00:34:38,500
Just because I am not friendly

495
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,680
All the other kids are going up and down slides

496
00:34:39,680 --> 00:34:42,780
All the other kids are playing funny games

497
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:46,860
While I sit by myself and examine my brain

498
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:51,720
I've got a world of my own

499
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:56,600
I see things that you don't

500
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:01,860
Nobody can tell me what is good

501
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:05,720
Though you wish you could

502
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,660
Nobody wants to play with me

503
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,500
Nobody wants to play with me

504
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:16,280
Just because I am not sexy

505
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:20,400
All the other kids are fooling around

506
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,740
But I'm several miles above the ground

507
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,580
I've got a world of my own

508
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:33,440
I see what is not there

509
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:39,560
Nobody can tell me how to feel

510
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,260
I know that's real

511
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:50,200
Nobody wants to play with me

512
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,640
Just because I have no family

513
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:58,400
All the other kids have wives and jobs

514
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:02,340
While I lay in the gutter and think and stop

515
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:07,500
I've got a world of my own

516
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:11,200
I see sadness and dirt

517
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,620
Nobody can tell me what is right

518
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,020
Try to fight

519
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,000
Nobody wants to play with me

520
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:32,000
Just because I'm old and ornery

521
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,340
All the other kids have grandchildren

522
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,180
They chatter and they squabble

523
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,920
But I ignore them

524
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,920
I've got a world of my own

525
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,620
I see all that I am

526
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:55,520
Nobody can tell me why I live

527
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:01,000
You have nothing to give me

528
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:14,580
But only your love

529
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:15,560
Now I have your life

530
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:15,560


531
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,440
Somehow there is a love

532
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:24,740
That I knew long ago

533
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,420
The reason I live

534
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:26,420


535
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:26,420


536
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,000
professionally

537
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,240
Yahoo.com.

538
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:33,800
I should spell Theodore.

539
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,220
It's spelled F as in Frank.

540
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:39,360
Y-O-D-O-R.

541
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,140
Little Theodore.

542
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,980
Here's another address.

543
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,960
3277 Raleigh Street.

544
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,580
R-A-L-E-I-G-H.

545
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,160
3277 Raleigh Street, Denver, Colorado.

546
00:37:58,980 --> 00:37:59,780
80212.

547
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,540
For Little Theodore at Yahoo.com.

548
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:10,100
And now, friends, well, you're hearing in the background the Amino Acids who played at our Akron Revival.

549
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:14,040
You can hear more of them at TheAminoAcids.com.

550
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:19,100
That's www.TheAminoAcids.com.

551
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:27,460
And now, friends, a song with, for some reason, deep personal meaning to me.

552
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,480
I'm not sure why.

553
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:29,620
The King.

554
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:30,920
El.

555
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:31,440
Fist.

556
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:32,620
El.

557
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:33,940
Fist.

558
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:33,940


559
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,480
Fist.

560
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:38,700
El.

561
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,260
Fist.

562
00:38:44,260 --> 00:38:44,260


563
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:46,200
Fist.

564
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,200


565
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,200


566
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,200


567
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,200


568
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,200


569
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,200


570
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,200


571
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,200


572
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,200


573
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,200


574
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,200


575
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:46,200


576
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,620
Oh, I used to be disgusted.

577
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,200
And now I try to be amused.

578
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,540
But since the winds have gotten rusted.

579
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:59,580
You know the angels wanna wear my red shoes.

580
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:01,020
But when they,

581
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:03,400
Told them at the side of the parking

582
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,500
That when I viewed it I could not refuse

583
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:09,620
And I won't get any older

584
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,380
Now the angels wanna wear my red shoes

585
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,340
Oh, I was watching while you're dancing away

586
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,980
I look at Frank shooting an echo and sway

587
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:25,480
I'm calling everybody who wants to be your friend

588
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,000
You know that it still hurts me just to say it

589
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:32,940
Oh, I know she's disgusted

590
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:34,260
Oh, why's that?

591
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,220
Cause she's feeling so abused

592
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,000
Oh, there's too bad

593
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,860
She gets tired of the lust

594
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,460
Oh, I'm so sad

595
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:44,180
But it's so hard to refuse

596
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,980
Can you say that I'm too old

597
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,300
When the angels have stolen my red shoes?

598
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,780
Oh, I said I'm so happy I could die

599
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:58,600
She said trapped in and left with another

600
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,120
guy

601
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:02,980
That's what you get if you go chasing out the vengeance

602
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:06,600
Ever since you got me punctured this has been my sentence

603
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,600
Oh, I used to be disgusted

604
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:12,280
When I tried to be amused

605
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,680
Since the wings have gotten rusted

606
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:19,680
You know the angels wanna wear my red shoes

607
00:40:19,680 --> 00:40:23,460
But when they told me at the side of the parking

608
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,560
That's when I knew that I could not refuse

609
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,580
And I won't get any older

610
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:32,460
Now the angels wanna wear my red shoes

611
00:40:33,940 --> 00:40:36,900
I won't get any older

612
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:39,780
Now the angels wanna wear my red shoes

613
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:43,980
Red shoes

614
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,660
The angels wanna wear my red shoes

615
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:47,540
Red shoes

616
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:50,220
The angels wanna wear my red shoes

617
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,200
Red shoes

618
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,820
The angels wanna wear my red shoes

619
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:54,800
Red shoes

620
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,280
The angels wanna wear my red shoes

621
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,300
Red shoes

622
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:58,580
Red shoes

623
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:58,580


624
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:58,580


625
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:58,580


626
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,320
I'm walking in a wonder wonder land

627
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,140
Asked for some water all I got was sand

628
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,940
There's a nine pound hammer beating in my skull

629
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,900
Laying down tracks on the road to hell

630
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:07,080
I'm walking in a wonder wonder land

631
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:10,960
I'm walking in a wonder wonder land

632
00:43:14,180 --> 00:43:15,340
There's a nine pound hammer beating in my skull

633
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:15,340


634
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:15,340


635
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:15,540
Laying down tracks on the road to hell

636
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,120
Here

637
00:43:16,120 --> 00:43:19,400
There we walk back

638
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:21,880
For the cat

639
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,260
Here

640
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:38,240
Here

641
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,960
He sat His und helpless head

642
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:42,980
Silently

643
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:42,980


644
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:42,980


645
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,260
But don't worry

646
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:45,780
A David hadn't shed

647
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:45,780


648
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,380
And I have

649
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:46,840
To trap

650
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:47,380
My wild

651
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,680
And needy

652
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:49,680


653
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:49,700
Mine

654
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:50,200
humanity

655
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:50,480
To be

656
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,220
Such an

657
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:51,900
immense

658
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:51,940
Thunder

659
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,400
They stare

660
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,620
Like a

661
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:56,160
ghost

662
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:56,280
To keep

663
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:56,860
Praise

664
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:56,860


665
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:56,860


666
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:56,860


667
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:56,860


668
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:56,860


669
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:56,860


670
00:43:56,860 --> 00:43:56,920
Dance

671
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:36,140
The mathematics of the equation just don't add up.

672
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,440
It's a paradoxical situation.

673
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:55,900
And while my cock is in elation, my soul is in purgatory.

674
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:11,100
And praying to the demon god at Radio Shack to give me peace and make the neighbor's dog stop telling me to murder the innocents.

675
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:13,420
In the twilight of the night.

676
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:13,420


677
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:16,140
In the cracks of the sidewalks in New York City.

678
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:22,680
The Great Groovy Neptune, dear friends.

679
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,400
www.neptune.itgo.com

680
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:33,220
A new CD from The Great Groovy Neptune called Turpentine Enema.

681
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:36,160
Proof that there's still hope in Texas.

682
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:43,420
And friends, stay tuned for yet another killer remix of a classic tune by Dr. Oneg.

683
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,060
Onan's Wotan Band.

684
00:45:46,520 --> 00:45:57,420
Followed by a new, traditional Celtic song about computer online affairs by Sister Melodious Chops.

685
00:45:57,420 --> 00:46:00,020
But now, Onan's Wotan Band.

686
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:27,960
Do you remember Dr. Melodious Chops?

687
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:33,920
The song about a famous screenwriter, 따가EEEEE

688
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:34,920
And the director .

689
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:35,080
And now on to the包括 Sheetbane

690
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:36,500
Onan's album is also the disco Grammy Award for Best Singer of the Year.

691
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:39,760
Craving for allons samen

692
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:40,240
It functions as a sex relationship

693
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:43,420
So will it be our also dis இரう

694
00:46:43,420 --> 00:46:56,380
Think about when you're using sex devices, think about when you're walking through the woods, when you make out with the girls, when you beat up tubular hoods, think about.

695
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,340
Big steps!

696
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:34,720
Here it comes.

697
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:38,460
He's coming, bud.

698
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:40,760
Go coming.

699
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,180
Go coming.

700
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,440
Take your slack away

701
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,600
He's Bob

702
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,540
When you see a flock of birds, think of Bob

703
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,680
When you just run out of words, think of Bob

704
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:09,620
When a ring falls round your car, when you hear a given holler

705
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,500
When you write checks for one dollar, think of Bob

706
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,460
When you ride to the subgenius, think of Bob

707
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:21,420
B or Fox, one four or three or six, think of Bob

708
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:25,560
When you cast your mojo hexes, when you ride to Dallas, Texas

709
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:28,520
When you're all die-lexing, think of Bob

710
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:48,020
One dollar, one dollar, one dollar, one dollar

711
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,840
You're a cunt

712
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:04,040
Slack

713
00:49:04,040 --> 00:49:05,180
Don O B

714
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:05,680
Don O B

715

Don O B

717

One, one, B O B

Heaven in the sky

725
00:49:22,820 --> 00:49:25,320
One dollar, one dollar

726
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,240
That's right, just send a shrew

727
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,300
One dollar, one dollar, one dollar

728
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:34,020
One dollar

729
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:36,500
One dollar, you get Bob

730
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:36,500


731
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,800
You get a lot more for your money

732
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,540
Heck, one dollar, you get Bob

733
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:47,860
Think of Bob

734
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:48,500
Think of Bob

735
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:49,940
Yeah, think of Bob

736
00:49:49,940 --> 00:49:52,300
Think about Bob

737
00:49:52,920 --> 00:49:54,020
Yeah, he makes us

738
00:49:54,020 --> 00:49:55,860
Think of Bob

739
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,900
Everybody's thinkin' about Bob

740
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,520
Everybody wants to think of Bob

741
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:01,460
Yeah

742
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:04,880
Oh, think about Bob.

743
00:50:05,740 --> 00:50:07,980
Think about Bob.

744
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:11,300
Yeah, we're thinking about Bob.

745
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:14,480
Yeah, Bob's think about Bob.

746
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:15,880
I'm Bob.

747
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:17,140
No, I'm Bob.

748
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,100
No, I'm Bob.

749
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,380
No, I'm Bob.

750
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:23,600
No, I'm Bob.

751
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,500
Listen here, Malachi.

752
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,820
Hi, Kai. Time for a religious donation.

753
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:34,440
Hand over your wallet!

754
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,260
But, Lord, we are a poor and simple folk.

755
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,320
Poor? Aw, crap.

756
00:50:49,560 --> 00:51:03,400
Well, some maids like to tend the fields, others will tend their children.

757
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:08,400
Some will buy a DSL to find a man who's willing.

758
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:13,220
There's something about the online world that makes me want to care.

759
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:19,260
And I will go with flights unfurled to meet my Charlie there.

760
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:33,300
Well, some will wear their sexy things and turn the lights down low.

761
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:38,240
Some will grab a brew or two and drink them as they go.

762
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:43,660
But, they are not the kind of girl to go for a motor party.

763
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:50,040
But you won't, or if you will, I'm going online for Charlie.

764
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:11,920
Well, some will fly to Cameroon to quench their loving flame.

765
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:16,920
Me, I'll sit inside my room and summon up your name.

766
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:20,020
So get your fingers ready, dear, I'm going to be your queen.

767
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,020


768
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,020

00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:20,020


771
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:21,880
And light a candle too.

772
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:28,040
And if I'm known, you may not hear, but I'm coming online for you.

773
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,040
He sends me streams of thrilling thought.

774
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,120
He opens up my gate.

775
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:53,820
He touches me where he should not.

776
00:52:54,060 --> 00:52:55,800
And I can hardly wait.

777
00:52:56,080 --> 00:52:58,880
Some like fear the strains of heart.

778
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:01,360
Others the beat of a party.

779
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:03,920
You're ready now.

780
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:08,040
But I don't care, just let me start.

781
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,600
Going online for Charlie.

782
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,780
Going online for Charlie.

783
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:21,920
Going online for Charlie.

784
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:26,940
Charlie.

785
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:44,000

I am bird dogging that Princess Wee.

Of a lot of things I've had.

And a lot more than I needed.

00:56:01,220 --> 00:56:04,160
I got sidetracked in El Paso.

Yes.

I tried to get a concept.

850
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:12,200
Right, right, right.

851
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:14,700
And big brain.

852
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:15,720
Heaven.

853
00:58:18,080 --> 00:58:19,600
That's fascinating.

854
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,440
No, no.

855
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:21,640
And.

856
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:23,940
And.

857
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:26,780
That's.

858
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:29,060
Jesus Christ.

859
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:29,480


860
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:30,840
The.

861
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:34,160
In the Jesus Christ.

862

00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:37,160
Or.

864
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,780

866
00:58:40,260 --> 00:58:40,820

And then.

869
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:42,620
And then it.

870
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:44,600
To.

871
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:45,860
Was.

872
00:58:45,940 --> 00:58:46,300
The.

873
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,100
In a.

874
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:49,480
In a.

875
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:50,540
The Satan himself.

876
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,740
In a huge house overlooking the ocean in the tropics.

877
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:55,160
Sure.

878
00:58:55,220 --> 00:58:55,420
Right.

879
00:58:57,500 --> 00:58:59,780
Well, that was fun.

880
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,660
Now for eons of loneliness.

881
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:04,920
And.

882
00:59:04,920 --> 00:59:05,280
And.

883
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:05,580
And.

884
00:59:05,580 --> 00:59:05,820
And.

885
00:59:05,820 --> 00:59:06,240
And.

886
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:06,240


887
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:06,240


888
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:06,240


889
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:06,240


890
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:06,240
