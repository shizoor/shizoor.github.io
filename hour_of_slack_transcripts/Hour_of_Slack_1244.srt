1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
We're busy, so we're in reruns, and this particular episode, number 509, from late 1995,

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:13,980
was assembled during a relatively dark time of my life, and it's a painful hour of slack, imagine that.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:18,280
The first half is by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang and My Favorite Bands,

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:26,900
and the last half is by Reverend Susie the Floozy and Papa Joe Mama, two experts in real pain.

5
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:29,600
What a problem?

6
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,700
Oh, joke, return it.

7
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:09,940
No, no, no, don't worry about it.

8
00:01:09,980 --> 00:01:11,940
We want to hear your phone calls.

9
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:14,620
We want you to call us and tell us what's been happening in your life.

10
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,360
That's not a problem.

11
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:22,800
Oh, well, we have time to listen to the tapes, I'm sure, sooner or later.

12
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,060
It's not a problem.

13
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,660
No, no, no problems here.

14
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,440
We're just doing just fucking fine.

15
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,760
Pardon my language.

16
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,360
Yeah, we've got just a few little technical setbacks here and there,

17
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,780
a few minor little things on the personal side, but maybe.

18
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,480
Oh, cut.

19
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,160
We'll be right back.

20
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,360
But you don't love me

21
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,700
I'm tired of waiting for my time to come

22
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:20,980
I'm tired of playing your games

23
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:26,760
I'm tired of watching my life slip away

24
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:34,820
Take me from this lonesome town

25
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,480
Oh, yeah

26
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,560
Oh, yeah

27
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,440
Oh, yeah

28
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,020
Oh, yeah

29
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:39,860
Oh, yeah

30
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,140
Oh, yeah

31
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,140


32
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,140


33
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,140


34
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,140


35
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:40,140


36
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,380
Oh, yeah

37
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:41,380


38
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,020
Too bad you don't want anymore, baby

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,960
Too bad your people are falling down

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,880
Oh, yeah

41
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,640
Oh, yeah

42
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:02,140
What's a river of tears come to life?

43
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:09,340
And what's a river of thought all became my life?

44
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,140
Oh, yeah

45
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,140


46
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,140


47
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,140


48
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,140


49
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,940
Just when every day

50
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,900
Seemed to greet me with a smile

51
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,340
Soon spots have faded

52
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:23,840
And I'm doing time

53
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,160
And I'm doing time

54
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,700
Ah, yes, friends, we're back with that wacky, funny, hilarious show

55
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:37,020
The Soap Genius Hour of Swatch

56
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,340
This is for everybody

57
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:50,300
Ah, slack, yes, slack for everyone

58
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:53,760
We're going to share our slack with you, friends

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,500
Because it was under the sea

60
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,820
At first for food and later for other purposes

61
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:05,580
That the old ones first created Earth life

62
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:09,640
These viscous masses were without doubt

63
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,120
What they were doing

64
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,480
What Abdul Alhazred whispered about as the Shoggoths

65
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,520
In his frightful Necronomicon

66
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,020
Although even that mad Arab had not hinted that any existed on Earth

67
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:26,360
Except in the dreams of those who had chewed a certain alkaloidal herb

68
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,120
Oh, wait, wait a minute

69
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,880
Oh, that's not, oh, that's not what I, that wasn't the slack we were going to share

70
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,500
We were going to share with you the kind of slack that we've been getting lately

71
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,240
Now, um, let's see, how did that go?

72
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:40,100
Uh, I don't know

73
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:46,780
Uh, um, hey, Stang, Stang, did you listen to my tape yet?

74
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,620
How come I haven't heard it on the show?

75
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:56,900
Hey, Stang, my man, like if you're getting too much email, just don't answer it

76
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,780
Duh, uh, but I have a question

77
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:05,420
Um, Stang, you didn't spell my name correctly on the website

78
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:09,820
And that picture of Reverend Susie the Floozy looks all grainy on my screen

79
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:15,760
Uh, hey, Stang, I know you're busy, but you wouldn't believe what my dog did today

80
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,940
Hey, hey, Stang, I just called to tell you, I won the lottery, man

81
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:22,420
Bob came through

82
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:26,000
I'm going to be buying that Bob t-shirt real soon now

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,500
I just wanted to let you know

84
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,560
So, uh, like, tell me how things are going, dude

85
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:37,000
Mr. Stang, your internet access will return

86
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,400
We are working on the problem

87
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:46,940
Expect your service to improve just as soon as our Dallas move is complete

88
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:57,020
Dear, you never spend any time with the family

89
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,540
Hey, Stang, dude, I haven't seen you in years

90
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:03,560
I'm in town and I'll be right over

91
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,800
Dad, uh, somebody backed into the car today while I was driving

92
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,080
Uh-oh

93
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,240
Uh, hey, uh, uh, Stang, you got a minute?

94
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,920
I know you're busy, but this won't take long

95
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,900
This'll, this'll, I promise, this'll only take you five minutes, max

96
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,000
Oh, Stang, have I got a deal for you

97
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,460
I have this game for a, this, this, this, this great game idea

98
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,300
And all you have to do is write the proposal

99
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,380
It'll be easy

100
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,180
You will all get rich, man

101
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,740
You want to get rich, don't you?

102
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:39,600
Uh, well, Stang, uh, uh, I guess you just don't, uh, even care about us, uh, little people anymore

103
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:46,460
Uh, I guess you're too, uh, busy partying with, uh, GWAR and, and fropping with movie stars

104
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:55,420
Mr. Stang, um, I'm afraid we have some bad news about your dog's nose

105
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,740
It, it is cancer

106
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:06,160
Uh, well, uh, Mr., ahem, Stang, we're not accepting applications at this time

107
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,580
And, well, we'd rather talk to people with college degrees than with your dog's nose

108
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:17,400
Uh, hey, Stang, about those pictures I said I'd scan for you

109
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,220
Um, I, I can't find them

110
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:25,920
Do you have any more spare copies of those you can send me?

111
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:30,380
Hey, hey, Stang, hey, this is Bob Dean, hey, hey, hey

112
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,460
The Canadian False Bob, hey, hey, hey, hey

113
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,180
Hey, guess what, hey, hey, I got interviewed again

114
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey, hey, hey, hey

115
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,860
Hey, Rath, remember me?

116
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,920
We met at that devival in Austin in 1983 and I bought that Bob button from you

117
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:51,340
But, man, I lost it, can you luck send me another one?

118
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:58,020
Dear Church of the Subgenius, I ordered a church video from you three weeks ago

119
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:01,240
And I have yet to see any such video in my mailbox

120
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:04,120
I am alerting the Better Business Bureau

121
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,580
I spend three hours a day listening to your videos

122
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:09,580


123
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,180
Listening to other people's problems, Stang

124
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:20,360
Reverend Stang, you must see this television special I taped about UFOs

125
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,620
It's somewhere down near the middle of the tape

126
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:24,080
Tell me what you think

127
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:31,620
Reverend Stang, I'm sure you're too high and mighty for people like me

128
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:36,520
But I sent you five 90-minute tapes of me ranting

129
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:39,580
And if you don't even have the courtesy to respond to them, I'm going to kill you

130
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,680
four days before an26 dies

131
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:49,780
Also, if you hangs up your time and the show end genteel

132
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,060
And hate the absurdembate that my performances may cause

133
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,180
I decided that lest I leave

134
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,180


135
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:50,320
There's a new movie which I'm going to boot

136
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,720
But, dear Fan Mouse, it's too early to depart

137
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,720
You can thank whatever you want

138
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,000
But, how did you find the key for me?

139
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,420
Doesn't make any sense

140
00:08:59,020 --> 00:08:59,800
Hooray, buddy gran

141
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,580
APPLAUSE

142
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:01,580


143
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,040
G World

144
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,860
Now I know how the Omega Man felt.

145
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:10,480
If you ever saw that movie.

146
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:15,640
But at least, you know, he got to go out killing them during the daytime.

147
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:45,880
I'm so sick, so sick of you.

148
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:53,240
I'm so sick, so sick of you.

149
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,660
Your face is gross, you eat by toast, you don't know what to do.

150
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,280
And just your luck you really suck and so I'm sick of you.

151
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,960
Sick, sick of you.

152
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:22,780
I'm so sick, so sick of you.

153
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,260
Sick, sick of you.

154
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:30,220
I'm so sick, so sick of you.

155
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,160
I'm so sick, so sick of you.

156
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:48,820
I'm so sick, so sick of you.

157
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,400
I'm so sick of you.

158
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,040
Sick, sick of you.

159
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,440
Sick, sick of you.

160
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:04,020
Sick of you.

161
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,020


162
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:04,020


163
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,560
I'm so sick, so sick of war.

164
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:17,260
Human cells.

165
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,020
Ah, just kidding, folks.

166
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,320
Present company excluded anyway.

167
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,360
Let's put it that way.

168
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:33,380
Who do you think you are?

169
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,520
Why do you always have to be so negative?

170
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,180
Boy, are you bad.

171
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,920
Why do you always have to be so negative?

172
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,400
Boy, are you bad.

173
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,300
Let me call you back next week.

174
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,860
Get a job, boy.

175
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,260
Get a job.

176
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,840
Get a job, you crazy son of a bitch.

177
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,440
You have already nailed your payment.

178
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,620
I can't make the rehearsal today.

179
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,900
My car ran over a pitchfork.

180
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,740
Mr. Zubin, I can't make the rehearsal today.

181
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,280
I'm already over a pitchfork.

182
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,000
I can't make the rehearsal today.

183
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,060
I can't make the rehearsal today.

184
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:04,080
$10,000,000.

185
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:07,060
What does your husband do for a living?

186
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:12,080
Who's got the pain when they do the mumble?

187
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:18,480
I don't know who do you...

188
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:22,360
Pain, pain, problems?

189
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:25,760
No, but we haven't really, I mean.

190
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:31,920
Yeah, we're a little bit late on the shows here, but it's not a problem.

191
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,140
We don't have any problems.

192
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,680
problems here. It's...

193
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,820
It is mere

194
00:13:36,820 --> 00:13:38,520
nothing such.

195
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:39,760
To quote

196
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,780
McGabrarland's garblins,

197
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,080
it's just that we're getting

198
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,020
a little

199
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,980
tired of waiting.

200
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:04,460
You're hot,

201
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:07,200
but the next day

202
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:07,860
you're cold.

203
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:09,200
You're green,

204
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,380
you never go for the gold.

205
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,000
You're young,

206
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,220
you turn around,

207
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:17,180
you'll be old.

208
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,560
You love,

209
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
but you don't look at my soul.

210
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,520
I'm tired of waiting

211
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:26,160
for my time to come.

212
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,400
I'm tired of playing your games.

213
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,340
I'm tired of watching

214
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,200
my life slip away.

215
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,200
No problem.

216
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,440
No, no, no, no, no.

217
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,320
As you all know,

218
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,320
you just can't believe

219
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,120
everything you see in here.

220
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:48,040
Can you?

221
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,100
We're not having any problems at all.

222
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,320
Everything's just fine.

223
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,300
I promise you, it's fine.

224
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,500
We're gonna get it all

225
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,760
straightened out.

226
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,420
It's just a slight little

227
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,980
morale thing, that's all.

228
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:07,980
Get your mind together.

229
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,200
Minds together.

230
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,040
Get your mind together.

231
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,880
Minds together.

232
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,420
Could you give us your

233
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,560
regarded opinion on this

234
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,040
nonsense about spaceships

235
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,300
and even space people?

236
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:27,740
Space people.

237
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,960
It's all in your mind.

238
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,820
It's all in your mind.

239
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,560
It's all in your mind.

240
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:50,820
It's all in your mind.

241
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,800
Oh, my mind is so messed up.

242
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,280
The heresy within the church

243
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,200
is that I've been listening

244
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,320
all night long

245
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,120
to all the things that I've been listening to.

246
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:03,120


247
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,360
All this fine talk about slack.

248
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,420
And I got to tell you,

249
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:10,200
there are some people here

250
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,920
that are working too gum hard

251
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,620
so y'all can have some slack.

252
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,200
Amen!

253
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,780
But those who know

254
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,060
Sister Melodious Chops

255
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,680
know that I'm not one to complain.

256
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:29,460
No, I write songs.

257
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:32,460
And this is all about

258
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,860
that hard work heresy.

259
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,820
Amazing face

260
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:48,520
that's known as Bob

261
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,660
You promise slack

262
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,460
to me

263
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,100
I told you

264
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,100


265
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,120
You should also share

266
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,880
And this is about

267
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,620
heresy

268
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:11,760
this whole quality

269
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,440
All my fan games

270
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,440


271
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,440


272
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:14,440


273
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,320
I have a chart

274
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,000
of history

275
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,000


276
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:16,000


277
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,060
Cast a great song

278
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,300
and a limited part

279
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:24,680
There's no date

280
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,660
And they'll have to up

281
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:29,660


282
00:17:29,660 --> 00:17:31,780
And they'll be

283
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:31,780


284
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:31,780


285
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:31,780


286
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:31,780


287
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:31,780


288
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:31,780


289
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:31,780


290
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,400
outside

291
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,100


292
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,100


293
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,200
Well, it's good to see you here tonight

294
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:44,320
But I got to say it's all not right

295
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,160
Behind the scenes of the things you see

296
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,840
Is a lot of hard work heresy

297
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,960
Now Bobby's great and Bobby is good

298
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,820
But he don't slack me like I should

299
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,740
He should be eating bonbons and lying in bed

300
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:01,600
And busting ass at the smart bar instead

301
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,180
Whoa, give me back

302
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:07,220
Where do I go to get my slack?

303
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,100
Say whoa, give me fun

304
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:13,020
Not another rant and rave to run

305
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,180
I went to a party that was wrong

306
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:28,980
Cause everybody want to hear Bob's song

307
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,220
They kept me playing till my fingers

308
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,620
Bled with nothing paid and no one fed

309
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,540
No, give it back

310
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,440
Where do I go to get my slack?

311
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:43,320
Say whoa, give me fun

312
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,280
Not another event to run

313
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:59,280
I worked all night at another rant

314
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,160
I wanted to sleep but they said

315
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,160
You can't

316
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,780
You got to pack up a room or two

317
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:07,660
And put up the tables before you're through

318
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:10,560
Whoa, give it back

319
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:13,460
Where do I go to get my slack?

320
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,360
Say whoa, give me fun

321
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,260
Not another big event to run

322
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,140
Whoa, give me fun

323
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,540
Just pass it on

324
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,560
Without an event from dusk till dawn

325
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:38,260
Why can't slack descend on me

326
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,940
Without this hard work heresy?

327
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:44,140
Whoa, give it back

328
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,080
Where do I go to get my slack?

329
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,960
Say whoa, give me fun

330
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,920
Not another big event to run

331
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:04,860
So all you people

332
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,200
It's not all just you

333
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,560
It's better than none

334
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:09,020
Cause we are through

335
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:11,940
Go out and find a world to save

336
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,120
We're going to enjoy the rants and raves

337
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:17,920
Say whoa, give it back

338
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,880
Where do I go to get my slack?

339
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,800
Say whoa, give me fun

340
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,700
Not another event to run

341
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,600
Say whoa, give it back

342
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,140
Where do I go to get my slack?

343
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,140


344
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,140


345
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:35,380
Say whoa, give me fun

346
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:38,360
Not another event to run

347
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,180
Not another big event to run

348
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,160
Not another rants and raves to run

349
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:44,900
Give it back!

350
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,540
I want it now!

351
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:57,600
Excuse me, but I must insert this 2010 note.

352
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,320
That song is especially ironic now,

353
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:01,140
15 years old,

354
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:01,460
15 years later,

355
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,480
since Melodius,

356
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,400
Princess Wee,

357
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,600
and myself are all

358
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,420
still running those events.

359
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,040
To hell with you!

360
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:10,300
To hell with you!

361
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:11,180
Okay, she's down to hell.

362
00:21:11,340 --> 00:21:13,240
She dared to question Bob Z-Dick.

363
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,880
Lucky for her,

364
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,740
it's the sub-genius hell.

365
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:21,480
Lucky for Sister Melodius Chops,

366
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:25,320
it's the sub-genius hell, my friends.

367
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,920
By the time you get

368
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,480
to the Christian heaven,

369

you've made a discovery.

00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:37,180
subgenius hell but the great thing about subgenius hell is oh man what a party you have to go through

373
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:45,000
it in order to be prepared to endure the even greater pure slack fun of subgenius heaven

374
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:53,440

383
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,060
their

384
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:53,420
their

385
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:53,420


386
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:53,420


387
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:53,420


388
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:53,420


389
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,780
very bull-dotted, don't you think?

390
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:01,220
Well, they get wacky and quirky, and then they get

391
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,020
kind of sad like this. But it's going to be okay, man.

392
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,880
It's not a problem.

393
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,240
Some of the Jimi Hendrix samples are from a group

394
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:16,140
called, pardon me, Beautiful People.

395
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:21,200
Very technically adept tape splicing and sampling there.

396
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:24,120
Well, now it's Sergio Leone.

397
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,180
Pretty soon they'll get to Nina Rota.

398
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,900
Before that, oh, of course,

399
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:36,760
Sick of You, that song by

400
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:41,020
Gwar, the gods from, the elder gods,

401
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,380
you might say, from beyond space.

402
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,080
And a little

403
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,560
media barrage there.

404
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,360
From Sister Susie the Floozy.

405
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:01,480
Oh, Susie. Susie did a show on her show

406
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,720
in Atlanta, on WREK, a pain show.

407
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,660
And it has come in very handy to us

408
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:12,060
here, because to tell the truth,

409
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:12,440
it's...

410
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,440
Blood pressure.

411
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,760
Not a problem.

412
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,340
It's all in your mind.

413
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:29,700
Oh, my mind is so messed up.

414
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,120
guitar solo

415
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:32,840
guitar solo

416
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,960
guitar solo

417
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:37,440
You work

418
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:37,440


419
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:37,440


420
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,100
guitar solo

421
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,460
guitar solo

422
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,960
guitar solo

423
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:49,460
guitar solo

424
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,140
guitar solo

425
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,140


426
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,140


427
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,140


428
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:51,140


429
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,560
You don't know what it means

430
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,760
to live

431
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,280
guitar solo

432
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,300
You don't follow your dreams

433
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:57,820
guitar solo

434
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:58,540
You feel

435
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,080
guitar solo

436
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,920
You don't fall to your knees

437
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,480
guitar solo

438
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,200
You love

439
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,080
guitar solo

440
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,560
But you don't love me

441
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,380
guitar solo

442
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,520
guitar solo

443
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:08,620
guitar solo

444
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:08,620


445
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:10,740
I try to wait for my time to call

446
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:11,240
guitar solo

447
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,360
guitar solo

448
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,140
guitar solo

449
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,580
guitar solo

450
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,940
I'm tired of playing your games.

451
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:20,600
I'm tired of watching my life slip away.

452
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,440
Slip away.

453
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,120
Oh, slip away.

454
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:40,840
Slip away.

455
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:11,100
Slip away.

456
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:23,360
Slip away.

457
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:33,960
Slip away.

458
00:26:43,580 --> 00:26:48,040
When I was training, I fell for hell.

459
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,380
Everyone ignored me.

460
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:53,780
They stood around in line.

461
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,200
When my head was in, to my aching isolation,

462
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:05,540
I gave up everything and see his face as mine.

463
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,240
Freedom, freedom, what a relief.

464
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,780
We've become a nation, a nation, a grand society.

465
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:18,280
We've become a nation, a nation, a grand society.

466
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:37,280
When my spaceship lands, I'll kiss my silver angels.

467
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:42,860
I'll gaze up at the sky and see his face as mine.

468
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:49,840
When I was training, I fell for hell.

469
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,260
Everyone ignored me.

470
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:55,560
They stood around in line.

471
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,960
When my ship rolled in, to my aching isolation,

472
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:07,120
I gave up everything and see his face as mine.

473
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,180
I'm tired.

474
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,480
Fried,house.

475
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:24,200
Found.

476
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:38,060
When I got mad, I had

477
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,420
leave a smile.

478
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,420


479
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,500
And when I say three things,

480
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:40,460
We're cross.

481
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:40,740
Because I'm a man.

482
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:40,740


483
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:40,740


484
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,740
ML I'll be mês tranquille.

485
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:43,560
choses que me faire, relationship.

486
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,980
guitar solo

487
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,120
guitar solo

488
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:30,960
guitar solo

489
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,800
guitar solo

490
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:32,120
guitar solo

491
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:35,960
guitar solo

492
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:37,880
guitar solo

493
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,880
guitar solo

494
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,500
guitar solo

495
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,820
guitar solo

496
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:50,980
Yes, yes, yes, dear friends, the great, the great Zug's Riff with his song, When My Ship Rolls In.

497
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,340
I'd give you Zug's address, except that it got to him.

498
00:29:55,340 --> 00:30:00,100
He quit the music business. He even quit the wrestling business.

499
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:05,240
Yes, because he got fed up.

500
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:09,000
He just got fed up with the struggle.

501
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:12,100
And here's an important credit, friends.

502
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:23,340
That song, Tired of Waiting, which I have interspersed throughout this whole show, is by Mary McGuire and her band, Cosmic Dolly.

503
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,300
And I'm going to give you their address.

504
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:29,140
Because you should send off their CD or write them for information.

505
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,160
Cosmic Dolly at P.O. Box.

506
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:33,080
Got that pencil ready?

507
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:40,500
P.O. Box, 1541 Royal Oak, Michigan.

508
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:42,780
That's M.I.

509
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:45,640
4-8-0-6-8.

510
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:52,400
I saw her perform at the Underground Film Festival in Chicago, and it was lots of fun.

511
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,840
And, you know, friends?

512
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,640
It is a struggle.

513
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:06,380
One must keep hacking and hacking and moving in constant motion straight ahead.

514
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,100
Until the tape runs out.

515
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:18,460
Because the tape will run out, dear friends, just as it did for Dr. Legume.

516
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:24,700
And we'll get to that pretty soon, I guess, on side two of show.

517
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:32,020
Although, first, I think there's some other things that we're going to stick on this pain theme.

518
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,660
I just love this.

519
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,340
Why, it's almost as good as the hate.

520
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,120
In fact, we may not even get to Dr. Legume.

521
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:42,940
This show, it may just all be pain and hate.

522
00:31:43,060 --> 00:31:44,900
And we might not even get to death.

523
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,980
Until the tape runs out.

524
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,480
Oh, yes.

525
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:53,980
Sweet.

526
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,900
Sweet Susie.

527
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:59,900
She'll beat you to death.

528
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,120
Sweet Susie.

529
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:08,060
From Russ Meyer, the director who gave you Vixen and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls.

530
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,900
For a taste of evil?

531
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,240
Sweet Susie.

532
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:13,400
A woman.

533
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,840
A woman too much for one man.

534
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,500
Sweet Susie.

535
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:20,320
The diary of a wicked lady.

536
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,080
The memoirs of a bad girl.

537
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:25,740
Sweet Susie.

538
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,900
No man escaped her island.

539
00:32:28,220 --> 00:32:29,640
Or her whip.

540
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:32,360
Sweet Susie.

541
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:37,000
Slamming, crashing, banging action from opening scene to mind-bending climax.

542
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,820
Sweet Susie.

543
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,380
She ain't no lady.

544
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,240
Oh, yeah.

545
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,700
Who knows what he's talking about.

546
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:49,960
Welcome, welcome, seekers of slam.

547
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,060
Welcome to WREK Atlanta.

548
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,680
Atlanta's Bob's Slap Time Funhouse.

549
00:32:56,020 --> 00:33:01,000
Oh, I'm the right-raving Reverend Susie the Floozy, your genial hostess.

550
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,700
But let me warn you, dear listeners.

551
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,840
Oh, the theme of my show tonight isn't a pleasant one.

552
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:15,100
Last night, I had a close encounter with Russ Meyer and a 20-foot-tall tourist satana.

553
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:20,060
And it got me thinking about the nature of something near and dear to my heart.

554
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,820
The only thing that cuts through my Teflon coating.

555
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,780
The only thing that makes me sit bolt upright and take notice.

556
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:27,740
Pain!

557
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:29,480
Oh.

558
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:35,380
I don't mean the sharp twinges you get when you slam your thumb in the car door or stub your toe.

559
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:40,860
I'm not bothering with that painy, anti-piddling, ooh, I hurt myself crap here.

560
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:42,140
Oh, no.

561
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:45,780
I'm talking about the brain-twisting agony of everyday existence.

562
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:53,040
From that first conscious breath you take in the morning when you realize, no, damn it, I didn't die in my sleep.

563
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,780
I'm going to sleep again!

564
00:33:55,060 --> 00:34:00,260
Oh, until you eventually pass out hours later from the excruciating pressure and torment.

565
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,420
They call this going to sleep.

566
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:10,180
With me, it's like an overloading agony circuit reaching critical mass and then massive system shutdown.

567
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,560
But maybe you're different.

568
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:18,080
Maybe you think that there's a minimum of pain in your life.

569
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:20,720
Well, think again, bucko.

570
00:34:20,720 --> 00:34:21,500
It's there.

571
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:26,020
And I'm going to have to put you in touch with it if you're going to achieve Bobhead.

572
00:34:26,220 --> 00:34:29,240
And take it from me, Bobhead is worth it.

573
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:32,520
So welcome to the house of pain-cakes.

574
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:35,340
And please feel free to scream.

575
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:38,280
It's music to my ears.

576
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:07,340
Welcome to my little world.

577
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:09,520
Welcome to my little world.

578
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,740
Completely self-contained, yeah.

579
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,540
Your problems, they will soon be gone.

580
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,560
We've so got.

581
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,700
So got.

582
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,240
So got lots of pain, yeah.

583
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:34,740
If life is a reflecting pool, then we are like a sponge, yeah.

584
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:39,840
Absorbing the good with the bad.

585
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:42,460
We've so got.

586
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,560
So got.

587
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:44,460
So got.

588
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,400
So give me all your trouble, folks.

589
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,540
Ooh.

590
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,860
And baggage you can't handle, no.

591
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,020
Yeah.

592
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,080
Yeah.

593
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,760
You gladly take it off the back.

594
00:35:56,200 --> 00:35:56,860
Yeah.

595
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,500
We've so got.

596
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,720
So got.

597
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:02,280
So got lots of pain, yeah.

598
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,000
Good to see you all.

599
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,300
Why do I always have to be so negative?

600
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,180
I'm an old boy in the house.

601
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,380
I'm a big boy in the house.

602
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


603
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


604
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


605
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


606
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


607
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


608
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


609
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


610
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


611
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


612
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


613
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


614
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


615
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


616
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


617
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:16,380


618
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:43,320
I saw her walking by

619
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,060
and I sort of winked my eye

620
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,740
and she stopped dead.

621
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:48,320
Redhead.

622
00:36:48,380 --> 00:36:50,340
She had a cute way of walking.

623
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:51,960
I had to get her talking.

624
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,580
My heart bled.

625
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,220
I said,

626
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,000
my knees are getting weak.

627
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,380
Smile at me.

628
00:36:58,400 --> 00:36:59,200
Speak, she said.

629
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:03,800
We'll return to

630
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:06,020
The Painful Threshold

631
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,220
after this message.

632
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,480
So the severity

633
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,740
of the anal rectal pain

634
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:16,540
or burning

635
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,660
is sometimes a clue

636
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:18,240
to the diagnosis.

637
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,360
They may have

638
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:21,360
difficulty voiding.

639
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,720
And they may have

640
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,020
pain in the buttocks

641
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,080
and paresthesias

642
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:28,900
in the buttock areas

643
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,800
and also paresthesias

644
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,120
in the upper posterior thighs.

645
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:33,820
This is thought to be

646
00:37:33,820 --> 00:37:35,240
related to the virus

647
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,180
infecting the sacral ganglia.

648
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:45,860
Oh, oh, oh.

649
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,220
Hurry, Betty.

650
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,880
What's the matter, Coco?

651
00:37:50,420 --> 00:37:51,360
My coosh.

652
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:51,800
Oh.

653
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,160
Ow.

654
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,720
Your eyes cast a spell

655
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,980
that bewitches

656
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:11,240
the last time

657
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,220
I needed twenty stitches.

658
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,020
To sew up the gash

659
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:18,080
you made with your lash

660
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,200
as we dance

661
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,460
to the masochism tango.

662
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,540
Bash in my brain

663
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,440
and make me scream with pain.

664
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,140
Then kick me once again

665
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,420
and say we'll never part.

666
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:31,600
I know too well

667
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,300
I'm underneath your spell.

668
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:35,260
So darling, if you smell

669
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,440
something burning,

670
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,400
it's my heart.

671
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,560
Excuse me.

672
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,680
Although they may be

673
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,380
having the pain,

674
00:38:40,500 --> 00:38:41,740
it's not affecting them

675
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:42,580
through fear

676
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,140
as much as it would

677
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,240
otherwise because fear

678
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,400
and pain

679
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:48,180
sort of act on one another

680
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:49,400
in a way that the fear

681
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,400
plus the pain

682
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,980
actually enhances the pain.

683
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:53,880
Mary never cries.

684
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:56,380
Smack her, pinch her, hurt her.

685
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:58,820
Not one tear will you get.

686
00:38:59,200 --> 00:38:59,800
Ever.

687
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:03,000
Mary also never laughs.

688
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,920
I dare you to make her do

689
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:06,460
either one.

690
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,740
In the midst of Gabbatha

691
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,620
was a huge stone post.

692
00:39:14,140 --> 00:39:15,720
They would bring a man

693
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:17,100
to that post.

694
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:19,560
They would take his hands

695
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,820
and wrap him around the post

696
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,020
and pull him as tight

697
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,840
as they possibly could

698
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,800
to stretch the skin

699
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:30,500
very tight across the back.

700
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,660
They would turn

701
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:34,020
and take the reins

702
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:35,560
and pull them

703
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:38,100
around this huge stone

704
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,840
and tie that person down,

705
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,540
spitting their clothes

706
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,120
on each side of the post.

707
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:44,820
Inside of that stone

708
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:46,180
was a basin

709
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:48,240
filled with salt water.

710
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:49,960
In that salt water

711
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,900
was a number of scourges.

712
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:53,860
Now these scourges

713
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:56,460
was a short handle

714
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:58,140
leather scourges.

715
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,420
They had nine strands

716
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:03,100
that came down from the hands.

717
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,220
Each of the strands, I'm told,

718
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,180
were tied in knots.

719
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:09,180
Little bits of bones

720
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,660
were tied

721
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,700
in each of the knots

722
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:14,040
in the strands.

723
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,160
The strands that came down

724
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,740
from that scourge

725
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:17,940
that was huge.

726
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,060
Ah, yes.

727
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:23,700
Oh.

728
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:27,960
Real pain to my sham friends

729
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,820
and sham pain to my whole hell.

730
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:32,600
Real pain for everyone

731
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,380
all around.

732
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:35,840
Oh.

733
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,040
Yeah, see,

734
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,980
the Church of the Subgenius

735
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:42,800
isn't the only religion

736
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:43,560
that wallows

737
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:44,120
in a pain.

738
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:49,680
theme. Look at the supposedly benign Christian cults like the Baptists and

739
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:54,680
the Catholics. But this is a season that all Christians indulge in lip-smacking

740
00:40:54,680 --> 00:41:00,700
Easter time necro porn. Boy, they pack the pews like rubberneckers at a multi-car

741
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,600
fatality this time of year because everybody likes to see somebody else get

742
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:11,880
hurt. Oh, how they relish pouring over the gory details, thinking that somehow

743
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:16,700
because somebody got staple gunned to a tree a couple millennia ago, they're off

744
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:21,880
the hook. Hey, I'd rather duel with masochists than Methodists any day.

745
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:31,380
Oh, those religious snuff perverts sicken me. I'd rather cast my lot in with a cult

746
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:35,460
where there's some certainty that when you buy your salvation, it stays bought.

747
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,300
Barring, of course, any clerical oversight.

748
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,760
But grab a

749
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:41,860
thought.

750
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:46,320
Don't be pencil seekers because I'm going to give you some advice here. You can buy

751
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:58,880
salvation by sending a stamped, self-addressed envelope to Bob at P.O. Box 140306, Dallas,

752
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:06,560
Texas 75214. And get all the pain you've got coming because with Bob, that pain you

753
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,620
suffer daily is a beautiful thing. Bob's going to see to it that you're not only

754
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,760
olutionally want to heal him and下面, but also想...

755
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,560
Lamable as bad as it gets, Bob still needs to turn around the clock in order to

756
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:38,280
tell the doctor his public opinion of the concept of mutualzię주 pai sacrifice in İB-15

757
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:38,320
and the

758
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:40,640
balancio.

759
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:40,980
14.

760
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:41,600
15.

761
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,700
But have you had enough pain yet?

762
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,360
I don't think so.

763
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:50,740
I will always love you.

764
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:58,400
I will always love you.

765
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,920
Oh, even I'm not...

766
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:02,880
Let me show you something.

767
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,740
You will feel absolutely no pain at all.

768
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:11,860
How do you feel?

769
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,560
Fine, thank you.

770
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:14,960
Well, thank you, young lady.

771
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,020
We'll get back to removing the needles in just a few moments.

772
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,140
We'll be right back.

773
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:21,960
We'll be right back.

774
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:40,640
We'll be right back.

775
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,960
We'll be right back.

776
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:44,260
We'll be right back.

777
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,580
We'll be right back.

778
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:48,720
We'll be right back.

779
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:22,580
We'll be right back.

780
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:06,720
We'll be right back.

781
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:08,380
We'll be right back.

782
00:48:44,140 --> 00:49:04,000
We'll be right back.

783
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:07,620
We'll be right back.

784
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:37,700
We'll be right back.

785
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,220
We'll be right back.

786
00:50:37,300 --> 00:50:38,700
We'll be right back.

787
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:07,260
We'll be right back.

788
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,920
We'll be right back.

789
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:07,980
We'll be right back.

790
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:12,320
We'll allow me to respond to that common misconception with one word.

791
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:14,400
Corrupt.

792
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:16,980
You've heard about corrupt.

793
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:23,140
It means lacking in moral integrity to taint, infect, or spoil.

794
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:28,220
To change the original form or intent.

795
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:32,440
In other words, to compromise.

796
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,720
Now, most of us don't like the word compromise.

797
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:42,900
corrupt. It sounds too dirty, too sleazy. We'd rather view ourselves as compromising. That sounds

798
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:51,320
so much more respectable. But is there really any difference, my friends? Let me tell you a little

799
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:59,360
story. It's a story about a fine Christian widow going through some hard times. She was still

800
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:03,880
beautiful, but her husband had jumped out the window after a stock market crash, leaving her

801
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:10,940
family and herself without much money. They had lived a very lavish lifestyle before, but now

802
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:17,880
they were struggling. Her only daughter was sick, and both her parents were old and feeble. Still,

803
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:27,740
she was a very proud woman because she still had her integrity. Until one day, when a wealthy old

804
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:33,300
man came by and visited her, he asked the old woman if she would sleep with him.

805
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:39,820
Of course, she flatly refused. She was angry at the suggestion, but then he offered to marry her,

806
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:44,880
restore the family fortune, take care of her daughter, and provide for her parents in their

807
00:53:44,880 --> 00:53:51,480
old age. At this point, she knew the man was a lecher, but marriage seemed a fair compromise,

808
00:53:52,100 --> 00:53:59,100
so she agreed. The man then offered her another compromise. Why not skip the marriage altogether

809
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:03,860
and just have sex for a hundred bucks? She exploded in anger. What did he think?

810
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:11,840
She was some kind of whore? Why, yes, the man replied. We just established that fact. Now we're

811
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:20,600
negotiating price. You see, the old man was right. The woman was always corrupt. She was just living

812
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:28,800
in denial. She wasn't a bad woman. She had many good qualities, but she had one fatal flaw.

813
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,860
She was willing to compromise her princess.

814
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:43,640
Now, how many of us are in that same situation? I don't mean widowed with a sick kid or older

815
00:54:43,640 --> 00:54:47,060
parents. I mean willing to compromise our principles in order to get ahead.

816
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:54,760
After all, when the reward is big enough, it's not easy to resist giving in just once.

817
00:54:56,080 --> 00:55:03,860
The problem, of course, is that it never is just once. It's only the beginning of a long,

818
00:55:03,860 --> 00:55:11,480
long line of compromise. It's always that first little compromise that's the hardest one to make,

819
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:14,780
but from there on out, it gets easier and easier.

820
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:25,220
My friends, even religion is not immune to this temptation. Have you ever heard of a seeker church?

821
00:55:26,180 --> 00:55:31,940
A seeker church is a non-denominational church designed by compromise.

822
00:55:33,860 --> 00:55:38,520
Every principle that might offend or scare newcomers off is compromised away.

823
00:55:39,720 --> 00:55:45,700
There is no loud, angry sermons. There's no insistence on tithing. There's no talk about

824
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:53,760
the horrors of hell, only the peace of heaven. In fact, there's no controversy at all,

825
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:58,280
just touchy-feely stuff to make you feel good so you'll come again next week.

826
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:03,680
These so-called seeker churches are the fastest-growing churches,

827
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:08,340
and they're the fastest-growing churches in America today. Many of them are mega-churches,

828
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:14,120
built to literally hold thousands of customers. I won't call them believers,

829
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:18,400
because they don't have anything to believe in, nothing they're not willing to compromise,

830
00:56:19,820 --> 00:56:29,580
because their church isn't built on a rock. It's built on the shifting sands of compromise.

831
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:33,580
Alas,

832
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:39,760
it's not just the seeker churches that are built on these changing foundations, my friends.

833
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:46,440
Religions from across the globe are compromising away their most fundamental beliefs, their

834
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:55,840
most fundamental principles, their most fundamental truths. O sure, it starts out small, some

835
00:56:55,840 --> 00:57:01,780
Jew eats pork, then some Catholic has an abortion. The next thing you know, the Episcopalians

836
00:57:01,780 --> 00:57:03,840
perform homosexual marriages. And the history speaks for itself in the history of the South,

837
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:07,080
Hindus forbid women from climbing on their husbands' funeral fires.

838
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:10,660
I mean, really, what's the point of even having a religion

839
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,760
if you're not going to play by the rules?

840
00:57:14,300 --> 00:57:18,500
Do you think God isn't going to know when you're cheating on him?

841
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:24,740
Do you think God is going to turn a blind, omnipotent eye on your betrayal?

842
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:28,560
No, sir. No, sir. He knows.

843
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:34,500
And if you betray God, why shouldn't God betray you?

844
00:57:35,840 --> 00:57:38,380
Oh, it's your choice, all right. Don't get me wrong there.

845
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:41,980
You can choose. But stop a moment to consider this.

846
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,140
Who is going to suffer more in the long run?

847
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,020
God or you?

848
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:57,340
We've considered, and that's why we, the Church of the Subgenius,

849
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,240
are dedicated.

850
00:57:58,560 --> 00:57:59,980
To not compromising.

851
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:02,600
That's why we, Bob's chosen few,

852
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:07,380
refuse to give in to outside pressures to become more mainstream.

853
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:10,140
If you want mainstream,

854
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:13,060
you can go to any one of those other milquetoast churches

855
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:15,780
that litter the landscape and refuse to pay taxes.

856
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,940
But don't come whining to us with your

857
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,280
gee, Bob, can you tone it down just a little bit attitude

858
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:25,200
because we're not interested in winning the Nielsen ratings.

859
00:58:26,120 --> 00:58:27,960
We don't care if you're disgusted

860
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:32,420
by Jane or launching decapitated heads from the stage with a nine iron.

861
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,340
We don't care if you're nauseated by the hardcore anti-Muzak

862
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,880
of the swinging love corpses.

863
00:58:39,320 --> 00:58:42,900
And we damn sure don't care if you're offended by my hate rants.

864
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:48,440
In other words, we don't care about you at all.

865
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,580
Because this church isn't about you.

866
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:58,260
In fact, our church is probably the only product of the me generation.

867
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:01,020
That is not about you.

868
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,540
It's about Bob.

869
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:09,280
And if you don't like it, you can just go to hell.

870
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:14,060
Because that's where Bob sends those who compromise his church.

871
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:20,740
Hearing the word of Bob, unchanging, unamended, and uncompromised.

872
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,140
Praise Bob! Amen.

873
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,040
Amen.

874
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:30,360
Great Father Joe Mama closing out the show.

875
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:35,560
And of course, dear friends, if you need more information about the Church of the Subgenius,

876
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:40,020
please write for free information from this address I'm about to give.

877
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:41,860
Got that pencil ready? That's Bob.

878
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:55,080
At Post Office Box 181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118 www.subgenius.com

879
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:57,640
Ah.

880
00:59:58,560 --> 01:00:00,260
Oh, yes.

881
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,060
Yes, it's so purging.

882
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:08,260
So purging to do a show.

883
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:16,260
Get your mind together.

884
01:00:17,660 --> 01:00:18,460
Mind together.

885
01:00:20,300 --> 01:00:23,300
Get your mind together.

886
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:25,100
Mind together.

887
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:27,220
Mind together.

888
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,820
Mind together.

889
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:32,860
Mind together.

890
01:00:32,860 --> 01:00:33,720
Mind together.

891
01:00:34,540 --> 01:00:35,960
Mind together.

892
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:36,660
Mind together.

893
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:37,660
In the air, in the air.

894
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,620
It's a new one now

895
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:49,460
Everybody locks the doors

896
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:51,720
Strangers

897
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,120
Everybody's all bent up

898
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,720
Ready to blow up

899
01:01:01,820 --> 01:01:04,440
Boys and girls in a line

900
01:01:04,440 --> 01:01:06,580
Come and get your big reward

901
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,940
It's not too late, just in time

902
01:01:08,940 --> 01:01:12,000
Just put your hand on mine, your mind, your mind

903
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,140
And everybody has gone to bed

904
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:27,180
Sit up late and watch TV

905
01:01:29,140 --> 01:01:34,220
And soak up, soak up, soak up lots of pain, yeah

906
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,260
Little Junior on the bus

907
01:01:43,020 --> 01:01:45,700
There's no book by his side, yeah

908
01:01:47,460 --> 01:01:51,080
He hardly ever makes a fuss

909
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,340
He soaks up so much food

910
01:01:54,340 --> 01:01:57,180
He travels by the smoky and me

911
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:01,820
By airplane, boat and train, yeah

912
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,420
We're here to eat up all your sins

913
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:13,240
And soak up, soak up, soak up all your pain, yeah

914
01:02:14,780 --> 01:02:16,700
Is it anyone to know

915
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:19,060
Everybody goes insane

916
01:02:19,060 --> 01:02:21,320
Everybody locks the doors

917
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,340
To keep out any stranger

918
01:02:24,540 --> 01:02:25,980
Everybody's all bent up

919
01:02:26,820 --> 01:02:28,320
Everybody's got your views

920
01:02:28,920 --> 01:02:30,540
Getting ready to blow up

921
01:02:30,540 --> 01:02:32,760
We live in so much danger

922
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:36,360
Boys and girls in a line

923
01:02:36,360 --> 01:02:38,500
Come and get your big reward

924
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:40,940
It's not too late, just in time

925
01:02:40,940 --> 01:02:43,860
Put your hand on mine, your mind, your mind

926
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:51,440
Boys and girls of every creed, yeah

927
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,620
Religion and persuasion, no

928
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:59,580
It's time to get up off your knees

929
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,640
As we soak up, soak it up

930
01:03:03,640 --> 01:03:06,220
Open the door and let me in

931
01:03:06,220 --> 01:03:06,340
Let me in, let me in

932
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:06,340


933
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:06,340


934
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:06,340


935
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:06,340


936
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,680
Don't question who I am, no

937
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:15,540
Just shake my hand and give me your name

938
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,660
We soak up, soak it up

939
01:03:19,660 --> 01:03:22,100
Soak up, soak it up

940
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,260
Soak it up, soak it up

941
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:24,580
Soak it up now

942
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,260
Got seven dollars in my pocket

943
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:43,860
Still walking

944
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,200
What a shame

945
01:03:52,980 --> 01:03:56,680
Seven dollars in my pocket

946
01:03:58,220 --> 01:04:00,640
But my heart is broken still
