1
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,260
Yes sir, I'm the guy that has my legal notices in the paper to explore base.

2
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,420
I have the one by the sheriff and he mentions I have problems with a clemency policeman

3
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,060
and permission to exchange those seeds, a seed source.

4
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,400
I have my case in the Indo-Chinese one.

5
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,520
I'm allowed to put in one from North American Indian.

6
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,420
I'm allowed to explore base.

7
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:39,300
I'm allowed to smoke out in the open if I wish.

8
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,260
It's not my wish that I have a privacy case.

9
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,620
I have an oxygen case.

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,100
I had another legal notice.

11
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,580
The whole reason I called, I forgot.

12
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,560
Wasn't it a really big, long message?

13
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:52,940
What the hell was it?

14
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,380
I'll call back to you in a minute.

15
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:56,380


16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:56,380


17
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:56,380


18
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:56,380


19
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:56,380


20
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,640
Jesus.

21
00:00:58,380 --> 00:00:59,680
Bob, what button did you push?

22
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,580
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,700
I think they're learning how to fly.

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,420
To fly?

25
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:15,580
Yeah, fly.

26
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,420
Yeah, no, we're learning how to crawl, dear friends.

27
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,080
We're crawling through these cassettes.

28
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,100
Yes, crawling through these cassettes

29
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,900
and cigarette butts and spilled coffee.

30
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,580
But I'll tell you what, my friend,

31
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,320
we've come to a new fork in the road.

32
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:37,220
Yes, here at the Church of the Subgenius.

33
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:38,300
I bet you can't hardly believe

34
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:39,800
we actually got a new show out

35
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:42,560
only one week after the last show.

36
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,080
But it's because Jesus got here.

37
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,320
Jesus got here.

38
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,220
He's been healing and sickening everything

39
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,500
except his own equipment.

40
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,020
And friends, it's making a difference.

41
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:54,940
And I'll tell you something.

42
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,020
I'll tell you.

43
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,940
You know, we've done some artistic projects

44
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,560
in this old church of ours.

45
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:03,260
We've done all kinds of terrible crimes

46
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,220
in the name of Bob and so forth.

47
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,740
We've worked hard and we've saved a few mutants

48
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:10,020
from suicide.

49
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:13,080
Even a few that we should have saved from suicide.

50
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,060
And, you know, now we're ready to get down

51
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:20,240
to a new phase, a new artistic approach.

52
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,920
Yes, our new goal, our new way

53
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,880
shall be to make money.

54
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:26,960
Money.

55
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,860
Hand over fist.

56
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,380
Yes, that is the new...

57
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:32,540
Actually, that was always a goal

58
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,000
of the Church of the Subgenius.

59
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:34,820
But now that we've...

60
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:38,400
I mean, heck, X-Day is only two years away.

61
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,920
And we'll be giving you detailed information

62
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,780
about the X-Day drill coming up in New York later.

63
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,180
But, friends, I mean, at this point,

64
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,480
you know, as we've said so many times before,

65
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:52,820
in order to completely and utterly destroy

66
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,540
the concept of money,

67
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,040
it's going to take money.

68
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,960
It's going to take a lot of money, my friend.

69
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,200
And, by God, before this show is out,

70
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,220
we shall be millionaires.

71
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,860
I swear it.

72
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,280
And, Bob, that's a much bigger transaction

73
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,960
than what we puny human beings want to get involved in.

74
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,640
What about those millionaires, eh?

75
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,360
What are we going to do with the millionaires?

76
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,420
As the money comes pouring in,

77
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,780
we'll realize our potential

78
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:18,640
by creating great obstacles

79
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,760
in the way of hospitals and libraries.

80
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:23,960
We'll keep these things from being spread

81
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,520
and destroyed.

82
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:26,840
First, so that the populace can wallow in ignorance

83
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:29,420
in the new world which is to come.

84
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,260
Thank you.

85
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:31,240
You've got it. You've got the part.

86
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,680
I told you he could do it.

87
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,120
Sure, I could.

88
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:33,680
What?

89
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,500
Not only that, it's on the television station

90
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:38,060
that you could be watching right now

91
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,000
instead of this show.

92
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,000
And he's happy about it.

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:41,820
He knows how to celebrate.

94
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:43,880
They stay happy in their tiny mud huts

95
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,220
with the dirt floors and the bugs

96
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,020
dropping from the little palm frond roof

97
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,800
watching their color TV.

98
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,980
Instant or not, all pseudo-slack or false highs,

99
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,160
every bit as fulfilling as a real thing

100
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,920
are quickly reached through repetitive monotonous

101
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,520
and phantomatic.

102
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:57,020
And healthful competition.

103
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,480
It's shown here.

104
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,540
Here's what happens when one worshiper

105
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,020
gets his prayer wheel just a little out of control

106
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,400
and has it wallowing too fast.

107
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,480
Remember what I said?

108
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,460
Yes, sir.

109
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,060
I'm the guy that has my legal notice

110
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,280
in the paper in advance.

111
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,880
Also, I mentioned I'm having trouble

112
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,440
with a clemency policeman or two.

113
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,400
I sued them in the 70s

114
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,520
in the front hall of Euclid High School

115
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:18,460
and they won't get off.

116
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,940
They want to disturb my privacy.

117
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:23,100
And then I believe I have a story.

118
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:23,760
I'm large.

119
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:23,760


120
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,260
And I am allowed

121
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,360
for the reintroduction message,

122
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,800
crap, I'm allowed 9 leaf

123
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,600
and 11 and lucky 13

124
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:36,360
and 15 and bad news 17

125
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,760
and 19 and 21 leaf.

126
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,040
I'm entitled to scientific

127
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,520
and entertainer's roles

128
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,760
and music industry,

129
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:44,600
entertainment industry,

130
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,280
where it's going.

131
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,780
Scientific.

132
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,640
I'm allowed to carry a sizable amount

133
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,580
because I'm supposed to be

134
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,580
international status

135
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,360
and this is my privacy case.

136
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,480
And a large amount for bail

137
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,460
and bond and severance silver,

138
00:04:57,660 --> 00:04:58,720
Ms. Sparry's I'm entitled

139
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,760
to liquid blue,

140
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,220
blue mid Spirits,

141
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,880
sacred Indian Blue,

142
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,460
blue Mesa, blue corn.

143
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,820
pretty much

144
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,880
clemency is mês

145
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:22,880


146
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:22,880


147
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,260
Mr. Sparry,

148
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,260


149
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,260


150
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,260


151
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,260


152
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,260


153
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,340
Thank you, Mr. Sparry,

154
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,840
And now it seems like we've been waiting for ages

155
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:29,000
Consciousness has walked through states and stages

156
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,040
Shaking it up, spreading around

157
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,860
Making up religions and filling up pages of history

158
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,680
It's a mystery to me who wrote that story

159
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,900
What do you believe? It's an Illuminati party

160
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:40,920
A space dog's dream, you watch yourself

161
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,280
Cause they could be mean

162
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:50,340
Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati

163
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,440
Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati, Illumination

164
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,940
They be scheming like demons, sucking your brain

165
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:04,940
Making you feel like a new age when it's blackmail

166
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:07,440
Wholesale, anybody's game, you don't know you're in the club

167
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,420
Till it's too late

168
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:10,700
Look real close, read between the lines

169
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,860
World leaders and coots with kooky canines

170
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,980
Gonna make you wanna laugh, make you wanna scream

171
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,240
It's an Illuminati party, a space dog's dream

172
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:19,940
Illuminati

173
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,320
Illuminati

174
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:25,600
Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati, Illumin junto

175

181
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,420
Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati, Illuminati, Illumination!

182
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,360
Eat it up, think boys, swallow it whole

183
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,640
Swallow in stupidity, smoke it in your bowl

184
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,820
Eat it up, think boys, swallow it whole

185
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,000
Swallow in stupidity, smoke it in your bowl

186
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,400
Swallow in stupidity, smoke it in your bowl

187
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,260
Swallow...

188
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:07,440
Swallow it whole

189
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,260
Swallow in!

190
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:14,500
Oh, it's更,更 hell appearing now on screen

191
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:14,680
I am name Jena

192
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:28,800
I just got the random Chinese word

193
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,260
guitar solo

194
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,620
Now everybody thinks dog's man's best friend

195
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,780
Waggy tail, lick your hand and all that kind of shit

196
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,020
But I don't buy the domesticated crap

197
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,220
What the hell, hounds talking, shitting in your lap

198
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:16,320
Breathing down your neck with their dirty doggy breath

199
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,420
I see them trotting down the street

200
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,500
You know they scare me hot to death

201
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,720
It's an Illuminati party, a space dog's dream

202
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,040
You watch yourself, cause they could be mean

203
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:27,800
Illuminati, Illuminati

204
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:28,800
Illuminati, Illuminati

205
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,820
Illuminati, Illuminati

206
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,260
Illuminati, Illuminate

207
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,800
Illuminati, Illuminati

208
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,920
Illuminati, Illuminati

209
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,480
Illuminati, Illuminati

210
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:39,740
Illuminate

211
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,520
Shun!

212
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:52,320
While inoculate, mercury umbilical clear

213
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,080
Umbilical clear

214
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:55,180
Mercury and atmospheric light gone

215
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:58,360
All recorders to fast D-18

216
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:58,780
D-18

217
00:08:58,780 --> 00:08:59,720
Oh, the recorder's fine

218
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:03,880
Because Bob is watching

219
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:10,360
Bob is listening, dear friends

220
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:22,100
Bob, yeah

221
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,440
Because, you know, friends

222
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,580
Since that mess with the

223
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:30,020
Branch Davidians

224
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,760
Many small religious sects

225
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,040
Have been the recipients of some

226
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,740
Negative dogmas

227
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,320
This has long been the case

228
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:42,200
Among the church of the subgenius followers

229
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,900
The so-called pinks

230
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,500
Or normals

231
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,980
Have been critical of the idea

232
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,500
That salvation is guaranteed

233
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,720
For the reasonable price

234
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,500
Of thirty dollars

235
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,700
Some believe an upright life

236
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,700
Lacking in sin

237
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:58,760
Is the key to a good life

238
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,500
And the only way to eternal happiness

239
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:03,020
But through the timeless teachings

240
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:05,740
Of J.R. Bob Dobbs

241
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:07,600
I have finally learned

242
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,920
How to slack off

243
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,540
Bob's optimism

244
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:14,620
His valuable teachings

245
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:16,340
And contagious enthusiasm

246
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,680
Are just a few of the traits

247
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,040
That led him to lead

248
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,600
The subgenite

249
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,700
Millions and millions

250
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,420
Of people are depressed

251
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,500
Right now as you're hearing me

252
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,820
Give this introduction

253
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:32,260
Someone, somewhere is planning

254
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,580
Their suicide

255
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,960
They are cleaning the gun

256
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,000
Or writing the note

257
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,500
Because nobody cares

258
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,940
They know greed

259
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:44,420
Has overtaken society

260
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,640
They know that people would be afraid

261
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,920
To give them mouth-to-mouth resuscitation

262
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,300
For fear of disease

263
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,800
And lawsuits

264
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,800
What these unfortunate souls lack

265
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:57,540
Is J.R. Bob Dobbs

266
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,460
Optimism

267
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,360
He sees our greed

268
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,860
And accepts it

269
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,020
He has put a price

270
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,360
On your salvation

271
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,660
And you're only worth thirty dollars

272
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:11,040
And that is no problem

273
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,140
There's no prob

274
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,620
With Bob

275
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:16,020
Bob has glimpsed our collective future

276
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,820
And is still able to smile

277
00:11:17,820 --> 00:11:19,440
His famous smile

278
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:21,940
Above all else

279
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:23,860
Bob is a teacher

280
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:26,660
He unselfishly tells the universe

281
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,940
What it wants to hear

282
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,780
Slack off

283
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:29,800
Quit your job

284
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,200
Pull the wool

285
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,120
Over your own eyes

286
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,900
Bob knows what is true

287
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,540
And allows his message

288
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,440
To be broadcast on radio waves

289
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,260
And other various waves

290
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:42,720
Throughout the cosmos

291
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,620
Anyway

292
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,120
Bob also teaches of the coming

293
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,940
Of X-Day

294
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:51,680
July 5th, 1998

295
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:54,600
He ensures the end is coming

296
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,540
And gives his followers an option

297
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,780
Of salvation

298
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,060
Thirty dollars, dear friends

299
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,800
That is all it will cost you

300
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,760
The Book of the Subgenius asks

301
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,640
Are you abnormal?

302
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:09,180
Then you are probably better

303
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,960
Than most people, it responds

304
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,940
This kind of enthusiasm

305
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,780
Is contagious among the subgeniuses

306
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,680
As children

307
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,220
They felt misunderstood

308
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,640
Alienated by their peers

309
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,520
Because they were different

310
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,820
Bob's contagious enthusiasm

311
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:27,920
Abets the self-conceit

312
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,340
confidence of his followers by convincing him they are not the freaks they once thought

313
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:38,020
they were. In fact, they were far greater freaks than they ever dared dream, and gives

314
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,120
them a feeling of connection.

315
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:50,960
Ah, yes. J.R. Bob Dobbs has an enthralling optimism, strong teaching skills, and an extremely

316
00:12:50,960 --> 00:13:00,600
contagious enthusiasm that shows his followers for years how important it is to slack off.

317
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:10,240
Ah, yes, dear friends. That lovely little essay there was actually written by Reverend

318
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:16,820
Rachel Simon, a Plano High School student here in North Texas.

319
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,840
Oh, yes. Thank you, Rachel.

320
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:25,400
Thank you, Rachel, and how truly smarmy it is. Sort of like this music in the background,

321
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:32,880
which by the way is Brother Cleve Duncan, Cleve Donut Duncan from his new tape, Dreamsville,

322
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:38,900
which is mostly music by Henry Mancini redone by Brother Cleve. And friends, tonight we're

323
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:43,820
going to take young Rachel at her word and we're going to go slack off. We're going to

324
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:50,620
go see Brother Cleve perform tonight in Dallas with the combustible Edison. No, with cum

325
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:50,820
the.

326
00:13:50,820 --> 00:14:00,300
combustible Edison. That's like saying the Devo's. And oh, it shall be spacey, dear friends.

327
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:07,560
You know, space age bachelor pad music as it is. So let us be off.

328
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:18,140
Now, let's not go off. Let's, uh, let's, oh, hey, old man, let's have a damn party. That's

329
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,640
what I say. We'll have this damn party because friends.

330
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:24,380
There is a damn party coming up. Wait a minute.

331
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:33,980
You kids keep it down back there. It's hard to get work done. You know, as much as we

332
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:37,860
have to party constantly here at the subgenius foundation, but friends, I wanted to share

333
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:43,500
with you before we get going on to more incredible music, uh, and amazing rants. I wanted to

334
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:50,100
share with you some news about upcoming deed Bibles. Yes. Um, there are some coming up.

335
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:57,440
Uh, here and there we've got actually almost all of these are up north around the Cleveland

336
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:04,440
and New York area on May 25th. Uh, music star, uh, yours truly will make that's just a small,

337
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:10,800
uh, pagan folky. I don't know what it is actually to tell the truth, but, but, but, but heck,

338
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:15,420
you know, we're going to be there May 25th for information on that. And on starwood,

339
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:19,840
the giant pagan, uh, camp out event, the infamous thing.

340
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:25,180
That happens every year. That one is, I think the, the last weekend in July. And for information

341
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,980
on those, you may call, uh, ACE in Cleveland. I'm about to give that 1-800 number and here

342
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:46,040
it is dear friends. It's a 1-800-446-4962. Once again, that's 800-446-4962. And, uh,

343
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,820
ah, but that, yes, as much fun as that is.

344
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:55,640
Those may be friends. What's really, really gonna peel your hide right off of you is the

345
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:01,520
X day end of the world drill. Number one, coming up at brushwood folklore center, Sherman,

346
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:08,580
New York X day, 1996, July 5th through 7th. It friends, it's going to be a little taste

347
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:16,240
of Dobbs town. Oh yes. Because you know, there's only two years left, two more July 5th before

348
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,160
we kiss all calendars. Goodbye.

349
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,800
And that gives us barely enough time to get to the end of the world.

350
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:19,800


351
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,060
I'm going to give you a little bit of time to prepare by gathering together all the tribes

352
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:29,560
and files of sub genius them for a fast yearly doc stock, like free for all outdoor slack

00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:40,040
talking at the same time in the background, but friends, here's that number to call, uh,

355
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:45,720

00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,880
2 1 6.

00:16:54,340 --> 00:17:00,360
That's 2 1 6 5 5 6 0 3 3 8 because, and friends at brushwood. Yeah, sure. You, most of you

358
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,000

359
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,840
in southwestern New York state about an hour from area and about two hours from Cleveland.

360
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,980
And it's a it's a hand zone, it's going wait a minute.

361
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:17,040
That's better.

362
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:19,780
Yes, friends. It's true. I didn't know the Interstate was about to decode this. Whoa.

363
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:19,780


364
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:19,780


365
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:19,780


366
00:17:20,360 --> 00:17:22,500
out on this amazing campground.

367
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,940
It's a nicely equipped campground, too, by the way.

368
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,480
They've got a giant tent for holding tents, show devivals,

369
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,980
a swimming pool, a hot tub area,

370
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:33,400
and enough electrical power to keep 10,000 doctor vans

371
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,680
cranking out the hits, using all their equipment,

372
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:39,140
while breathing church air and performing nasal sex,

373
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,260
start naked right there in front of everybody all night long.

374
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,080
Yes, that's right.

375
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:47,920
You can finally really let your Yeti nose hair down

376
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:49,260
at this little event.

377
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,060
It'll probably scare the crap out of the norm worms

378
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:53,320
and us as well.

379
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,760
But this isn't the sort of sleazy little...

380
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,120
Excuse me, friends.

381
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,460
This radio station's falling down around our ears.

382
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,620
These are the end times.

383
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,260
But, you know, this is a secure situation, friends.

384
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:10,240
We will own the cops at this particular setup.

385
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,140
It is the perfect place to practice and drill

386
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:16,000
for the utterly mouth-watering slack

387
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,040
that we'll have to undergo come 1998.

388
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,620
None may stop us.

389
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,640
None may escape once the gate closes.

390
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:27,960
And, friends, it will be an unforgettable,

391
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:31,160
insane, nervous system-raping experience

392
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,200
that should freak out the normals

393
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,420
as well as the stuffed shirts of Geni

394
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,160
until they too join the orgy.

395
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,740
And, yes, friends, saucers will scream overhead.

396
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:47,420
Greys will skulk in the butches.

397
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,160
There's an actual live Yeti.

398
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,000
Bees will materialize by your campfire.

399
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:53,800
You'll finally meet your true Yeti mate

400
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,560
and play with prairie squids in the bushes all day.

401
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,760
You'll become your own heroes and meet friends for life

402
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,020
who will get you rich without working

403
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:08,520
and, uh, it may even permanently traumatize or scar you.

404
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,920
We certainly hope so.

405
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,500
That's okay.

406
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,940
That's all part of Bob Dob's great underplan.

407
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,920
It's a subgenius X-Day drill party, friends.

408
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,240
You bring the self-ignorance...

409
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:19,960
You bring the exciting bobbies...

410
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,040
And I'll bring the binoculars.

411
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,920
You bring the candy warheads...

412
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,820
And I'll bring the real ones.

413
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,520
You bring the pipe cleaners...

414
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,440
And I'll bring the cornstarch.

415
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:28,860
You bring the great big wooden cross...

416
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,860
And I'll bring the hell of skulls.

417
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:32,880
You bring the messiah...

418
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,220
And I'll bring the nails.

419
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,040
You bring the pit bulls...

420
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:40,440
And we'll supply the pit, friends.

421
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,820
So, um, well, there's gonna be so much to see there.

422
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:48,460
Sideshow marvels, tubs and tubs of purple Kool-Aid,

423
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,240
Spongebob, and the other stuff.

424
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:50,820
Spontaneous doctor band combustion,

425
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,720
trained prairie squid gigging parties,

426
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,600
um, free de-beaking tools for the first five gig-ees,

427
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,460
uh, sports figure body part launching,

428
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:02,540
nude chainsaw juggling,

429
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,480
bull fights,

430
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,240
frop enhancement workshops,

431
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,500
acubating psychic surgery cockfights,

432
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:10,340
live freaks of nature and acid casualties,

433
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,080
uh, bobby roping,

434
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,860
private adult sex-hurt seminars,

435
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,420
bonobo chimpanzee goblin contest,

436
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,320
dog fights,

437
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:19,800
self-mutilating preachers,

438
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,380
oddly normal seeming people,

439
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,680
and insane irritating bobbies who won't shut up.

440
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,040
Free crucifixions in front of lobotomies,

441
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,180
live casner heads,

442
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,880
live aliens and their walk-in dupes,

443
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,560
and body painting, friends.

444
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:36,100
Well, there's so much more we could tell you about that.

445
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,480
All the greats will be there.

446
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,300
Uh, Dr. Katahdin Lagoon, Papa Joe Mama,

447
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,960
Circus Apocalypse, Reverend Nikki Death Chick,

448
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,440
um, uh, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

449
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,300
the Lord Jesus Christ of the Dead,

450
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,580
Son of God, King of Slack Bill T. Miller,

451
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:52,900
yours truly, uh, j- and, uh,

452
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:56,080
everybody, everybody cool, man,

453
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,780
everybody cool will be at, uh, the X Day Drill.

454
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,900
It's your chance this decade, until next year,

455
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,540
to do a Doc Stock, if you know what I mean.

456
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,220
And, hey, where's my left channel?

457
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,520
Oh, it's there, okay.

458
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,780
Um, and once again, that number to call is

459
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,940
216-556-0338.

460
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:24,840
I think you may be able to hear the, uh, enthusiasm in my voice.

461
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:27,840
That man Bob has given me that contagious enthusiasm

462
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,680
that we need so badly in this church,

463
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,420
and now we're going to get rich, rich, rich beyond, um,

464
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,920
even my wildest nightmares.

465
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,480
So call the Free Dobs Hotline,

466
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,820
D-Vival Hotline, 216-556-0338,

467
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:45,760
or write to us here at the post office.

468
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:45,760


469
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,280
That's the P-O box for that free information.

470
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:52,100
And that address, of course, is Bob at 140,

471
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:54,940
Box 140306.

472
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,200
That's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

473
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,660
And, uh, I'm sure we will be giving that number again.

474
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:05,120
I should now, uh, tell you that the music we were listening to earlier

475
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:08,400
was, of course, uh, that song Illuminati Party

476
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,020
is by, uh, the Klingons in Germany,

477
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,780
in Berlin, in fact.

478
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,740
That's Captain Nancy Darnier,

479
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,000
and her, uh, side captain, Rocking Wanky.

480
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,460
I love to say that guy's name.

481
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,000
Rocking Wanky.

482
00:22:24,420 --> 00:22:28,240
And, uh, yes, yes, yes.

483
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:31,100
And, oh, God, there's so much, so much here.

484
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,500
What shall be next? I don't know.

485
00:22:34,100 --> 00:22:37,400
I'd love to be able to go to a party where I can yell out,

486
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,180
I want to hear some pervert music!

487
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,080
So what I mean by pervert music, it doesn't have to be, uh,

488
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,840
overtly pervert music,

489
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,620
but it does have to, for no particular reason,

490
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:58,880
psyche up to want to do sexually perverted things

491
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,180
to women and or girls.

492
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,800
Like that song by the Monkees, I Saw Her Face.

493
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,180
Now, I'm a believer.

494
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,080
When I hear the beginning of it,

495
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,440
it, uh, psychs me up to want to do kinky sexual things.

496
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:17,100
I almost forgot. Here's the How Dare You song.

497
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,180
How dare you?

498
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:23,780
You made me ejaculate in my pants.

499
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,260
For I was only in junior high school.

500
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:36,580
I was too young to fall in love and have sex.

501
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:40,800
Here's an imitation of an angry transvestite.

502
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,140
How dare you?

503
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:46,620
You made me ejaculate in my skirt.

504
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:53,480
For I was only in junior high school.

505
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:59,780
I was too young to fall in love and have sex.

506
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,980
I was too young to fall in love and have sex.

507
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,280
And today, we are still, if they still had animal sacrifices,

508
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,980
and Bob, before the Lord comes back,

509
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,420
or in that period of time,

510
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:19,180
that temple's going to be rebuilt,

511
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:22,080
and they're going to be reinitiating the sacrificial system.

512
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,740
And I can just see a bunch of these Christians

513
00:24:24,740 --> 00:24:27,380
that are more preoccupied with Israel than they are Jesus

514
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:29,480
just flocking over there to get involved.

515
00:24:29,780 --> 00:24:31,580
Just thinking that's the neatest thing ever going.

516
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,960
Well, there's a...

517
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,220
My daughter has become involved in something that I think is a cult.

518
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,160
I think it might be a satanic cult.

519
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,700
Um...

520
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:49,640
I saw an astral star on some of their literature.

521
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,220
Okay.

522
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:56,080
Well, let's just do an abbreviation of what's going on in here, okay?

523
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,780
She's a member of this group,

524
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,380
this organization,

525
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:06,860
the First Church of Cute Young Girls Who Are Sex Wives to Jane of Iberclades.

526
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:12,180
Okay, because this is the card of the devil.

527
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:12,540
It's reversed.

528
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,220
Yes, ma'am.

529
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,700
And this couple have a chain around their necks.

530
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,880
Is that bad, ma'am?

531
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:27,300
Well, yeah, because I'm saying that there's some kind of illusion there.

532
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:30,900
There are chains, whatever it is, you know?

533
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,780
And between now and six months,

534
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,160
you're gonna be in a better frame of mind about this,

535
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:38,820
because I'm saying that there's a way out.

536
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:39,180
They're chained to Bob.

537
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,660
Yes, ma'am.

538
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:46,920
I don't understand why she would want to be a sex slave.

539
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,300
I mean, we tried to raise her, you know, in a Christian manner.

540
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,380
It had nothing to do with what you raised her.

541
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:56,880
It's the company that she keeps.

542
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,280
Yes, ma'am.

543
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,040
That had pulled her away from her upbringing.

544
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,240
Hanging out with subgeniuses again.

545
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,120
Jane, what you gotta do is you gotta hire a deprogrammer.

546
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:11,320
And the only kind of deprogrammer that can deprogram your daughter

547
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:13,040
is another subgenius.

548
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,240
You know, it takes one to know one.

549
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:19,840
That's Jane of Iberclades doing a prank call on the psychic network

550
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:21,380
or something like that.

551
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:24,260
Jane has got a show in Little Rock,

552
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,600
and I guess they're hearing it right now.

553
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,840
And I'm very glad of that.

554
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:33,220
Finally, the church has a chance of taking over the entire universe

555
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:36,180
now that Jane of Iberclades is on the radio.

556
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,320
Yes, yes, it's absolutely true.

557
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:40,700
Hey, another show to them.

558
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:41,380
Hey, bro.

559
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:41,540
Hey, bro.

560
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:47,040
I'm getting a strong reading over here on this meter here.

561
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,540
Uh-oh, I've got a funny reading too, sir.

562
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,060
It's something big, and it's coming this way.

563
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:54,380
Now, this is a 40-foot mosquito you're seeing here.

564
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,040
They would...

565
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,480
They would coax the giant 40-foot mosquitoes to come towards them

566
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:00,140
and run behind one of the ancient hardwood trees

567
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,020
that go all through the jungle.

568
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,760
And as the mosquito hit into the hardwood tree,

569
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,380
they would grab the...

570
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:08,440
The musketeer would grab the mosquito beak with his pliers

571
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,240
and hit with a sledgehammer,

572
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,180
bend over the beak on the backside of the tree,

573
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,120
thus trapping him.

574
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:13,580
Here we go.

575
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:13,900
Here you go.

576
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:14,400
You can see him.

577
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,140
There's the musketeer.

578
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,360
Hey, you got a musketeer?

579
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,820
Hey, you got a musketeer?

580
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:21,020
And you can see the musketeer chasing down the mosquitoes.

581
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:23,100
The doctors are chasing the insects around Green Hill now.

582
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,420
They've gone completely out of sight.

583
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,880
I didn't know.

584
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:27,120
But of course, when that insect...

585
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:27,620
Actually, they kill...

586
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,020
Ah, yes.

587
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,540
When you can finally trap him

588
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:31,300
and bend his beak over into that hardwood tree,

589
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:32,960
you can then sap his bodily fluids

590
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:35,060
and make that ancient liquid that you're talking about, girlfriend.

591
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,820
He's got a giant weather balloon there.

592
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,080
He's looking for two or three of the cats.

593
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,440
I don't say I can get the whole bird.

594
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,140
Yes, yes.

595
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,720
Yes.

596
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:43,220
Oh, look out.

597
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:44,740
Ah.

598
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,060
You can hear the squeaking.

599
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:46,960
Ah.

600
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:48,060
That's it.

601
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:48,760
That's it.

602
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,280
That's it.

603
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,500
That's it.

604
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:49,720
That's it.

605
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:49,840
That's it.

606
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:49,860
That's it.

607
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:55,180
He's got a body and he's now trapped.

608
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,360
You can see his giant body withering and limp hanging from the trunk

609
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,280
as the musketeer comes around with his tiny...

610
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:00,560
Limp hanging from the trunk.

611
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,440
...spittle bucket and puts it beneath...

612
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,680
Listen, you can hear it dripping out now.

613
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:04,940
Yes, there it is.

614
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,480
I can hear bubbles coming out.

615
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,180
You can see that.

616
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:06,840
There's the liquid.

617
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,000
There's the liquid coming out of that giant 40-pound mosquito.

618
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:09,380


619
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,320
There it is.

620
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:10,560
Listen.

621
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,560
Oh, look at...

622
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,380
Give me another glass of that, would you?

623
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:12,700
Here.

624
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:13,780
Here's more.

625
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:13,980
Look.

626
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:14,720
There's more.

627
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,700
Yeah, you're going to be able to expect...

628
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:17,600
This isn't bad at all.

629
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,400
You can expect at least 20 gallons of this stuff to come out of this one 40-pound mosquito,

630
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:25,780
and the mosquitoes are such a popular cult.

631
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,380
Oh, yes, dear friends.

632
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:34,120
A lovely classic little stretch from the old KPFA subgenius show in Berkeley, this time

633
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:40,740
with Glass Madness, Dr. Hal Palmer Vreides, Puzzling Evidence, and Gary Gebrogfran, an

634
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,740
all-star lineup.

635
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:45,100
And, friends, don't you forget to go to that X-Day party, that X-Day drill.

636
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:45,780
That is...

637
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,540
It's going to be your big chance to face the spike.

638
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:50,980
You'll love it.

639
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:51,580
Yeah?

640
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,400
Well, you know, the last time I partied like that, I woke up in the morning, and I was

641
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,400


642
00:28:54,420 --> 00:28:54,600
like, I'm going to get married.

643
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:55,060
How's that?

644
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:57,020
I woke up married.

645
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,020


646
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,020


647
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,020


648
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:57,080
I woke up married.

649
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,300
Hey, Jack, you forgot your muffin.

650
00:28:58,840 --> 00:28:59,740
Have a good one, Bob.

651
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:00,440
Thanks, Jack.

652
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,020
Take care, huh?

653
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:04,920
Yes, sir.

654
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,840
I'm the man that has my legal notice in the newspaper in advance.

655
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,220
I figured I'd give you a chance to practice your business and trust you with my privacy.

656
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,700
You have permission to serve me in the newspaper.

657
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,920
I need to talk to somebody that knows what they're talking about.

658
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,360
I have my story in the paper.

659
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,600
I'm missing my degrees, and I'm the big shoe on campus.

660
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,400
Man, I'm going to have to go to the office.

661
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:24,400


662
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,840
I'm the man that can't remember where he went to college.

663
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:30,400
There's an explanation about it, the Dr. Galakowicz incident.

664
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,220
Anyway, I'm entitled to black.

665
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,960
I'm allowed to grove, and I need to talk to somebody who knows what they're talking about,

666
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:41,640
a seed source, and I need to know about soil and pH and the right environment.

667
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,480
I'm allowed pink.

668
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,140
I'm allowed to have pink.

669
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:52,220
I'm allowed to have black and blue and yellow or gold, green and red.

670
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,380
I'm allowed to have purple or yellow.

671
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:54,380


672
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,220
I'm allowed to have pink, getting a little purple.

673
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,740
They call purple space grass, or scientific.

674
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,100
And rules outer space.

675
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,320
Purple space grass.

676
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,640
Purple Polly.

677
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:17,760
If I was a subgenius, I could drive a Cadillac with class,

678
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:22,200
my pockets stuffed with bad checks, and I could sit on my fat ass.

679
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:25,400
Now you take a subgenius, he ain't nobody's fool

680
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:28,680
He doesn't buy any gasoline to drive his kids to school

681
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,840
Damn, I wish I was a subgenius

682
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,440
Our government has gone crazy, I'd change things if I could

683
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,680
If only I was a subgenius, I could afford to live in a good neighborhood

684
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,020
All the things I could do if I was yeti and hellbent

685
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,020
I could send my kids to college, and it wouldn't cost me one damn cent

686
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,000
Damn, I wish I was a subgenius

687
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,920
My wife and I, we're down on our luck, we're really starting to sink

688
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,600
They sent my local subgenius slack helpline

689
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,780
You ain't white, you are pink

690
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:03,160
Oh, how I tried to get a job, and a diploma I had with pride

691
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,820
The post office man laughed and said

692
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:08,340
You're not yeti enough to even qualify

693
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,620
Damn, I wish I was a subgenius

694
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:15,340
I took a civil service exam and passed it without shame

695
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,020
A subgenius took one next to me

696
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:19,860
And couldn't even write his own name

697
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,880
The subgenius got the job, now he's government top brass

698
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:26,720
He couldn't qualify for a trash truck

699
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,700
And I'm out in the street, on my ass

700
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,580
Damn, I wish I was a subgenius

701
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:37,460
If I was Reverend Ivan Stang, I'd be nobody's slob

702
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,160
Buying $5,000 computers

703
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,180
That subgenius hasn't even got a job

704
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:46,300
If I was G. Gordon Gordon, then I wouldn't have to think

705
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,700
I could run for president and paint the White House pink

706
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:52,980
Damn, I wish I was a subgenius

707
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:56,700
If I was of yeti genes, then I could trace my kin

708
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:00,960
To a pair of horny snow beasts and a dozen prairie squid

709
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:06,400
If I was only a subgenius, I could stand proud in this life

710
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,260
I could eat high off the hog, just me and my yeti wife

711
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,320
Damn, I wish I was a subgenius

712
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:17,540
Things are supposed to be segregated, but things are a little off key

713
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,680
Hell, I can't even find a normal job, and I'm not even a subgenius

714
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:21,260
I can't even find a normal who's not too shy to pee

715
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,280
It ain't that I don't like a subgenius

716
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:26,500
If I rubbed you wrong by chance

717
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:30,480
Then take a look at that mistletoe hanging on the seat of my pants

718
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,540
Damn, I wish I was a subgenius

719
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,440
If I was some weirdo freak, I could be just like Sterno

720
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,840
And burn down the whole damn pink earth

721
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:42,260
In a terrible, blazing inferno

722
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,740
I could have me a hate march on the streets of Dallas, Texas

723
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,600
I could tear up the whole damn city

724
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:51,640
And make love with the exests

725
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,040
Damn, I wish I was a subgenius

726
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,680
A lot of things in life I know

727
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,820
One thing's not too clear, though

728
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,620
Like why a weirdo can call me a pink

729
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:06,220
But I can't call a subgenius a weirdo

730
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,760
If I was a big ugly subgenius, I could ring a bell

731
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:13,740
I could be sphinx drumming, and party, in subgenius hell

732
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,880
Damn, I wish I was a subgenius

733
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,680
If I was a yetikin, and I could be some other finger- они

734
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:19,680


735
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:19,680


736
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:18,920
eno

737
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:26,180
seven feet tall and lean, maybe I'd be Reverend Snavely, rich beyond my dreams. If I was only

738
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:32,700
yeti skinned, I could have my prairie squid in bed and on the weekends, launch Arnold Palmer's head.

739
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:35,460
Damn, I wish I was a subgenius.

740
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,880
Reverend Lagoon was buried in Philadelphia with class,

741
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:48,480
face down in his box so the bobbies could kiss his ass. If I was only a subgenius,

742
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:53,780
I'd live high up on a hill, selling frop and prostitutes, popping all kinds of pills.

743
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:59,160
Now take the church of the subgenius, they can hold the bibles and raise all kinds of hell.

744
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:06,320
Let the normal start to talk and they'll all wind up in jail. Damn, I wish I was a subgenius.

745
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:10,700
I dreamed my life was over. I heard Jehovah One say,

746
00:34:11,220 --> 00:34:15,700
today we're taking only subgeniuses. You gotta go the other way.

747
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,280
Then I heard the devil,

748
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,820
he said I heard what Jehovah One had to say. But I'm sorry to tell you son, today in hell is subgenius day.

749
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:30,560
Damn, don't you wish you were a subgenius?

750
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,860
Johnny Rip, and all that you believe.

751
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:39,400
You fought all the way, Johnny Rip, Johnny Rip. Yeah, you fought all the way, Johnny Rip.

752
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:46,760
You fought all the way, Johnny Rip, Johnny Rip. You fought all the way, Johnny Rip.

753
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:48,460
Oh, yeah.

754
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:55,680
Yes, I wished I was a subgenius by Jesus. Yes, that's our first little tape piece there by

755
00:34:56,500 --> 00:35:03,040
Reverend Jesus H. Christ de Valaqua, the new business manager here at the church of the subgenius.

756
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:07,140
Let's have a hand for, a big hand for Jesus. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.

757
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,920
Oh, and friends now, DK Jones.

758
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:10,340
Hello, Joe.

759
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,120
Reverend DK Jones is not a preaching man by nature.

760
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,440
Reverend DK Jones is a musical artist.

761
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:18,460


762
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,360
He's a great anti-musical man.

763
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:24,380
But I want to testify tonight to the power of that man, Bob.

764
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:37,440
Sixteen years ago, dear friends, I was in Texas, and a man named the Reverend Stevie Hambone showed me that face, that grin and face of Bob.

765
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,600
And it caught my eye, and it caught me by the back of the head.

766
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:46,880
And I copied down that P.O. Box number, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

767
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:54,440
And dear friends, up to that time, I thought I had plenty for me.

768
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:57,020
I had that conspiracy money.

769
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,020
I had that conspiracy job working nine to five.

770
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:03,580
I had that sports car, friends, that made it an American sports car.

771
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,560
But did that do it?

772
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:08,100
It didn't mean shit, dear friends.

773
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:10,080
It didn't mean shit to me. You know why?

774
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,100
Because I was missing something in my life.

775
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:14,920
You know what I was missing?

776
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:15,800
Bob!

777
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,180
That's right.

778
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:17,820
Bob!

779
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,500
Bob!

780
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,100
It was Bob!

781
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,180
You know what Bob is?

782
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,480
Bob is the original band, mother fucker, children.

783
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,160
Samuel L. Jackson ain't got nothing on Bob!

784
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,920
Bob was the man that gave the Jones to D.K. Jones.

785
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:40,540
He made huge voodoo huge!

786
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,120
He gave a grand to Bruce Grant over here.

787
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,600
He made wetlands wet, dear friends.

788
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:46,380
You know why?

789
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,340
Because Bob's a sex gun!

790
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:52,780
Bob is a sex gun!

791
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:57,220
Not just that, but Bob is sex.

792
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,460
Bob's all encompassing sex.

793
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,160
Bob's got more wives than anybody in the country and he still makes it on the fuck honey every night!

794
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,940
That's Bob!

795
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,140
What's his name?

796
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,260
Bob!

797
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:13,440
Fucking right!

798
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,600
Who is Bob?

799
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,160
I said it!

800
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:17,360
Bob!

801
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,300
Bob!

802
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:19,120
Bob!

803
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,760
Huh!

804
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,360
Bob!

805
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:31,220
hu hu!

806
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:31,380
Bob!

807
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:31,980
Bob!

808
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,440
Bob!

809
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:33,960
Bob!

810
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:34,480
Bob!

811
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,140
Bob!

812
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,060
Bob!

813
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,840
Bob!

814
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,360
Bob!

815
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:50,940
Yes, friends, D.K. Jones, rats.

816
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,400
It's true, D.K. Jones, not...

817
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,220
Oh, wait a minute.

818
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:02,000
It's been a long time since I've seen that face up big and close like that.

819
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:03,380
River and Stan will tell you.

820
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:04,460
He's going to tell you later.

821
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,760
He's scared of Bob.

822
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,980
Do you think Bob's your friend?

823
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,200
Do you think Bob's your savior?

824
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:13,440
Bob don't give a fuck about your sins, girls and boys.

825
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:16,060
Bob has come to justify your sins.

826
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,160
And he's going to come again and again and again to justify your sins.

827
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,220
That's because he's Bob.

828
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:23,940
What is it?

829
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,120
Damn right.

830
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:29,700
It's Bob.

831
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,180
It's Bob.

832
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,820
Tell him, River.

833
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,900
Who you got talking?

834
00:38:36,920 --> 00:38:37,400
Talk it.

835
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:38,940
Talk it.

836
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:44,800
Yes, friends, it's D.K. Jones and Huge Voodoo at the Wetlands nightclub there in New York City

837
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,760
a couple of months ago in February.

838
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,160
An amazing revival.

839
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:55,800
They're performing in front of one of the prettiest big rear view video projection screens

840
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:58,000
that I've ever had the pleasure of dealing with.

841
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:03,080
And, yes, friends, it was a righteous and holy, holy revival.

842
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:07,680
One of these days I'll have to read from the negative review that was in New York Magazine.

843
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,440
That was just ridiculous.

844
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,560
And what did we have coming up next?

845
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,620
Ah, b-b-b-b-b...

846
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:25,600
I-a want to join Islamic jihad

847
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:28,780
I-a just want to kill for God

848
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,660
Praising Allah is the law for me

849
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,900
All you spy coms, what the fuck?

850
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:37,960
What?

851
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,080
Killing a Hebrew brings good luck

852
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:45,040
Gotta make the old man proud of me

853
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:49,320
Load a car with dynamite

854
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,400
And drive into a synagogue without any brakes

855
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,400
Nothing could be better than

856
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,620
Impaling your intestines on a big rusty stake

857
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:03,000
And grenades and cattle prods

858
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,720
Let's go out and kill for Bob

859
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:09,620
I can hear Mohamed calling me

860
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,600
A subgenius tape

861
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,620
But we'll have the real thing soon enough

862
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:52,360
So, uh, you know, wait until you hear

863
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,140
The version of Shock for Livin'

864
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:56,680
Geatomy combined with Mission Impossible

865
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:58,600
On next week's show

866
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:03,200
Oh, the Koran seems quite odd

867
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:05,360
I still want to kill

868
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:05,960
For Bob

869
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,940
Praising Jesus is the lie for me

870
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:14,020
A fuck of them pagans

871
00:41:14,020 --> 00:41:15,540
They're such cynics

872
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,460
Let's bomb the abortion clinic

873
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,120
Jesse Helms, hey, is my cup of tea

874
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:26,700
Never thought I'd make it big myself

875
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:29,460
And got two idiots on cable TV

876
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,500
What the fuck, it's not cheap

877
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:35,360
But still a better way to use my business degree

878
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:39,880
Use the rifle, spare the rod

879
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,980
Let's go out and butt-butt Bob

880
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:46,960
Baby Jesus, hand that gun to me

881
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:04,360
I'm a slut, that's just the way it is

882
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,780
I like it

883
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:10,540
Oh, I love the world

884
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:12,860
It's all a joke and I've got a sense of humor

885
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,100
You know when Wavy says

886
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:16,180
If you lose your sense of humor, it's not funny

887
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,600
I'm a slut, that's just the way it is

888
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,420
Here's an example

889
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,620
I like rock and roll

890
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,600
I like jazz

891
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,660
I like country and western

892
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:33,480
I like the blues and tribal chants and choirs

893
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,200
I like fast music

894
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,300
I like slow music

895
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,620
Holy fuck, I'll listen to disco

896
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:42,360
I'm a slut, I'll listen to anything

897
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,020
Right here, in this world

898
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,360
Right here in the midst of this

899
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,120
I'll just enjoy myself

900
00:42:52,120 --> 00:42:55,780
I'm just a slut, that's just the way it is

901
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:03,260
I never had any favorites

902
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:04,980
I like Jesus

903
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,760
I like Moses

904
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,440
I like the force

905
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,660
I like the Buddha

906
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,180
I like Atlantis

907
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:13,400
I like the great spirit

908
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,620
I like the higher mind

909
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,360
I like spirit guides

910
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:19,080
I'm a slut, I'll pray to anything

911
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,080
I'm a slut, that's just the way it is

912
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:27,700
I'm not saving myself for anything

913
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:28,960
Okay?

914
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:32,540
I'm gonna use it all up

915
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:36,840
All those stops go nowhere

916
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:37,600
Until I'm my alma mater

917
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:44,620
I'll stay at my soul´s마 2020

918
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,460
I like rock and I like jazz

919
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:46,940
I get all the ballad I love

920
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:58,040
I love my Philippines

921
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,380
I love the atmosphere

922
00:43:59,380 --> 00:43:59,380


923
00:43:59,380 --> 00:43:59,460
I love everyร♡

924
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:29,400
We'll see you next time.

925
00:44:54,380 --> 00:44:59,180
We'll see you next time.

926
00:45:17,140 --> 00:45:20,540
We'll see you next time.

927
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:41,080
We'll see you next time.

928
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:29,000
We'll see you next time.

929
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:46,520
We'll see you next time.

930
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:16,860
We'll see you next time.

931
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:30,460
We'll see you next time.

932
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:05,560
We'll see you next time.

933
00:48:30,060 --> 00:48:30,860
We'll see you next time.

934
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,320
We'll see you next time.

935
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:41,640
We'll see you next time.

936
00:50:00,820 --> 00:50:02,140
We'll see you next time.

937
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:29,980
We'll see you next time.

938
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,220
We'll see you next time.

939
00:51:09,100 --> 00:51:13,840
We'll see you next time.

940
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:20,840
We'll see you next time.

941
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,560
and the alien sex workers.

942
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:35,040
Oh, I love to be naked.

943
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:38,460
That's what they all really want.

944
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,900
But the Gilly Bobs, they've got their hands up.

945
00:51:40,940 --> 00:51:42,180
They want something for nothing.

946
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,580
They think Bob has something to do with slackers or something.

947
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:47,660
And they're non-members.

948
00:51:47,740 --> 00:51:50,560
We might be able to get a few of them to empty their wallets and join up,

949
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,400
but most of them have no clue.

950
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,560
But we need them anyway,

951
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,940
because on that fateful day, X-Day,

952
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,040
when the normals are all, like,

953
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:03,120
striding pink boy hell,

954
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,320
we need somebody to pick on,

955
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:07,200
so the Bobbies will come in handy for that.

956
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,740
Because X-Days are coming,

957
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,460
and the pinks are bombing.

958
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,200
Ah!

959
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:26,560
Blaze Bob! Blaze Bob! Blaze Bob!

960
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,120
Yeah!

961
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:31,120
Of course, here comes my favorite sort of Bob.

962
00:52:31,260 --> 00:52:32,380
It's the Buy Me Bobs.

963
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:34,100
They've got product to sell,

964
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:35,820
but they're also willing to buy product.

965
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:38,160
Most of you hopefully fall into this category.

966
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:43,300
And that's why you're going to be interested in the amazing section coming up now,

967
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,080
the section where we give you the post office boxes to write to

968
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:50,280
to get information on copies of these amazing tapes

969
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,540
by these amazing subgenius artists.

970
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,120
Going backwards in time,

971
00:52:56,220 --> 00:52:57,640
rewinding in our brains,

972
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:58,360
as one might say,

973
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:58,880
that was...

974
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:01,080
what we last heard was Bill T. Miller,

975
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,480
the King of Slack,

976
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:05,400
preaching about used Slack and Gimme Bobs

977
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,980
live at the Slack Crusade Devival in Boston

978
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:11,860
at the Middle East Club.

979
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:12,480
And friends,

980
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,880
the easy way to get the information

981
00:53:14,880 --> 00:53:17,940
on Kings of Feedback,

982
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:19,040
Out of Band Experience,

983
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:20,860
and Bill T. Miller's material

984
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,360
is just call.

985
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:23,720
This is a phone number.

986
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,040
Call 617-LICK.

987
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:29,860
O-B-E.

988
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,060
That's 617-LICK.

989
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,200
O-B-E.

990
00:53:36,540 --> 00:53:38,180
Ah, yes, and friends,

991
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,720
before that we heard a little bit of preaching.

992
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,560
And we'll hear some more from Reverend Velveteen Sly

993
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,800
and the mighty Heidi and Spring Herbage

994
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:48,120
at the Slack Crusade Tour of the Bible

995
00:53:48,120 --> 00:53:49,680
in Madison, Wisconsin.

996
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,160
Yes, hello to our listeners there at W-O-R-T.

997
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:58,020
The slaves of the devilish Reverend Velveteen Sly.

998
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:58,020


999
00:53:58,020 --> 00:53:59,040
And before that, friends,

1000
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:01,500
that song called I'm a Slut.

1001
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,360
Now that's something else, now ain't it?

1002
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,120
That was by R. Moon

1003
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,160
and the new Improved Night Nurses.

1004
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,920
A brand new tape from them.

1005
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:11,840
And you can get that information

1006
00:54:11,840 --> 00:54:13,940
from Holy Funk.

1007
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,220
That's Holy Funk Records.

1008
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:18,180
Just write to Holy Funk

1009
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:21,720
at P.O. Box 2329.

1010
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:23,020
That's it.

1011
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:24,600
P.O. Box 2329.

1012
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:27,800
San Anselmo, California.

1013
00:54:28,540 --> 00:54:31,120
San Anselmo, California.

1014
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,780
9-4-9-7-9.

1015
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:36,620
San Anselmo, California.

1016
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:38,060
9-4-9-7-9.

1017
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:40,520
And between that,

1018
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,680
we heard Dr. Bizarro.

1019
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:45,100
Yes, you thought it was Frank Zappa,

1020
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,780
but it's Dr. Bizarro

1021
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,300
from his rock opera,

1022
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,700
The Big Machine.

1023
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:53,820
And he's got tons of tapes.

1024
00:54:53,940 --> 00:54:56,560
And you can get those from iBob.

1025
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:58,000
That's iBob.

1026
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:58,100
That's iBob.

1027
00:54:58,380 --> 00:55:02,840
At Post Office Box 3405.

1028
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:04,820
Skokie, Illinois.

1029
00:55:05,520 --> 00:55:06,620
Skokie, Illinois.

1030
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:08,900
3405.

1031
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,160
Skokie, Illinois.

1032
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:12,440
6-00-76.

1033
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:15,780
6-00-76.

1034
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,720
And we heard some bootleg

1035
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:19,640
Joe Newman

1036
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,280
and Rudy Schwartz Project

1037
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,740
combined with Colonel Sphinx,

1038
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,300
Drummond, and the Swinging Love Corpses.

1039
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:27,640
Wait until you hear what more of that we shall have.

1040
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:30,000
And you can always get Joe Newman's CDs

1041
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,620
by referring to

1042
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:35,940
Box 4542.

1043
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:38,660
Box 4542.

1044
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:39,580
Box 4542.

1045
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:41,620
And it's fortuitous

1046
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:44,040
that it is in Austin, Texas.

1047
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:46,320
Where we just returned

1048
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,220
from a great crusade ourselves.

1049
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:50,620
78765.

1050
00:55:53,200 --> 00:55:53,440
78765.

1051
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,720
For Joe Newman there.

1052
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,880
And, oh,

1053
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,000
yeah.

1054
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,000


1055
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,000


1056
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:58,000


1057
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,060
Yes, and this is Doctors for Bob in the background.

1058
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,420
We have also heard some cosmic triad

1059
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,200
from Reverend Emot Zipol

1060
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:05,480
in our backgrounds.

1061
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,620
And, oh, I think I forgot

1062
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:09,880
one other little P.O. box.

1063
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,860
Now, didn't I?

1064
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,420
You got a pencil?

1065
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,480
Who's got a pencil?

1066
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:17,280
Write it down, children.

1067
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:18,460
Bob!

1068
00:56:19,020 --> 00:56:22,720
Post Office Box 140306.

1069
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:24,160
Dallas, Texas.

1070
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,060
75214.

1071
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:27,840
That's where you gotta send

1072
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:28,400
that dollar.

1073
00:56:39,460 --> 00:56:40,360
All right.

1074
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:42,380
So, we can help you.

1075
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,360
Stop thinking so much.

1076
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,860
Stop trying to be a genius.

1077
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,380
Just kick back and be a sub-genius.

1078
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,920
Sub-genius.

1079
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,480
Yeah.

1080
00:56:50,520 --> 00:56:51,400
Doesn't that sound good?

1081
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,440
I like the way that sounds.

1082
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:53,280
Oh, yeah.

1083
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:56,300
But how does somebody turn into a,

1084
00:56:56,300 --> 00:56:57,300
from a genius

1085
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:57,820
into a genius?

1086
00:56:57,820 --> 00:56:58,560
Into a sub-genius.

1087
00:56:58,560 --> 00:56:59,880
Well, we have a special cure

1088
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:01,120
that comes from Bob.

1089
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:03,200
What we do is we take

1090
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,680
a little bit of these elements here

1091
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,120
and look into all the stuff

1092
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:07,360
that's bugging you every day.

1093
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:08,600
You can put it together,

1094
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:09,820
mix it all up.

1095
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,960
Bob will help transform it

1096
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,920
and you'll have the substance you need

1097
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:16,140
that will make you immune

1098
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:17,900
to those conspiracy.

1099
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,500
All those components together

1100
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:23,080
are gonna sort of neutralize each other,

1101
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:23,360
you mean?

1102
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:24,400
Kind of like one of them there.

1103
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:25,880
Homeopathic remedies?

1104
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:26,400
Oh, yeah.

1105
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:27,620
It's a homeopath.

1106
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:28,160
It's a homeopathic remedy.

1107
00:57:28,280 --> 00:57:29,660
Right here in Madison, Wisconsin.

1108
00:57:29,660 --> 00:57:32,000
We can mix up the homeopathic remedy.

1109
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:32,640
You know what it's called?

1110
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,700
Tell me, sister.

1111
00:57:34,860 --> 00:57:35,540
Tell me, Reverend.

1112
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:36,140
I need to know.

1113
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:37,860
If I block that brain thinking too much,

1114
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:38,980
it's brain-o.

1115
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:40,100
Brain-o.

1116
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:41,580
Good Lord, man.

1117
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,840
Yes, sir.

1118
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,920
I'm the guy that has my legal notices in advance

1119
00:57:52,920 --> 00:57:54,380
and permission to contact.

1120
00:57:54,460 --> 00:57:55,840
You have permission to serve me

1121
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,560
after you practice your business.

1122
00:57:57,820 --> 00:58:00,260
So I'm Dr. Golankowicz's incident.

1123
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,180
And I'm the guy that a center for,

1124
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:03,540
let's see,

1125
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:05,460
Dr. Vendicronology

1126
00:58:05,460 --> 00:58:06,680
that produced my evidence.

1127
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:07,340
I was having trouble

1128
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:09,460
with the center for Clemency Police.

1129
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,140
They got spattered.

1130
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:12,760
The big shoe on campus.

1131
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:14,680
They had orders to give me the keys to the zoo

1132
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,180
and accept my position

1133
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,040
and liaison to law enforcement.

1134
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,220
The guy I can't remember

1135
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,640
what college he went to.

1136
00:58:22,660 --> 00:58:25,240
Then I'm entitled to free base,

1137
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:26,820
explorer base.

1138
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:27,800
I got the $150,000.

1139
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,440
I was on 32nd Street.

1140
00:58:28,680 --> 00:58:29,580
Poleste Ball.

1141
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,580
That, before I moved in here,

1142
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:33,820
had the keys to my property in the early 80s.

1143
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:35,020
And they had my bail and bond

1144
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:37,320
and my right to explore base.

1145
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,980
And they stole it.

1146
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:40,200
And enough for my friends.

1147
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,520
And what this address was about.

1148
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,680
I had my bail and bond here.

1149
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,720
And I had to pay for the property myself eventually.

1150
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:46,740
Again.

1151
00:58:48,220 --> 00:58:48,700
Um...

1152
00:58:50,920 --> 00:58:53,580
And now the climax of our show.

1153
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:57,420
The Pope of Berea, Ohio.

1154
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:01,020
Lou Ducey.

1155
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,800
The Pope of Berea, Ohio.

1156
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,080
And his friend, I'm not sure who it is,

1157
01:00:00,140 --> 01:00:01,300
doing their, um,

1158
01:00:01,820 --> 01:00:02,300
uh,

1159
01:00:03,420 --> 01:00:05,040
sympho-flatulation suite.

1160
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:06,840
Uh, yeah.

1161
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,740
Uh, thank you.

1162
01:00:17,020 --> 01:00:17,920
And good night.

1163
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,000
Or good morning.
