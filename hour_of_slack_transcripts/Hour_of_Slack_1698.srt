1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
And welcome to the show with the squeaky chair.

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:05,820
Ah, yes.

3
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,680
But we don't need that spooky music yet.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:11,900
No.

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,620
Because it's a light-hearted show tonight.

6
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,140
We're going to be talking about hell and death and rebirth and so forth.

7
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:24,400
Because, well, number one, friends, I should say,

8
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,320
welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,860
Our of slack.

10
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,000
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:39,480
Ah, yes, dear friends.

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:45,060
It's me, Reverend Stang, around Halloween of 2018.

13
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,500
The world is too much with me again, so we've got to do a rerun.

14
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:56,320
Now, this one was suggested by a longtime listener who has caught on

15
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,180
that we get so little feedback

16
00:00:59,180 --> 00:00:59,980
that if somebody says,

17
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,300
if somebody requests something old, I'll dig it up

18
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:05,900
because we're just happy they remember something well enough to ask for it.

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:10,140
So the upcoming was originally

20
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,020
Our of Slack number 414.

21
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:19,420
414 from the year of 1993,

22
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,800
25 years ago.

23
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,540
But it's strangely perfectly timely

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,900
because it's about life and death,

25
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,920
and especially death.

26
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,260
And this year and last year

27
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:38,620
have been real, real bad years

28
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:41,580
for some of our old friends and loved ones

29
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,560
and some not so old.

30
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,480
I now, friends,

31
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,620
I officially hate incurable, chronic, crippling, painful diseases

32
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:58,560
far more than I hate the entire conspiracy of humans.

33
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,720
And that's some serious,

34
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,880
bloody hate with a capital H.

35
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,760
And they both have something in common.

36
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,280
They're mindless.

37
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:08,660
And yet, they're plowing through us

38
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:10,760
just because we're outnumbered.

39
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,920
So we have to stick together, friends.

40
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,980
I forgive everybody for everything,

41
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,420
and I hope they forgive me.

42
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,960
I just can't forgive the diseases

43
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:28,580
or the mindless conspiracy of childish, vengeful pinks.

44
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:45,000
Anyway, this show is largely me as a baby reading stuff just freshly written from our second Bible, Revelation X, before it was edited and pared down by half.

45
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:54,740
So there's some old school subgenius doctrine revealed in this show that never saw the light of day again until now.

46
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:06,240
So let the calendar pages fall away as we go back, back, back to the year of 1993.

47
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:15,200
I sound a lot younger in this old tape and faster but you'll see some things have not changed at all.

48
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,060
Praise that man, Bob.

49
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,440
We didn't really have time to edit tapes tonight.

50
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:33,160
I could just play music, but anything I picked you'd think was too normal and old-timey.

51
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:39,300
And to play a lot of subgenius tapes, I have to pre-screen them first, you know,

52
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,960
and that usually takes up about half of my Sunday.

53
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,720
It's my preacher's job.

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,900
And that's fine. I love doing it.

55
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:50,740
And it's a good break from the pressures of working on this book.

56
00:03:52,780 --> 00:03:53,820
More book?

57
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:55,920
Young lady?

58
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,760
Yeah, this book we're trying to finish a year late.

59
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,100
Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon.

60
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:06,320
But last week, last week, friends.

61
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,380
No, I've got to put the scary music back on.

62
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:13,420
Last week, Simon and Schuster called the publishers, my editor,

63
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:23,940
and she said that I have to have the text totally finished, chopped down and proofread.

64
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:26,220
In 30 days.

65
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,940
30 days, my friends.

66
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,260
30 Days

67
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:49,140
30 Days

68
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:53,860
Has September, April, June, and...

69
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,580
Cal...

70
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:55,280
Formal...

71
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,040


72
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,040


73
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,040


74
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,280
Power...

75
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:57,960


76
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:57,960


77
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:58,220
Cyber...

78
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:58,220


79
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:03,340
I remember I killed it when aόrith himself was walking down the street.

80
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,880
Well, I can say, my son, W pens have two questions.

81
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:04,880


82
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:04,880


83
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:04,880


84
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:04,880


85
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,720
Me porully la autó ill mom, and he's and I?

86
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:08,980


87
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,820
So, can't you doές call me?

88
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:15,160
Ehheh Princip Недоmoчинг

89
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,000
Oh.

90
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,500
On Eng.

91
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:16,500


92
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,780
So birthday party what...?

93
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:22,320
Oh yeah, Dad.

94
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,380
It's probably my birthday next year.

95
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:29,720
There was a time when I did believe that

96
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:33,220
I could recall every day I'd live

97
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:37,840
But then that joyride became a landslide

98
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,320
And I got buried alive in here

99
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,620
I used to wake up angels each morning

100
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,260
Time it was nothing I'd ever want to kill

101
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:53,800
But now the first day of every month's just

102
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,500
Another paycheck, no budget bills

103
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,400
For thirty days I am a prisoner

104
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:05,940
In thirty days I'm an escapee

105
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:09,420
For I shall tunnel out of all this trouble

106
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,460
I shall be free in thirty days

107
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,400
Well it's been a bad month my friend

108
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,620
And last month was not so hot either

109
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:31,540
The wind got knocked out of my life

110
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,320
And I don't want to fight

111
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,540
I just want, I just want to breathe

112
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,760
Yeah, yeah, yeah

113
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah

114
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,760
So God created the earth and heaven

115
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,400
In only seven days they say

116
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:17,760
And on that seventh day he rested

117
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,240
But I don't know how to say

118
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,440
I heard it another way

119
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,600
I heard that he got drunk and lonely

120
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,340
Created trouble left town alone

121
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,900
These thirty days he shoots out the full moon

122
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,640
Just to remind us we're on our own

123
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:41,480
For thirty days past September

124
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:45,460
And I could use a day or two

125
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,700
For lots of mystery

126
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,220
I shall remember

127
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:49,220


128
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:51,420
Without a clue

129
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:52,520
For thirty days

130
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,840
It's not some mystery

131
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,600
I shall remember

132
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,600
30 days, thirty days

133
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,740
30 days

134
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,940
Yeah yeah yeah

135
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,740
30 days

136
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,720
Thirty days

137
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,560
Now when I think about it all

138
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:14,720
Oh, thirty days

139
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,840
Thirty days

140
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,680
Thirty days

141
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,740
I'm gonna think about it all for 30 days.

142
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,720
30 days.

143
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,940
30 days.

144
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:25,880
30 days.

145
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,780
30 days.

146
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:27,940
Hey!

147
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:39,820
Well, that was the Rainmakers.

148
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,760
Love that band, the Rainmakers.

149
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,300
And that's how I felt all week.

150
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,940
So, starting yesterday, I went to hell.

151
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,600
And decided to finish the hell chapter by Tuesday night.

152
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,560
This Tuesday night.

153
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:57,760
So that I can whack the UFOs chapter together by Thursday.

154
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,620
And then the epistles and appendix.

155
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,000
And then I'll have three weeks to finish the rewrites and touch-ups of the other 400 pages.

156
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:10,580
That will take them back down to 200 pages.

157
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,840
Ah, yes.

158
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:17,400
And actually, I got most of that hell chapter done since yesterday.

159
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:17,800
Okay.

160
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:17,800


161
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,260
So, guess what you're stuck with, friends?

162
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:21,720
No, I'm not gonna read the whole night.

163
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,880
I did manage to find some remarkably apropos bits of tape without even looking too hard.

164
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,500
Thanks, Will, for helping.

165
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,940
But let us read here.

166
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:37,720
And this is, shall be, this perfect time to read this particular material.

167
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,360
Because a lot of it was originally written for the spoken word, preacher material.

168
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,360
And has not yet been alofteized, shall we say.

169
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:54,360
It has not been turned into the written subgenius form whereby you use a thesaurus and add big words and remove apostrophes.

170
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,060
But it is chapter 9.

171
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:00,940
Heaven and hell.

172
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:04,020
The realms of death and the before life.

173
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:07,980
And hints on living like there's no tomorrow.

174
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:17,020
This, by the way, folks, is based on extrapolations and direct revelations from the incomplete Dobbs Inferno manuscript.

175
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,580
Translated from the original tongue of the dead.

176
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:32,260
Dictated by the tormented earthbound lower half of the spirit of J.R. Bob Dobbs through Transmedium X.

177
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:44,320
The music, by the way, in the background right now is the great Reverend Dr. J. Condom on his Zombo Frothland album.

178
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:46,900
Music to pee by.

179
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,660
I can't remember what the exact title of it is.

180
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,720
It's in your catalog, okay?

181
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,300
And, of course, every chapter we start off with quotes.

182
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:56,980
Lofty type quotes and apropos things.

183
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,960
And there's always too many of them.

184
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:00,920
I have to cut most of these.

185
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:06,720
In fact, a lot of what you'll be hearing will be changed by the time it comes out in fall 94.

186
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,120
Yes, the fall 94 catalog.

187
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,300
That's right, Virgil, said Dobbs.

188
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:15,800
Loosening his collar.

189
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,720
It is getting rather hot in here.

190
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,240
And as Dr. Kataydin Legume, the evil Dr. Legume, said,

191
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,640
The best way to buy your way into heaven using...

192
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,480
The best...

193
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,900
No, let me take two.

194
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,140
The best thing to do is buy your way into heaven using somebody else's soul.

195
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,680
And buy your way out using somebody else's soul.

196
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,060
And keep your own in your pocket at all times.

197
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,540
And as the great Reverend Sheldon DeWeer said,

198
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,440
The difference between heaven and hell is which end of the pitchfork you're on.

199
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,360
Yep, yep.

200
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:03,260
And as Bob said in his diary at age 15,

201
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:12,700
I choose to believe in an afterlife only because it is too horrible to believe that such a cool stud as myself could be allowed to disappear from the universe.

202
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,260
And he also said,

203
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,580
This line was printing out just when my daughter's guest was looking at the computer.

204
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,220
Bob said,

205
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:26,580
I walked into hell the minute I stepped out of my ma's...

206
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,540
Uh, ma.

207
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,440
We'll just say ma, I guess.

208
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,740
To hell and back.

209
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,420
Death, rebirth, and the before life.

210
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,100
It could happen any time, friend.

211
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:36,980
Any time.

212
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,240
Just walking in the garden, you could suddenly die.

213
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,040
A branch might crack overhead and fall straight down, tip first.

214
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,300
Spear in the top.

215
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,140
Top of your head, exactly.

216
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:52,740
All the way down into your ribcage and destroying so much of your brain so suddenly that you'd never know what hit you.

217
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,540
And you'd think you were still walking down that trail.

218
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,180
And you'd hear a noise and turn and see your friend crying over your own impaled body.

219
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,440
And that's when you'd realize that you were a ghost.

220
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:09,900
Or a meteor could plunge from space and crush you.

221
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,280
Now!

222
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,160
Right now!

223
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,580
Right now!

224
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,300
Would you be ready?

225
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,680
Would you be ready, my friend?

226
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,280
If it happened?

227
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,040
In the instant you finish hearing this sentence.

228
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,980
Oh, but don't worry about the death of the body.

229
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:29,760
Leaving the meat shell is roughly the equivalent of taking off your shoes.

230
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,460
But you're not supposed to really know that.

231
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:39,280
From the grand evolutionary point of view, it would greatly impede the survival of the species.

232
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:43,600
If we all knew, we could just jump off a bridge and suddenly be...

233
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:52,140
beautiful, immortal souls, free of debt, in a wonderful heaven of telepathy and love and infinite joy.

234
00:13:53,780 --> 00:14:03,660
And yet, we've all heard stories from people who were clinically dead and had these near-death, out-of-the-body experiences just before they were resuscitated on a hospital table.

235
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:12,560
And in most cases, they entered a tunnel of light, leading to the shades of their deceased loved ones.

236
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,580
And a great deal of light was lost.

237
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,660
But the light of love was at the center of the universe.

238
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:21,460
A few felt the flames of hell licking at them.

239
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:27,760
Now, both of these lovely afterlives glimpsed during temporary death are real,

240
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:34,820
but are designed only for those who are already fated to return to life and report back.

241
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:43,400
Oh, by the way, this footnote here says that another misleading phenomenon used to prove an afterlife are the so-called phone calls from the dead.

242
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,600
And spirit voices at seances.

243
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:54,060
And the deal is that the dead are allowed to make one telephone call, and only one, after they've passed through the gates of the hereafter.

244
00:14:54,940 --> 00:15:00,760
But anyway, those particular kinds of afterlives that people come back from the dead having glimpsed,

245
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:09,280
those are merely a ruse, a red herring, a hallucination, programmed into our genetic structure to throw us off the scent.

246
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:13,560
A Wotan-implanted mental movie projector is true.

247
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:17,840
Triggered at the time of death to show this racial acid trip,

248
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:25,240
so that the human race will always be hearing fairly plausible stories suggesting some sort of god and devil.

249
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:29,320
But it's strictly for propaganda purposes.

250
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,380
It's not even put there as a kindness.

251
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:40,620
It's as a rollercoaster ride, as a reward after all the tedious rigamarole of living and the usual pain of dying.

252
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,680
What you find out too late.

253
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,560
Just as you find out too late.

254
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:52,500
Just as you're nearing that white light, is that it is really the headlights of an etheric Mack truck bearing down on you at 90 miles an hour.

255
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:59,180
And it's the last second before the ultra-dimensional truck hits you that makes the gods laugh the hardest.

256
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,840
The minute you suddenly realize that you've been tricked and are about to be killed again.

257
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,300
And that's what happens if you aren't resurrected pretty quick.

258
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,900
Each time that truck smashes you, you're reborn with amnesia.

259
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,280
Again, floating towards that bright.

260
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,500
Oncoming light.

261
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:20,480
And every time you end up remembering what that light really is, an instant too late.

262
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:26,620
Why this cruel, elaborate trick on poor, pathetic dead folks?

263
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:30,700
It's because God isn't trying to create something.

264
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,800
He's trying to recreate nothing.

265
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,340
Even God doesn't know where everything came from or how to get rid of it.

266
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,320
No, just kidding.

267
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:43,260
Friends, Bob wouldn't let God do that to you.

268
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:52,060
In reality, every time you fully die, you get to go from one universe to another.

269
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:56,480
Let me find some lovely reincarnation-type music.

270
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:02,040
Yes, you go from one universe to another.

271
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:08,000
They start you off, however, in the before life, which is like eternal paradise.

272
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,340
To kind of get you off on the right foot.

273
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,460
And then all of a sudden you lose your memory.

274
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:17,260
And are born of woman onto this earthly plane.

275
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:24,600
Then, when you get old and die here, you pass on to one of the etheric universes next door.

276
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:32,500
Bob once spoke of driving past the slag heaps of Midlothian, Texas,

277
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:38,080
where the conspiracy melts down the fossilized metal skeletons of old cars

278
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,200
to make into new ones, thence themselves to die.

279
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,540
And be smelted down again.

280
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:50,980
He said that this is exactly how we experience, endlessly experience,

281
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:54,080
the eternal conveyor belt of karma.

282
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,880
The great wheelbarrow of humiliation that we call existence.

283
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:04,020
As Bob said in Transmission 47,

284
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:09,380
In my father's midway are many bumper car rides.

285
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,540
And the before life for subgeniuses is like that.

286
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:13,540


287
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:15,180
A huge carnival.

288
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,360
You'll end up on many rides for fleeting eternities.

289
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,460
One may be the roller coaster of alternating fear and joy.

290
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,600
The next might be the tunnel of love.

291
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:29,840
Hell is the ultimate spook house.

292
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:34,080
Indeed, there are so many multiple death realities

293
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,340
that there's even one where you're really dead.

294
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,840
And nothing happens.

295
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,380
And you don't exist.

296
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,500
But most people think of liars.

297
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:46,060
Life and death as only two states of being.

298
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,280
The only two states of being.

299
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,180
Actually, they are very small straws in a very large haystack.

300
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:57,720
This haystack of death lives isn't an infinite one, though.

301
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,940
There is a judgment day or splice in time

302
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,440
that serves as both the beginning and end of a big repeating loop

303
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,560
of all cause and effect.

304
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,340
And beyond all these lives and alternate universes,

305
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,900
the whole of creation is actually a vast pipe.

306
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,400
Balanced on the back of a huge cosmic horned toad.

307
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:19,940
And beneath that, an all-encompassing fiddler crab.

308
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:24,280
Nothing itself does not exist after that.

309
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,860
But there's enough afterlives, however,

310
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:32,280
that you'll get the afterlife that you really want.

311
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:37,300
That's why so many preachers can't quit talking about hell.

312
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:41,960
They try to get you all mixed up between heaven and hell.

313
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,880
The record reveals that the world is a mess.

314
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,860
That's how they can get them mixed up.

315
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,960
But the world is not mess.

316
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,080
There's got to be a curse for people who believe this story.

317
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,720
I feel that's what's so great about Paul murdered and massacred and whipped.

318
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,960
I feel that's a��

319
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:11,960
That's really dope.

320
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:12,860
Paul wasn't the

321
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,380
God, I made it. I finally made it. Did you hear? I finally made it. Glory to God.

322
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:20,600
Oh, I thank you, Lord, for thy mercy. I thank you, Lord.

323
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:23,760
Blessed be thy name. Oh, I love you, Jesus. I thank you, Lord.

324
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,280
Hallelujah. Glory to God. I made it. I made it. Hallelujah.

325
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,280
Praise God. Thank you, Lord. Hallelujah.

326
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,660
The backslider will be there in that judgment.

327
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:43,340
Though Christianity for centuries has operated on the thought

328
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:46,320
that men could walk in and out with God,

329
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,840
that they could turn back to the world and back to their sins,

330
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,460
then come back to God without any loss,

331
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,360
has led many to speculate in the most frightening way.

332
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,860
But the Bible said,

333
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:02,240
If the righteous man turn from his righteousness,

334
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,720
then all of his righteousness shall be forgotten.

335
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,120
Yes, sir.

336
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,440
The backslider.

337
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,540
Will be there in the judgment.

338
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,080
Call the next defendant.

339
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,280
Dana Dean to the bar.

340
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:36,140
Dana Dean, the record shows that in the year of your Lord, 1959,

341
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:38,640
you received the glorious glory of God.

342
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,940
You received the glorious experience of salvation.

343
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,380
Almighty God, King of kings and Lord of lords,

344
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,460
indeed, it was a glorious experience.

345
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,900
The record goes on to reveal that for many years,

346
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,900
you were a faithful servant,

347
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,800
performing your duties well.

348
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,720
Because of your faithfulness in witnessing,

349
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:59,780
many were brought into the glorious light of the gospel,

350
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:02,140
and many souls were added to the kingdom.

351
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,180
Because of your giving,

352
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:07,380
my preachers were able to circle the globe

353
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,300
with the message of salvation.

354
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,040
Sir, I gave back only part of that which was given unto me.

355
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,840
For the records to stop here, my son,

356
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:19,140
it would indeed be a wonderful story.

357
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:22,940
But these faithful records are very careful to point out

358
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,800
the darkest day in your life.

359
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,520
It is stated here that in the year of your Lord, 1973,

360
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,660
you turned your back upon your God,

361
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,620
and once more began to walk in your own way.

362
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,200
But sir, I've come back.

363
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:37,360
I've come back.

364
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,960
I've come back, sir.

365
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,200
I'm closer now than I've ever been before.

366
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,160
I've come back, sir.

367
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,580
My God, I've come back.

368
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:43,960
Yes.

369
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,880
The record shows that in the fourth watch of your life,

370
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,700
you returned to the fold.

371
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:52,220
What an awful price you must pay for your foolishness.

372
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,580
Because you turned back,

373
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,540
you have lost your reward.

374
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:01,060
You shall enter heaven as a servant without a single soul to your credit.

375
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,020
It's unfair.

376
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:05,560
It's so unfair.

377
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,360
I've worked so hard for the kingdom of God.

378
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:07,760
It's all in tears.

379
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,360
It's unfair.

380
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:10,060
I should lose all my credits now.

381
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:10,880
Oh, my.

382
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,440
You knew all of this before you backslid.

383
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,000
Show him his record.

384
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:22,660
January 3rd, 1973.

385
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:26,380
But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness,

386
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:28,000
and commiteth iniquity,

387
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:32,080
and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth,

388
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,940
shall he live?

389
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,820
All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned.

390
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:39,740
In his trespass that he hath trespassed,

391
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:41,820
and in his sin that he hath sinned,

392
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,220
in them shall he die.

393
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:48,100
This simply means that if you backslide and turn away from God,

394
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:51,400
all the rewards that you've accumulated shall be lost.

395
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,060
I just don't understand how this could happen to me.

396
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,580
August 21st, 1973.

397
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,620
You mean you aren't going to church again today?

398
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,480
Baby, don't bother me.

399
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,340
You know it's the morning of the day off.

400
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,460
I don't have to live in church to be saved.

401
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,480
Dana, if you aren't careful, you're going to miss out with the Lord's complete peace.

402
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:20,540
I ain't going to church.

403
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,960
It's my birthday, honey.

404
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,040
My son, you heard the word.

405
00:24:27,700 --> 00:24:28,680
You were warned.

406
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:32,400
Were you so foolish as you think you could outwit the law of God?

407
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:36,000
You have returned and have been saved as of by far.

408
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,340
But the glory and the splendor that could have been yours

409
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:42,080
throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity

410
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,240
is an awful price to pay.

411
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:45,760
Oh.

412
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,620
Oh, my, what a fool.

413
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,560
Oh.

414
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,000
To think that I could turn my back on God and make it on my own.

415
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,700
My God, what a fool I've been.

416
00:24:58,520 --> 00:25:00,300
How foolish can a person be?

417
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,520
Sir, I hope you haven't been the fool I've been.

418
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:02,740
Good question.

419
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,120
My God, what a fool.

420
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,180
What a fool.

421
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,680
Yes, friends, the subgenius shall be at the judgment.

422
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,720
Yes, yes, yes.

423
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,520
And, you know, it's sad.

424
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:23,300
You know, by the way, so far we've just been talking about the Christian hell and heaven.

425
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,820
And we're going to be on that for a while.

426
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:30,000
But there is, you graduate to the subgenius hell and then to the subgenius heaven.

427
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:32,560
We ain't written that part yet.

428
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,800
But, you know, we're told by people that are sometimes in the middle of the world,

429
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,060
they're going to be in tears.

430
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,900
This happens when I'm talking about Bob on somebody else's talk show.

431
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,360
Their voices will be cracking with emotion.

432
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:48,280
And they'll be saying, you're going to go to hell if you keep up this subgenius church business.

433
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:55,180
And it's because they've been shaken up pretty bad, possibly for the first time,

434
00:25:55,220 --> 00:26:04,320
by we who dare to laugh at the great, bearded, all-judging, all-non-forgiving, unlaughable.

435
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,800
The great, unlaughable.

436
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,460
Unlaughable, my friends.

437
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:11,560
And the Christian hell does exist.

438
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:14,620
And it is the lowest rung of the ladder of the four lives.

439
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,020
They aren't lying about that.

440
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:21,120
What they don't tell you is that only Christians go there.

441
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:25,300
It's a rare subgenius that ends up in the Christian hell.

442
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:35,080
The hell law, the hell law, my friends, states that hell is reserved for those who believe in it.

443
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:40,580
And the lowest level is for those who think that if they don't believe in it, they'll go there.

444
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:48,020
Hell is God's revenge on those who insulted his intelligence.

445
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:55,760
Those vain and stupid enough to think God is as simple-minded and vengeful as they are.

446
00:26:57,800 --> 00:27:03,280
God built hell only for Christians, Muslims, and others who believe in a devil.

447
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:07,660
The devil's only job, actually, is to pester them.

448
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:13,060
To milk out every drop of human faith and credence.

449
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:19,620
Satan, or Ahriman, or whatever, is a very minor deity compared to Jehovah One.

450
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:27,880
And has been bested in sexual prowess, if not in supernatural powers or demonic dominion, by none less than Bob himself.

451
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:31,580
To any subgenius dumb enough to take him seriously,

452
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:35,940
the devil is at worst a figure of negative slack.

453
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:42,840
Satan does run hell, and it's a very busy place these days.

454
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:49,500
But as far as affecting earthly life, Satan's responsibilities cover only Middle Eastern-based religions.

455
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:55,420
Jehovah One assigned the devil to create something that would really be hell on earth.

456
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:01,160
So he came up with the idea of Christianity, which he then followed up with Islam.

457
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:03,120
Jehovah One said to Satan,

458
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:09,180
We'll just let your hell on earth run randomly so the dupes will suffer and generate more pain for each other.

459
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:12,760
In the end, it won't matter whether they were good or bad in life.

460
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:15,780
We'll just divvy up the souls 50-50. How's that?

461
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:21,780
Friends, you might say that Christians are to blame for Satanism.

462
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:25,980
If it weren't for Christians telling each other there's a devil, nobody would believe in him.

463
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:30,200
And besides, for every satanic ritualistic killing,

464
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:35,840
a hundred babies are killed spur of the moment by fanatic Christian nut parents

465
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,780
who thought the kid was crying because it was possessed by Satan.

466
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:45,660
The only reason anybody serves Satan is because some Christian told them there was a Satan there to serve.

467
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:47,060
How about that?

468
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:52,740
However, there are eight circles in the Christian hell.

469
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:57,280
Dante's Inferno, however, is a hopelessly outdated work.

470
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,180
Hell is constantly being upgraded into a new world.

471
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:06,020
It's a world of pain configurations to compensate for the ever-degenerating quality of life here on earth.

472
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:13,140
The types of sins required to damn a Christian to these varying levels of torment are, however, surprisingly minor.

473
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,980
Here are some examples in ascending order of guiltiness and punishment.

474
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:25,640
The first level, the easiest level of hell, is for instance, for people who said damn or ga.

475
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:30,160
The second level is for those who might say,

476
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,360
I cannot believe I'm still alive.

477
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:33,440
The third level is for those who have felt lust in their hearts at one time.

478
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:38,480
The third level is for people who, for instance, forgot to say sir or ma'am.

479
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:45,940
Level four is for people who can't quote me John 6, 14 and don't know what brand Jesus Christ smoked.

480
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:51,640
Level number five is for people who opened their eyes during prayers in church.

481
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:55,360
Level six is for that guy that ripped you off.

482
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:59,960
Level seven, for murderers and rapists.

483
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:11,780
And level eight is reserved for members of, well not members, for subgeniuses who neglected to spend that $30 membership.

484
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:17,780
If you are still going down and not liberated, meditate as follows.

485
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:28,480
The sexual activities, the manipulation of machinery, the mocking laughter, dashing sounds and terrifying apparitions.

486
00:30:29,420 --> 00:30:33,380
Indeed all phenomena are in their nature illusions.

487
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:34,880
They look real to me.

488
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:36,300
However they may appear.

489
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:37,440
You mean like a dream?

490
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:39,800
In truth, they are unreal and fake.

491
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,040
They won't stay?

492
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,260
They are like dreams and apparitions.

493
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,800
Non-permanent, non-fixed.

494
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:46,700
They'll go away?

495
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,040
What advantage is there in being attached to them?

496
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,020
Well, I'm scared.

497
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,480
Or being afraid of them?

498
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,240
I don't know.

499
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,780
All these hallucinations of the mind.

500
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,080
I like hallucinations.

501
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,620
The mind itself does not exist.

502
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:00,260
Oh no.

503
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:02,340
Therefore why should they?

504
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,400
Well, they look real.

505
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:09,420
Only through taking these illusions for real will you wander around in this confused existence.

506
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:10,400
Well, what are they?

507
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,060
All these are like dreams.

508
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:12,780
Yeah?

509
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,800
Like echoes.

510
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:14,540
Echoes, echoes, echoes.

511
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:15,760
Like cities of clouds.

512
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:16,660
Wow.

513
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,800
Like mirages.

514
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:18,460
Hmm.

515
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,100
Like mirrored forms.

516
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:20,800
What the?

517
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,900
Like phantasmagoria.

518
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,480
Is that what that is?

519
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,120
The moon seen in water.

520
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,380
What should I do?

521
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,460
Not real even for a moment.

522
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,000
Yeah?

523
00:31:30,300 --> 00:31:33,320
By holding one pointedly to that train of thought.

524
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:33,840
Okay.

525
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:37,200
The belief that they are real are dissipated.

526
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:37,800
All right.

527
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:40,080
And liberation is attained.

528
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:41,040
What?

529
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:41,720
What?

530
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:42,460
What?

531
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,140
What?

532
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:43,640
What?

533
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
Fourth method.

534
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:49,540
Meditation on the void.

535
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,420
All substances are part of my own consciousness.

536
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:54,140
What?

537
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:57,340
This consciousness is vacuous, unborn, and unceasing.

538
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,880
What was that?

539
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,000
All substances are part of my own consciousness.

540
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:04,880
This consciousness is vacuous, unborn, and unceasing.

541
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,060
Hey, I think I heard this.

542
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:08,800
All substances are part of my own consciousness.

543
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:12,360
This consciousness is vacuous, unborn, and unceasing.

544
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,220
Hey, I did hear this.

545
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:19,100
Thus meditating, allow the mind to rest in the uncreated state.

546
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:23,040
Like the pouring of water into water.

547
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,000
Oh, I got a tingle.

548
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:29,080
The mind should be allowed its own easy mental posture.

549
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:29,620
Well?

550
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,640
In its natural unmodified condition.

551
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:33,320
Yeah?

552
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,820
Clear and vibrant.

553
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,120
Well, what should I do?

554
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,000
By maintaining this relaxed, uncreated state of mind.

555
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:40,420
Yeah?

556
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:45,080
Rebirth into routine game reality is sure to be prevented.

557
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,560
Okay.

558
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:49,780
Meditate on this until you are certainly free.

559
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:51,340
I want to be free.

560
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,000
I got it.

561
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:53,200
I got it.

562
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:53,840


563
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,040
I got it.

564
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:55,900
I got it.

565
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,340
Oh, and they've got to be the Funky Bardos.

566
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:04,520
Who else could it be but those wacky, Funky Funky Bardos.

567
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:11,900
And yes, you have to be careful about reentry into the regular, normal, mundane earth plane

568
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:19,020
because there's another level of hell called West Heck, which we will tell you about on

569
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:23,020
side two of show in just one minute.

570
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,020


571
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,020


572
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,020


573
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,020


574
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,020


575
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,020


576
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,020


577
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:23,020


578
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,980
tape-flipping moment, if you know what I mean.

579
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:48,400
Yes, my friends, there is a particularly insidious section of hell called West Heck.

580
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,960
Philodrummond is an expert on West Heck.

581
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,320
Many lost souls are in Heck without knowing it.

582
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:59,980
It's a polite hell, a genteel hell.

583
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,720
They don't even tell you you're in Heck.

584
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:07,740
You could easily be living in Heck on Earth and think it was perfectly normal.

585
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:11,120
You still have to work a horrible day job,

586
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:19,640
to spend your whole eternity working a dull, pointless job that doesn't mean a damn thing except money to pay for slightly less pain.

587
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,940
There's a special section of Hell that's called West Heck.

588
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,760
It's a section of Hell for each earthly profession in which one might fail, including yours.

589
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:32,020
The only difference is that this time it's eternal torment.

590
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:36,180
Then you're not trying to satisfy paying customers, but paid demons.

591
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:46,580
Only after toiling for a week that lasts 1,000 years do you earn the right to relax and go out on a date.

592
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:51,340
But then you're faced with sex in Hell.

593
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,000
Which is a living nightmare.

594
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:57,120
Because in Hell, you're judged by your looks.

595
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,660
If your looks don't conform to Miss Hell foldout of 1996,

596
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,780
well, you're going to have trouble getting dates.

597
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:10,320
And in Hell, you get old, you age, your skin sags as the years go by,

598
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,740
and you're compelled to wear elaborate hairdos and makeup.

599
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,720
On top of that, the demons make such a big deal out of sex, both pro and con.

600
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:21,420
Half the time you're so uptight about doing everything correctly,

601
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,960
you can't get your rocks off.

602
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,420
You go to all that trouble for kind of a halfway climax.

603
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,280
Wouldn't you hate to live in a world like that?

604
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,900
Wouldn't you do anything to get to Heaven?

605
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:32,840
Even kill yourself?

606
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,600
But see, that's the difference.

607
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:38,140
In Hell, you don't know if there's an afterlife, so you don't dare kill yourself.

608
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:42,220
In Heaven, you know for sure that you're already in it, so you don't have to kill yourself.

609
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,780
There is a Hell you can retire from.

610
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,660
But there's also one where they tell you you'll retire at age 50.

611
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,020
But you always get killed there.

612
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:56,540
Just before your 50th birthday, and end up wading even deeper into the lake of fire.

613
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:00,080
Oh, you'll find out. You're gonna find out, friend.

614
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,780
There ain't no water down there.

615
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,780
Ain't no water down there.

616
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:08,500
You can't get a drink, and you can't put out that fire.

617
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,760
There's never quite enough church air to breathe.

618
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:16,020
Oh, you take that church air for granted now.

619
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,800
You may not even know about it.

620
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,760
But wait till it's gone, little Bobby.

621
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,280
You can never win.

622
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,560
It's like playing against a computer.

623
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,280
It can't lose. It can't lose.

624
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,980
In fact, in one Hell, in the Tick Hell, you're like a little character in a video game.

625
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:39,000
Forced to eternally machine gun the endless stream of ticks crawling out at you from behind cactuses in a blistering desert.

626
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:43,820
And when the ticks die, they excrete a cactus and another tick.

627
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,300
You can kill lots of ticks.

628
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,920
Yeah, you can score real high.

629
00:36:48,020 --> 00:36:48,760
You can keep earning lifetimes.

630
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,620
But sooner or later, they're gonna get you.

631
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:53,260
They creep up on you.

632
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:54,720
They creep up on you, boy.

633
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:56,740
It's just like here on Earth.

634
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:00,480
And to top it off, there is reincarnation.

635
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:02,300
There is reincarnation, friends.

636
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:08,260
Once you're in Hell, oh yeah, you'll have plenty of lives in Hell.

637
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,000
Facts about the before of life.

638
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:12,760
Some genius rebirth.

639
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:15,260
You were, will be there.

640
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,740
It tends to end the scrutiny of the new Gnarnians.

641
00:37:19,740 --> 00:37:24,920
But the Gnarnians, or the subgenius book of the living dead, has been underway for the past 12 years.

642
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:32,620
Church doctors in the Dobstown vaults have nearly completed their translation of this most holy book in the Yeti Vita trilogy.

643
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:42,240
These self-same doctors inform us that many passages of this work are directly attributable to the brave and enlightened Atlanteans.

644
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:49,720
Long-time subscribers to the Stark Fist will recall our last report on this uber-sacred tomb-time story.

645
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,020
The story of the Gnarnians is a story of a man who was sent home about six years ago, number 22, volume 17.

646
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:59,500
And we published Partying After Death by Dr. Siddhartha Ni-Katharsis.

647
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:12,020
As you knew, will know, subgenius souls, or mental essences, are volatile, brightly colored, and usually very fast when they care to be.

648
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:15,220
They go where they want and are hard for others to control.

649
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,700
Souls of normals, however, are bland-looking pill-like creatures.

650
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:19,700


651
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:19,700


652
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:27,400
Although in life, subs and norms are almost indistinguishable, after death this is a hard mistake to make.

653
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:33,740
When a subgenius dies, the in-intescence bursts from its meek prison.

654
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:39,200
Its massless seed careens in a pan-galactic journey, lasting but a moment of our time.

655
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,760
It usually returns once to make sure it's really dead before moving on to the before-life.

656
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,700
Due to a 10,000-year disinformation campaign by the Gnarnians,

657
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:49,700


658
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:49,700


659
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:55,020
a jaded stereotype of heaven and hell is being pushed by the false churches.

660
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:59,040
In fact, there is little difference between the two.

661
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,740
Subgenii often commute between heaven and hell.

662
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,140
Interestingly, heaven is hotter than hell.

663
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:12,560
The seven suns which heat heaven make it many times hotter than the molten gaseous temperature thresholds of brimstone.

664
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:18,080
When a subgenius decides to live again, he, she is not alone.

665
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:22,920
Each subgenius has a nental-life twin on the media plane.

666
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,520
This is a revelation of the power of the subgenius.

667
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:33,460
Subgenius spiritual mastery is not maintained without struggle.

668
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:38,080
The subgenius must be vigilant and must hone his abnormality.

669
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,480
He must tithe the church.

670
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,940
Otherwise, the in-intescence loses its spark,

671
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:48,060
and the subgenius degenerates and dies normally.

672
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:51,700
This is a death worse than any fate.

673
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:00,260
When a normal dies, it exhausts all of its puny strength in a vain effort to hover near the body it squandered.

674
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,980
The pale, shell-like entity soon is carried away by wind or other forces.

675
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:10,880
Being lighter than air, the pink, although they may be bland versions of other colors,

676
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,540
the pink soul drifts aimlessly.

677
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:22,480
Although pinkster souls, also known as plugs, do tend to cluster.

678
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:28,100
The plugs are gathered up by cosmic agents, usually representing Jehovah One,

679
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,580
who has the largest franchise in this era.

680
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,180
The plugs are sprinkled into vats.

681
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:38,400
The vats have an energy source which melts the plug shells, making them bond together.

682
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,200
As new plugs continue to collect above,

683
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:45,460
the norm souls' shapes and colors blend until they resemble a lumpy stew.

684
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:50,700
Ultimately, the plugs form a clear slurry which drains from the vat.

685
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,700
This plasma can be used to form new souls,

686
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,840
souls who have a chance to become new subgenii.

687
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:59,880
However, the plasma is also formed during sex,

688
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:04,560
and the slurpluss is often sold as a spaceship fuel additive.

689
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:11,180
These hedgemen are known to have been styled in such a vat by the gods,

690
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,440
by agents for their master.

691
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,760
The vats themselves are said to be relics left by the elder gods,

692
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:19,200
forged for unguessed motives.

693
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:25,280
Thus, normals cannot be said to have led past lives.

694
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:28,540
It was just... normal.

695
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,240
I'm Pastor Bucknaked. You can write to me at

696
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:39,820
Post Office Box 140026, Dallas, Texas 75214.

697
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:44,380
Send a dollar and I'll send you a package of wild stuff and my candy line.

698
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,700
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

699
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:49,040
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

700
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:16,260
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

701
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,280
Patrons all around you,

702
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,380
Patrons everywhere.

703
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,780
Patrons of behavior,

704
00:42:25,820 --> 00:42:27,580
Sometimes seem unfair.

705
00:42:28,080 --> 00:42:32,320
Can you recognize the patterns that you find?

706
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:36,160
Patrons unfamiliar,

707
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:39,460
Patrons leaking through,

708
00:42:39,820 --> 00:42:42,480
Two patterns of discovery,

709
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,400
Tracing up the clues.

710
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:49,980
Can you recognize the patterns that you find?

711
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:52,020
Stuck in your mind.

712
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:03,160
In this land where stability is hard to find,

713
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:07,580
You can erase the patterns so unkind.

714
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,520
Don't bother asking why,

715
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,520
Where patterns never cry.

716
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:18,440
Where patterns never die.

717
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:21,460
They just go on and on.

718
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,860
Patrons multiply,

719
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:44,100
Repair and debut.

720
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:46,840
Endless variations,

721
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,940
Make your life seem new.

722
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:54,520
Can you recognize the patterns that you find?

723
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,660
Stuck in your mind.

724
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:07,800
In this land where stability is hard to find,

725
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:12,280
You can erase the patterns so unkind.

726
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,660
Patrons all around you,

727
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,340
Patrons everywhere.

728
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:22,360
Patrons everywhere.

729
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,380
Patrons leading you,

730
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:24,560
Patrons with you,

731
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:25,560
Patrons all around you,

732
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:28,020
Patrons all around you,

733
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,340
Never fail to see,

734
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:34,800
Patrons in your mind.

735
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:49,140
Oh, yes, friends, the devos, as I like to call those terrible boys.

736
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,840
God, I actually had not meant to play that song,

737
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:59,560
but the thing that I did have queued up was something mysterious happened to it.

738
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,740
But that's okay, friends, because you know what?

739
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:05,700
Well, no wonder this thing stopped turning on when I hit it.

740
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,000
Power's off.

741
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:08,480
There we go.

742
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,960
Ah, yes, you know, because Bob's been to hell.

743
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:18,240
The elder gods were jealous of Bob's slack,

744
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:23,580
for they have no bodies and thus cannot know the true squirt.

745
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,180
And so they sent Bob to hell and stole his squirt.

746
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:27,800
Now think of it.

747
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,020
Dobbs in the Christian hell,

748
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:31,940
pursued endlessly by demons,

749
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:34,840
making him relearn the concept of pain,

750
00:45:34,980 --> 00:45:37,700
which he had forgotten in his great slackfulness,

751
00:45:39,460 --> 00:45:47,020
while bastard gods like Wotan usurped the sexual-spiritual orgasm

752
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:51,720
from which they had disconnected his astral senses.

753
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,480
It's enough to make you want to do something about it.

754
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,480
But like what?

755
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:57,340
What are you going to do?

756
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,900
Shoot a shotgun up in the sky or into the deepest,

757
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,300
mine shaft you can find.

758
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:04,080
All the gods in the universe all join together,

759
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:08,200
and a mighty legion of doom have been unable to defeat the devil.

760
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:10,240
And we say, here's what we say.

761
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,720
We say, thank God for Satan,

762
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:17,100
for it's through his success that Bob's word receives press.

763
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:21,500
You see, as powerful as the devil is, he cannot defeat Bob.

764
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:23,080
He cannot defeat that man, Bob.

765
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:27,640
Bob has repeatedly made incredible breakouts from the underworld.

766
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:29,740
Now, by coincidence, each time,

767
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:33,500
as he is reincarnated into short-lived life forms,

768
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:36,980
such as the mayfly, the brine shrimp, and a turkey,

769
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:37,980
just before Thanksgiving,

770
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:40,540
at one point he came back as a baboon's heart.

771
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:44,100
Thus, he was quickly caught again by that devil

772
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:47,860
and sentenced even deeper into hell with each recapture.

773
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,460
He has become very familiar with hell's many circles

774
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:55,520
and levels and trap doors and escape hatches.

775
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,520
And while he's been there, Bob's made a few changes.

776
00:46:58,600 --> 00:46:59,720
He's going to bring...

777
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:01,700
some measure of democracy to hell.

778
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,900
He will, shall we say, Americanize hell.

779
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:08,640
Most of the souls down there were born before there was an America.

780
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:13,460
They're more than ready for blue jeans, hot cars, and radios.

781
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:17,640
For in some parts of hell, there is not even rock and roll.

782
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,320
But although you can escape from hell,

783
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,840
especially Bob can escape from hell,

784
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,780
there is no escape from heaven.

785
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:34,160
And we're going to talk about the caves and flames of the Christian heaven.

786
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,020
Although you can escape hell.

787
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:38,340
Uh, wait, I just said that.

788
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,460
I see I'm editing as we go along here.

789
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:44,360
By the time you get to Christian heaven, said Chainer Hyperclete,

790
00:47:44,440 --> 00:47:47,280
you'll be wishing to God you've made it to subgenius hell.

791
00:47:47,740 --> 00:47:52,120
The Christian heaven is only the next rung up the ladder of afterlives,

792
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:54,080
and it's also reserved for Christians.

793
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,720
It consists of an absence of pain

794
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,160
and...

795
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,260
of pleasure.

796
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:04,220
You see, friends, you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.

797
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:09,960
All the obedient souls belong to God and get eternal slavery in heaven.

798
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,440
And everybody else burns in hell forever and ever.

799
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:14,340
Now, we don't buy that! I'm sorry!

800
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:16,560
Church and subgenius, we just don't buy that.

801
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:20,520
As if making you a work slave all your life wasn't bad enough,

802
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,040
they want to keep you enslaved in the afterlife as well.

803
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:29,000
They spend all their mortal lives forcing puritanical laws down everybody's throats,

804
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:32,360
and then they expect us to believe that heaven's gonna be any different?

805
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:39,220
That once they reach heaven, then God's suddenly gonna allow his little herd of sheep to run wild?

806
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:40,460
You get the...

807
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:43,520
You get all the joy of the fundamentalist lifestyle.

808
00:48:44,040 --> 00:48:44,560
Uh-huh.

809
00:48:44,620 --> 00:48:47,520
With no hope of escape, not even death.

810
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,140
Some heaven.

811
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,160
Little wonder Lucifer got the hell out of there.

812
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:56,820
Bob believes in everyone's God-forbidden right

813
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,660
to choose for themselves!

814
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:00,700
The fate of their almighty soul!

815
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:04,340
Dobbs is recruiting lost souls of every creed!

816
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:09,100
The billions that fell between the cracks of good and evil!

817
00:49:09,440 --> 00:49:15,500
The neutrals who just want for once to be left alone in the afterlife?

818
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:20,700
My friends, there's plenty of quality souls frying in hell

819
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:27,560
just because they didn't want to follow the goose-stepping guidelines of G-G-God.

820
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:34,440
Lashed and tortured forever for no other reason than that they wanted to be free.

821
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:39,820
And if freedom's a sin, pray that we're all sinners.

822
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:45,500
I was praying last night when an angel broke the light

823
00:49:45,500 --> 00:49:50,180
He said, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for a time

824
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:54,740
I said, hold like hell, let me talk to the boss

825
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:57,020
He said, I'm sorry, stupid sinner.

826
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,460
It's the boss's day off.

827
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,960
And I realized then that the wages of sin

828
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:08,440
was two bucks an hour and working weekend.

829
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:13,280
I was ignoring the fee he was lashed to the crawlers

830
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,580
He cried, help me get this son of a bitch off.

831
00:50:17,740 --> 00:50:20,220
I said I would if I could.

832
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:22,500
I can't, so I won't.

833
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:26,220
Well, I wouldn't want you messing your hair up.

834
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,140
So don't.

835
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:31,620
And I realized then that the wages of sin

836
00:50:31,620 --> 00:50:34,160
was all the lumber you can carry

837
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,260
all the nails you can bend

838
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:38,560
the wages of sin

839
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:40,940
the reward of fear

840
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,620
is worrying and threatened every second of the year

841
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:50,040
If heaven is guilt, no sex and no show

842
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:54,700
then I'm not sure if I really wanna go.

843
00:51:10,900 --> 00:51:11,460
Is it going to be fast or fast?

844
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:15,740
Are you okay with that?

845
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:15,820
If the удобimas don't have money

846
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:15,820


847
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:15,820


848
00:51:15,820 --> 00:51:15,840
If all's well that ends well

849
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:16,060
I'm a shit pimp

850
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:17,080
If all's good

851
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:17,700
I'm ennoblando

852
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:18,820
I don't mind a girl

853
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:19,720
Burn my threeatti

854
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:24,420
All the people be put on set

855
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,500
If you know this church is crap.

856
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:41,020
Hey, it's Maria and Fred, every second of the day. The church and the state, you've got a country kind. One gets your body, the other gets your mind.

857
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:54,860
Mary, Mary Magdalena, how about a date? You've been wasting your time staying up so late. Your boyfriend's dead, the word is you're a whore.

858
00:51:55,120 --> 00:52:08,540
Just about then I heard a knock on the door, and I realized then that the wages of sin was a bad reputation and too many friends.

859
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:10,860
The wages of sin.

860
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:15,520
The wages of sin.

861
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:20,040
The wages of sin.

862
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:24,700
The wages of sin.

863
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,280
The wages of sin.

864
00:52:31,300 --> 00:52:34,000
The wages of sin.

865
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:38,460
The wages of sin.

866
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:38,460


867
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,100
The Raging Wound of Sin

868
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,700
The Raging Wound of Sin

869
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,380
The Wagers of Sin

870
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:56,940
The Wagers of Sin

871
00:52:56,940 --> 00:53:01,500
The Wagers of Sin

872
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:06,080
The Wagers of Sin

873
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:10,580
The Wagers of Sin

874
00:53:10,580 --> 00:53:16,920
Oh yes friends, the Rainmakers once again.

875
00:53:17,700 --> 00:53:29,940
Performed that little piece of music and now we must unfortunately discuss, well it's, one might say the scarier part of all this.

876
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:35,480
You know the soul is the one part of us that the conspiracy hungers for the most.

877
00:53:35,820 --> 00:53:42,880
And when you enter Wotan's bloodstream you have to deal with his antibodies.

878
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:47,480
Go into the spirit and you must deal with spirit.

879
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:52,140
And with the cannibalism of souls.

880
00:53:53,640 --> 00:54:08,420
Some spirits called theocrats vampirize off other spirits and so live, quote unquote, live forever at the expense of their victims.

881
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:17,620
They obtain these victims by posing as gods and persuading the religious believers to come to them.

882
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:24,420
They come voluntarily after death thinking that they are entering eternal bliss in heaven.

883
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:33,520
And by the way, this is all from a book called War in Heaven by Kyle Griffith.

884
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:35,620
And he continues to say, quote,

885
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:44,100
Many notorious tyrants, conquerors, evil religious leaders, black magicians and criminals have become theocrats after death.

886
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:47,540
But so have some saints or benign.

887
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:48,920
And so have some priests or priests or priests or priests or priests or monks or priests or priests or priests or priests or priests or priests or priests.

888
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:48,960
But there are also some of the most famous and most renowned and most respected and most respected and most respected and most respected.

889
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:50,160
Power corrupts.

890
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,240
And the prospect of achieving immortality corrupts even more.

891
00:54:54,460 --> 00:55:02,420
Many people with highly developed souls whose earthly lives were lived quite ethically chose to become theocrats after death.

892
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:13,020
This has been especially true for people who were religiously devout, then found out the horrible truth about their gods after death.

893
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,600
The theocrats enslave other spirits and provide.

894
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:23,180
psychic energy, just as slaves or employees on earth provide physical labor. The daily

895
00:55:23,180 --> 00:55:29,640
activities of a fundamentalist theocratic band organized in heaven are similar to a

896
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:35,760
church service as such sects hold them on earth, except that they go on perpetually.

897
00:55:36,120 --> 00:55:42,980
The theocrat in charge poses as the Lord God Jehovah. The subordinate theocrats pose as

898
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:49,080
Christ, various angels and apostles and so forth. God quotes the same biblical passages

899
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:55,460
and preaches the same sermons as preachers in the same sect do on earth, and the congregation

900
00:55:55,460 --> 00:56:03,740
joins in singing the same hymns. The theocratic leaders then channel this collective psychic

901
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:09,340
energy. For instance, there are dead Christians who think they're in heaven, sitting around

902
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:12,960
the throne of Jehovah, eternally singing his praises.

903
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:21,460
When they're really just his slaves and possibly his dinner as well. Now you understand the

904
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:24,720
real significance of Holy Communion.

905
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,640
Ah, yeah.

906
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:42,940
Young lady, because you have never been a Christian, you are not a Christian. You are

907
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:42,940


908
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:42,940


909
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:42,940


910
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:46,160
a Christian. You are a Christian. You have accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior. You

911
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,120
must go to hell.

912
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:57,140
Oh, please. I don't want to go to hell. Why, I'm only 14 years old. I'm too young. I never

913
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:03,180
even had a chance to be a Christian. But I'd like to be saved. Couldn't I become a Christian

914
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:03,520
now?

915
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,540
No, child. It is too late.

916
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:12,520
But, but you wouldn't send a person to hell who, who never had a chance, would you?

917
00:57:12,520 --> 00:57:23,660
But you had an opportunity when you were seven years old. June 2nd, 1968.

918
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:27,320
Oh.

919
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:33,240
Willie, you're too young. Willie, you're older. You have plenty of time.

920
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:42,420
But you saw how my parents wouldn't let me go. It's their fault.

921
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:47,120
It's their fault that I'm lost. It's their fault. Why wouldn't you let me go?

922
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:52,820
There were other times that I have dealt with you, but you would have none of it.

923
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,940
When was it that you dealt with me?

924
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:04,280
December 18th, 1974.

925
00:58:05,800 --> 00:58:10,720
Betty, for as long as I've known Christ, I've tried to make him real to you. When are you

926
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,280
going to accept him and be saved?

927
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:18,320
I don't know, Cindy. I don't want to hurt your feelings, but religion just isn't my

928
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:22,800
thing. There's plenty of time. I'm just not interested right now.

929
00:58:23,340 --> 00:58:28,660
Betty, one of these days you're going to stand before God, and you'll wish a thousand times

930
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:32,140
you'd taken the chance to accept him. But it'll be too late.

931
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:39,800
No, child. You are lost and there is no place found for you except the lake of fire, prepared

932
00:58:39,800 --> 00:58:41,200
for the devil and his angels.

933
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:42,260
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm

934
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:42,480
so sorry. I'm so sorry.

935
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:42,480


936
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:42,480


937
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:42,480


938
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:42,480


939
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,100
Take her away.

940
00:58:43,340 --> 00:58:54,400
No. No. No, I'm too young. I don't want to go. Mama! Betty! Help me!

941
00:58:55,740 --> 00:59:03,540
The evil. The beat. The beat. The beat. The evil. The beat. The beat. The beat. The beat.

942
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:11,340
The beat. The beat. The beat. The evil. I. I believe that it's because I know Christ.

943
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:12,240
No.

944
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:12,240


945
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,120
Subgenius hell.

946
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:19,000
It's a cold, cold kind of hell.

947
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:21,960
Cold in here.

948
00:59:22,840 --> 00:59:25,620
Wish I could light this here pipe.

949
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,300
They gave me all the frappy in the world.

950
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:31,800
And it's too cold to light this pipe.

951
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:34,540
Oh, Bob, where are you now?

952
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:38,020
Why did you leave me in the hands of me?

953
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:47,680
However, Bob will offer you eternal salvation or triple your money back.

954
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:58,540
Which unfortunately gives them the image in their minds of Bob standing at the gates of hell handing out $60 checks.

955
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,900
Well, that's real funny.

956
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,060
I hope you boys are having a good time.

957
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:07,920
I bet you thought this old church thingy.

958
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:10,900
Yours is going to be big, big fun.

959
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:12,180
Big barrel of laughs.

960
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:13,820
Oh, yeah.

961
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:23,240
I bet you thought you were going to be some kind of high school lawyer with that Bob fellow of yours.

962
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:29,260
Well, you're looking at a pretty damn long eternity.

963
01:00:30,900 --> 01:00:33,840
Oh, by the way, here's that triple your money back.

964
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:36,220
It's, what, $60?

965
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,480
One for you.

966
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:39,440
One for you, Jones.

967
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:46,220
And don't let this deter you from doing business with us again.

968
01:00:46,420 --> 01:00:46,480
Yeah.

969
01:00:52,300 --> 01:00:56,120
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

970
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:03,880
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready?

971
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:04,680
Bob.

972
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:05,920
Post office box.

973
01:01:06,440 --> 01:01:08,000
8-0-1.

974
01:01:08,020 --> 01:01:08,340
8-0-7.

975
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:10,720
Glen Rose, Texas.

976
01:01:11,080 --> 01:01:13,920
7-6-0-4-3.

977
01:01:14,220 --> 01:01:15,400
That's Bob.

978
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:17,540
Box 8-0-7.

979
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:20,060
Glen Rose, Texas.

980
01:01:20,360 --> 01:01:22,880
7-6-0-4-3.

981
01:01:23,340 --> 01:01:25,920
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

982
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:41,700
Well, then, Dennis locked me in this little box.

983
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,660
I can't feel anything.

984
01:01:43,740 --> 01:01:44,960
I can't see anything.

985
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,420
It's totally black.

986
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:48,840
I have no sensation in my hands.

987
01:01:48,940 --> 01:01:50,640
I don't know if I'm moving or what.

988
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,000
I'm just in this little box.

989
01:01:52,340 --> 01:01:53,700
He said I could talk to you.

990
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:56,620
He said you'd know what to do if you wanted to help me.

991
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:57,920
Oh, good.

992
01:01:58,060 --> 01:01:59,700
Help me, Peter Wellman.

993
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:05,040
I promise I'll pay you all the royalties that I didn't tell you about.

994
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:06,900
And whatever you want.

995
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:07,540
I mean, anything.

996
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,620
Oh, Tevis.

997
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:10,540
You can have Tevis.

998
01:02:10,580 --> 01:02:12,500
Just get me out of this box, Wellman.

999
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,760
Please don't.

1000
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:14,080
No.

1001
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:16,140
Don't believe what Paul told you.

1002
01:02:16,180 --> 01:02:16,980
It's all a lie.

1003
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:17,880
It's all a lie.

1004
01:02:18,080 --> 01:02:20,280
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

1005
01:02:20,420 --> 01:02:20,900
I'm sorry.

1006
01:02:20,940 --> 01:02:22,320
I let you out of the box, Wellman.

1007
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,080
I can't.

1008
01:02:23,080 --> 01:02:25,500
This is a bad show, Wellman.

1009
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:27,900
This is a real bad show.

1010
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:33,680
She says she'd almost rather see me in Tevis than in nothing at all.

1011
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:37,140
Bright, perky, almost psychedelic.

1012
01:02:37,140 --> 01:02:39,720
The Tevis line of fine men's undergarments.

1013
01:02:39,820 --> 01:02:41,520
Underwear you'll never change.

1014
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:46,820
Sweet-talk me all you want, but you'll never get me out of my Tevis.

1015
