00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900
Dear friends, to the subgenius hour of SLAT!

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,040
And you are listening to the hour of SLAT on KNON in Dallas, Texas.

3
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,140
Eternal salvation.

4
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,680
Or triple your money back.

5
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:55,000
We would have to creep inside their heads to know whether this person or that carries the rare subgenius genes.

6
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,460
But once inside those heads,

7
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,980
we would discover a very special secret.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,480
A vast new universe.

9
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:03,140
A new dimension.

10
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,480
Coexisting, not always in harmony, alongside the mundane workaday world of the common human.

11
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:14,200
Another world that until now has been forced into hiding.

12
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:18,780
Now at this very moment, the veils of secrecy can be torn aside.

13
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:24,080
We, the persecuted, may now dare to raise our heads high and declare,

14
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,500
Behold us, for we are the subgeniuses!

15
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:36,740
Our prime concern is to locate and photograph the geek.

16
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:40,240
This is a team effort.

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,840
And we are all pledged to share and share alike.

18
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,840
Our food and our water.

19
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,520
Everything.

20
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:51,300
Including our women.

21
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,900
We didn't lie to you folks.

22
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:59,340
We told you we had living, breathing monstrosity.

23
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,360
You laughed at them.

24
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:04,040
Shuddered at them.

25
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,700
And yet, but for the accident of birth,

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,040
you might be even as they are.

27
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,840
They did not ask to be brought into the world.

28
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,060
But into the world they came.

29
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,720
Their code is a law unto themselves.

30
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,520
Offend one, and you offend them all.

31
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,920
And you will be punished for your sins.

32
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,840
And you will be punished for your sins.

33
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,960
Oh, and we're offended, dear friends.

34
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,960
We're offended that you haven't called in to express your horror.

35
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,620
Your disgust at this show.

36
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,920
At least last week's and this coming show.

37
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:57,240
Go ahead, if you dare, call 823-7490.

38
00:02:57,860 --> 00:02:59,720
Yes, I'll say it again.

39
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,680
Go ahead, call 823-7490.

40
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:04,060
We don't care.

41
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,200
Go ahead and insult us, hate us.

42
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,140
They're lighting up.

43
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,660
The little collar hole is lighting up.

44
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,440
And soon they'll be dumped down into the...

45
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:13,940
No.

46
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,240
No.

47
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,080
No.

48
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,340
No.

49
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,720
Please.

50
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,880
It is not hands that call us.

51
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,640
It is desire.

52
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:26,020
Ah, yes, desire.

53
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,900
But what is a subgenius?

54
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:40,220
How can they, we, differ so much from the humans whose nonsensical laws and customs we have been forced to obey?

55
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:49,920
Uncorrected personality traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult.

56
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,220
Lack of involvement with the father or over-involvement with the mother

57
00:03:56,220 --> 00:04:00,520
can result in lack of ability to relate to sexual peers.

58
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,280
And in homosexual leanings, narcissism, transsexuality,

59
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,640
girls from the waist up, men from the waist down,

60
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:11,320
attempts to be your own love object.

61
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:17,700
Reconcile your parents to you by becoming both at once.

62
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,300
Even Marilyn Monroe was a man,

63
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,140
but this tends to get overlooked by our mother fixer.

64
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,660
And she got a little present over a couple of questions from

65
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:35,660


66
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,960
A glademan doesn't thank all women but her love-

67
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,220
�

68
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:56,120
The criminal opinion framework exist suddenly is every time so much more realistic than what it doesn't seem to be.

69
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:05,520
psychotic and they won't make an ideal husband or wife. The spoiled baby grows into the escapist

70
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:15,640
teenager who's the adult alcoholic who's the middle-aged suicide boy. So uncorrected personality

71
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:23,520
traits that seem whimsical in a child may prove to be ugly in a fully grown adult.

72
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:36,460
So what is the difference? Examine this seemingly docile crowd and know that in some few simmering

73
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:43,660
beneath a placid surface there broils a veritable cauldron of repressed subgenius awareness ready

74
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:48,440
at any moment to explode outward often with catastrophic results.

75
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,560
We may be witnesses to a biblical prophecy come true and

76
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:55,940
we may be witnesses to a biblical prophecy come true and

77
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:02,100
but there will be destruction and darkness come upon creation and the beasts will reign over the earth.

78
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,220
People of Earth, I am an alien from outer space.

79
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:25,920
Every time your heart beats these gruesome creations spawn by a demon brain grow foot by incredible foot feeding their ever-growing mind.

80
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:29,380
Every time your heart beats these gruesome creations spawn by a demon brain grow foot by incredible foot feeding their ever-growing mind.

81
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,960
This way it stops yet another hanging,

82
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:33,320
destroyed,

83
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:33,820
dev vermeous mastermind who shall swallow all humans.

84
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,280
Trans Detroit ravens plowing years away from you,

85
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:36,280


86
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,900
Even if you're weak and inexperienced affinitydo or certain education,

87
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:38,900


88
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:39,500
body half as firm that investment of me.

94
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:01,420
Coming closer, closer, closer is an enemy from outer space.

95
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,840
The Church of the Subgenius.

96
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:22,380
From out of this world it came, a horrifying terror that threatened mankind, haunting and possessing every human being within range, an indestructible danger beyond all earthly understanding.

97
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:34,840
This extraterrestrial comes from outer space, from some godforsaken antimatter galaxy, millions and millions of light years from the Earth.

98
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:46,920
Atomic hydrogen weapons capable of wiping cities, countries off the face of the Earth, are completely ineffective against this creature from the skies.

99
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:51,160
Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob.

100
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,020
There it is now. Attacking the United Nations building.

101
00:07:56,660 --> 00:08:05,220
I have found out how now, to add to the 16 existing glands a 17th, artificially developed a new gland.

102
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:17,280
What this gland does to this blonde beauty when it's electrolyted into her body, is an experience and horror almost unbelievable.

103
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,360
Ejected from unexplored secret strata, this giant...

104
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:31,160
...harder than steel piston, disgorges strange creatures, inundating our world, twisting the emotions of women, distorting our men.

105
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:38,180
This is a piece we have. Reflex action like a snake. Cut a snake in half and the two pieces go off in different directions.

106
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,760
These things take over a man's mind? He becomes a robot? A machine taking orders?

107
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,340
Join the hunt for the hiding place of terror. Find the breeding place of these globs of destruction.

108
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,200
What is happening to us?

109
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,900
What are these giant mutations, whose attack on people sends the whole countryside on an endless search.

110
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:09,960
Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob. Bob Bob.

111
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:18,260
Chaos and upheaval in a strange world, as a comet runs wild among the planets of the universe.

112
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,400
This catastrophe, whatever it was...

113
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:20,640
...has...

114
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:22,360
...thrown the Earth into a new age. A new unity, a new undercurrent of love. A new world of love. A new world of love. The one who would love the world. A world of love. This catastrophe, whatever it was, has...

115
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,520
orbit. No, this whole thing is unbelievable.

116
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:40,860
Besides his own exaggerated human nature and the powers granted him by Jehovah One,

117
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:48,840
Bob also benefits from being the chosen broker on Earth for superior beings from the furthest

118
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:58,260
reaches of known space, the so-called men from Planet X, or X-ists, for they are nothing like men.

119
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:10,800
Bob has a covenant with these angelic beings, a cosmic contract, a deal. On July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.,

120
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:18,620
the X-ists shall make a mass landing on this planet. The children of Bob shall be rewarded

121
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:18,820
for their service to the planet.

122
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:25,680
And at this foretold rupture, this day of judgment, when all those who paid their church

123
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:33,020
dues will be lifted up in power and glory to gain new homes and bodies aboard the pleasure

124
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:40,900
saucers of the sex goddesses, all the while watching the hapless pinks twitch and bleat

125
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:48,320
and wail in the death throes of their world. And we faithful shall be transfigured into

126
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,820
new beings.

127
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:56,940
Two enlightened beings, superior mutants called Overmen and Überwomen, who will start a new

128
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:04,260
Jerusalem in the promised land of Dimension X, Asgard, the zone of eternal slack and

129
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:07,100
cytor-spasmic ooze squirt.

130
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,200
Alive with primordial animals.

131
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,480
The menace of cavemen, gorilla people.

132
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,520
Underground.

133
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:18,800
Underground.

134
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:19,160
Underground.

135
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:21,120
ay demons.

136
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:30,820
What kind of a nightmare world is this?

137
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:37,120
While the beach set twists to the big beat sound of the dellaires, swinging out with

138
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,140
six rocking hits.

139
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:44,420
While the cycle gangs burn up the road and strong-arm their way into the party with fists

140
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,000
flying.

141
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,700
While teenagers prepare for a secluded slumber party.

142
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:51,880
terror strikes from the bottom of the sea.

143
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,120
An invasion of ghoulish atomic beasts

144
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,000
who live off human blood.

145
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,840
Can they be killed?

146
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,160
I don't know, Lieutenant.

147
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,220
They are the living dead.

148
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,960
They're zombies.

149
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,620
Behold, my servant shall prosper.

150
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,460
He that exalted and lifted up

151
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:29,040
on the pipe shall be very high.

152
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,100
He who knew that the fools prophesied for him

153
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,260
shall be made over man.

154
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:38,100
Many will be astonished at him

155
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,480
for his appearance is so mild

156
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,300
beyond human semblance

157
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:47,060
that his form is beyond that of a soul.

158
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:59,440
Meet the most beautiful creature of the future.

159
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:06,420
Her name is Barbarella

160
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:10,920
and she makes science fiction something else.

161
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Barbarella is a five-star,

162
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:18,220
double-rated, astronavigatrix, earth girl.

163
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,200
Whose specialty is...

164
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,460
Love.

165
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,720
Shall I tell you what I would like?

166
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,200
I think I know.

167
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,740
Her top-secret mission

168
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,400
is a real wing-dinger.

169
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:39,340
I got him.

170
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,380
No!

171
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:45,460
Ah!

172
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:46,700
Ah!

173
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:47,380
Ah!

174
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:47,840
Ah!

175
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,140
Ah!

176
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:48,200
Ah!

177
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:48,800
Ah!

178
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,800


179
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,800


180
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,800


181
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,800


182
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,800


183
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,800


184
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,800


185
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,800


186
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,800


187
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,800


188
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,800


189
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,800


190
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,800


191
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:48,800


192
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,740
Ah!

193
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,000
Ah!

194
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:58,920
Ah!

195
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,180
Ah!

196
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:00,320
Ah!

197
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:00,500
Ah!

198
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:00,540


199
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:00,840


200
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,020


201
00:14:01,020 --> 00:14:01,020


202
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,040


203
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,040


204
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:01,060


205
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:01,220
Ah!

206
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:01,240
Ah!

207
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,240


208
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:01,340
Ah!

209
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,100
Ah!

210
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:03,020
Ah!

211
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,020


212
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,020


213
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,020


214
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,020


215
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,020


216
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,320
Ah!

217
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:06,920
see

218
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,220
Barbarella

219
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:10,980
do

220
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,800
her thing

221
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,340
with a nice angel

222
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,460
with a warm

223
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,640
friendly ice

224
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:29,480
with a cold evil black queen with the charming hand-to-hand Romeo

225
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:50,620
in the biting birdcage in the chamber of dreams in the labyrinth of love in the deadly dollhouse

226
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:53,500
in the palace of pleasure

227
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,120
so

228
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:57,880
we

229
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:57,880


230
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:58,120
we

231
00:14:58,120 --> 00:15:06,480
can't do much about those evil gods from the other side of the cosmos who fly through the air

232
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:15,180
and through the nebulous darkness of space space my friends the infinite inky clouds of nebulae

233
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,800
they fly on their membranous leathery wings holding in their coiling tentacles shiny steel

234
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:26,440
cylinders each one containing what was once a human soul what was once a member of the church

235
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:27,980
of the subgenius but another

236
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:28,140
this

237
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:29,740
wow

238
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,600
now

239
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:31,600


240
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,700
gleam

241
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:35,760
g

242
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:36,100
isn't

243
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,100


244
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:36,100


245
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:37,240
don't know

246
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:37,560
block

247
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:43,420
bex squirrels

248
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,600
battle for survival against the rock snakes of the dark planet.

249
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:53,380
Sometime in the near future, when we least expect it,

250
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,420
they will come.

251
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,820
Cities will burn.

252
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,560
Mankind will panic.

253
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,180
Our world will tremble.

254
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:17,900
When the invasion from another time and another place begins,

255
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:24,200
disbelief will be shattered and the truth of an ancient past will be revealed.

256
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:29,860
When it occurs, you will see men turned killers by mysterious power.

257
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,160
I wanted to kill you.

258
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:35,120
Why?

259
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:38,280
Because you are different.

260
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:42,860
Women will be defiled by the invaders from outer space.

261
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,200
You will be killed.

262
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:45,240
You will be killed.

263
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,060
You will be killed.

264
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:50,780
Scientists will vainly attempt to save civilization.

265
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,960
My duty now is to quieten public alarm.

266
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,540
And you, you keep your damn paws out of face.

267
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,200
Ironically, his mission will not be to sell Earth,

268
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:07,300
but to prevent Earth being sold and transformed into a kind of Stucky's in space.

269
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,380
Don't forget that Bob has come to,

270
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:11,540
uh,

271
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,200
as a prophecy,

272
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,000
the end of the world,

273
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:15,460
July 5th, 1998.

274
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:16,880
Okay?

275
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,620
When most Americans will have hangover,

276
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,780
but it's not just for the Americans,

277
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:21,000
it's for everyone in the world.

278
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,940
I didn't hear that.

279
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,060
Yeah, right.

280
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:23,820
That is,

281
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:24,300
that is why,

282
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:24,840
I'm gonna start smoking again.

283
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,800
Yeah, start smoking,

284
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,400
start drinking,

285
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,240
and live it up.

286
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,020
Start fornicating as if your very life depended on it.

287
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,960
Does it, does, dear friends,

288
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,420
and,

289
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:35,760
and,

290
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,220
well,

291
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:36,740
uh,

292
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,280
just,

293
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,860
uh,

294
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,520
in case you've been wondering what you've been living for,

295
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:41,520


296
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:41,520


297
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:41,520


298
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:41,520


299
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:41,520


300
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,400
listening to,

301
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,680
this is the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack,

302
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:52,000
the voice of the church of the subgenius.

303
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,760
Um,

304
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:54,860
actually,

305
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,500
this is,

306
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:55,720
uh,

307
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,540
Nancy Regalia night.

308
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:57,960
Yes,

309
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,420
we have,

310
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,000
we have a,

311
00:17:59,040 --> 00:17:59,400
a,

312
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:00,480
uh,

313
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,480
most beloved and valued member in New Orleans,

314
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,000
uh,

315
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:06,520
Reverend Nancy Regalia,

316
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,920
who has sent almost all the stuff that you'll be hearing,

317
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,500
except for the,

318
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,720
um,

319
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:12,480
edited,

320
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,020
uh,

321
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,540
segment coming up,

322
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:14,740
uh,

323
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,540
in a little while.

324
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,000
Uh,

325
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,600
all these wonderful little,

326
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:18,920
uh,

327
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,520
movie trailer clips and,

328
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:21,020
and,

329
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,300
uh,

330
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:25,520
statements about the church of the subgenius from people who didn't even know it existed

331
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,320
back then.

332
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,000
Ah,

333
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,420
you know,

334
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:33,240
the church of the subgenius,

335
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:41,400
that thing that started here in Dallas about 10 years ago and continues to grow.

336
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,280
And grow.

337
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:45,700
Expanding like a balloon.

338
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,060
A hideous balloon.

339
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,560
And when it bops,

340
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,880
if it must pop,

341
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,620
I hope you're not standing in the way,

342
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,300
dear friend.

343
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,280
Uh,

344
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,760
but,

345
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:56,140
uh,

346
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,360
on the other hand,

347
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:57,560
if,

348
00:18:58,180 --> 00:18:59,040
of course,

349
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,280
if you were a card-carrying member of the church of the subgenius,

350
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:02,700
you'd,

351
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,840
you'd be waiting for it to pop on July 5th,

352
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:06,360
1998.

353
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:09,420
Wouldn't you?

354
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:09,760
Uh,

355
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:10,720
I,

356
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:10,980
I,

357
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:10,980


358
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,060


359
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,100


360
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,100


361
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,100


362
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,100


363
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,100


364
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:11,100


365
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,100
uh,

366
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:13,460
I,

367
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:13,900
I,

368
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:19,800
I would probably go there pretty soon.

369
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:20,360


370
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:20,500
uh,

371
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:21,680
I,

372
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:22,040
I,

373
00:19:24,060 --> 00:19:28,000
I think if you're looking for that,

374
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,740
that's a little more difficult.

375
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:29,740


376
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:30,260
uh,

377
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:30,260


378
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,600
I think you'd be a great idea to,

379
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,580
uh,

380
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:33,580


381
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:33,580


382
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:33,960
to,

383
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:33,980


384
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:33,980


385
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:33,980


386
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:33,980


387
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:33,980


388
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:33,980


389
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:33,980


390
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:33,980


391
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,180
uh,

392
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:36,380
to,

393
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:41,440
This plan will succeed only if conditions are just right at the appointed time.

394
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:47,500
Otherwise, dark forces of antiquity will be awakened from their slumber of eons

395
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:53,200
and rise again from Atlantis to rule our world in their sizeless grip.

396
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:57,280
These primordial elementals, the Elder Gods,

397
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:03,440
have countless demonic and interplanetary minions carrying out their unholy schemes.

398
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:11,440
They even control Bob's own evil twin brother, Dick Dobbs, the Unclean One.

399
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,300
It could happen in your lifetime.

400
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:24,620
They build the city, make the laws, the gods,

401
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,220
and control the gods.

402
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,760
That's us, a race of lowly, terrified humans

403
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,420
who run wild in the dark.

404
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:37,720
The gods in the jungles are caged in the prisons and stuffed in the museums.

405
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:42,900
A world gone insane, an upside-down civilization that could not be real.

406
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,820
Yes, a world of madness and terror.

407
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:50,000
Man has no understanding.

408
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,040
No kidding.

409
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,620
He can be taught a few simple tricks, nothing more.

410
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,640
And you're teaching him here, friends.

411
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:03,200
Oh, sure, it's a madhouse.

412
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,200
Don't you love it?

413
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:13,960
The Holy Tribunal has placed you in my custody for final disposition.

414
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,700
Oh, boy, thanks, Bob.

415
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,700
You realize what that means?

416
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:19,540
Oh.

417
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:19,900
No.

418
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,040
Slack?

419
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,400
What duration to begin with?

420
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,800
Well, that's not slack.

421
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,920
An experimental surgery on the speech centers, on the brain.

422
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,400
What's brain slack for?

423
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,960
It's a kind of living death.

424
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:31,720
Slack!

425
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,900
Like all his powers,

426
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:36,340
could Dobs really be defeated by these beings?

427
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:40,060
Ah, but you must not underestimate the conspiracy.

428
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:46,300
Its weapons are so insidious, even the human conspiracy leaders are unaware of them.

429
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:53,180
The fact that the conspiracy itself is ignorant that it is a conspiracy gives it such control over our minds,

430
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,360
that the very thought becomes unthinkable.

431
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:59,320
You cannot think about your own mind.

432
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:00,580
That's part of the problem.

433
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,620
You cannot think about your own mind.

434
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,100
You cannot wash.

435
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,680
You cannot see your own eyes.

436
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,860
You cannot run from your own legs.

437
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:06,860
You cannot hide from God.

438
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,480
You cannot hide from God.

439
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:09,060
He's bearing you.

440
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,220
He's bearing you in all reality.

441
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,200
Help me somebody.

442
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,040
She ain't got no legs.

443
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,420
My legs are on fire.

444
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,700
Yeah, my legs are on fire too, dear friends.

445
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,360
Actually, what you've been listening to just then

446
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:22,540
and interspersed through the rest of this is

447
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:28,340
the soundtrack of Arise, the subgenius video,

448
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:33,320
which you won't be seeing on television anytime soon.

449
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,780
No, I don't think so.

450
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,260
Sure, it sounds good, doesn't it?

451
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,740
Well, it looks even better.

452
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,960
Don't you wish you could see it?

453
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:47,780
Well, I can't tell you how you can, so it's too bad.

454
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,020
But yeah, that's Dr. Howell Robbins

455
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:54,860
narrating the Arise video still.

456
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:58,320
And this is your host, Reverend Ivan Stankovic.

457
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,300
Once again, you can call the station here

458
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,700
and speak to Will Adobes,

459
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,980
who's got nothing better to do, really,

460
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:08,660
except for praising Bob.

461
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,580
When you're not calling, he's sitting here

462
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,940
with his hands folded praising Bob,

463
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:16,220
whipping himself with a little thin metal chain

464
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,960
until the blood flows freely

465
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,920
because that's how much he loves Bob.

466
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:24,360
Bob doesn't care how much blood comes out, actually,

467
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,640
but, you know, what Will thinks that he does.

468
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:27,920
So.

469
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,440
And that's all that counts.

470
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,680
It's your faith, friends.

471
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,520
Your faith, isn't it?

472
00:23:33,020 --> 00:23:36,060
An adventure that ultimately leads man

473
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:38,240
to confront his own destiny.

474
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:42,240
A shrieking monolith,

475
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:45,500
deliberately buried by an alien intelligence,

476
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:51,060
starts man on a mission half a billion miles into space.

477
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:54,960
Howell, you're the brain and central nervous system of the ship.

478
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:58,100
Does this ever cause you any lack of confidence?

479
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:00,300
Let me put it this way, Mr. Raymer.

480
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:03,060
No 9,000 computer ever made a mistake

481
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:04,380
or distorted information.

482
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,000
Open the pod bay doors, Howell.

483
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,340
Open the bathroom door, Howell.

484
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,120
I'm afraid I can't do that.

485
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,040
Open the bathroom door, Howell.

486
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,800
The divinity and temerity of the human mind itself

487
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,780
does all the work.

488
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,560
The evil ones may just lean back

489
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:27,440
and watch the little humans march gladly,

490
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,260
even proudly,

491
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,120
to their doom.

492
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,040
But we, too, must be vigilant.

493
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,900
For, thanks to the false slack bombarding us daily,

494
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,800
it is terrifyingly easy for even a subgenius

495
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,740
to slip back into normality.

496
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,700
We'll make her one of us.

497
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:48,120
A loving cup. A loving cup.

498
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:53,280
We're going to make you one of the five big cups.

499
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,400
One of us. One of us.

500
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,300
One of us.

501
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:57,820
One of us.

502
00:24:57,820 --> 00:24:59,520
The subgeniuses.

503
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,320
Come on.

504
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:04,020
Join the church, humans.

505
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:07,160
Become the subgeniuses.

506
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:12,920
One of us.

507
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,900
One of us.

508
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,000
Google doggo.

509
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:16,080
Google doggo.

510
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,000
One of us.

511
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:17,860
One of us.

512
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,020
Freak!

513
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:21,240
Freak!

514
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,080
Freak!

515
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:26,640
Tonight, my dear Maxwell,

516
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:31,400
I'm ready to try my experiment on a human.

517
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:32,500
Yes?

518
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,080
There's basically two factions out there right now.

519
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,260
It's us and them.

520
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:44,400
And unfortunately, them is much, much greater than us.

521
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:51,140
The fortunate thing about it is that we know that them are actually working for us,

522
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,940
but them doesn't know that they're working for us.

523
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:57,460
What do you think will be the next obstacle the Earth people will put in our way?

524
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:01,740
Well, as long as they can think, we'll have our problems.

525
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,300
We stand at a crossroads.

526
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:07,960
The tenuous slack that a subgenius may occasionally enjoy

527
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,820
could be rent to shreds at any moment,

528
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:16,460
for the human puppets of the Elder Gods continue their senseless plunge into madness and anti-slack,

529
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:21,740
dragging us and our whole beloved planet ever closer to the brink of destruction.

530
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:31,900
In the name of Bert, and Bert the turtle was very alert.

531
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,080
When danger threatened him, he never got hurt.

532
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,480
He knew just what to do.

533
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:43,280
But then, Bert was 300 miles from the blast epicenter.

534
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:46,020
He's got and cover.

535
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,060
Got and cover.

536
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,680
He did what we all must learn to do.

537
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,180
You and you.

538
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,940
And you.

539
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:55,700
And you.

540
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,620
Got.

541
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:58,600
And cover.

542
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:03,540
Be sure and remember what Bert the turtle just did, friends,

543
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,520
because every one of us must remember to do the same thing.

544
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,620
Hey, Bert, come on out and meet all these nice people, please.

545
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:14,240
Bert can't understand, Mr. Announcer.

546
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,240
He's only a reptile.

547
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,060
Besides, he knows all this advice is pointless.

548
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:23,360
All right, we really can't blame you.

549
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,620
You see, Bert is a very, very careful fellow.

550
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,100
When there's danger, this is the way he keeps from being hurt.

551
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:33,380
Sometimes, it even saves his life.

552
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,500
Sometimes, but not always.

553
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:38,200
Other times, he's killed.

554
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:43,260
But unlike you, Bert's only a badly drawn cartoon character.

555
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:49,340
That's why these children are practicing to duck and cover just as you do in your school.

556
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,000
We all know the atomic bomb is very dangerous.

557
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,600
But did you know that the hydrogen bomb is also dangerous?

558
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:56,600


559
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:03,200
Is it over 100 times more powerful than that little atom bomb that Bert faced in the 50s?

560
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,560
Since it may be used against us, we must get ready for it,

561
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:10,340
just as we are ready for many other dangers that are around us all the time.

562
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:17,540
The only difference is getting ready for the atom bomb is a laughable, pathetic self-delusion.

563
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,320
Fire is a danger.

564
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:22,540
It can burn whole buildings if someone is careless.

565
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:25,460
But if you're 100 miles from a fire,

566
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:27,780
you won't get radiation sickness.

567
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,920
But we are ready for fire.

568
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:33,260
We have a fine fire department to put out the fire.

569
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,820
And you have fire drills in your school so you know what to do.

570
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,480
Automobiles can be dangerous too.

571
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:43,960
Especially to Bert, when he tries to migrate across highways.

572
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:45,340
But we are ready.

573
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,060
We have safety rules that car drivers and people who are walking must obey.

574
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:53,380
In the aftermath of a nuclear attack, there are no rules.

575
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:55,300
It's dog eat dog.

576
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:55,440
It's a fire.

577
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,540
Or turtle.

578
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,260
Yes, you may love the family pet now,

579
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:04,280
but you'll love Rover even more when he's the last thing left to eat in the fallout shelter.

580
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,140
Next to you...

581
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:07,740
Remember, Bob will be right back.

582
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,520
Help Bob battle the satanic seduction of America's youth.

583
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,900
Now we must be ready for a new danger,

584
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,260
the atomic bomb.

585
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:53,640
First, you'll have to know what happens when an atomic bomb explodes.

586
00:29:54,280 --> 00:29:55,440
Not that that will lead to a nuclear an-

587
00:29:55,440 --> 00:30:02,700
do you any good? You'll know when it comes. For one-eighth of a nanosecond, not even time enough

588
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:09,280
to pray. We hope it never comes, but we must get ready. So start praying now. It looks something

589
00:30:09,280 --> 00:30:14,180
like this. There is a bright flash, brighter than the sun, brighter than anything you've ever seen.

590
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:20,240
And certainly much brighter than anything you'll ever see afterwards with your melted corneas

591
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:26,940
running down your cheeks like useless tears. If you are not ready and did not know what to do,

592
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:33,800
it could hurt you in different ways. Some of these ways, like leukemia and impotence,

593
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:39,020
may not even show up for months or years. Others, like the melting of eyeballs,

594
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:45,740
you'll notice immediately. It could knock you down hard or throw you against a tree or a wall.

595
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:50,080
At such a high velocity that you are cut in half or smashed.

596
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:56,560
Into a boat. What is such a big explosion? It can smash in buildings and knock signboards over

597
00:30:56,560 --> 00:31:02,720
and break windows all over town. If the town is 400 miles away. Otherwise,

598
00:31:02,980 --> 00:31:11,380
it'll disintegrate your town instantly, atom by atom, if you're lucky. But if you duck and cover

599
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:19,700
like Bert, you'll be much safer. Of course, Bert is a turtle with a shell or bony carapace.

600
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:24,800
His ancestors survived the explosion that destroyed the mighty dinosaurs.

601
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:30,480
But your meat is protected only by a thin bag called the skin.

602
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:37,100
You know how bad sunburn can feel. The atomic bomb flash could burn you worse than a terrible

603
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:44,440
sunburn. Worse than Freddy Krueger. Especially when you're not covered. Now, you and I don't

604
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:48,980
have shells to crawl into like Bert the turtle, so we have to cover up in our own way.

605
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,220
Such a bad sunburn can feel. But if you're not covered, you're not covered. You're not covered.

606
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:56,120
It's a cave lined with 10-foot thick lead walls 50 miles underground. That's what our president

607
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:04,400
and chiefs of staff would use. But for the rest of us, first you duck, and then you cover. Then

608
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:10,680
you kiss your bottom goodbye. And very tightly, you cover the back of your neck, your face.

609
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:18,120
Duck and cover underneath a table or desk. Preferably a table or desk made of 10-foot thick

610
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,200
lead. Or anything else close to it. And then you're covered. And then you're covered. And then you're

611
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,600
covered. And then you're covered. And then you're covered. And then you're covered. And then you're

612
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,280
covered. In Betty's school, they're talking about the atomic bomb, too. Betty is asking her

613
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:32,180
teacher, how can we tell when the atomic bomb may explode? And her teacher is explaining that

614
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:38,680
there are two kinds of attack. With warning, and without any warning. Too bad they don't even use

615
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:45,200
atomic bombs anymore. We think that most of the time, we will be warned before the bomb explodes.

616
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:50,200
So there will be time for us to get into our home, schools, or some other safe place.

617
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:57,580
place. And time to launch retaliatory rockets to wipe out all of Russia, Cuba, China, and Northern

618
00:32:57,580 --> 00:33:04,560
Europe. Our civil defense workers and our men in uniform will do everything they can to warn us

619
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:11,540
before enemy planes can bring a bomb near us. Of course, if a bomb should explode even before it

620
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:20,100
gets near us, all radios, TVs, and telephones will be useless. You may be in your schoolyard playing

621
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:29,000
when the signal comes. That signal means to stop whatever you are doing and get to the nearest safe

622
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:37,720
place fast. If the nearest safe place is Antarctica or the North Pole, hurry there. Always remember,

623
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,360
a flash of an atomic bomb can come at any time.

624
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:46,480
No matter where you may be. You might be out playing at home when the warning comes.

625
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:54,860
Then be sure to get into the house fast, for your parents have fixed a safe place for you to go.

626
00:33:55,340 --> 00:34:04,360
Or else a syringe full of euthanasia to end your suffering before it starts. That is, if your parents aren't both at work.

627
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,160
If you are not close to home when you hear the warning, go to the nearest safe cover.

628
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,520
No one will be able to stop you.

629
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,840
You may be in a safe place, but you may not know where you are to go. Or ask an older person to help you.

630
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:24,220
Very old people are easier to butcher for food in case you're trapped with them in a caved-in basement for a long period of time.

631
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:30,200
You know the places marked with the S sign? They're safe places to go when you hear the alarm.

632
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:38,740
Or at least that's what they want you to think. But since all radios will instantly fall silent in case of an attack,

633
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:41,500
you might never even hear the alarm.

634
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:46,240
If there is a warning, you will hear it before the bomb.

635
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:04,400
But sometimes, and this is very, very important, sometimes the bomb might explode without any warning.

636
00:35:05,060 --> 00:35:07,780
This is what to do if you should be in a corridor.

637
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,380
You duck and cover tight against the walls.

638
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:11,840
You fall this way.

639
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:19,260
With a fallout shelter wrapped snugly around your body and with your hands raised up to heaven in supplication.

640
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,540
Remember to keep your face and the back of your neck covered tightly.

641
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:26,220
Or you'll end up looking like Freddy.

642
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:30,600
Try to fall away from windows or doors with glass in them.

643
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:34,540
Then, if the glass breaks and flies through the air, it won't cut you.

644
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,400
Maybe.

645
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,960
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop.

646
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,620
Bop bop bop bop bop bop bop bop.

647
00:35:41,380 --> 00:35:43,480
Bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom-bom

648
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,600
What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What? What?

649
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,600
What? No! No! No! No! It can't be! Not now!

650
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,720
You might be eating your lunch when the flash comes.

651
00:35:55,060 --> 00:35:57,140
Duck and cover under the table.

652
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:01,000
Then, if the explosion makes anything in the room fall down...

653
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:01,840
Like the walls.

654
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:03,520
It can't fall on you.

655
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:08,900
Getting ready means we will all have to be able to take care of ourselves.

656
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,280
The bomb might explode when there are no grown-ups near.

657
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,400
Like in Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.

658
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:20,300
Paul and Patty know this, and they're always ready to take care of themselves.

659
00:36:21,260 --> 00:36:24,440
Here they are on their way to school on a beautiful spring day.

660
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:32,060
But no matter where they go or what they do, they always try to remember what to do if the atom bomb explodes right then.

661
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:40,180
And because they grew up thinking about the atom bomb, they also are often out visiting the child psychiatrist.

662
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,900
It's a bomb. Duck and cover.

663
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,700
Paul and Patty know what to do.

664
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,040
Paul covered the back of his head so that he wouldn't be burned.

665
00:36:49,220 --> 00:36:52,160
And Patty covered herself with the coat she was carrying.

666
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:57,840
Of course, both protective items were burned off of them in just a matter of seconds.

667
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,840
They knew how to duck and cover.

668
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,040
They acted right away.

669
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,280
Not that it did them much good.

670
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:12,840
If they had been at this doorway when the bomb flashed, Paul and Patty would have ducked and covered this way, like this girl.

671
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:17,720
As you can see by this shot of her skeleton huddled safely in the doorway.

672
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:21,060
Heavy doorways are a good place to duck and cover.

673
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:23,060
She will be safer, too.

674
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:26,920
At least she won't have to worry about the bomb anymore.

675
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,620
Here's Tony going to his Cub Scout meeting.

676
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:35,000
Tony knows the bomb can explode any time of the year, day or night.

677
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,580
That's why he's autistic.

678
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:40,120
Attaboy, Tony. That flash means act fast.

679
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,520
Tony knows that it helps to get to any kind of cover.

680
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,520
This wall was close by, so that's where he ducked and covered.

681
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:50,260
And that's where his body is still buried.

682
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,300
Tony knew what to do. Notice how he keeps from moving or from getting up and running?

683
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:56,920
That's because he's dead.

684
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,600
The man helping Tony is a civil defense officer.

685
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:04,380
His job is to bury the bodies in quick line.

686
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,440
We must obey the civil defense worker.

687
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,800
Especially if he has a gun.

688
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:16,740
We must know how to duck and cover in the school bus or in any other bus or streetcar.

689
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,880
Duck and cover.

690
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:22,400
Don't wait. Duck away from the windows fast.

691
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:25,880
The glass may break and fly through the air and cut you.

692
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,660
Into little tiny pieces.

693
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,340
No matter where we live.

694
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,760
In the city or the country.

695
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,340
We must be ready all the time for the atomic bomb.

696
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:37,200
Duck and cover.

697
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,540
That's the first thing to do.

698
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,640
Duck and cover.

699
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:46,420
The next important thing to do after that is to stay covered until the danger is over.

700
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,180
Which could be up to 90 years.

701
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,640
Yes, we must all get ready now.

702
00:38:52,900 --> 00:38:57,360
So we know how to save ourselves if the atomic bomb ever explodes near us.

703
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,600
Move to Antarctica today.

704
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,280
Older people will help us as they always do.

705
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,740
There might not be any grown-ups around when the bomb explodes.

706
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,420
Then, you're on your own.

707
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,280
You're on your own.

708
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:12,800
You're on your own.

709
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,300
You're on your own.

710
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,840
You're on your own.

711
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,320
You're on your own.

712
00:39:17,880 --> 00:39:18,780
You're on your own.

713
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:30,580
Be it by the nuclear kiss of Jehovah-1.

714
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,240
Ecological disaster.

715
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,640
Or invasion by hostile aliens.

716
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,320
Which will it be?

717
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,660
Destruction of planet Earth?

718
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:44,040
Or eternal slack under the benevolent rule of Bob?

719
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,820
Or are the two the same?

720
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,300
This world is a time for destruction.

721
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,560
You say it can't be true.

722
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,700
Jesus began to give to them the signs.

723
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,280
Of his coming and the end of the age.

724
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:08,380
And one of the signs he referred to was the abomination of desolation that was spoken of by Daniel the prophet.

725
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:13,480
Exactly as Noah getting into the ark triggered the deluge that destroyed the Earth in his day.

726
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:22,020
And that it's very highly possible that when this all takes place that a great cataclysmic judgment will do that very thing.

727
00:40:22,340 --> 00:40:24,520
God will destroy this country.

728
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:25,580
Cities in America.

729
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,460
Cities in this nation.

730
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:29,600
Literally instantly destroyed.

731
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,060
Well, we've done it.

732
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,280
Gee, I can't wait till that Bob time train comes around the bend.

733
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:55,220
Oh look out son, here it comes now.

734
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,680
It's frightening, isn't it?

735
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:07,060
It's unbelievably big and scary.

736
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,580
It's net wrenchingly large.

737
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:16,000
We stand to receive the war of the flesh and understand not the way of the lead clad ones.

738
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,420
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a

739
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,020
It's not natural.

740
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,760
Here was a weird idea.

741
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,820
Haven't I stood here and nursed dying dogs?

742
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:26,960
Yeah.

743
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:29,180
And even that miserable cat?

744
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,000
Agony!

745
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,800
I can't stand this torture!

746
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,700
Stealing through my body!

747
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:53,000
Creeping through my veins!

748
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:56,880
Pouring in my blood!

749
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,880
Oh, darts of fire in my brain!

750
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,180
17 out of 37 of the murderers,

751
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:13,980
13 out of 145 foragers,

752
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:20,120
15 out of 125 cases of assault and battery

753
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,580
were addicts of marijuana.

754
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:27,040
But I'm afraid that my words will not impress you.

755
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:29,740
So allow me to give you a few scenes

756
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:32,560
that I know will have a lasting impression.

757
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,780
You think Jesus had it bad?

758
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:38,040
Oh, Jesus had to work an 80-hour week?

759
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:40,000
Oh, boy, gee, they call him a...

760
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,980
Friends, they're gonna nail you up on the cross

761
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:44,420
with a lesser plot, you know.

762
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,740
Oh, no, no, no, they'll make you nail yourself up.

763
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,540
And you'll be glad to know it's 20% interest.

764
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:52,300
But how do you put it?

765
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:52,980
What's the matter?

766
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,140
You know what that left hand is?

767
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,840
How are you gonna get the right one in?

768
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:59,160
You'll have to pay somebody,

769
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:01,620
but you're not gonna get your water out of your pocket.

770
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,320
Why, you can think about that.

771
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,100
But come the Holocaust,

772
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:10,420
and you're crawling out of the rubble,

773
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,220
your fingers falling off your hair,

774
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,760
blowing off your head in the wind,

775
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:16,380
looking for flashlight batteries,

776
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:17,720
will you be saying,

777
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:21,320
gosh, if only I'd read that book of the subgenius a little closer,

778
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,720
I'd know what to do at a time like this.

779
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,980
And on that day, my friend,

780
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:28,360
your soul will be laid bare

781
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:31,920
to the eye of the great stark fist of removal

782
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,240
that hummers above you all the time.

783
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:38,020
You'll be necking, necking to Wotan,

784
00:43:38,020 --> 00:43:40,560
and it will know then

785
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:43,980
whether you really believed in Bob Dobbs or not,

786
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,920
because your belief in Bob or your life

787
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,900
will be all you have left.

788
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:52,560
1, 2, 3, 4.

789
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:05,500
I have seen the sleeping nights of Jesus

790
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:13,340
Gazing out across the open sea

791
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,460
I have seen the sleeping nights

792
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,520
of Jesus

793
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,440
Gazing out across the open sea

794
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:29,440
And they look extremely tired to me

795
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,380
Gazing out across the open sea

796
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:37,940
Dying of starvation in the gutter

797
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:40,460
Gazing out across the open sea

798
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:45,740
That is all the future holds for me

799
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:47,800
Gazing out across the open sea

800
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:51,460
For alcoholic poisoning

801
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:55,540
In the toilet of my choice

802
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:01,480
That's all there is as far as I can see

803
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:09,680
Fried to death in seconds by the Russians

804
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,640
By the Russians

805
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:17,160
Or if you're lucky just a sudden stroke

806
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:17,780
By the Russians

807
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:19,080
Or if you're lucky just a sudden stroke

808
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:23,660
A lingering death from fallout

809
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:27,100
As your teeth and hair fall out

810
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:33,040
A certain death from cancer if you smoke

811
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:41,200
For I have seen the sleeping nights of Jesus

812
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:47,760
Gazing out across the open sea

813
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,020
Gazing out across the open sea

814
00:45:51,620 --> 00:45:52,780
Gazing out across the open sea

815
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:57,000
I have seen the sleeping nights of Jesus

816
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,260
Gazing out across the open sea

817
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:04,840
And they look extremely tired to me

818
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:07,560
Gazing out across the open sea

819
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,660
Put your faith in God

820
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:12,960
He won't expect you

821
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,400
Gazing out across the open sea

822
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:18,580
Put your faith in death

823
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:20,600
Because it's free

824
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:24,160
Put your faith in death

825
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:24,160


826
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:26,660
If you believe in nothing

827
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:30,420
Honey, it believes in you

828
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:36,420
For God's sake don't waste any faith on me

829
00:46:36,420 --> 00:46:39,800
For God's sake don't waste any faith on me

830
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:44,620
When it comes to judge us in his glory

831
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:44,720
When it comes to judge us in his glory

832
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,680
When it comes to judge us in his glory

833
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:52,440
Then we'll see how old a man can get

834
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:55,500
When it comes to judge us in his glory

835
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:58,460
He must be feeling ancient

836
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:02,100
Up there on the rim of space

837
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:08,120
Two thousand years and he ain't been back yet

838
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,080
Two thousand years and he ain't been back yet

839
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:11,560
But

840
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:16,420
I have seen the sleeping nights of Jesus

841
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:18,560
Rub their eyes

842
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:24,040
Rub their eyes and keep at what they see

843
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:32,360
I have seen the sleeping nights of Jesus

844
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:39,800
And it looks as though they've noticed me

845
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:47,680
And it looks as though they've noticed me

846
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,360
And it looks as though they've noticed me

847
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:04,280
And that was Robin Hitchcock, dear friends, brought to you by the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

848
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,760
Robin Hitchcock and the Egyptians.

849
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:14,900
The song we played earlier in the hour, Uncorrected Personality Traits, was also by him.

850
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:19,500
And as I said before, most of the stuff we're playing tonight was, um,

851
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:28,040
Well, uh, a Wilton Ivanstang edit of a Nancy Regalia pre-edit.

852
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:35,780
Nancy sent us a mighty mound of tape pre-cut and we went and cut it further.

853
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:39,180
And that's what you often hear on this show.

854
00:48:40,180 --> 00:48:43,640
Tapes sent in by subgeniuses out there.

855
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,080
And you can send your tapes in if you want.

856
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,880
No guarantees, dear friends.

857
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:57,140
We're not responsible for unsolicited materials.

858
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:01,800
But we send a lot of unsolicited materials out.

859
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:03,920
And you can get some of those

860
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,520
unsolicited materials from us

861
00:49:08,520 --> 00:49:12,260
by writing for free information from

862
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:17,500
Bob.

863
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:20,900
Yes, old Bob.

864
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:23,780
Bob Dobbs. J.R. Bob Dobbs.

865
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:27,540
Not to be confused with Reverend Bob, who performs, uh,

866
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:32,220
here in Dallas, does a very funny take-off on fundamentalist preachers.

867
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:32,900
That's different.

868
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,780
He's been doing it for a long time,

869
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:40,360
but the Church of the Subgenius has been doing it since time began.

870
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:50,460
You can write Bob at P.O. Box 140306

871
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:57,500
in Dallas, Texas 75214.

872
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:03,900
That's Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

873
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,500
Talk to him and he'll guide you.

874
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,820
You know, Bob, I'm not gonna go there.

875
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:17,860
I've been thinking about maybe writing to the Church for a long time.

876
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:18,600
But you're thinking,

877
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,180
oh, no, I don't want to get wrapped up in a cult.

878
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:29,160
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

879
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:33,880
That's too good of a start.

880
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,860
late for some people. Actually, I believe in the upcoming weeks you'll be able to read

881
00:50:38,860 --> 00:50:46,700
about Church of the Subgenius and Bob Dobbs and Zippy the Pinhead, I think, is going to

882
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:52,860
be mentioning Bob in the next couple of weeks. The New Yorker magazine will have some new

883
00:50:52,860 --> 00:51:00,360
art by St. Palmer Vreedys about the church. And, of course, if you want to fly up to New

884
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:07,080
York, you can always go see the gallery show at Psychedelic Solutions. No one in Dallas

885
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:15,800
would ever want to show subgenius art, would you? And I don't blame you a bit, because

886
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:23,680
I don't want to either. Too much trouble. And, you know, see, the thing is, we're into

887
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:28,520
slack. Bob promised us slack, and we took it.

888
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,340
Bob helped me with the show, and I'm glad he did.

889
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:30,340


890
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:38,220
He helps those who help themselves. And I think those of you with any level of enlightenment

891
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:45,860
should be able to understand that much. Shouldn't you? Yeah, you really should. And you should

892
00:51:45,860 --> 00:51:52,120
also remember your pledges to KON, dear friends. Hey, next week, I think, yeah, next week we've

893
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:59,340
got the pledge drive coming up. I love pledge drives, because that's when we get to act

894
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,340
like regular people.

895
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,800
We get to act like religious people. We get to act like respectable religions. We get

896
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:12,260
to act like Christians. And beg money. And talk about nothing but money. And not actually

897
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:18,880
help anybody. Not actually give out any slack at all, but merely get money. Money for the

898
00:52:18,880 --> 00:52:24,800
station. And believe you me, the station needs it. That's why we don't have to feel guilty

899
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:30,340
about it, even though we're not forgiven by Bob. He only gives us an excuse. But we're

900
00:52:30,340 --> 00:52:30,340


901
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:36,600
not forgiven. Yet, even though we're not forgiven, we can beg for money, because it's for the

902
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:49,500
station and not for us. Don't worry, we get our money. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. And well, you'll

903
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:50,400
see why. Thank you all.

904
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:06,440
And when the demons, oh, when the demons try to tell you that, you think you're hearing

905
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:14,520
a satire. Oh, one day you'll find yourself up to your neck in false drugs, false sex,

906
00:53:14,620 --> 00:53:26,680
false jobs, false money. And you'll say, but where's Bob? Where's Bob? You mean, you mean

907
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:30,080
there really is a conspiracy?

908
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:30,340
Yeah.

909
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:39,600
You mean there really was a Bob? You mean, you mean I could have had slack and I would?

910
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,480
It's going to be up to you. It's going to be up to you. What are you going to let happen

911
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:49,280
to this planet? What are you going to do about it? Bob's going to let you decide what to

912
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:55,800
do about it. Is that what you're going to, are you just going to sit there? They won't

913
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:59,960
even have to do it. Bob won't even have to see that the end of the world happens properly.

914
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:02,080
It'll happen by accident.

915
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:08,500
There are a lot of well-meaning people that are involved in this thing, but it is satanic.

916
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:16,140
Now let me tell you, we talk about Christianity and Satan is very brilliant at maneuvering

917
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:20,000
the church into a position that is opposed to God.

918
00:54:20,540 --> 00:54:24,340
Hi Bob. I just want to call and tell you that I praise God for you and your show and what

919
00:54:24,340 --> 00:54:25,140
you're doing out there.

920
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:30,160
Well, that's nice. What do you think about today's discussion, Ed?

921
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:30,340
I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea. I think

922
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:30,860
it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great idea. I think it's a great

923
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:30,860


924
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:35,540
Well, it's kind of scary to me. I'm only catching parts of it because I'm at work. But it's

925
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,120
pretty disgusting what's happening out there.

926
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:37,800
It is.

927
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:43,040
Suicide to most everyone, but to me it's murdered by marijuana.

928
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:49,360
I think you should be the first one to know. Your daughter Joan drove into my house in

929
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:49,900
the nude.

930
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,340
In the what?

931
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:52,720
In the nude.

932
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,960
Well, where did she get it?

933
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,180
Where did she get what?

934
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:58,120
Well, what was it you said?

935
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,180
Oh God.

936
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:00,320
Oh God.

937
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:00,320


938
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:00,320


939
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:00,320


940
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:00,320


941
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:00,320


942
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,560
Oh, it's coming off.

943
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:03,360
Yes, it's all coming off.

944
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:09,540
Better, more terrific than you've ever seen it before in Striparama, in gorgeous color,

945
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:15,800
starring the three greatest names in burlesque. The incomparable Lily St. Cyr, America's foremost

946
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:22,880
strip tune. That red-headed cyclone, Georgia Southern, the fastest girl in burlesque. The

947
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,820
exciting Rosita Royce and her clothes-stealing dove.

948
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:38,300
The most beautiful, tantalizing, titillating, shapely lineup of strip stars ever seen in

949
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:53,280
one show before. Including the national pin-up queen, Betty Page. And the breathtaking Venus

950
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,580
Beauty, everyone a contest winner.

951
00:55:56,840 --> 00:56:00,300
The feminist dupes of the conspiracy charge that not a single woman in the world has ever

952
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:00,300


953
00:56:00,320 --> 00:56:00,520
been an example of women.

954
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:00,520


955
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:01,400
But not enough members are women.

956
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,400
Bob would agree to that.

957
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:08,320
Indeed, he would say, there will never be enough women.

958
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:12,460
But at least the ones we have are all women.

959
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:14,360
And Bob?

960
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:22,200
Bob is all man, the James Bond of Zen masters, the most dashing religious leader of his time.

961
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,620
Let's get really bad together.

962
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:35,680
Baby, I'll be like you never done before

963
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:41,860
Let's get really better together, baby

964
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:47,380
And climb the highest plateau of our love

965
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:52,320
Oh, you boring little creep

966
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:55,060
Don't say that this ain't love

967
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,740
I know it in my sleep

968
00:56:57,740 --> 00:57:01,100
It swept out of the barb

969
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,180
And snatched me in its claws

970
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:05,960
And flew off in the air

971
00:57:07,880 --> 00:57:11,800
Let's get really better together, baby

972
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,680
I'll be like you never done before

973
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:22,940
Let's get really better together, baby

974
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:27,720
And climb the highest plateau of our love

975
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,480
Oh, you dismal little twerp

976
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:36,040
Don't say that you don't care

977
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:38,880
Don't tell me it won't work

978
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:41,520
I feel it in the air

979
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:44,120
And like a dying tree

980
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,940
It blows up in the wind

981
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:52,900
Let's get really better together, baby

982
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,520
I'll be like you never done before

983
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:03,500
Let's get really better together, baby

984
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:09,140
And climb the highest plateau of our love

985
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:15,100
Let's get really better together, baby

986
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:23,220
You need to say that Bob has actually had one of those horrible diseases?

987
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:25,140
That isn't true, Doctor.

988
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,220
Is that true, Bob?

989
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:28,320
Just a minute, Sally.

990
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:29,740
One scandal at a time.

991
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:34,780
Yes, Bob Dobbs is a sex ghost.

992
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:40,380
A blazing rebuttal that strips bare the pretenses of blue-nosed critics.

993
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:43,580
A shameless revelation of the shamming pricks

994
00:58:43,580 --> 00:58:47,900
who say they're shocked by legs, laughs, and a lavish layout of lovely.

995
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:49,980
Yes, here's the answer.

996
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:52,220
And it's going to make their heads swim,

997
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:53,760
their eyes goggle,

998
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,120
and bring a burning blush to their cheeks.

999
00:58:56,300 --> 00:58:56,360
Yes.

1000
00:58:56,940 --> 00:58:57,200
Yes.

1001
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:57,200


1002
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:57,200


1003
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:57,200


1004
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:57,200


1005
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:57,200


1006
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:57,200


1007
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:57,200


1008
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:57,200


1009
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:57,200


1010
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,320
A gold-color motion picture

1011
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:02,280
bursting with the most beautiful array of keyhole cuties,

1012
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,880
curvy uncover girls,

1013
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:06,340
languorous long-stem lovelies,

1014
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:09,080
and naughty nifties that ever burnt up a screen.

1015
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,960
It's the picture that brings to bear

1016
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:13,600
every bang, bounce, and bump

1017
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:15,440
in the burlesque book of beauty.

1018
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:19,400
I saw my brother die.

1019
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,020
I saw the man's face.

1020
00:59:23,100 --> 00:59:24,200
I feel,

1021
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:26,780
and my guts are rotting with that,

1022
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:27,060
that truth.

1023
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,180
I'm gonna get my gun and

1024
00:59:29,180 --> 00:59:30,920
bury me an angel,

1025
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,480
a howling hellcat,

1026
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:37,460
humping a hot steel hog on a roaring rampage of revenge.

1027
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:43,460
Whipped into a blazing frenzy of violence.

1028
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:47,460
Twisted by torment.

1029
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:51,700
A sadistic she-devil

1030
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:56,380
leading a pair of perverts on a raging ride through hell.

1031
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:57,820
As you all know,

1032
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,800
for one thing and one thing only do we need men.

1033
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:04,320
The book that couldn't be written

1034
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,180
is now the motion picture that couldn't be made.

1035
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,920
Oh, yeah, dear friend.

1036
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:15,960
Well, you know,

1037
01:00:16,060 --> 01:00:19,080
Kathy is late to do her show,

1038
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:20,160
Kathy's potluck.

1039
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,220
She's on her way.

1040
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:21,660
What?

1041
01:00:21,740 --> 01:00:24,900
The rural Fellini serves up a colossal motion picture

1042
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,760
geared for the young and old alike.

1043
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:26,760


1044
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:26,760


1045
01:00:26,780 --> 01:00:29,240
The sophisticate and the blue collar.

1046
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:32,200
A motion picture born to entertainment.

1047
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,260
Vibrant, spellbinding, jarring, rocking,

1048
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:40,240
yet so hilariously funny in its delivery.

1049
01:00:40,780 --> 01:00:42,700
Russ Meyer's super victims.

1050
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:46,860
An all-out assault on today's sexual mores and more.

1051
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:49,700
A frontal attack against women's lib.

1052
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,020
Blasting through the male machismo syndrome.

1053
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,000
Kicking the crap out of conventions.

1054
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:56,320
Hang-ups.

1055
01:00:56,380 --> 01:00:56,760
Chicks.

1056
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:56,760


1057
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:56,760


1058
01:00:56,760 --> 01:00:56,760


1059
01:00:56,780 --> 01:00:57,200
Convictions.

1060
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:57,900
Obsessions.

1061
01:00:58,140 --> 01:00:59,040
The whole thing.

1062
01:00:59,820 --> 01:01:00,460
Cops.

1063
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:01,080
