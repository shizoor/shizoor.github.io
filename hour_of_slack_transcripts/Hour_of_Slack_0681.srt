1
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:03,940
Stir it up!

2
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:24,160
At last I have control of your radio tubes!

3
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,740
And I do too!

4
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,300
Good! This is Rand Hort!

5
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:31,500
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Rand and Stimpy Show!

6
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:35,600
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack on KNON!

7
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,580
Keep listening, you idiots!

8
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:49,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:51,040
Else I shall kill you!

10
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,600
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen!

11
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,280
Tonight we add another name to the long list of those we have honored.

12
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,340
This truth that I'm about to give you has exploded in power!

13
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,920
Thank you, though, I'm enjoying this.

14
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:15,140
Buried within the uncharted depths of waters surrounding a group of islands off the 50th parallel

15
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:17,680
lies man's most formidable challenge.

16
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:26,100
The awesome awakening of prehistoric monsters longed for extinction.

17
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:37,160
Savage and deadly, their one hope is to rule our planet as they once had thousands of years back.

18
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,540
And that ain't all!

19
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,620
Science was baffled and powerless.

20
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,480
This is confusing!

21
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,220
A terror-stricken humanity knew that it was on the brink of total destruction.

22
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,960
Well, things are looking up!

23
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,940
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,200
A once proud civilization...

25
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:03,940
Now had to place its trust and hope in Godzilla and his powerful ally...

26
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:04,780
Bob...

27
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,220
Titan against Titan.

28
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,780
Giant against giant in the most spectacular battle yet.

29
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,460
But things weren't normal.

30
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,460
There were changes.

31
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:13,980
Ah!

32
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:14,860
Ah!

33
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:15,440
Ah!

34
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:15,620
Ah!

35
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,940
Your mother bit me!

36
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,780
I never saw him by my bed.

37
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,080
It's a beautiful sight!

38
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:22,800
Strange, frightful changes.

39
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,260
That night, it all started.

40
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,680
Stop doing that!

41
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:27,660
Ah!

42
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,100
Ah!

43
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,340
Ah!

44
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,740
This was the night of the crawling terror.

45
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,380
American Impact represents...

46
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:38,920
The Self-Genius Hour of Swag!

47
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:50,780
Hosted by your friend and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

48
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:54,020
Uh, yes, uh, thank you, Joe.

49
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:58,140
Uh, uh, join tonight, dear friends, by...

50

Uh, yes, uh, thank you, Joe. Uh, uh, join tonight, dear friends, by...

51
00:02:58,300 --> 00:03:05,040
Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence, yes, and of course, uh, Reverend Joe Riley, whose...

52
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,960
whose, uh, brand new media barrage tape you'll be hearing.

53
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,220
The...

54
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,280
The... Cuts...

55
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,040
The... Cuts... Of...

56
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,140
Have the technology, have the tapes.

57
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,260
Bob told me to make this, not gonna resist.

58
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,200
And if during the proceedings a small chlorine-oxypropylene bag should drop down, open the receiving flap and inhale deeply.

59
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,140
Don't ask questions.

60
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,980
Prepare to have your mind scanned for possible bozosaurant traces.

61
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,020
Scanning now.

62
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:39,680
Continuing.

63
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,080
Take notes if need be.

64
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:41,980
Call for assistance.

65
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,400
Operators are standing by.

66
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:44,400
Forward when notified.

67
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,260
Void when prohibited.

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:46,140
Visitors only.

69
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,000
Ten minute parking.

70
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:52,680
Do not fold, spindle, or mutilate, except in the presence of Krishna, Muhammad, Buddha, Jehovah, Vincent Price, or Bob.

71
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,720
It's Candy Frappy.

72
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,040
It's Frappy Candy.

73
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:11,820
Stop.

74
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:12,260
Huh?

75
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,600
You're both right.

76
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,620
Introducing new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

77
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,220
Stripes and stripes and stripes of colors, colors, colors, colors, and colors.

78
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,200
Colors that go below infrared and way above ultraviolet.

79
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,180
And the taste?

80
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,540
Yeah, Frappy Candy.

81
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,680
Well, I can see these two won't need any words or worms for several days now, I should say, I think.

82
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,720
So don't forget.

83
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,800
That's new Candy Frappy Frappy Candy.

84
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,300
Now with extra dimension Love Hamster 16.

85
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,680
Tell Jeff and all your Acer friends this one's the beans for maximum best fun.

86
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:48,000
Candy Frappy Frappy Candy from Squidco, the Gobi Bar People.

87
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,900
The proceedings will cause brain damage.

88
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,260
Nothing to fear.

89
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:01,600
Buy something and inhale its fumes.

O Lord of heaven above earth.

129
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:05,740
Bless our overlords for protecting us from our wretched selves.

130
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,860
May we be blessed with a lust for submission and guidance.

131
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,800
May we think of the Lord and not of pain.

132
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,700
Authority is great.

133
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,160
Ignorance is bliss.

134
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,960
Peace is war with the devil.

135
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:28,700
This is the word of the Lord.

136
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,780
Amen.

137
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:38,000
Welcome to yet another Bulldada Audio Barrage Day.

138
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,240
Volume 1 couldn't possibly hold all the eclectic propaganda needed

139
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,640
to become a complete raving lunatic for Bob.

Oh, hi there.

147
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,040
How do you do?

148
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,120
I'm your new neighbor, Herman Munster.

149
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:37,920
Thank you.

150
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:40,980
Welcome to Mission Control, space travelers.

151
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:52,500
What's up, genius?

152
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,880
What the hell are you doing, Lee?

153
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,860
I'm watching Bob.

154
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,960
You know, he's a lot less patronizing than Crusty used to be.

155
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,300
You backstabber.

156
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:00,820
You traitor.

157
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:01,280
You...

158
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:02,600
Snap out of it, Bart.

159
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,020
Um, I lost my job.

160
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,840
I had a job.

161
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:06,760
Now I don't have a lot.

162
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,560
I want you to be like me.

163
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,760
I want you to worship me.

164
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,420
I want you to be like I am.

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,680
I want you to enjoy the fearlessness that I have.

166
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,080
The courage that I have.

167
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,600
The compassion that I have.

168
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,940
The love that I have.

169
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,140
The all-encompassing...

170
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,480
The mercy that I have.

171
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,700
I want you to be what I am and something greater.

172
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,100
I want you to give you more than I have.

173
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,040
I want you to be greater than I am.

174
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,900
And if you don't want to go this route,

175
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:35,700
then go to hell where you want to, but don't bother me.

176
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:39,220
Heal my toe, honey.

177
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,260
Heal my back.

178
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,320
Heal my bottom.

179
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:44,340
But don't you heal my mind, because my mind is too sick.

180
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:47,860
Christianity was never based on the idea of an unknown God.

181
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,760
I'm going to cause you to know that you are what Jesus was.

182
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,880
Jesus said that...

183
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,340
Every human being was a God.

184
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,880
It is written that ye are gods.

185
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,040
I'm a God and you're a God.

186
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,300
And I'm a God and I'm going to stay a God until you recognize that you're a God.

187
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:07,860
And when you recognize you're a God, I shall go back into principle and will not appear as a personality.

188
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,340
You are a God.

189
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:13,940
But until I see all of you knowing who you are, I'm going to be very much what I am.

190
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,540
God Almighty God!

191
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,100
Call the next defendant.

192
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,040
K. Bridges to the bar.

193
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,420
The next defendant is K. Bridges to the bar.

194
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:43,780
Silence, K.

195
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:50,540
Yes, your hands are covered with the blood of the thousands of souls that you have murdered.

196
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,080
Murder?

197
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,140


198
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,280
Yes, that's right.

199
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,080
But I never murdered anyone.

200
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,100
Not with a sword.

201
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,940
But you have sentenced a thousand souls to hell with your malicious tongue.

202
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,400
It would have been a thousand times better had you murdered them with a sword.

203
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,020
Oh, no.

204
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:11,180
But I never said anything about anyone except what was true.

205
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:13,220
I only spoke the truth.

206
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,600
No, K. You spoke that which you wanted to be true.

207
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,520
But granting that you did only speak the truth.

208
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,140
who gave you license to defame and destroy the character of others.

209
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,120
The serpent with his venom and his ire,

210
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,040
with his slimy, slithery foes and his noiseless crawl,

211
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,340
with his deadly call and fatal fang,

212
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,100
is the only fit emblem of the man or woman

213
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:42,160
who stabs and kills the character of another.

214
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:45,080
Let your own words condemn you.

215
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,240
May 10th, 1973.

216
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:56,940
Linda's been such a good friend in spiritual health.

217
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,000
Well, when you've known her as long as I have,

218
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:01,880
you'll really get to know her.

219
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,500
What do you mean?

220
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,720
She's not as concerned about your spiritual life as you think.

221
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,680
But I'm not one to say anything.

222
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,340
You just call me when you need advice.

223
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,080
Well, I've got a lot to do. I have to go.

224
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:19,380
Goodbye.

225
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:22,440
Goodbye.

226
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,980
Well, I didn't think being a Christian was going to be like that.

227
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:30,780
I don't believe I want any part of it.

228
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,400
Oh, no.

229
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,380
Oh, my God. My God, have mercy on me.

230
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:45,240
I never realized. Have mercy on me.

231
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,480
You, Kay, with your gossipy tongue,

232
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,460
have driven the babes away.

233
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:51,300
You have driven the babes away from my church.

234
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:55,960
You have in your lifetime destroyed the weak among my flock.

235
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,840
You never knew what it meant to show mercy.

236
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:01,420
Would you dare ask this court of mercy?

237
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:03,740
There is no mercy for you.

238
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:07,280
You are sentenced to hell where you will want to be haunted

239
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:10,240
forever by the souls you sent there.

240
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,820
Oh, no. I don't want to go to hell.

241
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,420
You can't send me to hell for something I didn't know.

242
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:18,680
I didn't know. I only repeated what I heard.

243
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,040
You didn't know.

244
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,500
You didn't know.

245
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,600
The most beautiful of all crimes is the crime of gossip.

246
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,080
Your record will speak for itself.

247
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,920
But, yes, friends, send in that love offering, that check,

248
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,180
addressed to Tammy Faye Dobbs,

249
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,240
daughter of Connie.

250
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,460
Oh, that felt so good.

251
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:44,540
I forgot.

252
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,720
Wow, look out!

253
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,500
Cleveland Donut Gun.

254
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:49,940
Call her!

255
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:50,700
Come on.

256
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,180
Oh, my God.

257
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,020
Oh, my God.

258
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:52,020


259
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:52,540
Oh, my God.

260
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,100
Well, call her right outside the building.

261
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,500
Come on.

262
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,580
I hope you all enjoyed that brief moment of silence we had there.

263
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,400
It was almost a half second.

264
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:00,900
Good.

265
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,560
Oh.

266
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,140
Oh, my God.

267
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,020
Oh, my God.

268
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,520
Come on.

269
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,680
That'll last forever in my memory.

270
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,840
First time ever.

271
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:07,660
Okay.

272
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,260
Oh, right.

273
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:08,620
Okay.

274
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:09,220
Oh, nice.

275
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:10,740
Oh, we got some more.

276
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,260
Why do I feel it there?

277
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,360
Bergman knew how to use silence.

278
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,160
The silence of the soul.

279
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:20,200
Sure is nice.

280
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:20,560
It's nice out here.

281
00:13:20,640 --> 00:13:21,540
I hope the boat comes, though.

282
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,540
Fellini knew how to use silence.

283
00:13:23,860 --> 00:13:26,780
But that horrible boatman with his grizzly hands.

284
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:27,400
Yeah, I know.

285
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,120
Don't touch him.

286
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,460
A giant flaming oar.

287
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,000
Mr. Boatman.

288
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:33,060
Please, Mr. Boatman.

289
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,040
And look, you have to put a coin on his tongue,

290
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,480
and it's all black and icky.

291
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:41,940
Climb aboard, Dr. Howell Robbins.

292
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:43,220
No, no.

293
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,980
And be prepared to go past my dog,

294
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,000
my three-headed dogs.

295
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:50,960
Cerebrus.

296
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,860
Oh, he looks rather cerebral.

297
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:56,900
The triple-brained monster which guards the gates,

298
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,160
the gateway.

299
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,780
Abandon hope all ye who ever hear.

300
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,160
What's he reading from?

301
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,240
It's a B-movie script.

302
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,520
No, it's about the three-headed son of a dog.

303
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,020
Into eternal sorrow.

304
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,760
I am the wage of forsaken people.

305
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,200
Gee, you're right, Virgil, said Dobbs.

306
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,400
It is getting hot in here.

307
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,120
Yeah, I've seen that movie, the Virgil movie.

308
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,680
... beyond me and beyond time myself.

309
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:19,900
I'm a big guy.

310
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,660
Bob and Virgil went several levels further down into hell.

311
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:29,560
Suddenly, Bob, shifting his pipe from one hand to the other,

312
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:32,360
pulled out from his voluminous ditty bag

313
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:36,120
a sop of cakes with wine and honey,

314
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,140
fermented, which he threw dexterously into the slavering three mouths

315
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:43,960
of the three-headed monster which guarded the cavernous entrance

316
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:45,480
to Funworld.

317
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,860
And in return, he was given a mighty blivet

318
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,680
by Satan.

319
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:55,560
And a mighty belt shook the canine's, uh, bulging stomach.

320
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:59,560
His three-headed, uh, his three-headed thing

321
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,520
wafted in the air.

322
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,640
That's enough of horrible horticultural facts from the world of mythology.

323
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:13,140
His gigantic, postulous, scabrous hide quivered unspeakably.

324
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:17,020
As with canine lust, he scraped his hindquarters across the floor,

325
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:20,240
howling and gribbling from all three heads simultaneously.

326
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:28,000
Huge ticks the size of small land crabs leaped from his fur-sparse epidermis.

327
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,680
Suddenly, the dog leaped across the vast expanse of hell

328
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,280
and saddled up to Ivan's leg.

329
00:15:33,280 --> 00:15:35,900
Yes, he was forced to be on the show hour after hour.

330
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:39,960
Pinot, why did you make me do that horrible thing?

331
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,520
Yes.

332
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:44,880
Yes, the bells of hell go ting-a-ling-a-ling for you and not for me.

333
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,900
Take my blood.

334
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:50,240
They bang and bong and bing-a-ling-a-ling and ring eternally.

335
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,520
Yeah, they don't ever stop.

336
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:54,640
That's from Cerebus the P-Dog. They all go for Ivan's leg.

337
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,840
Ow! Get that you! Get those horrible little poodles off of me!

338
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:00,320
I hate poodles!

339
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:04,700
That was Madame Rosonga and her dancing chihuahuas

340
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:08,520
performing once again on the subgenius hour of mystery and darkness.

341
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:12,520
That was really a beautiful little dance number, Doctor Howe.

342
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,940
Yeah, you wouldn't think they were pop, they were capable of that.

343
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,080
And when's Michael Jackson gonna be on?

344
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,300
You know, there's a certain song that I mean between every other song that we play.

345
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,280
It's called the tune-up song, you know?

346
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:27,680
But...

347
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,320
No, that kind of mess, Elvis Presley and stuff.

348
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,880
There baby, you can sit here and sit down.

349
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:35,080
Look at the rocker there. Yeah.

350
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,280
David Bowie.

351
00:16:45,860 --> 00:16:46,800
Thank you very much.

352
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,040
Thank you very much.

353
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,100
We sold a million records on that one right there.

354
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,100
And all that bull.

355
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,060
Slack!

356
00:17:03,780 --> 00:17:05,260
You Slack yourself!

00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,600
I'm done doing this!

375
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:48,640
You Slack!

376
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,900
You're very old!

Slack!

381
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,380
Slack from the other side of the world!

382
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,140
What?

383
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,860
Slack from right next door!

384
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,080
Slack!

385
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:11,500
Slack!

386
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,000


387
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:12,240
Slack!

388
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,420
You Slack!

389
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:14,920
Slack!

390
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,100


391
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,100


392
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,100


393
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:15,720
Right now!

394
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,340
You Slack!

395
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:25,840
We have you, Slack!

396
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:26,760


397
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,640
Slack!

398
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:30,320
I've got a new product.

399
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:31,420
I see there's a majority of people in the ghetto

400
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,860
nothing worse than putting somebody in the corner

401
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,480
when they've tried over and over and over

402
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:42,060
to do righteousness and no one receive it you get them in a corner they're extremely dangerous

403
00:18:51,240 --> 00:18:55,160
extremely dangerous aren't they i think you can sense the hands of these people

404
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,940
that we are non-violent people but we are extremely dangerous

405
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,860
right

406
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:14,420
something for nothing

407
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,060
is not for everyone

408
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:35,500
you cannot take my slack away

409
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:57,820
just remember you don't have anything on

410
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:04,100
me that i care about because everything you have on me i've let it all hang right out for everybody

411
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:11,480
now you get to worry about yourself i don't mind losing my life what about you

412
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:19,580
i don't mind losing my reputation what about you i don't mind i don't mind being tortured

413
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:27,480
what about you i'm just no longer afraid and i've lost interest in this old world of capitalist

414
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:36,040
men racism i've lost interest in it so if somebody wants to make me stay in it by compromising with

415
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:42,360
filthy minded people that cannot even have respect for somebody that would die for even his enemies

416
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:48,480
and they want to cause anarchy in our midst i would just as soon bring it all to a gallant

417
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,980
a glorious screaming in

418
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:57,980
face

419
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:02,580
oh

420
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:11,300
What collect metal

421
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,460
and tear it down

422
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:21,460


423
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:21,880
Why

424
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,520
Trembling

425
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:23,100
For a few days

426
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,000
i'd玉

427
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,320
debt

428
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,140

00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:27,920

430
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:27,920


431
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,020
99% of the atom's weight.

432
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,500
The density of the nucleus is such

433
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:37,700
that if we had one cubic centimeter, half a teaspoon,

434
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:41,960
it would weigh 100 million tons.

435
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,120
And at the same time, with 250 units

436
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,720
of tetanus immune globulin human administered

437
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,540
in the contralateral gluteal muscles.

438
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,520
An educational service of the Longine-Whipnor Watch Company.

439
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:57,160
I have a wonderful free gift waiting for you now.

440
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:00,420
Introducing new candy frappy, frappy candy.

441
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:01,280
Mm-hmm.

442
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:04,180
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi-yi.

443
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,480
Attaboy, Luther.

444
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:14,060
Uh, when I was asked to be guest speaker at this luncheon,

445
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,360
I asked myself this.

446
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:23,620
Who are you, Luther Higgs, to be the guest speaker

447
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,520
at this luncheon?

448
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:31,460
I thought about my answer about being guest speaker

449
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,980
for a long time.

450
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,520
What is a guest speaker?

451
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,280
Let me clarify this.

452
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,080
I have been called brave.

453
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,680
What is brave?

454
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,320
Let me clarify this.

455
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:57,140
Of course, we all know that it is short for brave.

456
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,140


457
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,140


458
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,200
Brave, brave, brave.

459
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,820
That goes without even being said.

460
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,800
But it is also a symbol of another thing.

461
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,380
Bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah, bah.

462
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,860
Thank you for having me.

463
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,400
It's real quiet, Dad.

464
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,500
I'll let you, I'll leave it.

465
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:20,720
I won't say anything unless you listen to it now.

466
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,260
Ah!

467
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,200
Ah!

468
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,240
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

469
00:23:26,260 --> 00:23:26,440
Ah!

470
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,560
Ah, ah, oh, look again.

471
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:28,760
Ah, ah, ah, ah.

472
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:31,300
Yeah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

473
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,640
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.

474
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:44,500
For your own listening pleasure, please

475
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:48,300
be sure that your balance control is now

476
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,520
in the center position.

477
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:52,820
Thank you.

478
00:23:52,920 --> 00:23:54,760
I am in aluminum foil now.

479
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,420
I think it's gotta be done.

480
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:56,420


481
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:56,420


482
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:56,420


483
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,580
I don't think it can be helped.

484
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:57,940
Dirt!

485
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:58,900
It don't go right!

486
00:23:59,500 --> 00:23:59,840
Dirt!

487
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,120
It don't go right!

488
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,240
Dirt!

489
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,620
It don't go right!

490
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,280
Well, we thought he was rolling.

491
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,660
Your flesh will keep, your heart will bump, your nerves will paralyze,

492
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:12,740
as you shall hear the strangest things that never met your eyes.

493
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,600
They're not that strange, Al.

494
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:22,720
Yes, you'll travel into the chilling, thrilling, slimy, haunted radio station.

495
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,380
Just sign on the dotted line, little boys and girls.

496
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,520
And now you've bought an interest in the Captain Beefheart Beefsteak Mine.

497
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:34,060
There's a beautiful vein of pure linguine running through these rocks,

498
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,660
and I want you boys to have every opportunity to become shareholders in this money-making project.

499
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:42,220
Now don't bother to read it, just sign your name on the dotted line,

500
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:45,080
and why, soon you'll be a beefsteak tycoon.

501
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,340
I promise you that.

502
00:24:50,660 --> 00:24:51,220
Dirt!

503
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,320
It don't go right!

504
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,900
I'm still there.

505
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:54,680
Dora.

506
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:56,980
What? Dora?

507
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,820
Dora, is he, is he laughing at us?

508
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,560
Hey, that's my job!

509
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,880
That's my job, I just try to help folks.

510
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,820
That's all I do, is try to come on and help.

511
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,980
Not that the job pays well.

512
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,440
Never has on this planet.

513
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,200
Did you ever notice anybody ever tries to help, we shoot them? Did you ever notice that?

514
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,460
If the risk is little, the reward is little.

515
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:28,900
Arrrrgggghhh!

516
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,160
Who the hell are you?

517
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,000
You're welcome.

518
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:36,540
Tweet.

519
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,880
Where's the tweet?

520
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,960
I mean, no tweet.

521
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:42,120
Oh, here it comes, here it comes, look out!

522
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,800
Look out!

523
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,260
Look out!

524
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,720
Cleve told me of an incident that happened to him the other day.

525
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:52,600
He was standing in a nearly deserted sub-Boston subway.

526
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,680
Tell it, brother, tell it.

527
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:57,480
There was a drunk standing on the other side across from him.

528
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,840
And he said,

529
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:00,340
What's your name?

530
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:03,780
And Cleve, not wanting to tell his real name, said, Bob.

531
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,740
That's right, he said Bob, Bob.

532
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:06,580
And the drunk said,

533
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,320
All the best drunks are named Bob.

534
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:15,360
In fact, the greatest drunk on earth is named Bob.

535
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:21,320
And then that man got down on his hands and knees and he licked that third rail.

536
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,700
How many of you licked that third rail?

537
00:26:22,700 --> 00:26:25,420
You listening to radio can lick that third rail.

538
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,440
How many of you have been sitting the way Bob wanted you to, huh?

539
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,920
You've just been sitting on your little fannies, your tokuses.

540
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,020
Yes.

541
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:43,420
Sitting there praising Bob, singing hymns to Bob, but you're afraid to get out there and whoop P-Dawg for Bob, huh?

542
00:26:44,780 --> 00:26:47,020
Aren't you being a little harsh with these people?

543
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,180
Oh, you Californians are so laid back.

544
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:52,460
We're into violence and hate in Texas.

545
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,900
I mean, we thought Bob was a nice guru.

546
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,700
We thought he was a good guy. We thought he was like, on our side.

547
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:05,840
Look, we didn't give you all that ammo just to praise him. Just to praise his sweet name.

548
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,660
I didn't get any ammo. I got some PCP.

549
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,020
Well, Bob, you best be lying.

550
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:18,400
Well, at least that. There's little kids in China who don't even get any PCP.

551
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,680
Well, none of the sacred PCP of the country.

552
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,680
Oh, the church. Ah, yes.

553
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,820
Many people meet here on the beach to call Sternow.

554
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,260
There's the little Sternow at the bottom of the hall.

555
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,200
Oh, look, I see him now.

556
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,920
He's been poked and prodded awake now by the bad show.

557
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:37,400
Let's hurt him now.

558
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,140
Except genius corruption.

559
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,940
Uh, Energon crystals.

560
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:42,300
Our muscles flexing.

561
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,800
Stop snorting those Energon crystals.

562
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:45,440
Okay, here it comes.

563
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:46,940
Okay, look out, look out.

564
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,040
Sternow's love muscle is flexing.

565
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,960
Oh, watch out, everybody stand back.

566
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:51,660
I'm listening. Stand back.

567
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,300
Oh, no!

568
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,300
Excuse me, it bumped into me.

569
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,440
Hey, you thought P-Dawg was ugly.

570
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,380
Don't get any on you. Don't get any on you.

571
00:27:59,380 --> 00:28:02,480
You hadn't seen nothing until Sternow whipped out of bed.

572
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,900
Whoa, he knocked a hole in the wall.

573
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,140
That damn thing's got three heads, Ivan.

574
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:09,540
Oh, beat that!

575
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,340
They grow big in Arkansas, don't they?

576
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,100
Only one foreskin's infected, though.

577
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,900
Unwholesome about that critter.

578
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,100
Don't look at it too close up, little show.

579
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:23,520
There's kind of a capacity there for, uh, isolation.

580
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:28,800
Yeah, we thought we'd get as far away as we could and then give you a call so it's the bad show again.

581
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:32,820
Well, good. We're gonna take those chromosomes and DNA fragments from...

582
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:34,040
And mix them all around.

583
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,680
...the genius rood and somehow mediate a recombination between those two types of, uh...

584
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,100
DNA, are they?

585
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:45,040
Why not? Why not?

586
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:45,480
Close one.

587
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:49,560
So we're gonna take the resultant strain and inject it right into that golfer head.

588
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:50,460
That's the way it goes.

589
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,240
The head pump.

590
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,380
No! No! Don't inject the head!

591
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:57,080
You'll bring it back to unholy life!

592
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:02,620
It started to float, nimbus-like, over the golf course, leaving a trail of sizzling bloody...

593
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,900
Hmm, it's like a little snail trail.

594
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,960
...decomposing tissues to interact with the microorganisms of the soil.

595
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:13,740
As the head floated and levitated along it, uttering the word,

596
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:14,060
Why?

597
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:14,460
Why?

598
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:22,500
And it realized its tragic loss and the tragedy that it had invented for itself and sunk into a depression.

599
00:29:22,860 --> 00:29:23,100
Oh.

600
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:27,240
Mumbling and muttering, mindlessly champing with its jaws and its...

601
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:29,620
But listen. Please listen.

602
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:36,180
Once upon a time, long, long ago, a lovely queen sat by her window sewing.

603
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,020
Dreaming, she pricked her finger with her needle.

604
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:54,740
Some time later, a little daughter was born to the queen.

605
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:59,600
And she was just as beautiful as the queen had hoped she might be.

606
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,980
Is that a boy or a girl?

607
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:03,180
Is it a spaghet?

608
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:04,320
It's a dyke.

609
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,620
No, it's a hippie.

610
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,380
A communist?

611
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:07,400
Practicant.

612
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:08,400
Drag queen.

613
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,340
Or a watch-rag queen.

614
00:30:10,580 --> 00:30:12,200
Probably a speed freak.

615
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:13,060
Or a pothead.

616
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,560
Or a mutton queen.

617
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,820
Look at her. It's just a whore.

618
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,660
Or maybe a gold digger.

619
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,200
Or she's a hustler.

620
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:22,860
Or some sort of intellectual.

621
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:27,880
The happy mother decided to call her baby Snow White.

622
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,520
It could be a bag-hag.

623
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:31,940
Or maybe it's a bee girl.

624
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:36,360
Snow White dreamed beautiful daydreams about a handsome prince.

625
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:42,440
Someday, she knew he would come and carry her off to his castle in the clouds.

626
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:43,100
Oh.

627
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:47,780
And I often imagine that a girl is actually a boy and use her accordingly.

628
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,160
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

629
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:54,360
Who is the fairest of us all?

630
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:55,320
She said.

631
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,620
And the mirror replied.

632
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:07,180
Message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

633
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:08,360
Interesting.

634
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,880
Thanks, Dad.

635
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:11,480
Oh, my gosh.

636
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,120
Oh, my gosh.

637
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
Oh, yes, yes, yes.

638
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:19,120
Do you think I remember you untam

639
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:21,440
True-human.

640
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,300
I am conscienc皆さん

641
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:42,760
True es BRUHyah.

642
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,300
You just have time to wash.

643
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:48,620
Mirror, mirror on the wall.

644
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,900
Who is the fairest of us all?

645
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:53,800
You sure as hell.

646
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:59,300
Take the princess into the forest and bring me back her heart in this jewel box.

647
00:32:06,780 --> 00:32:10,540
Alone in the forest, Snow White wept with fright.

648
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,000
But she was not really alone, she found.

649
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,680
All the little woodland animals were her friends.

650
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,760
You're all right.

651
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:31,360
And chirping and chattering happily, they led her to a new home.

652
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,340
Hey, what kind of place is this?

653
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:39,540
It was a sweet little, tiny little house in the woods the animals showed Snow White.

654
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,060
Looks like a rogues gallery.

655
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:48,040
The sink was piled with unwashed dishes and everything was thickly blanketed with dust.

656
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:49,860
Shut up, shut up!

657
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,140
You're doping?

658
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:54,440
They had almost forgotten what the word meant.

659
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,680
She took one bite and sank lifeless to the floor.

660
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:02,860
And that ain't all.

661
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:04,580
Sink!

662
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:07,320
Now you drop dead, you nitwit!

663
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:08,400
God bless you.

664
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,960
It's a beautiful thing.

665
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,040
Praise God.

666
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,200
Praise Bob.

667
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:12,400
Why not?

668
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,300
The man with the plan.

669
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,820
Focusing up now on future America.

670
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:17,780
The mastermind for world domination.

671
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,740
The false superior mutant.

672
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:24,240
Marching across history or the face of it.

673
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:35,860
Well, if you go here on page 45 of the Bay Guardian, you do find there is a whole section of WADADs, mutants seeking other mutants and stuff like that.

674
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,460
It's a wonderful theatrical world.

675
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:40,060
It used to be cool and lonely to be a mutant, but not everybody.

676
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,940
Everybody's doing it.

677
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:46,160
Well, I mean, there used to be a time when it was sort of like, you know, a mule.

678
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:57,240
You cross a mutant with a normal and you get some sort of mutation, but now that mutants are doing it with other mutants, it's almost become, I don't know, mainstream.

679
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:58,580
I know.

680
00:33:58,620 --> 00:34:07,060
It's really sad to see the best minds of our generation doing all that 50s stuff over again the same way they did it back then.

681
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,300
And now, you know, now it's almost like a new era.

682
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,640
It's really cool to be anything but mutant, you know?

683
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:20,800
I mean, it's sort of like, well, you know what I'm saying?

684
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,080
Yeah, you're saying it, it, it, it, it.

685
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:24,460
Yeah, exactly.

686
00:34:24,740 --> 00:34:33,840
And on top of that, if you're mutant, it's like be different for the sake of being the same.

687
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:35,840
Yes, that's right.

688
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:38,380
We're all different here for the sake of being the same on the air.

689
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,280
And I think that's what it's all about.

690
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,440
That's, that's really no better than the normal.

691
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,500
I mean, when you get right down to it.

692
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,420
You're on show.

693
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:46,180
Yeah.

694
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:52,360
Well, that's why the Church of the Subgenius is no longer a viable instrument in any of our lives.

695
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:58,180
Soon we may have to just revert to normality as an alternative to mutations.

696
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:02,820
Well, I think the ultimate thing to be is just to be me.

697
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:05,420
I just want to be the.

698
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,360
Not the, me.

699
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,080
Well, me for you.

700
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,240
The me is the.

701
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,380
Yeah, but that's the wrong me for you.

702
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,740
You got to be the you me.

703
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:17,820
I got to be the I me.

704
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:20,900
Well, this is no longer the me generation.

705
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,160
That was last generation.

706
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:23,560
So perhaps it's the.

707
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:24,780
Yeah, but I'm sterile.

708
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,520
So, you know, I'm kind of stuck with it.

709
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,660
Well.

710
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,200
If I could reproduce, then I might have a, a ye generation.

711
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:34,760
Ye?

712
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,100
Ye, that's true.

713
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,160
No, no, ye.

714
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:39,580
Ye.

715
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,560
I'm, um, likely a quién

716
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:50,980
Sure.

717
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,820
I would agree.

718
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:56,600
Everybody knowsी

719
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,280
Ye?

720
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:07,420
well, I would if senor, I would think, maybe he on it is be representative of

721
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:07,920
investing.

722
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:07,920


723
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:07,920


724
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:07,920


725
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,140


726
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,140


727
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,140


728
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,140


729
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:08,220
to parties, someonesail work Russian actually super here at that point and I.

730
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:08,580
But to put these things aside, you know have we got here territory to waster

731
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:08,580


732
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,540
little part 10 days and he's from Santa?

733
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,060
No, he's just beautiful man.

734
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,080
It's already humorous.

735
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:14,140
Well, we'll just have to be cartographers of the head.

736
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,320
And it's our duty to explore the wilderness.

737
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:18,520
Artillery-like art.

738
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,480
This new gray matter preserve.

739
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,480
Just don't look up its next stump.

740
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:28,020
You might see something you wish you'd never seen.

741
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:30,720
It was an ugly sight.

742
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,420
That's pretty romantic, Reverend Stang.

743
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:38,760
Yeah, I know what you do with that next stump, Pope Sternodoc's kick-haver.

744
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:41,820
I know exactly what you've been doing with that next stump.

745
00:36:41,860 --> 00:36:51,540
I've detected the potential many times in the past and have been dazzled by the ill-matched, intimidating circumstances that this relationship has provided for me.

746
00:36:51,620 --> 00:37:00,340
It's a breath of abnormalcy amidst a normal atmosphere of, you know, inhaling deeply of the church air.

747
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,280
Reverend Sternodoc, would you hang on just a second?

748
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,440
We're going to go to the caller. Hold on.

749
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:06,520
Okay.

750
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,340
Sir, I know who you are. God bless you.

751
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:19,440
Why did that nasty caller divert it before we could even get our hooks into him?

752
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:27,340
Well, he's probably trapped in a gas-filled tunnel when he's lifting his head at the scent of that golfer head.

753
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:33,720
And we're more and more interested to learn how far this mighty affair might have progressed tonight.

754
00:37:33,780 --> 00:37:37,920
Might have. That's the key, I think, for you listeners who are collecting clues.

755
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:46,820
Often you in the show might have is the grass-banned caller that would have found the other side to be a possibility.

756
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:49,080
The clues are buried in the show.

757
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:52,100
But that board slid up like a Christmas tree, Commander.

758
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:58,800
Well, the character and climate of the show no doubt have exerted a slight influence on his actions.

759
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,800
A tidal influence, we would say.

760
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,180
That's true.

761
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,240
At the moment, they've dragged him right out of the room.

762
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:08,440
That's right. They're taking him off to the land of the sky-blue waters.

763
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,000
Well, we'll...

764
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,440
All the water's best for brewing.

765
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:23,800
We'll delve deeper and deeper into the more compelling mysteries, which lay beyond those that we had deduced had to the security of the poop-dog hat.

766
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:31,960
A monster eight feet tall, half man, half beast.

767
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:35,840
Perhaps the elusive missing link between humans and apes.

768
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,720
In the Himalayas, it's called...

769
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,240
Yeti.

770
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:39,880
Yeti.

771
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:40,740
Yeti.

772
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,480
Yeti.

773
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:53,460
I was cursed by being fitted with the hair of a monkey.

774
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,460
The big question in all this, of course, is are these animals real?

775
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,740
Why don't we catch them?

776
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,940
You must decide.

777
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:05,040
For you are the jury.

778
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:08,060
It's not my intention to delay this court.

779
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:09,640
God bless you.

780
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,760
Wouldn't that be weird?

781
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,440
Of course, a lot of folks say, well, what do you believe in, Brother Dave?

782
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
I say, I believe in everything.

783
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:19,900
You don't mean that.

784
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:20,220
Yes.

785
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,920
Even that?

786
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,260
Yes.

787
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,140
Yes, I...

788
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,820
Yes, yes, I do.

789
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,220
I believe in everything that exists in this whole planet Earth.

790
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:34,260
I believe in every philosophy, every religion, every ideology, everything that exists.

791
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:36,460
And that don't give me no room for no argument.

792
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,220
If the world is wrong, then right your own self.

793
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,340
That's something to think about.

794
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:44,640
Sure.

795
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,020
Frankly, I believe in love and charity and goodness and kindness.

796
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,400
And I believe if a man's down, kick him.

797
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,440
That's right.

798
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:56,380
If he survives it, he has an opportunity to rise above it.

799
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,840
God bless you.

800
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,920
We were afraid there would be too many people on Main Street,

801
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:07,240
so we walked on down and stood in the grassy slope just this side of the triple underpass.

802
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:13,700
The president's car turned the corner and started toward us on Elm Street.

803
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,600
There were a lot of motorcycle police in front of the president's car.

804
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:23,740
My friend was afraid I didn't see the president,

805
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:26,480
so she said, look, there's the president's car.

806
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,360
Get a picture of him.

807
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:33,840
He turned to us and waved.

808
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,140
He faced forward again.

809
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:41,000
I lifted my Polaroid.

810
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:45,020
Just as I snapped the picture, I heard a shot.

811
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,620
That's a pile of horse manure, son.

812
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:06,960
God bless you.

813
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,100
I don't know.

814
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:16,440
You must try, Comrade Zilkov, to cultivate a sense of humor.

815
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:22,700
Just because you're not the same

816
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:25,680
Doesn't mean you're weird or strange

817
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,760
You're just different

818
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,320
Being different

819
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,720
Being great

820
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:31,200
You too, isn't that a risk?

821
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,020
Just because you're a different one

822
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,940
There's no telling what you might be doing

823
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,180
Come thinking different

824
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:39,720
Being different

825
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:41,140
Is being great

826
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,840
God bless you.

827
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,540
It's not who you aren't.

828
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,560
It's who you are.

829
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,520
And being yourself is being great.

830
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,020
From the Church of...

831
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,280
Let's get into trouble, baby.

832
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:59,060
I'm, uh, I think it's time to play some music.

833
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,760
Because we should.

834
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:23,740
They are well-dressed.

835
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:23,740


836
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:23,740


837
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:27,660
ou- defaulted and

838
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:27,660


839
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:27,660


840
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:27,660


841
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:27,660


842
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:27,660


843
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:27,660


844
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:27,660


845
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:27,660


846
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:27,820
짧은 나가 고 llegado.

847
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,460
He's cute.

848
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:30,780
He looks funny.

849
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:35,860
by the way I should have told you about that.

850
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:36,080
Long March.

851
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:36,820
I don't know what you're doing here. Oh my gosh.

852
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,720
The show rolls forward and Mobius is going nuts.

853
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,400
A hurtling juggernaut that can't be stopped.

854
00:42:43,080 --> 00:42:45,560
But Mike, let's be serious.

855
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:46,780
And squabble.

856
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,180
Well, all right, what's a four-letter word for...

857
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,060
Oh, wait, hold on.

858
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,860
What's a four-letter word for pronate?

859
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,640
Food.

860
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:57,660
How about prolapse?

861
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:00,480
Ugh, just prolapsed on me.

862
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,240
Ow.

863
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,940
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

864
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,220
Bear with me a moment.

865
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,260
There's a fond analog that...

866
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,300
I'm gazing into the mirror now.

867
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:14,660
Okay, I'll eat it, I'll eat it.

868
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:17,200
Okay, we're going to go with the menu.

869
00:43:17,620 --> 00:43:19,900
It's a punch-up 3D food.

870
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:25,140
Okay, well, how about the spooky strips of light

871
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:31,040
and I'll take the dead moth shining pie.

872
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,240
At Dead Moth Drive-Thru Plaza,

873
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,200
the pie is our...

874
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:36,560
I'll take the wall...

875
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:38,560
the fluttered wall soup.

876
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:40,640
Now available at Wall Drugs.

877
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:42,380
Yeah, and the dipping French woman.

878
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:43,520
Okay, thanks, here.

879
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,360
From Local Slaveway.

880
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:49,540
I'll take a real loony Cajun prune whip, too.

881
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,560
Wait a minute, I've been about to squeeze again.

882
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:52,260
Ugh!

883
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:52,640


884
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:53,600
Ugh!

885
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,220
A memo to Attorney General Edwin Meese III

886
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,640
about a $1 billion...

887
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,940
Yeah, that makes me think of Meese, too.

888
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:02,320
I don't know...

889
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,460
...mentions a possible payment or a contribution...

890
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:05,040
Goodbye, Meese.

891
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:07,620
I don't know if it's visual or maybe it's a sense of smell.

892
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:10,400
You know, basically, ancient sense of smell

893
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,000
just kind of makes you think of Meese when,

894
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:14,380
well, when the whole building squeezes like that.

895
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:14,760
You get it?

896
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,140
And suddenly it dawned on, uh,

897
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:18,800
Crooker Fran that...

898
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,480
Wait, is it 6 o'clock?

899
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,700
Things have changed a bit.

900
00:44:23,060 --> 00:44:26,820
Rappaport hired a long-time Meese and E. Robert Wallach

901
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:27,200
to get him...

902
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,460
Well, I just got...

903
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,780
I just, uh, went to the bathroom there

904
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,480
and almost finished the stark fifth!

905
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:34,740
But then I forgot.

906
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,680
I turned around.

907
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,220
I flushed it before I even thought about it.

908
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:41,260
And so more shows are probably going to be backing up the pipes.

909
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:41,880
Oh, God.

910
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,580
I need a gift.

911
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:45,380
And I really...

912
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:47,360
I just have no idea what to get him.

913
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:49,440
I know just what you mean

914
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:50,920
and I have just the gift you need,

915
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,320
but I can't say...

916
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,880
No cameras of any kind will be allowed.

917
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:00,640
I will not tolerate any outbursts...

918
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,260
Translation!

919
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,800
...any talking among yourselves...

920
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,640
Any laughter...

921
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:16,000
...nor anything that would interfere with the normal, orderly presentation of testimony.

922
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:22,600
Oh, a radio!

923
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,980
With your mid-afternoon news.

924
00:45:25,820 --> 00:45:29,340
Well, all of Southern California seems to have sighted another UFO

925
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,560
in today's sunny, smogless skies.

926
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:33,020
The official...

927
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,340
The official...

928
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:34,340


929
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:34,720
The official...

930
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,420
Oh, they put a mic on the station?

931
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:39,380
Oh, it's coming alive!

932
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,180
Oh, no, it's crawling out of the toilet!

933
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:42,140
That's Mobius!

934
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:43,100
Mobius!

935
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:43,560
Hey, hey!

936
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:44,340
Let go of my...

937
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:44,760
Let go!

938
00:45:44,840 --> 00:45:45,140
Let go!

939
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:45,880
Don't pull me out!

940
00:45:45,980 --> 00:45:46,520
Oh, God!

941
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,040
Ow!

942
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,620
And, children, this is what you get when you eat at Cafe Neutron.

943
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:54,200
Is the new...

944
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,180
The irradiated food...

945
00:45:55,180 --> 00:45:56,680
Is the new stark fifth out yet?

946
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:57,820
Yeah, it's out.

947
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:59,520
A little listener asking a real question.

948
00:45:59,520 --> 00:45:59,800
Yeah.

949
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,220
Stop it!

950
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,000
Yeah, it's out.

951
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:02,720
It's $40.

952
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:02,720


953
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,600
But let's go over that again.

954
00:46:05,620 --> 00:46:06,060
I don't...

955
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:11,440
Dear friends, the stark fifth, the long, long, long-awaited stark fifth of removal

956
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:16,360
is indeed almost finished, just as we've been saying for the last two years.

957
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:18,560
And this time, we really do mean it.

958
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:19,000
And...

959
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:21,260
Whoop, there went that...

960
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:23,180
Shoot, we flushed it away again.

961
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,240
We've now got a start all over again.

962
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:29,480
See, you backflush these things, and there's a little caller.

963
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:30,140
He's floating up.

964
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,280
He'll be floating face up.

965
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:31,680
There he is.

966
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,400
It'll be out soon.

967
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:34,780
We can tell you what the theme of the next issue is.

968
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:34,900
Get the plunger.

969
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,200
Get the show plunger.

970
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,760
Get that little caller up out of there.

971
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:40,980
The theme of the new stark fifth is not you, Jerry.

972
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,940
Oh, I'm afraid he's drowned.

973
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,320
Yeah, well...

974
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,940
Put it down as slowly as you can.

975
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,800
Oh, it's only an overshot.

976
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:50,240
Like Patty said.

977
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:51,900
On the floor.

978
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,720
Put it on the floor.

979
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:56,860
Gently.

980
00:46:57,200 --> 00:46:57,280
Gently.

981
00:46:59,020 --> 00:46:59,500
Ah!

982
00:46:59,680 --> 00:46:59,960
Ah!

983
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:00,660
Ah!

984
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:02,520
Ah!

985
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


986
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


987
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


988
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


989
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


990
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


991
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


992
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


993
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


994
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


995
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


996
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


997
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


998
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


999
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


1000
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:02,700


1001
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,660
What could have happened to get such a piece of tripe?

1002
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:10,540
You have no idea what I've gone through in the last three months.

1003
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,700
Sometimes I'm perfectly normal, mentally.

1004
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:23,100
I sit for hours and hours looking in the mirror,

1005
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:29,840
hoping and praying for the slightest sign of my physical change.

1006
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:33,640
But it doesn't come.

1007
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:40,800
Then I feel myself going back to the animal instinct.

1008
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,380
I try to fight it.

1009
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,520
I try to fight it with all my willpower.

1010
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:50,640
And then I feel...

1011
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:51,440
Oh, Ian.

1012
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,620
Ian, what am I going to do?

1013
00:47:54,020 --> 00:47:55,260
What am I going to do?

1014
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:55,840
Fight.

1015
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:57,200
That's all you can do.

1016
00:47:58,260 --> 00:47:58,780
Ah!

1017
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:00,160
Ah!

1018
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:00,860
Ah!

1019
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:01,820
Ah!

1020
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:01,960
Ah!

1021
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:02,220
Ah!

1022
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:02,440
Ah!

1023
00:48:02,440 --> 00:48:02,640
Ah!

1024
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:02,660
Ah!

1025
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:03,560
Ah!

1026
00:48:04,120 --> 00:48:04,460
Ah!

1027
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,720
Ah!

1028
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:13,080
Ah!

1029
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,120
Ah!

1030
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:15,740


1031
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:16,460
Ah!

1032
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:16,520
Ah!

1033
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:16,540
Ah!

1034
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:16,540


1035
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:16,540


1036
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:18,680
Oh!

1037
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:18,680


1038
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:18,680


1039
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,420
Ah!

1040
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:20,840
Ah!

1041
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:25,100
Ah!

1042
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,040
Ah!

1043
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:30,340
Ah!

1044
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:30,480


1045
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:30,480


1046
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:30,480


1047
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:30,480


1048
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:30,480


1049
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:30,480


1050
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:30,480


1051
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:30,480


1052
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:30,480


1053
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:30,480


1054
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:30,480


1055
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:31,400
Ah!

1056
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:31,880
Ah!

1057
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,140
And they mostly come at night.

1058
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,220
Mostly.

1059
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:36,260
Not all being old,

1060
00:48:36,280 --> 00:48:36,980
being lost.

1061
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:41,600
Gently.

1062
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,640
Sure is preferred,

1063
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:49,280
it is a day.

1064
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:49,640
Going down.

1065
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:51,840
Mmm.

1066
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:53,960
I like that.

1067
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:56,580
What is the truth

1068
00:48:57,920 --> 00:48:59,680
about rock music?

1069
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:00,840
I think it's an octopus.

1070
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:03,720
Plato said,

1071
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:07,720
when the music of a society changes,

1072
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:10,580
the whole society will change.

1073
00:49:11,180 --> 00:49:12,500
Certainly, I got married

1074
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,360
so I could retire.

1075
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:15,220
Lennon said,

1076
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:18,880
the best and the quickest way

1077
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,360
to undermine any society

1078
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:24,620
is through its music.

1079
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:26,820
Can you think of anything else?

1080
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,400
No, you've covered it all.

1081
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,820
Satan has taken music

1082
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:32,880
and he has counterfeited it.

1083
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:34,060
See that?

1084
00:49:34,560 --> 00:49:34,840
Oh.

1085
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:35,920
Oh!

1086
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:37,780
Convoluted it.

1087
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:38,420
Ah!

1088
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:41,580
Twisted it.

1089
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:45,280
Exploited it.

1090
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,700
And now he's using

1091
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,200
the hammer, hammer, hammer,

1092
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:52,840
hammer, hammer.

1093
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,400
Hammer, hammer, hammer,

1094
00:49:58,560 --> 00:50:00,220
hammer, hammer, hammer,

1095
00:50:00,220 --> 00:50:00,800
hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer,

1096
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,160
hammer, hammer, hammer, hammer,

1097
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:01,160


1098
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:01,160


1099
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:01,160


1100
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:01,160


1101
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:03,340
in the minds and the lifestyles

1102
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:04,880
of this generation.

1103
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,700
And that ain't all

1104
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:09,320
sin.

1105
00:50:09,680 --> 00:50:11,920
What kind of ungodly being

1106
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,580
was that?

1107
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,020
Don't you believe

1108
00:50:14,020 --> 00:50:14,860
in reincarnation?

1109
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:17,120
A wise guy, huh?

1110
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,480
Quick, kill him!

1111
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,600
Subdini's in space.

1112
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:24,200
They took me up to the top

1113
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,380
of that space needle

1114
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:27,220
and they showered me

1115
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:28,400
with beautiful gifts

1116
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:29,980
and beautiful girls.

1117
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:30,780
And love.

1118
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,800
Moon babes.

1119
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,540
Wow.

1120
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,220
What moon babes?

1121
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,060
Yeah, look at those satellites.

1122
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:37,240
Look at them spiky eels.

1123
00:50:37,240 --> 00:50:38,720
Oh, that one's looting me now.

1124
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,620
I can't tell whether those

1125
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,620
are convexities or concavities,

1126
00:50:42,700 --> 00:50:43,640
but that looting

1127
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,320
They some kind of moon babes.

1128
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,280
I say, do that again.

1129
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,500
Boy, can you dig those

1130
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,740
potatoes out of the craters.

1131
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:52,320
Hey.

1132
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:55,500
Oh, I love it.

1133
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:55,920
Oh!

1134
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,060
Tiny flagellants

1135
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,660
move through this,

1136
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:01,760
and they're like a microscopic stew,

1137
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:03,400
as if they own the place.

1138
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,600
What happened?

1139
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:05,880
What, did something die in here?

1140
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:06,980
Uh, well,

1141
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,120
Nancy Reagan

1142
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:08,760
It's just more shit.

1143
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,520
It's that dinosaur egg

1144
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:11,760
that Hal's been sitting on

1145
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,140
for the last 20 days.

1146
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:15,680
Look, it's cracking.

1147
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:17,280
I hear a screeching,

1148
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:18,160
a scratching noise.

1149
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:20,020
He's not even aware

1150
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:21,280
that his own child

1151
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,360
is being born now.

1152
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,280
It's got the head of a boy

1153
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:27,660
and the body of a Tyrannosaurus.

1154
00:51:27,940 --> 00:51:29,640
Yes, but it smokes Shermans.

1155
00:51:29,640 --> 00:51:30,780
Do you think that it could be a cure?

1156
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,080
It's got the faint knowledge

1157
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:31,680
of Al Cantanis.

1158
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:32,460
And it's still talking.

1159
00:51:32,700 --> 00:51:34,780
The PLO chief rates full pardon

1160
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:35,960
for safe sex.

1161
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:37,860
I just don't know about this guy.

1162
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:38,900
Meanwhile, Mikhail Gorbachev

1163
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:40,580
bought covert aid for erosion.

1164
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:43,120
Yes, Hal had his own dinosaur baby child

1165
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,820
on the show and didn't even notice.

1166
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:46,520
And so we're going to cook

1167
00:51:46,520 --> 00:51:49,960
this little rare creature up for breakfast.

1168
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,460
This single, look,

1169
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:56,200
dinosaur baby child's making his first phone call.

1170
00:51:56,460 --> 00:51:57,800
A homosaurus sapiens.

1171
00:51:58,400 --> 00:51:59,080
It's Jack.

1172
00:51:59,100 --> 00:52:00,780
...show him that there's no way

1173
00:52:00,780 --> 00:52:02,200
to get out of here.

1174
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:02,480
...just what do you do

1175
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,440
when you're in trouble?

1176
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:04,560
The show fought its way

1177
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:06,360
to the front of the castle.

1178
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:11,020
...the show thought to itself,

1179
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,880
should I swim across the moat

1180
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,680
or should I crawl through the mud?

1181
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,920
Or should you crawl six miles

1182
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,220
over broken glass

1183
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:21,260
and radioactive mine tables

1184
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:23,220
just to hear our program?

1185
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,480
How many callers,

1186
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:25,920
how many records,

1187
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,380
how many eardrums?

1188
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,480
We're going to talk about

1189
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,620
some of the subtle racism

1190
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:32,220
and sexism in the Bibles.

1191
00:52:32,380 --> 00:52:34,560
The sexism's pretty well accepted,

1192
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,620
but we will talk about the racism

1193
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:38,180
because it's so much more hidden

1194
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:39,720
and it's so much more dangerous.

1195
00:52:39,820 --> 00:52:41,480
What genocide the wretched can justify

1196
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,860
with the racism in it.

1197
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,260
Through devious ways,

1198
00:52:46,340 --> 00:52:47,620
Satan has tainted the Bible

1199
00:52:47,620 --> 00:52:49,120
and they justify their racism

1200
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:50,220
on the fact that Cain,

1201
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:51,300
the son of Adam and Eve,

1202
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,660
went off to a great city.

1203
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,240
How is there a city

1204
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,360
if Cain was the only first son of man?

1205
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,460
Well, this city was not occupied by man.

1206
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,420
But the beast of the field.

1207
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,180
And Mormons and many other religions

1208
00:53:04,180 --> 00:53:05,300
still teach that blacks

1209
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:06,700
are the descendants of Cain

1210
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:07,920
and the beast of the field.

1211
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,360
We single out these painted Bibles,

1212
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,300
even St. John and St. Luke versions,

1213
00:53:13,380 --> 00:53:14,860
so you will know that ours

1214
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,180
is the only Bible that should be read.

1215
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,100
Versions of the Bible

1216
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:21,660
which have racism in them

1217
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:24,120
is going to be exposed

1218
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:25,660
and then we will announce

1219
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,240
how we will edit the Bible.

1220
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:37,740
In a minute they are all going to be

1221
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:37,740


1222
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:37,740


1223
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:37,740


1224
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:37,740


1225
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:37,740


1226
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:37,740


1227
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,640
No science is always better than

1228
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:39,820
extraction from a part of itself.

1229
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:39,820


1230
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:39,820


1231
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:39,820


1232
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:39,820


1233
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:39,820


1234
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,880
only one microphone is on

1235
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:53,560
and Dr. Howell and Gary the Broke Friend and puzzling evidence all went to rock it away.

1236
00:53:55,700 --> 00:53:56,720
Rock it away.

1237
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,260
And that's what I'm going to do in a minute.

1238
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,760
And while we haven't been on the phone to our friends,

1239
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:07,360
we've been, well, the quick cut barrage that you've been listening to,

1240
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:10,560
the edits of wonderful little sound bits,

1241
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:16,200
holy messages from the collection of J.R. Bob Dobbs himself,

1242
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:20,440
that was all edited by St. Joe Riley.

1243
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:24,260
Oh, praise St. Joe Riley.

1244
00:54:24,460 --> 00:54:28,400
Saves us so much work and lets us get away with murder.

1245
00:54:28,740 --> 00:54:32,800
Oh, other little bits and pieces that were done by others.

1246
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:39,060
There's a song called Used Slack buried in there.

1247
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:39,960
That was by...

1248
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:40,540
Out of...

1249
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:40,540


1250
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,980
Band Experience, OBE.

1251
00:54:43,360 --> 00:54:47,780
You heard some Church of the New Faith there down at the end.

1252
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,500
They'll, of course, finish their explanations next week.

1253
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:58,380
On the commercial for our new product, Candy Frappy Frappy Candy,

1254
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:03,980
was produced by Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

1255
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,700
Oh, yes, up there in New York land.

1256
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:10,420
The background music that's on right now is, of course,

1257
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:15,240
J. Condom from his album, Zombo Frockland.

1258
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,060
And now, this.

1259
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:23,760
Well, no, how about this?

1260
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:29,320
How about the post office box of the Church of the Subgenius?

1261
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:34,140
I know that so many of you have been sitting there with your pens in your hands,

1262
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:40,460
and it's just aching to write down that address where you can write for free,

1263
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:48,500
free information about all the other services of our beloved Church.

1264
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,000
Ah, yes.

1265
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:55,640
And that post office box number, we'll just write to Bob.

1266
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,060
That's all you need to do.

1267
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:07,760
Write to Bob at post office box 140306 in beautiful Dallas, Texas.

1268
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:09,440
That's it.

1269
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:09,680
That's the only piece of life between old kicks and new grabs.

1270
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:09,680


1271
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:09,680


1272
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:14,000
We are going to be picking this folder up now,

1273
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:14,780
and what that means is that you put your computer,

1274
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:14,780


1275
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,740
exactly where this box is.

1276
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,960
And everyone in your group will open it up today.

1277
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:21,340
And you guys go to paste this and whatever your friends,

1278
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:22,980
and whatever company your friends have told you you can go ahead.

1279
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:28,060
We'll better, using our online möj�트,

1280
00:56:28,060 --> 00:56:31,720
we're hoping that you're going to get to that.

1281
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:31,720


1282
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,700
Thank you.

1283
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:17,120
Thank you.

1284
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:43,780
Thank you.

1285
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,560
Thank you.

1286
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,540
Thank you.

1287
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:15,880
Thank you.

1288
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,700
Thank you.

1289
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:12,180
Thank you.

1290
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:12,180


1291
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:12,180


1292
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:13,580
The dead hours of the morning

1293
01:00:13,580 --> 01:00:15,680
between 4.30 and 6 o'clock.

1294
01:00:15,980 --> 01:00:17,560
This is the time when

1295
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,360
women who have been many hours in labor

1296
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,800
finally deliver, and when the idea

1297
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:23,520
of the supernatural seems the

1298
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,720
least implausible.

1299
01:00:25,020 --> 01:00:27,660
Mobius Rex is clambering

1300
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:28,920
around on top of the

1301
01:00:30,180 --> 01:00:31,380
equipment here.

1302
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,640
For those of you interested,

1303
01:00:34,420 --> 01:00:35,840
monitor number four

1304
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:36,660
will show Mobius.

1305
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:37,620
At this time,

1306
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:40,640
ancient superstitions and night fears

1307
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,940
have the greatest hold on human thoughts.

1308
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:44,780
The time when those

1309
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:47,080
who sleep are deep in the dreams.

1310
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:48,760
And this is the hour

1311
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:49,700
when the callers call.

1312
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:52,280
The Church of the Subgenius Radio Show.

1313
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:53,300
Hello?

1314
01:00:55,120 --> 01:00:56,900
Cookie, this is the show

1315
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:58,240
trying to bother Philo.

1316
01:00:58,620 --> 01:01:00,300
State short question, please.

1317
01:01:01,720 --> 01:01:03,540
What's for breakfast, Cookie?

1318
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,480
Cookie, this is Ivan.

1319
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,080
You have to wake up Dr. Drumwatt.

1320
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:09,020
Hey, hey, hey, I got to go.

1321
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:11,460
How many presidents does it take

1322
01:01:11,460 --> 01:01:12,380
to screw in a light bulb?

1323
01:01:12,540 --> 01:01:13,040
No, no, wait, wait.

1324
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,200
What's the most beautiful sight in the world?

1325
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,020
A busload of presidents going off a cliff.

1326
01:01:17,160 --> 01:01:19,200
Get it? No, no, wait, wait, wait.

1327
01:01:20,140 --> 01:01:21,240
Spooky bad show.

1328
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:22,340
Cookie?

1329
01:01:23,460 --> 01:01:26,560
Can we talk to little dude?

1330
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:28,140
Don't listen to these men.

1331
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:29,800
Not unless you have a connection

1332
01:01:29,800 --> 01:01:30,840
to dog heaven.

1333
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:31,700
Oh, yeah.

1334
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,800
Oh, no.

1335
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:34,640
Friends, this is dog heaven.

1336
01:01:34,920 --> 01:01:36,900
And this is Philo Drumhead.

1337
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:37,660
Hey, dog heaven.

1338
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:38,780
Philo Drumhead.

1339
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:40,560
We've woken up just to be here

1340
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:42,500
entertaining you in all of

1341
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:43,760
Northern and Central California.

1342
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:44,880
No, I'm still asleep.

1343
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:46,680
You are going to save

1344
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:48,220
the universe this time.

1345
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:50,060
Yeah, that's right, Philo.

1346
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:51,940
Yeah, if I link up,

1347
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:52,280
sleep.

1348
01:01:52,860 --> 01:01:54,200
Be of good cheer.

1349
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:54,900
Yeah.

1350
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,140
Well, just tell us

1351
01:01:56,140 --> 01:01:57,220
what you're dreaming about

1352
01:01:57,220 --> 01:02:00,180
and we'll let you go eventually.

1353
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:01,500
I'm dreaming about

1354
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:02,120
a little dude.

1355
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:04,820
Your dog?

1356
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:06,800
Your dog that you had

1357
01:02:06,800 --> 01:02:07,840
five years ago?

1358
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:08,340
Yes.

1359
01:02:08,860 --> 01:02:10,120
I've never forgotten

1360
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:11,000
the little chap

1361
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,400
who was so dear to us.

1362
01:02:12,580 --> 01:02:13,520
Still running out there

1363
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:16,060
in the fields of toxic substance.

1364
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,040
That's what it is.

1365
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,800
He's prancing and dancing

1366
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:19,440
through the fields of...
