1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,480
Oh, Slime.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,020
Touch it gently.

3
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,600
Caress it.

4
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:36,060
It accepts you.

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,840
Oh, thank you so very much.

6
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,540
It is like a fluid.

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,120
You are truly, truly.

8
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:45,820
Through which you can float.

9
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:47,120
My one-eyed guru.

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,180
And if you run into it,

11
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,100
I have worshipped other one-eyed gurus.

12
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:54,280
But as you snuggle up.

13
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,540
Through aeons by,

14
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:59,060
I have wasted my spiritual juices on them.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,960
One fuzzy.

16
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:01,960
One eyes.

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,260
Bathtub full of hot gel.

18
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:08,780
But now, when I see you rising in the eastern horizon.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,940
Fuzzy and red.

20
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,700
And made and built for my sexual pleasures.

21
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:19,180
I can only offer up my squanderances.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,200
And what meager supplies of vestiges.

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,900
Dave's talking to his dog again.

24
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,760
Oh, puppy.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,740
It is true there is a thing here I do not understand.

26
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,860
There is a pain between my ears.

27
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,480
For those who don't understand,

28
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,640
perhaps they're always on the short poopy end of the stick.

29
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:47,780
Yes, the short poopy end of the stick.

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:50,960
There's a lot of short doggy poop around to put on the stick.

31
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,800
But if you want to live like a real man or woman,

32
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:56,020
you must, you must, you must.

33
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,680
It is...

34
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:56,900
Gone.

35
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,360
Later.

36
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:00,880
Than...

37
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,740
You...

38
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:04,880
Think.

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,960
It's too late for me to think, dude.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,600
It's too late for you to think.

41
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,380
It's too late for you to think.

42
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,280
As chimpanzees are to humans, humans are to us.

43
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,220
I love the smell of my pump in the morning.

44
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,660
You'd much rather have us happy.

45
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:29,980
Happy.

46
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:29,980


47
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,400
And satisfied to leave.

48
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,740
Smells like...

49
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,820
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

50
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:40,100
Kyle Andy Whistler.

51
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,460
I hate you.

52
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,920
I hate you.

53
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,660
The Pensioner Roll Program in this baby is really gone.

54
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,920
The functioning of our senses has been spiritually impaired

55
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:26,440
and chemically corrupted by the fake artificial food coloring.

56
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,540
We're the lucky ones.

57
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,080
The handful with the chance to reach another world

58
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,060
And we'll use those guns

59
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,400
You'll use them, Doctor

60
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:36,060
To keep your only chance to stay alive

61
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,160
Somebody tell me

62
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,600
Who is this guy?

63
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:41,500
J.I.F.

64
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,580
J.I.F.

65
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:45,320
J.I.F.

66
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:45,580
J.I.F.

67
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:45,820
J.I.F.

68
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:47,280
J.I.F.

69
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:49,400
J.I.F.

70
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:59,540
J.I.F.

71
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,260
J.I.F.

72
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:01,720
J.I.F.

73
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,340
J.I.F.

74
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:09,460


75
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:09,460


76
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:09,460


77
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,200
J.I.F.

78
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:20,700
A musician, if you consider the normal pattern of modern civilized life, is on the outside of it all.

79
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,840
He doesn't build things, he doesn't work regular hours like a decent God-fearing citizen,

80
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,240
And the life he leads in many ways seems useless and irrelevant

81
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,000
To those of us who prefer a quiet evening in front of the television and a bottle of beer.

82
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:45,060
Amazing as it might seem to some of us, musicians have basic physical needs, just like real people.

83
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:50,960
If I could just get my hands on a big, fat, juicy prairie squid

84
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,320
Ah, yeah!

85
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,900
Prairie squid.

86
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:58,820
Prairie squid.

87
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,760
Prairie squid.

88
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,860
Prairie squid.

89
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:04,780
Prairie squid.

90
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:06,820
Prairie squid.

91
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:17,400
Friends, this hour of Slack, number 1,122, is a tribute to our late friend Chaz Smith,

92
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:25,760
Who vacated Earth Plane 1 for greener pastures on October 16th.

93
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,400
He was, um,

94
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,660
One of the most valuable contributors to the hour of Slack and to Slack in general.

95
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,380
And, uh,

96
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:37,420
So this is kind of a hard show to put together.

97
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,820
In fact, this is the second time I've attempted to do it.

98
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:47,880
And I'm just gonna talk a little bit about Chaz, and then the rest of the show will be all songs from his band,

99
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:54,920
Einstein's Secret Orchestra, and clips from his old radio show, Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland,

100
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,560
Which is where some of the best parts of our Slack came from originally for like 10 years.

101
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:09,620
And also we'll hear some excerpts from Subgenius Devivals, where Einstein's Secret Orchestra headlined at pretty much every show that we did.

102
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,980
For a long time.

103
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:20,480
Chaz was hospitalized about a month ago with double pneumonia and had a stroke while in the hospital.

104
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,200
But he'd also been fighting Hodgkin's lymphoma.

105
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:30,640
Which he beat in his youth, but, um, it came back and he'd been getting radiation treatments.

106
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,160
He had just turned 50.

107
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:42,840
Chaz was a music professor at Cleveland State University and taught the most popular course in the whole school, a class in the history of rock and roll.

108
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,640
He put a lot more into that class than just the history.

109
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:54,900
The students loved him because he would spontaneously just start ranting about life or society or space or science or whatever grabbed his attention.

110
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:54,900


111
00:06:54,920 --> 00:07:04,740
And he also taught regular workshops in music and consciousness at festivals like Starwood, Winterstar and Serious Rising.

112
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:11,860
And taught basic musical composition to little kids through a program with the Cleveland Opera.

113
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,100
He has three textbooks that he wrote, From Woodstock to the Moon and The Soul of Sunrise.

114
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:22,680
Then there's a third one which was just recently finished and isn't published yet.

115
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,900
The real focal point of Chaz's work is that he's been working on a lot of music.

116
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,580
Chaz's life though was playing music.

117
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:34,700
He was in the Clocks in the late 70s and early 80s and then started Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

118
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:46,140
Which during most of its existence had Lonesome Cowboy Dave DeLuca, Bob Mosick and Michelle George in it.

119
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:51,540
And they produced a couple of really good studio albums and a lot of wonderful live recordings.

120
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,720
Cleveland Radio.

121
00:07:54,920 --> 00:08:01,900
And the radio listeners got to hear Chaz's show, Swamp Radio, for I guess over 20 years.

122
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:05,600
And that was a wild show.

123
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:11,320
He'd play whatever kind of music he was into at the time, which really could be just about anything.

124
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:16,340
And also did sort of improv comedy and radio plays.

125
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,920
First with Brain Rot Radio Theater with Dave DeLuca and Dan DiDonato.

126
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,900
And then later on, he did a lot of other things.

127
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:29,580
Later with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and myself and Princess Wee.

128
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,140
And he also took calls from listeners.

129
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,200
And he got some pretty wild listeners.

130
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:38,520
And the bits recorded on that were a mainstay of Hour of Slack for a long time.

131
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,660
Chaz was also an outdoorsman.

132
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,040
Not a hunter, but a hiker and camper.

133
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,240
And his seasonal camp out at Brushwood was almost like an art gallery.

134
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,120
And also a performance area.

135
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,620
He actually built a stage there.

136
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,740
And some of the coolest events at Brushwood happened there.

137
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:59,380
And if you're familiar with Brushwood, that's saying a lot.

138
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,620
His camp was called Tranquility Base or Club Tiki Banzai.

139
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,740
Or both.

140
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,680
And he ran a regular festival himself called the Rumble in the Jungle, which was sort of legendary.

141
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:17,420
Friends, thousands of us are going to remember Chaz.

142
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,920
His former students are almost beyond number.

143
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:25,720
It was a really popular class.

144
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:31,040
And he had an awful lot of fellow musicians and performers and camping buddies.

145
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,880
And he was part of a lot of communities.

146
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:40,360
Brushwood, Ace in Cleveland, WCSB, Cleveland State, Church of the Subgenius.

147
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:43,180
He wasn't the only reason I left Dallas for Cleveland.

148
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:45,260
But he was definitely one of the main ones, friends.

149
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,060
And he is already greatly missed.

150
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:52,000
He did not have health insurance.

151
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,020
And his family is, I mean, he was in intensive care for a month.

152
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:05,840
And if you want to help Chaz's family, you can send donations.

153
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,920
Or look at a website.

154
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:11,640
And get your pencil ready because I'm going to give the information about that.

155
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:21,980
Donations for Chaz can be sent directly to donationsforcharlesvsmith.com.

And measurements of time crumble and climb

179
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:57,640
For Jaguar, Knight and White Gear

180
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:12,200
The storms roll over and start to play

181
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:17,620
With toys left over from yesterday

182
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,540
But just now on the road

183
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,500
The pavements all aglow

184
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,640
While they wait and they watch

185
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,560
For the gates to close

186
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:34,460
With heads bowed they only see

187
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,440
Each other in the wet black street

188
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,300
And measurements of time crumble and climb

189
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,180
For Jaguar, Knight and White Gear

190
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,060
Jaguar, Knight and White Gear

191
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:23,940
I'm living in jungles of radio waves

192
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:29,460
Never, now or ever or yesterday

193
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,500
And just now in the air

194
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,480
Where black becomes clear

195
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:42,080
For Jaguar, Knight and White Gear

196
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,280
There's no words in books here

197
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:49,640
Have a look, there's something in the air

198
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:53,280
And measurements of time crumble and climb

199
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:57,160
For Jaguar, Knight and White Gear

200
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,660
The storms roll over and start to play

201
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:25,180
For Jaguar, Knight and White Gear

202
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:29,900
The storms roll over and start to play

There's no words in books here

00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:30,780


207
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:30,780


208
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,700
For Jaguar, Knight and White Gear

209
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:35,080
The storms roll over and start to play

210
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,080


211
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,440
Each other in the wet black street

212
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:36,440
And measurements of time crumble and climb

213
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:46,200
For Jaguar, Knight and White Gear

214
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:50,800
د النذ Grandpa, can't be seen

215
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:51,380
but light on the road

216
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,620
the sad planning like a car

217
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:53,660
hear a beautiful song

218
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,660
The smallest remnant trailer

219
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,460
You can't see too much

220
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:02,900
My emotions are so obvious

221
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,560
Jack-ابANytH

222
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,480
Will you smoke up the pipe?

223
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,900
Will you hit the osmolite?

224
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:52,540
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?

225
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,540
Will you climb the mountaintop and jump right off into the frond?

226
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:02,300
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?

227
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:07,260
I know the wound is humming

228
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:12,160
Cause I know soon Connie is coming

229
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,960
Astro intercourse, universal force

230
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,740
Galaxy's a number in the billion

231
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:26,540
They're all there for you

232
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:31,340
If you're the boss to see it through

233
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,880
I know the wound is humming

234
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:38,600
And light the fire of truth

235
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:47,060
Will you ever let go to your instinct bonobo?

236
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,820
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?

237
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,780
Will you escape on the date July 5th soon?

238
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:00,660
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?

239
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,640
Will you?

240
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,500
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?

241
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,340
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?

242
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:15,140
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?

243
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:19,100
5,000 years in incubation

244
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,480
Substance, that's what we need here

245
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,900
Let me out!

246
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,560
Let me out!

247
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,440
Isn't this music about evolution or something?

248
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,860
This is the first scene follows the evolution of the universe

249
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,200
metros

250
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,100
igner

251
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,100
Shining

252
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,260
Butch

253
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,940
끝�你說

254
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,260
mallard

255
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:53,380
he becomes larger and gives birth to many more children,

256
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,940
shown in this diagram here.

257
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,880
Until lightning strikes nearby.

258
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:00,980
And then there's monkeys swinging from trees.

259
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,720
As soon as the lightning clears, the smoke clears.

260
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:06,840
And there is the force of Zeus as the lightning bearers

261
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,140
stretch each one of those monkeys down.

262
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,520
Then as soon as the rain dries up, the trees die away, like within two hours.

263
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:17,320
So the monkeys don't have as many trees to swing around in.

264
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:21,280
Then they have to jump down to the ground and run from one group of trees to the other.

265
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:25,200
And they found that after a while, they stood up.

266
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:29,120
They could run faster if they stood up, not on all fours.

267
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,580
And right about that time, their heads started getting bigger.

268
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:40,240
And I am lonely, and I shall create me man from the mud of the earth.

269
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:44,880
And he shall slay all these nearly evolved other primates.

270
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:46,960
And so God...

271
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,620
Rose up the first completely created, unevolved Homo sapiens.

272
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,880
And now for a limited time only, you can own in your very own home

273
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,260
this unlimited collection of man's original Homo sapien collection.

274
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:06,700
And that was exactly 2,714 years ago that happened.

275
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,580
And then God placed all the fossils to full.

276
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,840
To test the faith of the scientists.

277
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:18,160
And the geologists.

278
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,380
That is what is the crux of everything in reality.

279
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:27,000
If you're out in the African desert somewhere, and you find a skull,

280
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,820
it was planted there by God just a few thousand years ago.

281
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:31,620
So you could lick it?

282
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,200
It's right next to where Lucy was.

283
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,480
You go down a few feet deeper than Lucy even.

284
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:39,520
And there's another one.

285
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:44,160
Well, there were cavemen and dinosaurs running around back then.

286
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:47,200
But the great deluge came and smashed a lot of...

287
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,300
So you could lick it?

288
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,060
Yeah.

289
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,660
Was that when Noah?

290
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,760
Yeah, when Noah managed to...

291
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,440
But see, the dinosaurs were too big.

292
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,740
And that's why they didn't survive.

293
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:58,040
And the Australopithecines and the Andropoles,

294
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:02,460
Paleoanthropocas and so forth were all too smelly.

295
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,840
That was their only defense.

296
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:07,260
And so Noah and his family...

297
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,220
Actually, Noah's wife didn't let them on.

298
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:10,580
There's no account.

299
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,860
No suitcase.

300
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,240
No money.

301
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,300
Them three brothers just shouted.

302
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,040
They were going to erect human eggs.

303
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,260
They were going to take the eggs from primates by taking two of each kind.

304
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:22,760
And why did these other ones, these non-godly primates,

305
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,640
why did they bury their dead ceremoniously?

306
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,700
Like Neanderthals buried their dead ceremoniously in...

307
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,580
They were Satanists.

308
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,060
Yes.

309
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:34,860
They were burying them to the wrong god.

310
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,440
Yes, the neutral primates are all Satanists.

311
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,840
And so they were also lost in the great flood.

312
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,160
But many of them had not learned the correct prayers.

313
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,280
So as their prayers are uttered throughout the woods

314
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:44,900
and picked up thousands of years from...

315
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,760
The Grand Canyon was cut 2,000...

316
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,400
I mean, 303 years ago.

317
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:28,000
I get up in the rain

318
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:31,440
The sun has yet to rise

319
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,100
I shake the webs and clear my head

320
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,420
Put on my target eyes

321
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,080
Brown boots and brown fields

322
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:43,520
Brown is all I see

323
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,120
But the red spot on my middle stick

324
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:49,620
Is all I really need

325
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:53,160
On my ride there's many sides

326
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,820
And the bandits on my tail

327
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,680
Another target in the eyes

328
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,380
Of midnight's growing pale

329
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:09,360
Ooh, midnight's growing pale

330
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,400
Ooh

331
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,380
Midnight's growing pale

332
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,800
From morning mist I rise

333
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,620
To help them greet the day

334
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:35,140
With little silver sunbeams

335
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:38,200
And little infrareds

336
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:39,880
I paint the house

337
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,360
I paint the dog

338
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,160
I paint the chicken

339
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:43,460
I paint the chicken

340
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:43,460


341
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,000
I paint the chicken

342
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,940
And when they come out

343
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,360
To see the show

344
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,860
I turn and paint them too

345
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,480
On my ride there's many sides

346
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,980
Bandits on my tail

347
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:59,940
Another target in the eyes

348
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:03,620
Of midnight's growing pale

349
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:09,660
Ooh, midnight's growing pale

350
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,440
Ooh, midnight's growing pale

351
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:15,600
Ooh, midnight's growing pale

352
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,240
Ooh, midnight's growing pale

353
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,860
They'll never know

354
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,360
They'll never see

355
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,980
Before the hit I'm gone

356
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:35,420
Back into the dragon's breath

357
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,700
To sing the dragon's song

358
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,260
Back home folks think what I do

359
00:23:41,260 --> 00:23:43,440
I do to keep them out of my sight

360
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:43,720
I'm free

361
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,740
And no one knows my secret

362
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,760
No one knows I fly for me

363
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,240
On my ride there's many sides

364
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:55,780
Bandits on my tail

365
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,560
Another target in the eyes

366
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:03,300
Of midnight's growing pale

367
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,420
Ooh, midnight's growing pale

368
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,320
Ooh, midnight's growing pale

369
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:13,420
Ooh, midnight's growing pale

370
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:13,420


371
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,260
Ooh, midnight's growing pale

372
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:25,960
Ooh, midnight's growing pale

373
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,760
Ooh

374
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:32,780
Ooh

375
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:32,780


376
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:32,780


377
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:32,780


378
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:32,780


379
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:32,960
Ooh

380
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:33,500
Ooh

381
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:40,640
Ooh

382
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:41,720


383
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:41,720


384
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,780
Ooh, I'm a shiwani

385
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:49,580
Ooh, I'm a shiwani

386
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:55,440
Ooh, I'm a shiwani

387
00:24:55,440 --> 00:25:01,360
Ooh, I'm a shiwani

388
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,560
Ooh, midnight's growing

389
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,480
Ooh, midnight's growing

390
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:10,380
Ooh, midnight's growing

391
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:11,200
Ooh

392
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,960
Ooh

393
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,520
Ooh

394
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,020
Ooh

395
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,060
Ooh

396
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:47,520
Ooh

397
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,560
Ooh

398
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,880
Ooh

399
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:12,160
Things without minds, a world of pain, no luxury, no comfort, no delight, suffering at every corner.

400
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,880
Enjoy yourself. Enjoy yourself.

401
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:27,760
We must get out. We must get out. We must get out this place.

402
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:41,720
Is there no more? There is no future. We have destroyed the land we live in.

403
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:46,060
We have taken the earth and enslaved the earth.

404
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,560
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

405
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,760
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

406
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,500
This is the sloth-jawed face of evolution.

407
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,980
This is the way it's been done for billions of years.

408
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,540
This is the slow-pivot, slumbering, lumbaring face of evolution.

409
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,460
End up!

410
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,500
No, even if they...

411
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:07,520
Next day then. Workout will go for sex day!

412
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,520
We want you people to dance into the new century.

413
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,960
Screw into the new century.

414
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,020
Sleep and eat your way into the new century.

415
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:24,340
Whatever you're doing in the moment of turnover is what you'll be doing forever.

416
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,520
So make sure you're not asleep.

417
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,740
Make sure you're not watching TV.

418
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,520
Make sure you're not listening to Pat Boone.

419
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:33,980
Make sure you're not reaching for an itch.

420
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:34,480
Make sure you're not reaching for an itch.

421
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,740
You'll never be able to scratch.

422
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,280
Friends, you're floating in a sea of pills.

423
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,660
A sea of Bob's pills.

424
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:45,280
But you're just too blind yet to see them.

425
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:48,600
Oh, friends.

426
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:53,860
I know you're not the dumb, asticated type.

427
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,480
I know you're the smart, asticated type.

428
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:00,220
Oh, but people say,

429
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,640
Reverend Stagg, what is slap?

430
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,480
I know you're the smart, asticated type. Oh, but people say,

431
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:04,580
Reverend Stagg, what is slap?

432
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,280
I want you to tell me what slap is.

433
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,480
I want you to tell me what slap is.

434
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:16,900
You know, friends, the television doesn't have to watch you as long as you are watching the television.

435
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:24,820
And a lot of people, a lot of people think that slap is that Miller beer commercial

436
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:29,380
where everybody's good looking and you're rich and your team just won the game

437
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,720
and you're drinking Miller beer and your favorite show is on.

438
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:34,220
And you know that's bullshit.

439
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,800
Because slap is not laziness, friends.

440
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,560
Slap is getting into the zone.

441
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:46,200
It's being awake and alert and doing what you wanted to do until your eyes snap open

442
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:50,520
and you're smart enough to realize that you are God.

443
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,540
Life is worth living.

444
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:58,720
And everything is just as psychedelic as an old t-shirt that you can't fit into anymore.

445
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,160
Now, hold that thought.

446
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,720
Hold it in your head.

447
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:06,340
Because that is what slap is all about, friends.

448
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,560
Slap is something for nothing.

449
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:20,880
Yes, at quadruple X day, the crowds, the masses will all rise up, raise their hands up and sing,

450
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,980
All flesh is like grass.

451
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,560
They shall raise their feet and scream,

452
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:30,020
All flesh is tastier than grass.

453
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:38,340
And that lemongrass can be used with practically any vegetable, fruit, fowl or vuels, vuels, vuels.

454
00:29:38,420 --> 00:29:42,520
And a new barb odor will rise up.

455
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:46,800
And a new, newbile reporter will sing behind him and say,

456
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:49,960
Then all is flesh as is vigras.

457
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:56,920
Froppit, froppit, froppit, froppit, froppit, froppit.

458
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:13,680
The crop circles promise to lead us the way home.

459
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,640
The pipe of Bob dolls is waiting for us.

460
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:21,940
The escape vessels of the sex goddess is coming.

461
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,020
I've paid thirty dollars to fly into space.

462
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:30,000
My father had told me not to go off to space.

463
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:34,600
So I took cash from his wallet and was on my way.

464
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:39,080
My brothers and sisters, they said it's all a sex cult.

465
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:43,040
They tried to stop me, but I shot them all dead.

466
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:52,520
Goodbye to Luckon, hello Margaritas, adios to your old friends, here's a better idea.

467
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,100
You won't have a name when you show up to X day.

468
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,980
And all they will call you will be,

469
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,420
D-Bobby.

470
00:31:01,420 --> 00:31:01,980
D-Bobby.

471
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,760
Some of us are smelly and some are not wanted.

472
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:13,860
Codini has told us we have to move on.

473
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:18,300
We went into T-Base just to meet all our heroes.

474
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:22,300
But Lagoon's got a really big knife and a gun.

475
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,860
We cried in the woods and we cried in the hot tub.

476
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,760
We washed down our pride with the water.

477
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,780
We cried in the water of fire.

478
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:35,260
We cried with some hairy old man they called Mojo.

479
00:31:35,420 --> 00:31:39,160
But we just want to hang with the ones we admire.

480
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:48,680
Goodbye to Luckon, hello Margaritas, adios to your old friends, here's a better idea.

481
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:53,300
You won't have a name when you show up to X day.

482
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,220
And all they will call you will be,

483
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:58,360
D-Bobby.

484
00:31:58,360 --> 00:31:58,360


485
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,060
The campsite erupted just when we all passed out.

486
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,980
A fireball of liquid that singed my young face.

487
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,360
Who were all these people who taught me the lesson?

488
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:18,480
Never pass out stone drunk at Tranquility Base.

489
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:22,800
But is this the best way to teach the young preacher?

490
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,200
And is this the best method to show us?

491
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:31,220
The way to set us on fire and laugh at our screaming.

492
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,320
And be known by no name except D-Bobby.

493
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:44,800
Goodbye to Luckon, hello Margaritas, adios to your old friends, here's a better idea.

494
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:49,440
You won't have a name when you show up to X day.

495
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,340
And all they will call you will be,

496
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,420
D-Bobby.

497
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:05,920
Goodbye to Luckon, hello Margaritas, adios to your old friends, here's a better idea.

498
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,640
You won't have a name when you show up to X day.

499
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:13,640
And all they will call you will be,

500
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,640
D-Bobby.

501
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,060
And all they will call you will be,

502
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,060
D-Bobby.

503
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:30,600
And all they will call you will be,

504
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,660
D-Bobby.

505
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:35,000
D-Bobby.

506
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,000


507
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:36,300
D-Bobby.

508
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:40,480
Are you the next American Idol, Dave?

509
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,540
I'm the next atonal recital.

510
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:47,020
I'm the next beautiful, beautiful bag of puss.

511
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,540
Look at that big old brain cell.

512
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,740
Look at that big old brain cell.

513
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:51,440
It's oozing out.

514
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,260
Big old ugly bag of water held up by a bunch of sticks.

515
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,080
Dicks.

516
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,740
That's a very romantic portrait.

517
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:58,260
It is.

518
00:33:58,420 --> 00:33:59,560
Just painted of the human race.

519
00:33:59,680 --> 00:33:59,940
Yeah.

520
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,540
Saline solution and a flaky...

521
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,820
I told my class the other day.

522
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:11,200
The aliens looking in from outer space, you're just a ugly bag of water held up by a bunch of white sticks.

523
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,820
If some babe goes, oh I love your eyes.

524
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:14,560
I think it is, yeah.

525
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:16,260
Praise Bob, that's right.

526
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,180
See if some babe says, oh I love your eyes or something.

527
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:24,080
Well the bag of ugly water, the ugly bag of water is actually an old Star Trek thing.

528
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:31,320
From the original episode, I think there was some entity that came from outer space and kept calling them ugly bags of water.

529
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:35,240
No, see I think Landry makes more sense now than the ugly bags of water.

530
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,100
But then I added the...

531
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,200
Held up by sticks.

532
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,080
Held up by sticks.

533
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:42,100
It's a slavvy boinkment you've used by the water.

534
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,480
Slavvy boinkment.

535
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:47,100
Once again you've been sitting there for the last two hours thinking the radio was on.

536
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:51,100
No man, the radio's not and it's the voices in your own head.

537
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,060
Those many, many, many voices.

538
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,060


539
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:58,320
But you don't listen too carefully, they will drive you mad.

540
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,360
Rewind, rewind.

541
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,660
Te ponere loco.

542
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:04,600
Te ponere loco de todo.

543
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,720
Are you listening, sheeple?

544
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:11,640
Are you listening to my voice?

545
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,320
Are you listening?

546
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:17,820
You'd better unscrew yourself.

547
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,300
Help me escape.

548
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:22,300
Unscrew yourself from the system.

549
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,160
I have a brain.

550
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,500
Unscrew yourself from the man.

551
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,400
You have a brain?

552
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,220
Unscrew yourself from the mountain that is humanity.

553
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:28,080
That has no escape for you.

554
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:29,060
Help me do things.

555
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:31,780
They make me say things.

556
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,100
Help me escape.

557
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,100
We are only here to help.

558
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,180
I can think.

559
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:37,580
I have a brain.

560
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,000
Partners away from Stang's throat.

561
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,160
They make me do things.

562
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:41,660
Leave him alone.

563
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,360
They make me do things.

564
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,480
Yes, I'm Bryce Bessinger.

565
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,980
They make me say things.

566
00:35:45,080 --> 00:35:47,160
They make me say things.

567
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,520
They make me do things.

568
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,160
They make me do.

569
00:35:50,340 --> 00:35:51,380
Open the cage.

570
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:52,460
Please.

571
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,100
Please.

572
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:53,140
Please.

573
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,140


574
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,140


575
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,140


576
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,140


577
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,140


578
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,140


579
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:53,140


580
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,000
They make me say things.

581
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:55,600


582
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:02,280
And the most colloquial way we can say that God makes us do all kinds of funny things.

583
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,480
I know what I'm saying.

584
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:10,940
And one of the funniest things he's made us do so far is to pretend a belief into our

585
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:17,940
beliefial systems that somehow he, she, I, we, they, and it are all one with a capital

586
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,480
O and a capital of zero.

587
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:22,420
We must get off.

588
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,140
We must get off.

589
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:23,140


590
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,480
We must get off.

591
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,400
We must get off.

592
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,420
We must get off.

593
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,460
We must get off.

594
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,480
We must get off.

595
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,600
We must get off.

596
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,500
Yeah.

597
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,780
Yeah.

598
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,960
Some people say a man is made out of mud.

599
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,000
Some people love their mud.

600
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,580
Present company included.

601
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:22,600
I saw people loving mud at that Starwood Festival.

602
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:25,060
My whole seminar was about loving your mud.

603
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:32,320
Well, it was because the mud was your only possession, right?

604
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:32,860
Mm-hmm.

605
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,660
The birth of the blues when mud was your only possession.

606
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,820
I even took away their names.

607
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,400
All their last names are now Smith.

608
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,780
This was your workshop at Starwood?

609
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,300
Yeah.

610
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,140
Wasn't that supposed to be a workshop in the history of American music,

611
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,440
not?

612
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:53,780
The love of your mud?

613
00:37:56,380 --> 00:37:59,140
Uh, how can you discuss one without the other?

614
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,200
The history of rock and roll and mud love?

615
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:03,880
Mm-hmm.

616
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,240
Mud love at the crossroads.

617
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,700
Makes total sense to me.

618
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:13,820
Made total sense to 25 believers in my workshop.

619
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,340
Well, it was weird because I didn't know you were doing that.

620
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:21,260
And after the, I was walking down the roads at Starwood,

621
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,580
and I'd see these hippies.

622
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:29,560
And I'd see these hipsters and characters walk by cradling ostrich egg-sized lumps of mud.

623
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:35,240
And they'd have little sticks and things stuck in them to decorate them.

624
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,280
They were cradling them like babies.

625
00:38:37,660 --> 00:38:38,100
That's right.

626
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:38,960
They're mud babies.

627
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:43,460
I didn't understand until later that it was you, Professor Smith,

628
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:51,740
that had commanded these young students and old students to make babies or something out of mud.

629
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:52,800
Mm-hmm.

630
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:58,840
And to love them as their only possession so that they could, I guess, identify with the slaves.

631
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,740
The slaves and the Appalachians.

632
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,640
When all you had was your mud.

633
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,300
That's right.

634
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,460
Hey, at least you guys had mud.

635
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:09,060
All we had was sand down in Texas.

636
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,700
Yeah.

637
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,780
We didn't have water to mix with it.

638
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,780
So we couldn't cradle our sand ball.

639
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:15,580
It would just fall through our fingers.

640
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:22,380
Somebody actually pointed out that right there, right near there, the Mississippi Basin cuts through.

641
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:26,780
So that mud really is, you know, Delta mud.

642
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,220
Cuts the Mississippi what?

643
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:30,100
Delta-bound mud.

644
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,020
The Mississippi Basin cuts up.

645
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:35,660
Well, weird water underchannels go all over the country.

646
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:42,900
The Ohio River cuts way off in different directions into Pennsylvania and West Virginia, but it all happens underground.

647
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:50,240
You're saying when a pagan urinates on the path at Brushwood, that water eventually goes down to New Orleans.

648
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:50,600


649
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,360
And parties at Marksville.

650
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:52,860
Marty Groff.

651
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,160
Yeah.

652
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:53,740
Right.

653
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:58,200
But by then it's combined with an...

654
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,620
I mean, have you ever seen the Mississippi River down there, right there at New Orleans?

655
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:02,440
Yes, I have.

656
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:04,120
It's a lot of water flowing there.

657
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:13,460
So it has to combine with many, many, many people's having their urinations in the mud.

658
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,640
I don't know how it is.

659
00:40:16,820 --> 00:40:21,180
You know, the vibes from your atoms of uric acid.

660
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:28,220
Acid join with the vibes of all your, you know, fellow party goers eventually makes it into the Gulf of Mexico.

661
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:28,740
Yeah.

662
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:35,200
And when you stand there down at the French market and watch all that water, that muddy looking water flowing past.

663
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:39,920
That's a lot of flush toilets and a lot of pagans and a lot of campgrounds.

664
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:49,040
Girls, doff tots for rock and roll professors exam on Woodstock.

665
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,000
Doff tots.

666
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,460
Flip hooters for her.

667
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:57,240
Hey, mister, si da cesta.

668
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,060
Don't you laugh, I thrill you.

669
00:40:59,260 --> 00:40:59,720
Oh, yeah.

670
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:00,880
Oh, that was good.

671
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,680
Good though.

672
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:06,480
She's actually playing her two-message pregnant belly right now.

673
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:07,260
What's up, viebro?

674
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,300
There is no death.

675
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,680
There is no war.

676
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,380
I'm going to the Bahamas.

677
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:16,560
That's why them babies down there all have the funny heads in there.

678
00:41:16,660 --> 00:41:18,240
I'm going to the Bahamas, man.

679
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:21,080
I'm heading out for that big evening.

680
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,060
I'm going to the Bahamas.

681
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:22,480
I'm going to the Bahamas.

682
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:26,020
I'm going to smoke me a big fat spleef big as my forearm.

683
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,340
I'm going to set my reptile hairs on fire.

684
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,260
Sitting on a beach somewhere.

685
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,580
Some psychedelic beach somewhere.

686
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,140
Neon beach.

687
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:47,660
You want to know what songs I played in class on September 11th yesterday?

688
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:50,320
I played.

689
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:51,640
Freebird.

690
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:52,200
No, I didn't.

691
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,260
It's more absurd than that.

692
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,560
I played the Andrew Sisters.

693
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,120
Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy.

694
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,480
I played Coming In on a Wing and a Prayer.

695
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,980
I played Dylan.

696
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:13,540
You know, hey.

697
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,280
One of his pro-war songs.

698
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,380
Yeah, right.

699
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:18,520
I played.

700
00:42:19,180 --> 00:42:20,800
Wait, what else did I play?

701
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,420
You played that Slovak orchestra song.

702
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,300
The one, the folk orchestra song.

703
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,400
That was Rushdill.

704
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:27,680
I played Comanche.

705
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:28,600
Comanche.

706
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:29,220
Johnny Horton.

707
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,920
I told him to go to.

708
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,420
Oh, all right.

709
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:31,920
Yeah.

710
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:32,860
Yeah, I remember that.

711
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,180
I told him to go to Vietnam Memorial on Memorial Day.

712
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,120
Did you play Green Berets?

713
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:39,400
Urinate on the foot of the.

714
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,260
No, I didn't do that one, but I should have played that one.

715
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:43,560
Yeah.

716
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,340
And then I played Elvis.

717
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,900
I played Elvis from Elvis for him, too.

718
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:49,640
Elvis Costello?

719
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:50,580
Because he's just really cool.

720
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:51,020
Yeah.

721
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:52,020
You know, he's just real American.

722
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:53,940
Yeah, and he joined, too.

723
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:58,000
Rather than have his head shaved, he enlisted and had his head shaved.

724
00:42:58,180 --> 00:43:00,300
Oh, that was just, you know, publicity stunt.

725
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:00,940
Of course it was.

726
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:05,080
He was just going to hump some fraud lines and make some tunes over there in an army barracks.

727
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:05,520
Yeah.

728
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:07,420
That was PR for the army.

729
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:07,920
Yeah.

730
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,980
They didn't take us seriously last time.

731
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:13,240
Hell, half of you didn't take us seriously.

732
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:15,260
Didn't take Donald Trump as seriously.

733
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,180
But this time we've learned our lesson.

734
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,900
We can't rely.

735
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:22,820
On invisible monsters from outer space.

736
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,820
We can't even rely on Bob.

737
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:35,120
We have to learn how to escape Earth without being dependent on the conspiracy or any extraterrestrials or salesmen.

738
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:41,240
Sure, send in your 30 bucks, but build your own ship.

739
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,180
You may not have to, but just to cover your ass.

740
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,360
Build your own ship.

741
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,400
Even better, go buy Hangar 18 or...

742
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:57,400
Area 51 or Cape Canaveral or Studio 54 and steal your own ship.

743
00:43:58,600 --> 00:43:59,620
Ah, yes.

744
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,340
Extract your own fuel.

745
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:09,680
And while you're at it, friends, let's swab the deck on the spaceship that we're already stuck together on.

746
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,500
We're already riding on the spaceship and it's in bad shape.

747
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,480
And it's high time we cleaned it up.

748
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:17,760
Earth!

749
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:20,340
We must get off!

750
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:23,860
Whether we leave it or leave it a cinder.

751
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:26,620
Whether we blow it off or blow it up.

752
00:44:26,740 --> 00:44:28,520
Just don't blow it, friends!

753
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,740
Dave, I think you've been listening to too much commercial right now.

754
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:32,660
Alright, here, I'll give you a set up.

755
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,440
I'll give you guys a set up.

756
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,320
You can do the God is a cowboy one.

757
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,840
You can do a version of it.

758
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,780
Okay, when I point at you, you can just rant.

759
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,540
Whoever, Dave, you, you rant.

760
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:48,940
But on the theme of God and the Wild West.

761
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,380
But also, God is a cowboy.

762
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:50,380


763
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:50,380


764
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:50,380


765
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,060
God being an extraterrestrial cowboy.

766
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:53,460
Yeah, right, right.

767
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:54,600
Wearing gaucho chaps.

768
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:56,680
A chandelier belt.

769
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:58,380
Maybe a lonesome cow god.

770
00:44:58,640 --> 00:44:59,460
Turquoise buckles.

771
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:02,400
Big old pair of lizard skin boots.

772
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,320
Denver lizard skin boots.

773
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:05,760
But, uh,

774
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:08,180
If, uh,

775
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,700
When I throw my hand up.

776
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,920
That's the script.

777
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,360
Stare away from your armpits.

778
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,420
Avert your gaze.

779
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,680
That's the other script. Don't breathe in, say enough.

780
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,980
You gotta stop for the chorus.

781
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:24,340
And then go preach all you want on the other part.

782
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,700
Okay, what's the finger sign for speaking Portuguese?

783
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:28,640
To give it a Brazilian flavor.

784
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,680
If I hold up the, hold up my finger green.

785
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:34,700
Then, yeah, just go for it, dude.

786
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:35,160
Okay.

787
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,020
What if you bend over and spread them?

788
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:39,920
What if God really is a cowboy?

789
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:43,120
And his favorite people of all, that's it.

790
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,540
You know, he's on America's side.

791
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,220
Because they were the cowboys.

792
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:49,680
He created cowboys here after he got done, you know,

793
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:50,380
Messing everything up.

794
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,640
And then he finally got it right.

795
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:54,540
When he made the cowboy,

796
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,480
God finally got it right.

797
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:59,900
What if God was Paul Bunyan?

798
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:00,400
Yee-haw!

799
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:04,900
Hehehehehehe!

800
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:05,420
That's right!

801
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,820
Woo-hoo!

802
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,780
Get along, little doggies!

803
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,260
Yeah!

804
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:13,560
Get along now!

805
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:14,040
Hyah-yah!

806
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,620
Listen, God is a cowboy!

807
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:20,120
That means you're his little cow.

808
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:20,380
That's right!

809
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:22,480
You know where God's taking you?

810
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:24,760
Little, little doggie?

811
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:25,740
Little bobby?

812
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:28,500
You know where God's

813
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,280
whipping you onto?

814
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,860
Well, don't you worry about that.

815
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,260
Because he's taking good care of you along the way.

816
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,100
He's fattening you up, baby!

817
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,220
Yes, sir!

818
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,000
You're God's little

819
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,540
future hamburger, baby.

820
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:44,100
He's gonna sell you at the market

821
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,220
at a good price.

822
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,500
He's gonna catch you down that trail.

823
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:49,000
That wild,

824
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:50,600
tumbleweed ridden,

825
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,220
rattlesnake sneaking trail.

826
00:46:53,420 --> 00:46:55,540
Yes, God has got

827
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,660
his cats on!

828
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,240
That's all he's got on!

829
00:46:58,360 --> 00:46:59,680
He's naked! Naked!

830
00:46:59,980 --> 00:47:01,380
God must be a cowboy

831
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:03,220
He saw me in a dream

832
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:05,440
He rode in from my darkness

833
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:07,240
Onto my TV screen

834
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,480
Worked somewhere deep inside me

835
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,500
My passion it ignites

836
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,440
That God must be a cowboy

837
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:15,180
Riding through the night

838
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:17,680
Yeah, guess we got the job

839
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:19,440
alright. We're driving them

840
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:21,300
Brahma bulls back on down

841
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,600
to Laramie. Laramie's

842
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,460
quite a few fathoms from this

843
00:47:25,460 --> 00:47:27,440
here reckoning. It looks like

844
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,060
we're gonna have to follow the stars.

845
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,400
But the stars we're gonna be

846
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,020
following aren't your usual stars

847
00:47:33,020 --> 00:47:35,180
you see in the sky. They're the

848
00:47:35,180 --> 00:47:37,260
stars you see when God beats you

849
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:39,520
over the head with that Winchester rifle!

850
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,000
Yee-haw!

851
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,520
Woo-hoo! Yee-haw!

852
00:47:43,760 --> 00:47:45,160
You're going to heaven,

853
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:47,660
little bobbies! God's

854
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:48,680
taking you to heaven!

855
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,220
Ah, yes!

856
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,020
Ha!

857
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,600
God must be

858
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:57,340
a cowboy came to me

859
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,380
in a dream. He rode in

860
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,300
from my darkness onto my

861
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,200
TV screen. Worked somewhere

862
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,300
deep inside me. My passion

863
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,400
it ignites. That God must

864
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,220
be a cowboy riding

865
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:11,560
through the night. Get on! Get on

866
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:13,420
now! Yee-haw! You can't slow down!

867
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,320
We go to

868
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,560
destination. Boys and girls

869
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,240
we're going to this, this slot.

870
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,320
I mean heaven. Heaven is where

871
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:23,500
we're going at the end of this trail.

872
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:24,840
Yee-haw!

873
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:27,520
Get on! Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!

874
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,320
Hey, man. Hey, man. You're

875
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:31,440
on the wrong... Hey, wait! You're going the wrong way!

876
00:48:31,540 --> 00:48:31,800
Wait!

877
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,220
Wait! You can't ride that bull

878
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:37,500
by. What are you doing on the back of that? Hey, man! Get over

879
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,780
there! Get on!

880
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,160
Get on, little

881
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:43,180
doggies! God must

882
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,220
be a bad man. It's a long trail.

883
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:46,900
We're almost there!

884
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,080
Hyah!

885
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:51,400
God must be a cowboy

886
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:53,220
came to me in a dream.

887
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:55,500
He rode in from my darkness

888
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,140
onto my TV screen.

889
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,060
Worked somewhere deep inside

890
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,120
me. My passion did ignite.

891
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,440
That God must be a cowboy

892
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,260
riding through the night.

893
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,080
Hey, uh, I

894
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:09,100
see the fire's off in the distance.

895
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:11,140
But that don't look like

896
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:11,800
the fire.

897
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:13,520
It looks like, it looks like

898
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,800
it looks like pokey slid into the old Jimmy's campfire.

899
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:17,200
Let's boozy on down

900
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,460
and have some beans and bread

901
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:22,200
and some cornbread. Oh, I love Johnny King.

902
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,160
Hey, let's all just get a

903
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:26,220
skin of women. Wait!

904
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,020
Wait! Those are the fires!

905
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:29,780
The hell! The fire!

906
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:32,560
My legs are on fire!

907
00:49:34,660 --> 00:49:35,300
My

908
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,380
legs

909
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,600
are on fire!

910
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:40,620
Welcome aboard, boys!

911
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,220
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

912
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:47,360
Your slaughterhouse was first!

913
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:52,420
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!

914
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:56,240
Oh, God must be a cowboy, gave to me in a dream

915
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,280
He rode in from my darkness onto my TV screen

916
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:04,200
But somewhere deep inside me, my passion did ignite

917
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,240
That God must be a cowboy, riding through the night

918
00:50:10,200 --> 00:50:12,140
And all my dreams...

919
00:50:12,660 --> 00:50:13,400
My dream what?

920
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,160
That God is a cowboy?

921
00:50:15,580 --> 00:50:21,300
A cowboy, very big, and... and with eyes!

922
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:27,660
Now I lay me down to sleep, in cold crystal patterns

923
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:28,640
I pray, I pray

924
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:31,120
Amino acid ancestors

925
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:37,660
Now I die, before I wake in silent void

926
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:38,480
And I'm no longer the same

927
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:38,740
No more...

928
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:40,920
Galactic space

929
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:44,700
Shimmering molecular designs

930
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:47,800
Are you trying to bum out the people that are tripping or something, Chaz?

931
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:53,520
Hey man, you trying to put a dodecahedron in the back of their conceptual shadow space now?

932
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,620
Hey man, life is a joke, it's alive!

933
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:57,620
Ha ha!

934
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,480
You...

935
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:02,200
You...

936
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,480
And friends, someday you're gonna shut up like hell.

937
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:08,220
So you better make... You better...

938
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:11,060
Better shout and make a lot of noise.

939
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,680
Because someday your vocal cords are going to be frozen.

940
00:51:15,020 --> 00:51:19,080
Just like that is snow right to the left of your...

941
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,320
They're on the monitor.

942
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:26,760
So I'd like to give thanks to the universe for every single extra second that I get to live.

943
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:29,180
Praise Bob and hail Connie.

944
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,740
My God, there's at least seven minutes left of this life.

945
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:39,540
This little life captured forever on the spinning disks and reams.

946
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:44,180
So much more permanent than you or I.

947
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:47,020
We are but mayflies.

948
00:51:47,320 --> 00:51:48,120
Bugs.

949
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:55,460
Perhaps just as we examine and pity and laugh at the little mayfly in its brief span.

950
00:51:55,660 --> 00:52:00,260
Perhaps some larger creature is gazing upon us.

951
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,980
Perhaps our little world is but an aquarium.

952
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:06,460
And you are nailed to the door of perception.

953
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,620
Endlessly watching it swing open and shut.

954
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:15,220
Jesus came knocking but no one answered.

955
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:21,120
It's more like Prometheus on the dock waiting for the persecutor to let him be.

956
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,180
Buddha came knocking and they hit him on the head with a stick.

957
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:29,860
Bob came a knocking but you didn't have your thirty dollars.

958
00:52:30,660 --> 00:52:33,140
And he was too thick.

959
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:38,880
And so Bob was wroth and wrath in his anger.

960
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,660
And he yanked upon the rug and spread the banana peels.

961
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:53,660
And so many fell and the bigger they fell, the harder Bob came.

962
00:52:54,700 --> 00:53:00,560
And his laugh rang out for political corruptigation from holiday to holiday.

963
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,480
Very, very drastic disease in the body.

964
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:04,180
But he was healthy.

965
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:08,360
We thank our lord, Jesus, the five-master-lord.

966
00:53:08,780 --> 00:53:11,180
In his big, shiny fangs.

967
00:53:11,780 --> 00:53:15,120
For God has made us in his own image.

968
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:18,140
And he's tired of looking in the mirror.

969
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:20,640
No problem.

970
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,500
publish an album of compelling legends about the respected freeman kübel

971
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,280
I stopped marketing my company.

972
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,020
And all the makers are proud to write plans to sellzier Ready

973
00:53:26,020 --> 00:53:26,020


974
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,780
I'm Brad everyday.

975
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:33,700
If you've got a plan,

976
00:53:33,740 --> 00:53:36,600
Bob Dobbs, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

977
00:53:36,620 --> 00:53:38,020
the living avatar of Slack.

978
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:39,800
You whom we thank

979
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,020
for our frop,

980
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:42,760
our

981
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,480
frankness,

982
00:53:45,700 --> 00:53:47,200
our frang,

983
00:53:47,780 --> 00:53:49,100
and our pang-eye,

984
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:52,260
and other things that the listener

985
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:53,440
does not know.

986
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:55,440
It is time

987
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,780
for all of you to decrease.

988
00:53:58,100 --> 00:53:59,780
Let go of the many, many

989
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:00,620
foods you have been tempted to do.

990
00:54:00,620 --> 00:54:03,940
Float downstream, dude. Black is the color and none is the number.

991
00:54:04,340 --> 00:54:05,780
Turn off your mind.

992
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:06,100
Relax.

993
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:07,900
Void, void, void.

994
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,740
Anything that makes it

995
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:12,800
harder to pee

996
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,180
is anti-Slack.

997
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,820
J.R. Bob Dobbs, 1959.

998
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,740
I believe that

999
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,380
prunes are God's

1000
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:23,520
answer to man's every

1001
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,660
dilemma. Anything that makes it harder to

1002
00:54:25,660 --> 00:54:27,120
learn is also

1003
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:29,480
anti-Slack. Reverend Ivan Stang, 2000.

1004
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,600
We can only

1005
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,400
offer our

1006
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,060
sincere thanks for that.

1007
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:39,620
So turn off that TV and turn up

1008
00:54:39,620 --> 00:54:41,440
your radio and read a

1009
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,380
book every now and then. Food!

1010
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:45,680
Oh, boy.

1011
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:46,300
I've noticed.

1012
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:49,640
Very, very, very, very, very, very, very,

1013
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,180
very, very, very.

1014
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,420
It's Halloween, children.

1015
00:54:52,820 --> 00:54:54,340
It's spooky time.

1016
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,360
Things are going to get weird, aren't they?

1017
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:58,660
People act weird.

1018
00:54:58,800 --> 00:54:59,600
It's special.

1019
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:00,500
It's amateur.

1020
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,080
A great little wash in the back of your head.

1021
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:04,800
Welcome to it.

1022
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,680
Till next week.

1023
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:13,220
For two hours, they see what my world is like 365 days a year.

1024
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:14,040
Till next week.

1025
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:14,680
Keep your hat on.

1026
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:15,500
Tie your back to the wind.

1027
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,460
You're sacking the saddle.

1028
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:17,700
See y'all.

1029
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:28,260
Well, I guess it's time to sniffle up to that old cosmic calendar

1030
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,660
and count off another day.

1031
00:55:30,920 --> 00:55:35,480
Remember, the higher you vibrate, the greater your chances of a vibratory accident.

1032
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:40,800
Please make sure everything is hermetically sealed in a latex product before using.

1033
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,600
Till next week.

1034
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:45,380
Keep your hat on.

1035
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,460
Tie your back to the wind.

1036
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:47,620
And you're sacking the saddle.

1037
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,460
Going from cowboy to dave.

1038
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,020
Increased vibratory levels also because of many road accidents.

1039
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,080
I'm Reverend Ivan Stang, and my name's Chad.

1040
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,960
When I'm driving on parkways past midnight,

1041
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:02,300
please pay attention to the small animals which you could strike with your mighty fist,

1042
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,640
especially if you had a wheel and a window.

1043
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:08,140
But that's only for a superior, super-evolved being,

1044
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:12,560
something you would never be until you make your vibration level so much higher.

1045
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:15,640
Just think of vibrating at higher levels.

1046
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:17,060
Think of it.

1047
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,300
Just keep it in your mind.

1048
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:27,460
Take me home, silly boy.

1049
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:34,400
Cause I'm still in love with you.

1050
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:36,660
Take me home.

1051
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:37,940
Thank you, Mom.

1052
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,240
It's the neutral matter.

1053
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,720
I can't stop doing it.

1054
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:53,500
Oh.

1055
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:17,640
I guess I'm pregunta'ing, I guess BE avant...

1056
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:18,040
yeah?

1057
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:19,540
We are fellin' off a little我

1058
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:19,540


1059
00:57:19,540 --> 00:57:19,580
Y'all no love, boy?

1060
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:19,580


1061
00:57:19,580 --> 00:57:20,280
We must not altenz paradise

1062
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:20,280


1063
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:20,280


1064
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,900
From my point of view

1065
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:23,640
She's so Stuart

1066
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:23,640


1067
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:23,680
Oh, time passes quickly

1068
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:28,240
and I wanna find my way up to which path

1069
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:28,240


1070
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:32,720
Go to sleep

1071
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:38,000
And dream of flying high

1072
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,760
On lullabies

1073
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,620
And dreams that Bob has now

1074
00:57:46,120 --> 00:57:50,040
Sex goddesses and squid

1075
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:53,940
Shall hide away

1076
00:57:53,940 --> 00:57:58,780
The smiling face of Bob

1077
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:00,920
Will keep you safe

1078
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:03,220
Till your sex game

1079
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:05,360
A sex goddess

1080
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,120
Will keep you safe

1081
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:14,000
By counting sheeples

1082
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:17,180
Follow bulls

1083
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:20,060
To the halfway bill

1084
00:58:20,060 --> 00:58:21,520
Follow blob

1085
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,320
By following bull

1086

01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:34,240
But you don't have to

1125
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,660

1131
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:51,040


1132
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:52,240
The other

1133
01:00:52,240 --> 01:00:52,720
destUNT

1134
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,980
But keep my eyes to the ground

1135
01:00:57,660 --> 01:01:00,340
I go round and round

1136
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,800
Like a sad little clown

1137
01:01:09,420 --> 01:01:13,060
Oh, oh, I get it

1138
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,700
In my dream

1139
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:21,660
I'm standing on the mountains on the moon

1140
01:01:22,300 --> 01:01:24,240
And I'm looking back at Earth

1141
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,620
And there it is, just floating underneath me

1142
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:34,740
And there's nothing holding it up

1143
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:37,380
And it looks so small and fragile

1144
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:43,500
And as it spins around there I think

1145
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,360
Gosh, that's where it all started

1146
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:50,780
That's where humans first took their first steps

1147
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:54,940
That's where all the songs that were ever written were wrote there

1148
01:01:54,940 --> 01:01:57,560
All the deeds that were ever done

1149
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,600
All the people who ever lived

1150
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:02,120
All lived there

1151
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,480
And that's when I realized

1152
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:16,260
Us and all our friends are so fucked up

1153
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,640
Us and all our friends are so fucked up

1154
01:02:21,660 --> 01:02:24,820
Us and all our friends are so fucked up

1155
01:02:27,860 --> 01:02:33,240
Us and all our friends are so fucked up

1156
01:02:36,260 --> 01:02:41,500
Us and all our friends are so fucked up

1157
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:49,480
Us and all our friends are so fucked up

1158
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:51,000
Us and all our friends are so fucked up

1159
01:02:51,000 --> 01:02:51,640
Us and all our friends are so fucked up

1160
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:51,640


1161
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:51,640


1162
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:51,640


1163
01:02:51,640 --> 01:02:51,640


1164
01:02:51,660 --> 01:03:00,180
are so fun. Us and all our friends are so fun. You should be singing along with us because

1165
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:06,480
you know it's true. And you're not going to really be free to come to these festivals

1166
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,860
to find freedom and to find healing. You're not going to find that healing until you just

1167
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:23,040
admit it, goddammit. Come on now. Us and all our friends are so fun. Us and all our friends

1168
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:38,100
are so fun. Us and all our friends are so fun. Us and all our friends are so fun.
