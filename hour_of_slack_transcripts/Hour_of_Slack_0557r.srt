1
00:00:03,400 --> 00:00:09,000
But now, I want you to remember to stay good boys and girls.

2
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,120
Respect your mothers and fathers and do what they tell you.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:18,560
Obey your teachers and learn a whole lot.

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:27,980
Now, if you do this, I'll make sure you get good presents from me every year.

5
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:40,000
But if you're bad boys and girls, your name goes in the bad boys and girls book.

6
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:45,640
And I'll bring you something horrible.

7
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,880
The Self Genius Hour of Swag.

8
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,620
A toast!

9
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,420
To Santa Claus!

10
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,080
To Santa Claus!

11
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,420
One, two, Santa's coming for you.

12
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,580
Three, four, you better lock your door.

13
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:25,400
Five, six, grab a crucifix.

14
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,700
Seven, eight.

15
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,720
You better stay up late.

16
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,660
Nine, ten.

17
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,180
Santa's coming again!

18
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,280
Now Dasher!

19
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,340
Now Dancer!

20
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,120
Now Prancer and Vixen!

21
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,660
One Comet!

22
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:48,280
One Cupid!

23
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,880
One Donner and Branson!

24
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:51,900
Now dash away!

25
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,940
Dash away!

26
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,240
Dash away all!

27
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,320
Mm-hmm.

28
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:59,080
Uh huh.

29
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:03,000
Mm-hmm.

30
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,340
Mm.

31
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:05,500
Mm.

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,280
Mm.

33
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:09,820


34
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:11,780


35
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,480
Mm.

36
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:14,920
Mm.

37
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,440
Mm.

38
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,580
Mm.

39
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,000
Who were they, number six?

40
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:41,840
Who let you in?

41
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:42,740
What are their names?

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,980
There's an organization, isn't there?

43
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,380
Dissidents.

44
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,800
Who's the head man?

45
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:47,880
Santa Claus.

46
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:54,820
Daddy, when's Santa be showing with his big red sack?

47
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:25,860
Daddy, when's Santa be showing with his big red sack?

48
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:30,160
Mrs. Claus, are you ready at last?

49
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,780
Your pole is ready.

50
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,220
I'm bumped up with gas.

51
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,260
It's Christmas time, it's my time of year.

52
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:39,400
Get your sweet bones cooking, let's get into gear.

53
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,500
Santa's red sack is packed and he's ready to roll.

54
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,700
You'll love them women from the hips to the toes.

55
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,780
Time to pack up the sled, make that be trip.

56
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,920
No time to complain, don't give me no less.

57
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,600
They're counting on me.

58
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,780
It's Christmas time, deliver my load.

59
00:03:56,940 --> 00:03:57,960
If I don't, it's a good day.

60
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,800
It's Christmas time, it's my time of year.

61
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,640
Through the cold north sky, I'm flying my sled.

62
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,840
Don't need no radar, I'm using my head.

63
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,340
To direct my notes, if y'all do the plumb.

64
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:11,280
Tickle your fancy till the morning come.

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,560
Christmas time, it's my time of year.

66
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:27,960
Get your sweet bones cooking, let's get into gear.

67
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:32,740
Santa's red sack is packed and he's ready to roll.

68
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,940
You'll love them women from the hips to the toes.

69
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,080
Well, I come down to Cheapman just once a year.

70
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,380
With my big red sack and a belly full of beer.

71
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,240
I'm gonna bring all the women lots of Christmas cheer.

72
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,260
Load it in, ready, say, it must appear.

73
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,620
This is the story of old Saint Nick.

74
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,740
With his big red sack and his candy stick.

75
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:57,940
Flying back home with his beer so white.

76
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,160
Getting high, I'd drink some of his beer.

77
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:10,420
My mom said he had to be a very didn't down boy,

78
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,020
So that he could relax.

79
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,020


80
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,020


81
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,400
Well, I'm so efficient I gotta put an end to it.

82
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:13,840
Checker changes ass when I get aóc denim.

83
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,900
Christmas still, my birthday present.

84
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:26,980
To myself and to all those here.

85
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:49,060
Yes, dear friends.

86
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:53,140
Santa's Big Red Sack by Iron Liver

87
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:57,360
with Brother Cleve Duncan and Dr. Felix Krul on vocals.

88
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:03,000
And yes, it is the Hour of Slack traditional Christmas show,

89
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,460
which is, as always, composed of all previous subgenius Christmas shows.

90
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,840
But don't despair. I know the last five were exactly alike.

91
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,160
But this time, why?

92
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,880
It's half new, thanks to an amazing Christmas barrage tape

93
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,880
we got from the good Reverend Jerry,

94
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:26,300
most aptly named subgenius, Nutter,

95
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,640
Reverend Jerry Nutter,

96
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,060
a tape called The Hopes and Fears of All the Years.

97
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,880
Ah, yes.

98
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,200
You know, when those other tape editing geniuses

99
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:41,160
and mad collectors help us out this way,

100
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:47,860
why, it makes Slack so much easier to get

101
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,980
in this hectic Saturnalia season.

102
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,180
By the way, I should also mention that we're doing this show

103
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,640
entirely at home, so to speak.

104
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:03,640
Most Hour of Slack shows are at least partly put together

105
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,320
live on the air in the high-tech studios of KNON.

106
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:12,400
But since this show has to be ready two weeks ahead of time,

107
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:17,000
I am forced to do it here at Bulldada Time Control Laboratories,

108
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,300
which may help to explain the lack of background music

109
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,480
and my own lack of the terror of,

110
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,340
oh my God, we're live!

111
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:29,900
And thousands are ready to pounce on any screw-up!

112
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,200
Actually, I kind of hate doing shows without that panicky feeling.

113
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,160
And you may also notice the different ambiance,

114
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:43,520
room sound, air noise, or smells, or what have you.

115
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,160
The background sounds like squeaky chairs,

116
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,240
or differently squeaky chair.

117
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,700
The dogs barking and the nuclear reactor thunking away,

118
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,180
and the whimperings.

119
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,840
The sub-Bobbies.

120
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:01,480
And, of course, poor old Willa Dobbs laboring away over there.

121
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,440
You there, Will?

122
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,640
Over there across the warehouse supervising the mail order division,

123
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:11,780
hauling canisters of souls down to the basement.

124
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,200
Anyway, all I want for Christmas, friends,

125
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:17,960
is my two frontal lobes back

126
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:22,940
and a stocking full of slack from Bob's own illegitimate dad,

127
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,940
Saint Nick, or Old Nick.

128
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,000
I can't remember which he prefers to be called.

129
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,400
Old Scratch, whatever.

130
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,800
Oh, yes.

131
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:51,540
Oh, so nice to hear Reverend Yukon Jack's Christmas themes again,

132
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:55,320
from his kitty cat singing to you, dear friends.

133
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:55,580
Yes?

134
00:08:55,940 --> 00:09:00,220
This is, uh, listen, for those of you doubtful about the hour of slack,

135
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:04,280
stay tuned, because I'm going to be playing a Christmas carol

136
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:10,320
so horrible, so anti-human, so absolutely...

137
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,820
I mean, believe me, you want a tape of the song,

138
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,140
the Christmas carol, that I'm...

139
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,540
recorded right here in Dallas by sick, sick minds.

140
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,920
Sick, sick minds.

141
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,480
I'm so

142
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:46,480


143
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:46,480


144
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,900
But Refty, wary citizen, but nothing ye dismay,

145
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:54,520
though Christ was not our savior, nor born on Christmas day

146
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,080
my stupid dad

147
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:55,920
to save us all tomorrow.

148
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:58,960
All from atoms, bonds, and we have gone astray.

149
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:03,520
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

150
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:07,060
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

151
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:12,580
God love ye weary citizens, for it is such a shame

152
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,940
to think of cruel injustices all done in Jesus' name.

153
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:21,360
Remember when you go to church, believers are to blame.

154
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,960
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

155
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:29,400
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

156
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,000
God help ye weary citizens, you've all been taken in

157
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,340
by priesthood's waxing rich and fat upon your fear of sin.

158
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,800
Though you may knock at heaven's door, they will not let you in.

159
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:48,320
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

160
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:51,340
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

161
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,500
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

162
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:57,260
God save ye weary citizens, for this will make ye sick.

163
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,740
That Christ was just another Jew they nailed upon a stick.

164
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,180
He couldn't save himself, you know religion is a trick.

165
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,760
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear, trembling and fear.

166
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:14,220
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

167
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:48,000
Oh, tidings of trembling and fear.

168
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:50,880
Oh, yes, and we have also,

169
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,340
I think it's been a while since I've said this, but I'm going to say it again.

170
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:51,340


171
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,180
another...

172
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,980
Damn it, where's my script?

173
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,360
Yeah, a new, that is new

174
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,140
this month, 1990 new Christmas

175
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,220
Carol, or actually it's an

176
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,540
X-mas, no, an X-ist-mas

177
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,340
Carol, not an

178
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,060
X-mas Carol, from the mighty

179
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,360
Soso Dada Clanch in Elizabeth,

180
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,640
New Jersey.

181
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,140
And you'll have to listen close to the lyrics,

182
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:17,420
because I believe this one is supposed to be

183
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,140
being sung by

184
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:20,820
the X-ists.

185
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,520
Slack Boba,

186
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,320
dropping in the hay,

187
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,800
with Connie and some Cutters,

188
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,840
they're on X-stay.

189
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:30,880
X-ists will come on,

190
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,920
must be on day one,

191
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,660
and we will have some

192
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,580
Slack Boba,

193
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,280
squat on top of it,

194
00:12:37,420 --> 00:12:38,220
do it all the day,

195
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,560
yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

196
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,040
We'll mess this up.

197
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,340
Slack Boba,

198
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,340
Slack Boba,

199
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,860
hey,

200
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:49,220
hey,

201
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,120
Connie,

202
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,280
Connie,

203
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,880
Thank you.

204
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,940
Thank you.

205
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,260
Thank you.

206
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,100
Good Lord.

207
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:24,840
For a brief moment,

208
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,400
the lights will go on.

209
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,300
And then a bomb concealed in one of the

210
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,400
tree ornaments will detonate,

211
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,940
destroying everyone

212
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,420
in the immediate area.

213
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,100
Including the president?

214
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,760
Especially the president.

215
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,400
And simultaneously,

216
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,180
five beautiful rockets will soar

217
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,300
like avenging angels through the night sky.

218
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,360
And when they reach their targets...

219
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:49,360
Merry Christmas,

220
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:50,800
everyone!

221
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,720
Merry Christmas, everyone!

222
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,920
To the minds of all beings,

223
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,920
let's penetrate the sacred radiation.

224
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,280
With your fiery incendiary

225
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,180
missiles of mercy,

226
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,200
turn out the hate and normalcy

227
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,220
which has sought to subdue our church

228
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:06,200
and our abnormality.

229
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:07,220
Sure, let's do it.

230
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,520
Purify them with your cleansing radioactive breath

231
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,220
till nothing human exists.

232
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,040
And now...

233
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,840
...carrier ducts

234
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:18,260
charged into a million

235
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,700
energy-efficient particles.

236
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:20,760
Again!

237
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:21,620
Give!

238
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,600
Give, folks!

239
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,120
Give a little to poor old

240
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,220
Santa Claus!

241
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,400
Give what you can

242
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,320
so thems ain't got hardly anything at all!

243
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:35,180
You can have a little Christmas cheer!

244
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,320
Give!

245
00:15:36,820 --> 00:15:37,440
Give!

246
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:38,640
Give!

247
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:39,540
Somebody will hit

248
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,140
like an atom bomb

249
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,520
when he comes,

250
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,680
when he comes!

251
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:43,820
You!

252
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:51,980
I said, give!

253
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:51,980


254
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:58,740
Come on!

255
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:02,900
For those of you out there who enjoy the latest in new music

256
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,820
you'll want to know...

257
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,720
Back we go.

258
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,540
Oh, dear friends, this is...

259
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,240
Magic mode.

260
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,480
What is it?

261
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,000
What is this?

262
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,220
Say, do we have any druids in the audience?

263
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,660
Well, hi, yeah.

264
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,020
This one's for you.

265
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,320
Magic Mose and his Royal Rockers here.

266
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,660
Have yourselves

267
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,080
A groovy little solstice

268
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:36,540
Mithras won his fight

269
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,960
From now on

270
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:49,100
The days are longer than the night

271
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,560
Yeah, have yourselves

272
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,540
A groovy little solstice

273
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:08,480
Nosh out on druid food

274
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,360
Yeah, make little pigs of yourselves.

275
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,800
Then we'll all dance naked

276
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:19,880
In a fair stew

277
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:20,640
Yeah, make little pigs of yourselves

278
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:29,420
In a fair stew

279
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:33,300
If you are a dazzling urbanite

280
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:37,460
A smug suburbanite

281
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,680
Hey, that's cool

282
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:46,480
You don't have to lead

283
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,360
A boring country life

284
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,640
To be a good man

285
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,520
To groove on natural life

286
00:17:54,820 --> 00:17:56,440
As a rule

287
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,400
Someday soon

288
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,620
We'll all dance nude together

289
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:12,180
If utility rates allow

290
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,640
You know, those funky Boston Edison guys, you know

291
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,620
Until then

292
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,620
We'll dance nude

293
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,860
On our ritual nobes and bow

294
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:34,080
To have ourselves

295
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,400
A groovy little solstice now

296
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,380
Take it away, guys.

297
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,620
Oh yeah, all you pagans and pagans

298
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:50,620


299
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:50,620


300
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,920
Out there ought to get into this

301
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,580
Special Christmas show

302
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,000
Here on the Hour of Slack

303
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,920
This is Magic Mose and his Royal Rockers

304
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,120
So, are you all having a good time this evening, huh?

305
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:00,840
I sure am

306
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Aren't you?

307
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,320
Yeah

308
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,820
Are they putting booze in the drinks tonight, huh?

309
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:06,960
Mm-hmm

310
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:07,680
Oh, yeah

311
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,660
Well, remember, folks

312
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,560
The more you drink, the better we sound

313
00:19:10,560 --> 00:19:11,020
Yeah

314
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:12,680
The better I feel

315
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:14,640
The more you drink

316
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,980
Praise Bob

317
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:20,600
Oh, yeah

318
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,420
It may be a witchcraft

319
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,920
The Royal Rockers, ladies and gentlemen

320
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,620
Aren't they wonderful?

321
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,020
But it's wonderful

322
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,300
It's a wonderful one

323
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:26,840
Thank you, thank you very much

324
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,420
Thank you

325
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,560
That was wonderful

326
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,560
The boys, thank you

327
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,220
I thank you

328
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,240
Oh, who would love

329
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:35,740
Hey, we're swinging now

330
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:36,660
Yeah

331
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,480
I'm not afraid of the cold or the dark

332
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:42,480
All my life I've lived in the cold and the dark

333
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,240
Well, who are you, little girl?

334
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:45,620
I am Greta Vilna

335
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:47,760
Please help me, Sandy Claus

336
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,440
Sure, sure, I will

337
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:50,920
But where do you live?

338
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,900
I don't live anywhere now

339
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:56,300
Don't you know the house or the street?

340
00:19:56,620 --> 00:19:58,920
There are so many houses all alike

341
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,180
So many streets all alike

342
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:03,160
Oh, you poor little girl

343
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,320
This is terrible

344
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,080
Please don't cry for me, Sandy Claus

345
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,120
I'm not afraid for myself

346
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:11,000
Only for my papa

347
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,520
Where's your papa gone?

348
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,280
To a newspaper office

349
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,600
A newspaper office?

350
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:16,620
What newspaper?

351
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,340
I can't remember, but...

352
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,500
He had to go

353
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:22,740
And I'm afraid they'll send him away to prison

354
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:23,860
Like they did at home

355
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:25,340
No, they won't, miss

356
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:28,740
Newspapers don't ever send nobody to prison in America

357
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,040
They only try to help the police

358
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,300
The police

359
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,580
That's where I better take you, miss

360
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,780
To the police station

361
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,380
Oh, no

362
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:38,100
Please, no, Sandy Claus

363
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,160
I'm afraid of police stations

364
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:40,560
Why?

365
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:43,960
Because people who go to police stations

366
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,400
Hardly ever come home again

367
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,440
Not here, miss

368
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,540
Why, if that was so in America

369
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,860
There wouldn't be enough jails to hold them

370
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,320
Now, you come on

371
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,700
I gotta get you out of this cold and snow

372
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,620
No, please, Sandy Claus

373
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:00,000
Don't take me to the police station

374
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,720
Only two shopping days

375
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,600
To Christmas Day

376
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,880
Well, I hope you've done all your shopping by now

377
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,320
If you haven't

378
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,320
You can go ahead and go running out to the department stores

379
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,940
Even now

380
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,520
But you might prefer to go to the department stores

381
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:21,440
And get in the Christmas spirit this afternoon

382
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,740
Oh, dear

383
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:26,400
It is turnover

384
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,960
The time of the year when all things sell

385
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,520
The end of the year sale

386
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,140
So come and get it, everyone

387
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,080
And just buy our products

388
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,800
Now, are we

389
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,900
I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about

390
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,280
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus

391
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,300
Or his death when they nailed him?

392
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,700
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie

393
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,520
But the present subgenie is the old Santa Claus

394
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:59,420
We have a joke

395
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,880
James Fair, the great, the little famous

396
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,840
But does Santa Claus sing those tunes all the time

397
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,000
Capricious, he sings them all

398
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,000


399
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:09,660
Yeah, I can like, compete with this ridiculous

400
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:09,660


401
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:09,660


402
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:10,840
So I am

403
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:10,920
I don't know

404
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:10,920


405
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:10,960
I can start

406
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,740
As helmet

407
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:11,740


408
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,400
You know what?

409
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:13,760


410
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:13,760


411
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:13,760


412
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:13,980
Because I do

413
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:14,200
I want to know

414
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,500
I know

415
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:16,760
I haven't print them

416
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:17,540
What anymore

417
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:17,580
Has happened

418
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:18,520
Leave them alone

419
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,640
that we're inventing as we go right now.

420
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,180
Exist, miss.

421
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,420
In the town.

422
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,040
Snap.

423
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,200
Sound system.

424
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,620
Ho, ho, ho.

425
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,020
Ho, ho, ho.

426
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,480
Ho, ho, ho.

427
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:31,940
Ho, ho, ho.

428
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:33,480
Come on, come on.

429
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,120
From Bunker Bunny, here you are.

430
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,140
It's He-Ball.

431
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:42,520
Hey, kids, you can help the mighty subgenius rice overthrow the evil normals with...

432
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:44,200
Shopping, shopping.

433
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,000
Everybody shopping.

434
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,860
11 more days to Christmas.

435
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,640
It's so separate.

436
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,640
It's so separate.

437
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:52,560
It's so separate.

438
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,380
It's so separate.

439
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,100
New from Tonka.

440
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,620
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob.

441
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,260
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.

442
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:02,520
Shut up, pink boy.

443
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,420
No way.

444
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,080
I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.

445
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,180
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien tool.

446
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:14,300
Bob Dobbs comes with rockets, pipe, head launcher, janger device,

447
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,760
all yuck-a-tisma, fightin' Jesus.

448
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,240
And other action figures sold separately.

449
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,260
Some assembly required, batteries not included.

450
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,820
This toy falls apart in three days.

451
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:21,760
He-Ball.

452
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:22,540
And wrestling.

453
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,580
And the masters of the universe.

454
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,960
Too much is always better than not enough.

455
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,260
It isn't Queen Barbara Dolphy when I came down so separately.

456
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,180
Gorgeous.

457
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:33,200
Me, goose, can blow from head to toe.

458
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,360
Right Barbie.

459
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,260
From Starlight, everything you see here.

460
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,400
I'm a chocolate space cadet.

461
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,660
Life support system down to zero cocoa.

462
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,180
Feeling spacey.

463
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:42,900
Absolutely.

464
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,220
What do you think?

465
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:50,540
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?

466
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,900
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob,

467
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,520
as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures?

468
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:04,060
Now we need roller skates for Fanny and a bicycle for Annie.

469
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,660
And don't forget the tie for dear old Mad.

470
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,400
Oh, that tie.

471
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:10,200
We just thought of something funny.

472
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,680
Where the heck do we get money?

473
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,200
We get it all funny.

474
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:32,540
On the first day of Christmas, my true love sent to me.

475
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,900
A new Ford custom built station wagon.

476
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,420
On the second day of Christmas, my true love sent to me.

477
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,140
A $2,000 Moray diamond ring.

478
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:46,220
A new Ford custom built station wagon.

479
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:52,860
On the third day of Christmas, my true love sent to me.

480
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:56,820
A three year supply of Libby's frozen fruits and vegetables.

481
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:59,300
A $2,000 Moray diamond ring.

482
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,360
A new Ford custom built station wagon.

483
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,960
On the fourth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me.

484
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,580
A complete steered.

485
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,700
A three year supply of Libby's frozen fruits and vegetables.

486
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,220
A $2,000 Moray diamond ring.

487
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,260
A new Ford custom built station wagon.

488
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,500
On the fifth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me.

489
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:27,380
A Mandeville five in one combination radio, television, phonograph, wire recorder and bar.

490
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,080
A complete steered.

491
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,200
A three year supply of Libby's frozen fruits and vegetables.

492
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,700
A $2,000 Moray diamond ring.

493
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:36,760
A new Ford custom built station wagon.

494
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,200
On the sixth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me.

495
00:25:43,220 --> 00:25:45,900
A $200 Moray diamond ring.

496
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:51,880
A checkered neon color and a dark orange.

497
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,040
A $3,000 Moray diamond ring.

498
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,100
On the first day of Christmas, my true love sent to me.

499
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,700
A $2,000 Moray diamond ring.

500
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:00,000
A $2,000 Moray diamond ring.

501
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:03,960
A $3,000 Moray diamond ring.

502
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,140
A $3,000 Moray diamond ring.

503
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,220
A $1,000 Moray diamond ring.

504
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,340
The problem with illusion is the ultimate weapon.

505
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,640
A doll that stands up.

506
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,560
She's new, from Kenner.

507
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,700
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

508
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,680
We must buy our toys.

509
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:27,040
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

510
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,820
It will empower us to resist them.

511
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:39,400
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.

512
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:46,420
It will be a power for kids.

513
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:54,620
Do we understand and accept this lesson?

514
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:55,640
Yes.

515
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,040
For the usual plus expenses.

516
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:03,840
Good.

517
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:09,700
This covenant has been required.

518
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:15,100
In the archives of reality.

519
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:21,800
Okay, I think the girls will have the strawberry rainbow bite.

520
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:28,380
And for the boys, a little tiny transformer.

521
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,020
Robots will change into Dr. Bill's back again.

522
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:33,580
Yes.

523
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:41,200
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your hearts?

524
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:43,200
Marketing schemes, human.

525
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,040
Good.

526
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:47,880
Good and welcome home.

527
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,040
Good.

528
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:50,820
Good.

529
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,500
The primitive earth societies should accept this value judgment.

530
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:05,340
Good will have great physical attributes according to human desires.

531
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,300
Sexual desires.

532
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,100
Latent in children.

533
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,880
Threats and

534
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,480
Quizzes.

535
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,660
For the drought.

536
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,500
That energy.

537
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:26,500


538
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:26,500


539
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:26,500


540
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,100
Hello to all you tissue people.

541
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,380
Everyone.

542
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,580
Tomatoes.

543
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,500
freely ready to go.

544
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,460
Mach� J.

545
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:44,920
In the night, that the little children as they sleep.

546
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:49,820
Too much is always better than not enough.

547
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:57,440
Too much is always better than not enough.

548
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:05,220
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad.

549
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:10,860
Too bad, too bad, too bad, too bad.

550
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,000
When everybody sells, we're all selling.

551
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:18,620
But we all have something to sell.

552
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,620
Yes, everyone selling together a mighty symphony of prosperity.

553
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,100
Chocolatey pebbles from you know who.

554
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,520
I'm a chocolate space cadet.

555
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,900
Hey, Mom, can we have some polyester ores for breakfast?

556
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:33,720
Sure, son. All of us moms have TVs.

557
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:40,900
So we know that polyester ores are just chock-full of conspiracy genetic coding and administrative byproducts.

558
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,160
That's right, Mom.

559
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:48,540
One serving of polyester ores can turn your blue-collar children into what appears to be a bag of pink pus

560
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,940
stuffed into a white shirt and tie.

561
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:56,960
And remember, there's a whole dead executive in every can of chunky-style polyester ores.

562
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:05,260
You have lost your reward.

563
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,180
Here we go.

564
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:09,740
You shall enter heaven as a servant without a single soul to your credit.

565
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:11,020
Thank you.

566
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,880
Oh, it's unfair.

567
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,540
Show him his record.

568
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:24,340
Throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity is an awful price to pay.

569
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,080
It is an awful price to pay.

570
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,360
Mom, Buck's calling you.

571
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:34,180
And we do, we're going to seriously address this issue.

572
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:39,260
But in the meantime, we have the problem of who is the Santa Bob?

573
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:40,640
Were there any readings here?

574
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,000
Were there any readings on the Santa Bob?

575
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:46,600
We ought to talk a little bit about Were-Bobs and Ima-Bobs tonight, Reverend Stang.

576
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:49,400
I can sense a little bit of that coming on, Reverend Stang.

577
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:56,140
The Were-Bobs and Ima-Bobs, those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.

578
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,980
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.

579
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:11,200
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands, the grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on the...

580
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,200


581
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:11,660
They're not going to be able to get out of the snow on their face.

582
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,860
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float in through the keyhole.

583
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,860
On the seventh day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...

584
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:29,580
7,500 cans of Campbell's delicious soup.

585
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,000
Six $100 hats.

586
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:36,960
A Mandeville 5-in-1 combination radio, television, phonograph, wire recorder and bar.

587
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,460
A complete steer.

588
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:40,760
Santa's on a diet.

589
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:46,180
He was forced into exile to a San Fernando Valley health spa.

590
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:50,480
Where they forced him to take off his clothes and embarrass him.

591
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,120
And he ran in front of his reindeer.

592
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,580
Who fled in confusion and hung her into the sky.

593
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:06,140
This one, dear friends, is...

594
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:10,860
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.

595
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,520
By a band called Mechanical Sterility.

596
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:21,920
The singer, I think, is Reverend M. Schaefer of the Church of the Subgenius.

597
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,680
Listen to this beautiful, beautiful song.

598
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,840
Ah, yeah.

599
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:29,400
Santa Claus is coming

600
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:33,820
to rape your wife.

601
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,660
Santa Claus is coming

602
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,820
to rape

603
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,180
your wife.

604
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:50,160
He's got a gun and he's got a big knife.

605
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:56,120
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.

606
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,140
Oh, yeah, that's right.

607
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:03,140


608
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:08,920
Where are you going to do your home?

609
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,120
All right?

610
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:11,180


611
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:20,500
Santa killed off all his elves

612
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:28,500
Cut off their heads and put them up on the shelf

613
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,640
Rudolph's cold in the freezer

614
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,340
Packed in separate baggies

615
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,600
Christmas causes disappear

616
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:59,760
Is that blood in Santa's beard?

617
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:08,020
Christmas time again I fear

618
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,320
Christmas time again I fear

619
00:34:09,340 --> 00:34:12,080
Tell me you need to getco wicked

620
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,960
For all the night you determination

621
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,420
Well thearos you don't need

622
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:27,740
Take every beating and you're up against

623
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:27,900
Christmas undone

624
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,200
Do not take a second, night and day

625
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,000
And fabricate the timing and the timing

626
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,320
To keep my hair in order so you especially

627
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:42,020
And I cooked up a mean reindeer stew.

628
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:47,920
Daughter and Gibson.

629
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,100
And Rudolph, too.

630
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:55,560
Quite tasty.

631
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,920
He knows when you've been sleeping.

632
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,020
He knows when you're awake.

633
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,160
He knows if you've been bad or good.

634
00:35:22,340 --> 00:35:25,320
So be good, for goodness sake.

635
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:31,760
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.

636
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,320
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.

637
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:48,140
Santa Claus is coming to rape your wife.

638
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:59,460
On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me...

639
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:02,300
Twelve $100 Volta wristwatches.

640
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:06,100
A Sherwin-Williams paint and varnish supply for your entire house, inside and out.

641
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,200
Venetian blinds and window styling throughout by Kirsch Company.

642
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:13,400
A general electric sink, combining garbage disposal unit and automatic dishwasher.

643
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,580
A French maid for two weeks.

644
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,620
7,500 cans of Campbell's delicious soup.

645
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:21,000
Six $100 hats.

646
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:26,980
A Mandeville five-in-one combination radio, television, phonograph, wire recorder, and bar.

647
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:28,640
A complete steered.

648
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:31,760
A three-year supply of Libby's frozen fruits and vegetables.

649
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,260
A $2,000 Moray diamond ring.

650
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,320
A new Ford custom-built station wagon.

651
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:49,360
A 5-up, 6A radio built with a chrome quarter dad.

652
00:36:51,140 --> 00:36:51,740
Wren manTIF.

653
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:51,740


654
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:51,740


655
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:51,740


656
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:51,740


657
00:36:51,740 --> 00:36:52,840
Cut that out!

658
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:56,380
A lot can happen to a kid in this hard-boiled town.

659
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,460
We deal too much with the seed Acesis.

660
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,800
Actually, the people of the big town are no worse than other people.

661
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,280
Yeah, more good than better even in the et场.

662
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,580
That is...

663
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,560
Out-of-the-world project.

664
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:09,860
that. Yeah?

665
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:12,600
We forget a lot of things, Harry.

666
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:14,380
That we only remember

667
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,600
this time of year.

668
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:17,200
Yeah.

669
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,020
It's still snowing.

670
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:22,360
Makes the old town kind of

671
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:24,280
pretty, almost. Yes.

672
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,360
It hides and

673
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,620
softens the man-made

674
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,620
ugliness. And in a moment, we'll return

675
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:32,400
to the dramatic and heartwarming climax

676
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,920
of Prelude to Christmas.

677
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,540
Perhaps I could interest you in this little

678
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,240
sparkler, the wild turkey

679
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,620
flask. Comes in its own gift box,

680
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:42,320
holds 200 milliliters,

681
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:44,120
and we've got eye-catching

682
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,420
point-of-sale signs to let everybody know

683
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:48,740
about them. A great stocking

684
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:50,520
stuffer, too. I love

685
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:52,200
it. You guys are beautiful.

686
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:54,400
I mean, you have thought of everything.

687
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,820
Of course. Great packaging,

688
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:58,460
collector's items, precious crystal,

689
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,340
flask. You've

690
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,300
thought of everything.

691
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,380
All this should lift your

692
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,180
holiday sale. Now,

693
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:08,520
I can really be

694
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,380
on top

695
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,600
of the world.

696
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,860
And I owe it all to you.

697
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:15,920
Hello?

698
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,400
Where'd you go?

699
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:20,060
Where are you? Hello?

700
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:21,900
Hello, spirit?

701
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,620
Where are you?

702
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:25,660
Where are you?

703
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,560
Where did you go?

704
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,320
He's got those

705
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,280
holiday blues.

706
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,000
Is that a dream?

707
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,700
I knew

708
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,500
it was too good to be true.

709
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:41,580
Merry Christmas to all!

710
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:44,040
Ah, yes, dear friends.

711
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:44,760
Christmas,

712
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,660
the season of turnover,

713
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,540
when the shelves must be cleared.

714
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,800
I can't get that call right now, dear friends.

715
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,940
You know, I got, after all

716
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,680
these friendly calls, I got one call from

717
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,780
somebody who

718
00:38:57,780 --> 00:38:59,960
said, what are y'all, the usual

719
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,500
thing, the usual question,

720
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:02,900
what are y'all trying to do?

721
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,600
I go, we're trying to give you some slack.

722
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:05,900
Okay?

723
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:08,300
You know, they go, who's Bob?

724
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,140
I said, well, give me your address.

725
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:12,000
I'll send you some information or whatever, you know,

726
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,460
give the number at the end of the broadcast.

727
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,560
And they, uh, and, and this person,

728
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,800
you know, I knew there was something that they weren't saying.

729
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:21,120
And finally he goes,

730
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:24,120
well, I just hope that

731
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,980
it was something like, I just hope that,

732
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,640
you know, you can get right with Jesus or

733
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,120
something like that. And just hung up.

734
00:39:30,140 --> 00:39:32,080
He hung up. That was the key point.

735
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,460
Said he didn't want to hear what I had to say

736
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,640
back about

737
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:40,040
that because, you know, see a subgenius has so much faith

738
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:45,120
that he not only can accept somebody making fun of Bob,

739
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,760
stomping on a picture of Bob, he'll do it himself.

740
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:51,160
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.

741
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,860
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.

742
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,240
Now we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle

743
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:00,920
of a bunch of entertaining tapes, but we subgeni may be bad,

744
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:05,680
but our way of bad is holy, is holy compared to the other way.

745
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:05,680


746
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:09,360
The evil of so not all at all by any means,

747
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,300
but so many American fundamentalists,

748
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:13,580
charismatic, evangelicals, et cetera, in general,

749
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:17,840
of course they and their corresponding types in Iran,

750
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,060
Russia, Libya, South Africa, et cetera.

751
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:25,140
If you ask me are actually the ACE up the devil's sleeve,

752
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:29,180
wolves and sheep's clothing friends, just like Jesus warned about.

753
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,960
I we're Jesus and Bob.

754
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,140
Like we say, our old drinking buddies got nothing against Jesus.

755
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:35,660
It's just,

756
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,000
it's his fan club.

757
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:41,240
And now we aren't saying that Bob is the ACE up God's sleeve.

758
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:44,680
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief, just like you or me,

759
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,720
but the uptight rival cults, they don't think God has a handkerchief.

760
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:50,200
Uh, no.

761
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,800
Cause God's perfect.

762
00:40:52,040 --> 00:40:53,580
He doesn't even sneeze.

763
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:58,520
We're made in his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us.

764
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:05,140
And we have to go in the secret room, the bath room to do awful things.

765
00:41:05,140 --> 00:41:08,560
But God, Oh, he's clean and pure according to them.

766
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:14,040
Oh, and he's male, but he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do.

767
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:14,700
Cause we sin.

768
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,180
Oh yeah, we all sin.

769
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:17,140
We're bad.

770
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:17,980
We're worthless.

771
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:22,840
We're no good to God unless we sign a contract with his agent.

772
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:30,140
Well, friend, Jesus himself, he spouted just about as many great punchlines as Bob, probably more, but, and this is true.

773
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,480
This is historical fact.

774
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:34,920
The very early mainstream Christian church.

775
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:39,900
Methodically censored about half of the existing gospels about Jesus.

776
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:41,620
They, and this is, I'm not kidding.

777
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:49,040
You can go to any real bookstore and pick up the censored gospels that they finally found years later.

778
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:59,000
They took out the parts where Jesus specifically said that every person had equal access to the Lord and that you didn't need no preacher between you and him.

779
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:03,000
That in fact was probably his main point now lost in antiquity.

780
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:03,920
That you.

781
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,260
Were the son or daughter of God, just as much as Jesus was or Bob.

782
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:13,060
See, but that's too humanistic for the conspiracy Christians.

783
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:16,920
So they, they wiped out the subgenius Gnostic Christians.

784
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,060
Anyway, I'm going to get off my soapbox.

785
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:26,040
We'll get into the hideous theological discussions coming up next week as we attack the Bobby's.

786
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:29,480
Interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement.

787
00:42:29,860 --> 00:42:32,720
We turn Bob and the bastards of the universe.

788
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:33,460
We'll be back.

789
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:33,880
After this.

790
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,920
Happy, happy holidays.

791
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,860
No more holiday booze.

792
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,140
Silent night.

793
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,660
Holy night.

794
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:53,280
All is calm.

795
00:42:54,620 --> 00:42:56,420
All is bright.

796
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,320
The night of birth.

797
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:02,820
Mother and child.

798
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:06,300
Holy infant.

799
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:14,500
Sleep in heavenly peace.

800
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,780
Sleep in heavenly peace.

801
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:20,860


802
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,560
Now the German version.

803
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,500

00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:53,720
Evil Night.

822
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:55,540
Starring Olivia Hussie.

823
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,580
K am cette femme FDP en принé le veut.

824
00:43:58,760 --> 00:43:58,860
Rare for you.

827
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:05,440
Margot Kidder.

828
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:10,380
John Saxon.

829
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,680
If this movie doesn't make your skin crawl, it's on too tight.

830
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,320
Right on, right on, right on, right on.

831
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,760
Right on, right on.

832
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:28,760
I am yours truly, Rudy Ray Moore, bold and still beautiful.

833
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:29,640
All right.

834
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,020
Baby, I want to talk to you for this kiss.

835
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:35,160
Because Christmas holds a lot of memories for me.

836
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,100
Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmas time.

837
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:43,680
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old.

838
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:48,640
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece and the health department made us take them down.

839
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,220
Baby, me and my brother wore tennis shoes so long.

840
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:56,820
Now, let me tell you how long we wore them.

841
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:02,100
We wore tennis shoes Indian summer, Easter, Thanksgiving.

842
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,960
Then Halloween day, New Year's and Christmas.

843
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:12,180
Baby, we wore our tennis shoes so long till we wore them out up to the name on the ankle.

844
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:17,520
When we got ready to lay down, we didn't take them off.

845
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,720
All we had to do was fold them back, baby.

846
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,240
I remember my father well, you know.

847
00:45:24,340 --> 00:45:27,060
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.

848
00:45:27,980 --> 00:45:30,160
He used to have, you know how tossed it been.

849
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,400
He used to put a...

850
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:36,280
stocking cap on his head and put a knock light in front of it.

851
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:39,720
Daddy wake up with that thumping headache.

852
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:42,660
And he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad.

853
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,880
He said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas, but he's going to bring you something.

854
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:53,080
Daddy took that old rifle and went outside and shot up in the air and come back inside and told us the biggest lie ever heard.

855
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,080
He said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.

856
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:59,780
So that we can celebrate future Christmases in peace.

857
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,340
And he said, I don't know what Santa's going to do.

858
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:10,740
But I'm going to get back to you and I'm going to tell you what Santa's going to do.

859
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:10,740


860
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:10,740


861
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:10,740


862
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:10,740


863
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:13,960
Yet in thy dark streets shineth the everlasting light.

864
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:18,800
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee tonight.

865
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:21,760
So goes the ancient Yuletide carol.

866
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:26,860
You know, I'm not the only soldier who says a little prayer inside when he hears it.

867
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:31,380
A little prayer that our United States keeps strong and free.

868
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,300
And this I know.

869
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:36,260
God helps those who help themselves.

870
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:43,840
And it's up to us, the American citizens, to keep up our defense with a strong volunteer army.

871
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:48,540
Because there's a light that shines on all of us the whole year through.

872
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,600
And that's the light of freedom.

873
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:57,060
Let's keep that light burning for all the years ahead by doing our part for defense.

874
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:29,360
On the fifth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me five valiums.

875
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,240
Four grams of passion.

876
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:33,600
Three pounds of grass.

877
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,140
Two hundred reds.

878
00:47:35,140 --> 00:47:37,640
And a tab of yellow sunshine LSD.

879
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:45,120
Well, yes, Ivan, thanks for coming out to Dobstown here.

880
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:47,480
And I wanted to show you the Christmas nursery.

881
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,480
Oh, look at these little scamps.

882
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:52,720
And to think these used to be slackless children.

883
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:54,060
What did you kids say?

884
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:55,660
Great Bob!

885
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:57,160
Oh, yes.

886
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:58,300
That's so darling.

887
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,960
Does that warm my Bob land or what?

888
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:00,720
Yeah.

889
00:48:00,740 --> 00:48:02,280
Hey, would you like to use one of these?

890
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:03,060
Yeah, yeah.

891
00:48:03,140 --> 00:48:04,140
Warm it up a little more?

892
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:04,840
They're available.

893
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:06,080
Yeah.

894
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:07,300
A discount for our...

895
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:17,920
Our subscribers, our church family subscribers can adopt one of these little scamps for a mere, oh, couple thousand on top of your usual annual fee.

896
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:18,580
That's right.

897
00:48:18,660 --> 00:48:19,260
Put them to work.

898
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,040
Take them home.

899
00:48:20,080 --> 00:48:20,620
Put them to work.

900
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:23,680
They've been trained and they'll do all sorts of tricks.

901
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:25,800
They've been trained to slack off.

902
00:48:25,980 --> 00:48:27,940
Just try to get work out of some of these little guys.

903
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:31,900
Prince Bob!

904
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:34,500
Merry Christmas!

905
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,900
God rest ye merry gentlemen.

906
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,700
Let nothing you dismay.

907
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:47,900
Remember Christ.

908
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:55,380
As they who was born on Christmas Day.

909
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,780
On the twelfth day of Christmas must you look after me.

910
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:24,040
Twelve kids are dripping of butter and magic mushrooms.

911
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,600
Ten yodeling buttons.

912
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:26,980
Nine gaps of dropping.

913
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:28,540
Eight spoons of smirking.

914
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:29,840
Seven whites of buzzing.

915
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,400
Six joints of smirking.

916
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,680
Five valiant

917
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:37,200
Four grand a patch

918
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,740
Three pounds of grass

919
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:40,220
Two hundred mills

920
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,720
And a cab of milk

921
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:43,900
One shag LSD

922
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:11,180
One day the rabbit woke up and realized he wanted a hamburger.

923
00:50:11,480 --> 00:50:13,540
Boy, said the rabbit to himself.

924
00:50:13,900 --> 00:50:16,580
A hamburger would sure hit the spot right now.

925
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:22,060
But, having never had a hamburger, the rabbit was at a loss as to where one could be found.

926
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,620
I know, he said.

927
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,360
I'll ask my old friend, the chestnut tree.

928
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:30,720
You, Fred Tanker.

929
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,280
Yes?

930
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:45,280
So many confusing issues at hand, including whether or not the Santa did actually die at the hands of the cavalry that day on the Mount of Skulls,

931
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:51,980
or whether the over-modulation can be helped at some time in the far future.

932
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,440
So, friends, this is a song about...

933
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,060
Oh, I see, I see. I can control that he comes in and out of here.

934
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,340
Learned how to control...

935
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:04,300
We can now control the hiss.

936
00:51:04,540 --> 00:51:12,400
That means that their minds can likewise be controlled by subliminal messages planted in the hiss that goes out with this show.

937
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,940
Stay there.

938
00:51:15,080 --> 00:51:16,180
Please stay there.

939
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:17,060
I'll be right back.

940
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:21,900
Remember, you are commanded, not asked, to be firm.

941
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:31,160
You are commanded, not asked, to be firm.

942
00:51:31,160 --> 00:51:40,160
You are commanded, not asked, to be firm.

943
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:40,620
You are commanded, not asked, to be firm.

944
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:40,640
You are commanded, not asked, to be firm.

945
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:42,060
Oh, yes, friends, and...

946
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:46,380
What I'm about to play, close out.

947
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,840
Well, there's really two of me here.

948
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:48,780
Christmas show here.

949
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,300
This is a Christmas show.

950
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:51,160
A tape song.

951
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:52,700
There are two Doug Wellmans in here.

952
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:59,160
By Pete Warner, the editor of famous magazine called Toilet Suck.

953
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:00,420
I'm sure you've heard of it.

954
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,740
Out of New Jersey, Toilet Suck is a fantastic cultural artifact.

955
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:13,820
And what we're playing right now, friends, is an album by this fellow.

956
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:23,160
It says, the irritating sounds heard on this recording are not intended to be digested as reenactments of actual events.

957
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,880
Sounds based on personal activity.

958
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:30,660
Monsoon familiar mechanized calf Jesus.

959
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,920
And it is copyrighted.

960
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:40,380
The name of this tune is The Manson Family Christmas.

961
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:47,820
Oh, my God.

962
00:52:47,820 --> 00:52:49,580
Oh, my God.

963
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,460
Oh, my God.

964
00:52:53,460 --> 00:52:53,560
Oh, my God.

965
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,560
Oh, my God.

966
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:56,900
Oh, my God.

967
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,140
Oh, my God.

968
00:52:58,420 --> 00:52:59,740
Oh, my God.

969
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:00,200
Oh, my God.

970
00:53:31,160 --> 00:53:35,560
Shortly after Shady and I got new ones to do joy.

971
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:38,240
Creepy boys went down.

972
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:41,140
We have to let love happen.

973
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,640
Charlie is our love.

974
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,240
We are Charlie's love.

975
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:45,300
It's our one.

976
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:47,260
It's all happening now.

977
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,460
Listen to that beautiful.

978
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,500
Charlie Manson Family Christmas.

979
00:53:58,400 --> 00:53:59,120
Yes.

980
00:53:59,120 --> 00:54:05,940
You know, those were different kind of family values, I think, in those days.

981
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:11,540
But who says the 60s can't live again here in the 80s?

982
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:16,880
And now, your local multinational corporation presents

983
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:21,660
some energy-saving holiday tips from Mr. Abernathy.

984
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:25,480
Hello.

985
00:54:25,580 --> 00:54:26,040
Hello.

986
00:54:26,040 --> 00:54:29,100
Your local multinational corporation has sent me...

987
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:32,180
...to this remote point in Australia to prove a point.

988
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,800
Conservation can be dangerous.

989
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:39,020
In this remote aboriginal village just outside of Sydney, Australia,

990
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,340
the natives were told by their government to slow down

991
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:45,200
in their consumption of gasoline and fossil fuels.

992
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:50,340
Unfortunately, the files in the government energy office on this town were lost.

993
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:56,000
So, nobody bothered to tell them when it was okay to go back to normal energy use.

994
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,940
Sadly enough, this town has become...

995
00:54:59,120 --> 00:55:01,560
...the victim of what we call an energy surplus.

996
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,540
And the natives have been forced to convert many of their dishwashers,

997
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:11,140
lawnmowers, and refrigerators into these homemade, energy-hungry miniature racing guards.

998
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:15,200
Boys and girls in the village between the ages of 14 and 20

999
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:19,320
must stay behind the wheels of these primitive, high-speed, and dangerous machines

1000
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:21,800
for up to 90 hours at a stretch,

1001
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:27,220
just so their village can receive the next fuel shipment from their local multinational distributor.

1002
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:29,000
And we'll keep on shipping.

1003
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,100
We're shipping at our usual rates,

1004
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:34,660
just so this little village can meet and surpass its energy quota.

1005
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,600
And to think, it's all because they kept lights off when it didn't have to be convenient.

1006
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:43,840
This holiday season, why not turn on all the lights in your house

1007
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:46,360
and keep them on for the rest of the year?

1008
00:55:46,620 --> 00:55:50,360
Maybe you'll make the load a little lighter on us here at Multinational.

1009
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,800
And a winter reminder, citizens.

1010
00:55:53,180 --> 00:55:57,080
Carbon monoxide, the silent winter killer, lurks everywhere.

1011
00:55:57,080 --> 00:56:01,160
So, if you have a gas stove, oil burner, or open flame,

1012
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,840
make sure all the doors and windows in the room are tightly sealed,

1013
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:08,060
so that none of that nasty carbon monoxide can sneak in.

1014
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:09,800
Thanks, and happy holidays.

1015
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,700
This is Mr. Abernathy, signing off from your town to you.

1016
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:25,720
Scott, you made your choice.

1017
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,160
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.

1018
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:31,780
And to your eternal soul,

1019
00:56:32,660 --> 00:56:35,240
you have found that only could you afford

1020
00:56:35,240 --> 00:56:38,080
to give to God that which was his.

1021
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,960
But you could not afford to do otherwise.

1022
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:44,180
The Senate still stands.

1023
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:51,780
In your outer darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth...

1024
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:54,980
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir!

1025
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,200
I don't want to go to hell, sir!

1026
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:58,540
Sir, now!

1027
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:02,500
I don't want to go to hell!

1028
00:57:03,680 --> 00:57:03,760
No!

1029
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:11,000
...live as he could be,

1030
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,600
and the children say he could laugh and play,

1031
00:57:14,700 --> 00:57:16,840
just the same as you and me.

1032
00:57:16,920 --> 00:57:20,740
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1033
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:25,040
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

1034
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:27,780
send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...

1035
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,780
Got your pencil ready?

1036
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:35,460
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1037
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:42,900
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1038
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:45,920
Stay tuned and praise Bob!

1039
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:00,960
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

1040
00:58:02,040 --> 00:58:04,560
Just like the ones I used to know

1041
00:58:06,040 --> 00:58:10,200
Where the treetops glisten and children listen

1042
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,240
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

1043
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:20,080
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

1044
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:23,660
With every Christmas card I write

1045
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:28,100
May your days be merry and bright

1046
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:33,020
And may all your Christmases be white

1047
00:58:53,660 --> 00:58:57,260
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas

1048
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:01,360
With every Christmas card I write

1049
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:05,400
May your days be merry and bright

1050
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:10,940
And may all your Christmases

1051
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,140
All your Christmases

1052
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:15,640
All your Christmases

1053
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:17,540
All your Christmases

1054
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:21,960
May all your Christmases...

1055
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,360
Be White

1056
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:47,980
One, two, three,

1057
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:53,280
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

1058
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:56,860
Hey Bob and Merry Xmas!

1059
00:59:57,340 --> 01:00:00,980
California oranges, Texas cactus

1060
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:04,820
We think you need a little more practice

1061
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:08,140
Throw them in the graveyard, cover up their feet

1062
01:00:08,140 --> 01:00:11,580
J.R. Bob Dobbs can't be beat!

1063
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:11,920
Yay!

1064
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:24,980
