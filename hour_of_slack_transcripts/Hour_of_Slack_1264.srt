1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,940
Remember, we're sitting together listening to this, and this was R MON 부부부� polity tenga

2
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:14,960
Remember, we're sitting together listening to this, and this was R MON 부부부부� 커다

3
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:29,980
Hey, Bob oh would you like a file, I'm so sorry to make you wait

4
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:32,560
Yes, sir. I love Bob. No, sir.

5
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:36,000
No, sir. I do not want to stop Bob.

6
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:40,040
I just want to give my feast to the thousands.

7
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,340
Yes, deep fried as it is.

8
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:47,820
They brought out the best in Bob's fish

9
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:51,040
and laid it upon the other water and fowl and little stinky things.

10
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,060
And everybody saw and everybody ate

11
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,500
and it was kind of nice for all those people.

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,980
Dear Bob who floats above the ground,

13
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,440
I long to hear the mournful sound

14
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:03,180
that's made when you emerge from space

15
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,760
and come to this, my dwelling place.

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,620
Dear Bob, each night while I'm asleep,

17
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:10,840
I hope to my house you will creep

18
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:13,580
and poke your pipe in through the wall

19
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,180
so I'll be burned remembering all.

20
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,680
Dear Bob, it's time to close my eyes.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,760
Remember now.

22
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:23,180
It's no surprise if I should be found dead someday.

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:25,900
I'll think that you were in the way.

24
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,480
Ooh.

25
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:28,680
Gimme Bob.

26
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,680
Confusing that face

27
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:35,900
with my own.

28
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,420
Can't remember my place.

29
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:47,300
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

30
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,760
which reaches from the inner mind to

31
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:54,260
the subgenius power of SWAT.

32
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:04,780
Bob's role on this planet is to see that the Earth is not sold

33
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:10,180
on that glorious or terrible day we call X-Day in 1998.

34
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,820
When the men from Planet X arrive.

35
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:13,960
Yeah, now it may sound ludicrous.

36
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,800
It may sound ridiculous to men and believers out there.

37
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,620
Sir, are you saying they're all nuts, all those people?

38
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,440
Maybe, yeah, maybe.

39
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,920
You once were telling me about Planet X, Dr. Morbund.

40
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:27,960
Yes.

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,640
There's evil on Planet X.

42
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,040
There's more than you could think of.

43
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,700
Evil stalks them.

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:40,000
Every night and day they wait to see the evil they go through.

45
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:41,500
Do they come down in flying saucers?

46
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,060
Flying saucers are bearing on us.

47
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,980
We don't know what to do.

48
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,140
We're here all alone.

49
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,280
The planets are fading.

50
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:53,860
The blood is running.

51
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,640
And the lights were fading.

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,940
And they still are.

53
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,460
Doctors, one by one.

54
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,160
Today.

55
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,640
This is the Man in Black, here for the Roma Wine Company of Fresno, California.

56
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,780
For centuries we have been circling your Earth, waiting for a means to penetrate your atmosphere.

57
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,060
I am the first to come to you.

58
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,480
With death and destruction?

59
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,520
Go ahead and kill me.

60
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,600
What's gonna happen to your children?

61
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,180
What's gonna happen to your children?

62
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,540
What's gonna happen to you when this society we've created?

63
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:27,240
When this society we've created?

64
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,200
Air conditions.

65
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,640
A station wagon with wooden sides.

66
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,180
A station wagon with wooden sides.

67
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,000
A cautious, indeed.

68
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,580
A retired actor.

69
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,600
Orange hail.

70
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,460
A common politician.

71
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,160
Orange hail.

72
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,700
What happens when that collapses?

73
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,900
What happens when your daughter ain't worth a damn?

74
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,340
What happens when your daughter ain't worth a damn?

75
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,840
That's when the man from Planet X-9.

76
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,740
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius church.

77
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:49,500
I'm down to save the members of the subgenius church.

78
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:55,220
But until that day, the power and wisdom of Bob can help us break their mind control.

79
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:59,300
By activating that mutant gland that we all have within us.

80
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,100
You don't like your life?

81
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,720
Straighten it out in a big hurry!

82
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:06,960
Give your money to the church, not the state!

83
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,040
The church!

84
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,180
Yes!

85
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:15,760
Give us your children!

86
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,460
Give us your children!

87
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,020
Let us raise them!

88
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,020
You'll have weirder kids than me!

89
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,580
Ha ha ha ha ha!

90
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,020
What are you?

91
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,540
That's odd.

92
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,340
Very odd.

93
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,260
Meltdown.

94
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,720
And this can happen to you!

95
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:36,760
This can be yours!

96
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:45,180
Uh, yes dear friends, it can happen to you, it can be yours, and it will be yours on X-Day 1998.

97
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:52,000
Only two years from now, and of course dear friends, this is our, uh, X-Day 1998.

98
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,680
It's a show, it's, uh, July.

99
00:04:54,020 --> 00:04:59,380
By the time you hear this tape, I will probably be at the X-Day drill!

100
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:11,660
And, uh, drilling my way deep into my own brain in preparation for the arrival of those, uh, gods and goddesses from outer space.

101
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:16,140
Who will come, uh, in 1998, July 5th, 1998.

102
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,300
You know the story, friends, and if you don't, well, just keep listening.

103
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,840
Because we're gonna have...

104
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:29,620
Every tiny media barrage clip that ever had anything to do with X-Day for this show and the next one.

105
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,120
I apologize for the last show.

106
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,860
Uh, but, uh, and, uh...

107
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:40,760
But, you know, as Dr. Legume pointed out in the first edition of the Book of the Subgenius, the McGraw-Hill Orange cover edition,

108
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:51,880
it, uh, there was a, a misprint, uh, that seemed, uh, obviously a mistake that at one point made it look like X-Day would happen in...

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:52,720
1996.

110
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,880
Well, what if that wasn't a misprint?

111
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,140
What if you're not ready, friend?

112
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,300
What if you're still putting off that mighty moment when you write that mighty check?

113
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,000
What if?

114
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,320
These are all important what-ifs, friends.

115
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:13,880
And, you know, that movie is coming out, Independence Day.

116
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,360
God, their ploys are so obvious.

117
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:20,360
So filthy and so obvious that...

118
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,020
What?

119
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,640
I... God.

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,820
You know, the pieces are all coming together for the one-world government.

121
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,740
We, we, we can tell...

122
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:31,000
You can see the story behind the rise of Bill... Clinton.

123
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,260
Bill Soft-On-Kitty-Porn Clinton, I should call him.

124
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,680
And his little clique rising to the American throne.

125
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:48,700
Yes, it was through the diabolical backroom machinations of Dobbs that all of these things have come about.

126
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,000
Thou art but an insignificant insect.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,840
And you'd better speak to the manager, boy.

128
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,720
Because that day is coming.

129
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,900
That day is coming up and, well, I'm gonna...

130
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,900
I ain't...

131
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,400
I ain't...

132
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:04,860
I'm just gonna let these tapes carry you on through, friend.

133
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,400
Because it's...

134
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:08,720
This is the biggest celebration of the subgenius year.

135
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,620
And, uh...

136
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,900
I hope that...

137
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:16,180
I hope that you're readying yourself just as we are.

138
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:16,600
I...

139
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:20,240
I'm sorry if you can't make it to the X-Day drill in Sherman, New York.

140
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:20,700
Uh...

141
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:20,980
I'm sorry.

142
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:20,980


143
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:20,980


144
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:20,980


145
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,360
And while you're hearing this show, I really am.

146
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,140
Um...

147
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:28,000
But, in the meantime, you may commune, yes?

148
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:34,900
You may commune now with the spirit of Dobbs and the promise of X-Day.

149
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,020
Awwww, yes.

150
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:44,920
Angels flash through the heavenlies.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,080
You know, Ezekiel...

152
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:50,840
Saw a wheel.

153
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:59,200
But what a lot of us do not realize is that in chapter 1 of Ezekiel, verse 4, the angels

154
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,380
traveled in whirlwind fashion.

155
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:04,060
Not like our jets straight ahead.

156
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:04,980
Whirlwind!

157
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:12,340
They move from one end of heaven to the other like a flash of lightning, verse 14.

158
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:16,020
And verse 15 says their color was burl.

159
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:19,060
Do you know what they put into spaceships?

160
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,140
Now that are heaved out there?

161
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,120
The only thing that can withstand the heat?

162
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,520
Other things would disintegrate?

163
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,780
Burl-illium.

164
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,160
It's like some kind of...

165
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,160
Some kind of vision like I've never seen before.

166
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,400
It was like a wagon wheel coming out of the sky.

167
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:38,280
And I was sitting on the porch with Aunt May.

168
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,260
She said, what is it, boy?

169
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,100
What is it?

170
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,360
And I said, I don't know, ma'am.

171
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,580
I swear to God, I don't know.

172
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,360
But I just said, praise Bob.

173
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,240
And...

174
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,720
And...

175
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,540
You know, when...

176
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,500
If Bob...

177
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,940
If Bob says something that...

178
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:55,640
Wall climbing.

179
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,500
Wall...

180
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,180
What is it?

181
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,480
Wall climbing.

182
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,520
Is it...

183
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,740
Wall climbing.

184
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:02,480
Well, I was wall climbing.

185
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:03,820
I was wall climbing.

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,860
And that's what Bob said to do.

187
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,720
That's what Bob told me to.

188
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,220
I was wall climbing.

189
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:09,520
Yeah.

190
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,160
I...

191
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:11,740
I get...

192
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,020
I get...

193
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,660
I get...

194
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,180
Real scared, Bob.

195
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,240
Because...

196
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,360
Because...

197
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:17,860
You'd Life Drugs and uh...

198
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,000
I haven't only seen...

199
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,000
I never...

200
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:23,420
I been...

201
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:24,620
You ain't never have.

202
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:25,640
You can never die.

203
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,840
But when did you saw the...

204
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,620
W بهания conventions like they were called?

205
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,000
Well, I haven't yet.

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,280
Which means we've never seen the w

207
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,840
W게z and complicidades.

208
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:40,220
That's...

209
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,440
That's a good question.

210
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,440
You always talk about women crowning or being being priests.

211
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:43,440


212
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,320
I've seen, I wait in school.

213
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:47,340
I've seen them...

214
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:47,340


215
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:47,340


216
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:47,340


217
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:47,340


218
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,520
and laughing and all the time.

219
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,380
Duncan Lunan of the British Interplanetary Society

220
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:58,140
has interpreted the signals as a message from a space probe,

221
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,300
a message from a dying planet in Eta.

222
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,860
Yeah, the little green men's day was real head-cats

223
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,520
Rockin' and a-rollin' through the crazy flats

224
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,380
Brought out the sax and they started to flow

225
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,360
Brought out the drums and they started to roll

226
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,060
That's awesome, rock and roll

227
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,920
That's awesome, rock and roll

228
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,840
I couldn't understand it, a thing they'd said

229
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,660
It was a crazy beat, it just stopped me dead

230
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:30,080
Along with Bob, the pursuit of slack, and a conspiracy of pinks,

231
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:33,240
the subgenius theology includes a vision of the apocalypse.

232
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,800
According to church doctrine, on July 5th, 1998,

233
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:43,280
when the television signal of Amos and Andy reaches the men from Planet X,

234
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,880
the aliens will unleash their wrath

235
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,660
upon the Earth.

236
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,000
And the men from Planet X are going to come down and take over Earth.

237
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,120
They're going to...

238
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:59,220
They will put us out of our misery unless Bob can explain to them in ways that they can understand

239
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:02,700
that there is something on Earth worth saving.

240
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:10,460
And only the subgenii, the dues-paying, book-buying, receipt-in-the-pocket, paid in full to the church subgenii,

241
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:14,080
have the tiniest prayer of survival.

242
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,400
The rest of them?

243
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,180
It's a tough world, Jack.

244
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:23,800
The fightin' Jesus looked out over the bridge of the Exist Battle Saucer, Blood of Christ.

245
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,560
He looked and laughed.

246
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,680
He laughed and looked.

247
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:29,640
He looked and looked.

248
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,840
He laughed and laughed.

249
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,980
He was finally going to have his revenge on the natives of Dustmote 89 AB.

250
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:44,880
Aboard Jesus's flagship, dozens of killer theologians, the Shock Priests,

251
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,360
were busy at their weapons terminals.

252
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:52,400
On the power decks, the proper orgone cycles were being timed by mass fornications between the ritual crew

253
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:55,280
and the cancer beings from Theta Z.

254
00:11:55,880 --> 00:12:01,900
An invasion-ready state existed in the ship and the 900 others floating over the doomed planet, Earth.

255
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,320
Jesus was in a psychopathically elated state.

256
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,120
His face resembled many of the perverse icons the humanoids of the Dustmote painted of him.

257
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,500
They prayed to these for the salvation.

258
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,620
The salvation of their souls.

259
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,880
As if they had any souls to save.

260
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:21,840
As if anyone would want to save them, which they didn't.

261
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,240
A whole disgusting religion now centered around his murder.

262
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,880
They had to gall to nail him up like a common criminal and then paint pictures of him enjoying it.

263
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:35,640
And they thought he loved them for it, that he was forgiving.

264
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,800
Oh, the anticipation.

265
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,380
He was sick to his stomach with glee.

266
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,740
He would show them the true face of pain and sin.

267
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:47,520
It had taken him 2,000 long years to return here.

268
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,920
And now he would pay them back for the scars he still carried in his hands.

269
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:53,840
Sweet stigmata.

270
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,300
Even the slightest thought of the scars made them glow red through his fists.

271
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:01,140
Through the boxing gloves.

272
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:10,060
The whole of the spacecraft was manned with angels of light personally lent by Jehovah One.

273
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:13,720
They supervised the demon teams operating on Earth.

274
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:16,680
And on all tangible destruction spectrums.

275
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,080
All in attack mode.

276
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,780
Nagas, Orzuma, Shiva, Horus, Aeons.

277
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,200
The dark bodies.

278
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,080
And at time and a half too.

279
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,460
It was expensive to ravage a planet.

280
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,680
No matter.

281
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:36,460
That which comes had finally arrived.

282
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,240
And on Jesus' birthday.

283
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:42,720
What do you think, Dad?

284
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:47,460
His second in command, Jim Jones, stood by with the final attack coordinate, Codices.

285
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,980
A holographic map of Earth rotated slowly next to Jones in midair.

286
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:56,460
On its surface, grids of the natives' planetary defenses were lit up in green.

287
00:13:57,580 --> 00:14:02,100
Ones, some depicting their pathetic communication structures in violet.

288
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:03,560
All in scale.

289
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:04,560
Quite pretty, actually.

290
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:07,440
A colorful net surrounded the sphere.

291
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,800
It would soon enough be dark.

292
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,300
These children wait for us below, Jesus.

293
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,240
We will walk among them and we will smile.

294
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:18,740
At your moment of choice, of course.

295
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:28,700
Jesus studied Jones' puffy, tired face in the pink glow of the neuron banks that ran around the walls of the mighty dreadnought and shuddered.

296
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,940
He was no stranger to resurrection of the undead.

297
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:35,480
But whoever had brought Jones around again had slipped up.

298
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,200
Something was missing.

299
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,360
Something else was added.

300
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,500
Something.

301
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:46,860
Jones had been forced on him by the Djinn bankers who had financed this angelic war fleet.

302
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:47,620
Damn them.

303
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:51,960
He never forgot the price they had demanded for this mercenary raiding fleet.

304
00:14:54,780 --> 00:15:00,540
Jones' constant reminders of their influence and expectations irritated Jesus no end.

305
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:04,540
Not to mention the annoying habit Jones had copied from Dobbs.

306
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:07,960
The twisted creature insisted on smoking a pipe.

307
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,280
Even here, near the sensitive nerve relays.

308
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,640
Jones might have been left dead a little too long.

309
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,040
He moved with a constant jerk and always poked at his throat.

310
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:25,440
He never removed his sunglasses and he still took massive injections of methamphetamines even though they no longer had any effect on his regenerated shell.

311
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:32,460
You know, Jimbo, said Jesus, the best part is that they think there's an afterlife.

312
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:35,840
That's why they strung me up the first time.

313
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,940
They think like bugs do.

314
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,360
I'm well aware of that, Commander.

315
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:49,400
It bothered Jones to be back on Earth so soon after his failure with the social programming research post he had been running there.

316
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,120
It wasn't really his fault.

317
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:55,440
The administration change at Central merely cut off the funding for it.

318
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,300
He was forced to abort the experiment.

319
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:01,160
Then we'll have to wait before we find out what this is all about.

320
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,240
Not entirely.

321
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:06,180
The papers we found in Harding's laboratory explain why they're building the hydrogen bomb.

322
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,840
Its explosion was intense.

323
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:12,260
It was intended to deflect the rotation of the Earth enough to send it out of its orbit and spitting off into space.

324
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,940
Those zombies must have been as crazy as they looked.

325
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,020
It may sound ridiculous, but it's theoretically possible.

326
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,980
Yeah, we're safe now, for the time being.

327
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,980
But there are undoubtedly more of those power-mad creatures loose on other planets.

328
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,760
So it'll take constant vigilance on our part to ensure the safety of this world.

329
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,840
Hello, I'm a Martian.

330
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,880
I hope I speak your language.

331
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:37,560
This is a recording.

332
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:38,640
What?

333
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,400
Take me to your leader.

334
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,360
Take me to your leader.

335
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:47,620
If this was indeed an extraterrestrial spacecraft with living occupants,

336
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:52,820
it must have been very disconcerting for them to cross millions of miles of space

337
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,740
only to be hit on the head with rotten oranges.

338
00:16:57,880 --> 00:17:02,940
The dramatic advent of such fascinating objects as those which were first called flying saucers

339
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,860
attracted the inevitable attention of those individuals who were not aware of the existence of these objects.

340
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:06,940
The

341
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,320
The

342
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,840
The

343
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,200
The

344
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:35,800
The

345
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:35,820
The

346
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:35,840
The

347
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:35,860
The

348
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,120
The The

349
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:40,680
The The The The The The

350
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:43,860
and put into the studio that seemed to be rotating very rapidly

351
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,760
with lights flashing off rhythmically.

352
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,700
And it was a small man with a swollen head

353
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,720
and hideously deformed eyes

354
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,180
sitting behind the console pushing the buttons

355
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:56,560
while pencils of light and energy flashed across my body.

356
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:59,860
And I wondered why I was there and what did they want of me.

357
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,300
And I couldn't figure out why I was sitting there.

358
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,680
And they didn't say anything.

359
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,660
They just kept flashing those lights at me

360
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:08,300
and pumping those strange chemicals into me.

361
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,700
And the man with the funny head, the leader,

362
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,440
the man with the strange grin and the pipe.

363
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:17,540
Well, I just want to know, do you want to be in the church or out of the church?

364
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:19,740
And where's your wallet?

365
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,340
Yeah.

366
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:25,300
I didn't know that I'd been snatched up, but it wasn't really a dream

367
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,000
until I saw these sacred nasal positions.

368
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,780
And suddenly it all came back to me.

369
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:35,480
And I realized that they'd stolen four and a half hours out of my life

370
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,420
when they put me in that tiny room

371
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,160
and plugged all those wires into me

372
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:43,460
and made me talk and talk and talk and talk and talk.

373
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,780
Because you only paid for an hour and a half.

374
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:49,320
Friends and neighbors of planet Earth,

375
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,020
I come to you from a long, long ways off.

376
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,220
I come from a planet that is similar to yours.

377
00:18:56,820 --> 00:19:01,080
Your many fears, tensions, and frustrations are no longer ours.

378
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,800
I hate them with all my heart.

379
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,440
They are inhuman and to be destroyed.

380
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,400
What is your opinion?

381
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:07,920
Objective.

382
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,040
You are not ready.

383
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,680
But we will still save you.

384
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,620
In your quest to save the city, you will send up more satellites.

385
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,580
And we will be there.

386
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,760
Waiting to come again.

387
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:28,780
I'll be right here.

388
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:37,300
And we'll be sending that little almond-eyed gray humanoid around to your door.

389
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,360
To collect those organs.

390
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:39,120
So...

391
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,720
Snappy.

392
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,320
He'll be in the cute little uniform, so don't be afraid.

393
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,680
They're your friends.

394
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,660
They're here to help.

395
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:48,280
They're our brothers from the stars.

396
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:52,700
You should believe anything they whisper into your ear in the dead of night

397
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,200
as you try to sleep.

398
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,360
Whisper, whisper, whisper.

399
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,440
They're your friends.

400
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,680
They want to teach humanity

401
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:03,860
and lead us into a new age of enlightenment

402
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,800
under their gray jackboot.

403
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:07,400
Whisper.

404
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,400


405
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,400


406
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,400


407
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:07,400


408
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:07,500
Whisper.

409
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,320
Now listen.

410
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,000
Now listen.

411
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:09,640
Now listen.

412
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,240
Now listen.

413
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,060
Now listen.

414
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:15,400
If you wake up in a vat of poison

415
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,300
with little aliens standing around outside the vat

416
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,860
wrapping, tying napkins around their necks

417
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,460
and sharpening their knives and forks,

418
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:30,280
be glad because you've just fell into the hands of the good aliens.

419
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:34,840
The bad aliens are far, far worse.

420
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,660
Whoa!

421
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,640
Oh, they're not like the thing.

422
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,520
That was a cuddly little Benji of an alien compared to what we're...

423
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:49,040
They aren't like aliens in that movie Aliens.

424
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:53,900
Those are silly little werewolves among monsters

425
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,560
compared to what we're talking about.

426
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:56,840
That is in the box.

427
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,500
What we're talking about is more like what's growing in your refrigerator right now.

428
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:05,220
That's what it looks more like.

429
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,860
That is in the box.

430
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:12,140
And the effect is it turns you into the alien.

431
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:18,220
But man, take my word for it.

432
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:18,940
It's worth it.

433
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,360
It's great, man.

434
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:21,820
It's cool.

435
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:22,720
You'll love it.

436
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,600
It's for your own good.

437
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:26,300
It's for your own good.

438
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:30,880
What's the matter?

439
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,440
Are you afraid?

440
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:33,280
What's the matter, you chicken?

441
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:34,720
Come on, man.

442
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,080
Everybody's doing it.

443
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:37,980
Go ahead.

444
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:45,780
Stroke the alien and collect the dew that builds up on the side of its neck like appendage.

445
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:47,620
Go ahead.

446
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,020
Now demagnetize your head.

447
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:55,860
Okay?

448
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:59,680
I think you know what to do next.

449
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:03,700
I don't think you're the kind of listener that I'd have to explain that to.

450
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,480
Now are you?

451
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:06,880
Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

452
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,120
Yeah, I think they know just what I'm talking about.

453
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,040
Oh, they like it too.

454
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:16,260
Oh, they're first and good.

455
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:19,480
I don't know what to do next.

456
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:25,000
You stand up on the hillside with your bat call and blow into the bat call.

457
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,540
Don't try to...

458
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,640
It's not like a moose call or a duck call.

459
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:29,840
You can't hear it.

460
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:30,180
I don't think I can hear it.

461
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:33,020
Yeah, but it's super...

462
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,560
This is superfluous cock.

463
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,640
I give it a name.

464
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,400
And just make sure...

465
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:42,060
Make sure you've got your antidote pudding ready for when that bat lands on your face.

466
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:44,380
You're gonna have to use that pudding mighty quick.

467
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,660
That's awesome, my boy.

468
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:46,880
But it's worth it.

469
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,240
You'll dig it.

470
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:48,960
Well, I don't know.

471
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:50,300
I'm kind of scared.

472
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:52,980
Well, it's always scary the first time.

473
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,200
That's part of the kick, man.

474
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:55,980
Oh, okay.

475
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,060
Come on, everybody's doing it.

476
00:22:58,380 --> 00:22:59,860
I ain't never gonna do it.

477
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:00,940
I'm too old to do it.

478
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:02,960
Aren't you susceptible to peer group pressure?

479
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:03,540
I mean...

480
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,280
I'm too old for it.

481
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:06,060
What are you, some kind of a weirdo?

482
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:06,660
Yes.

483
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,500
No, I'm not a weirdo.

484
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,360
I want to be like everyone else.

485
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,180
No, no, no.

486
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,200
Good, then you'll take this little alien home and...

487
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,760
I am a weirdo.

488
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,980
Hey, stop rubbing your...

489
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,340
I'm just being the game.

490
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,120
I don't think there's a reason for her to be confused.

491
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,580
There's something you find when you open the door.

492
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:28,960
You take these keys, and one of the keys says,

493
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:30,120
Barbwining.

494
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:33,420
You stick it in the lock, and you open up the door.

495
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:36,240
And if you're lucky, the green carpet rolls out.

496
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,120
And if you're not...

497
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:41,020
The red carpet rolls out.

498
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,620
He was communicating with them.

499
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,220
What do you think?

500
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:48,300
I think Rockefeller was crazy that night.

501
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:51,300
He got away with the money.

502
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:53,400
And then...

503
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,580
How can we stop them?

504
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,480
We can stop them by stopping the pink boys.

505
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,640
If we stop the pink boys, we can stop them murdering, and they're killing, and they're

506
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,620
stealing, and they're persifying us.

507
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:06,620
But it's so difficult.

508
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:06,960
Yeah.

509
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:10,340
Oh, Jerry, don't let the boy out of the house.

510
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,280
Be brave.

511
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:11,940
Be brave.

512
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,320
Oh, always be brave.

513
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,380
Because the women saves us.

514
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,680
Greetings to you, Earthlings.

515
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,480
I am Princess Dragomon.

516
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,680
I have taken over this planet.

517
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,620
Now I own the Earth, and you'll be my slaves for all eternity.

518
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:33,540
The disasters you experienced are just small examples of our great power.

519
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,840
Either surrender to me, or I'll destroy all humans.

520
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:37,380
I'm not going to let you go.

521
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,380


522
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,380


523
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,380


524
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,380


525
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,380


526
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,380


527
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,380


528
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,380


529
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,380


530
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:37,380


531
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,020
I've spoken.

532
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,360
It's all a warning you're going to get from me.

533
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,380
You'll be destroyed.

534
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,180
They don't sleep either.

535
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,340
They're not emotional.

536
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:50,980
Angels don't have any emotion.

537
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:54,240
Another and worse war will break out.

538
00:24:55,120 --> 00:25:01,340
When you see a night with a strange light in the sky, you will know it is a sign that

539
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,120
the world is about to be punished for its crime.

540
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,080
By 1998...

541
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:06,740
By 1998?

542
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:14,260
By 1998, every normal, mediocritan, pink boy, admin, Trekkie, and hippie is going

543
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:17,880
to be trying to get on board with the good ship dogs.

544
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:18,180
The great ship dogs.

545
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:18,900
The good ship dogs.

546
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:23,400
Or they're going to fry along with everybody else when those aliens get here.

547
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,920
Of course, such a prophecy immediately arises our cynicism.

548
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,240
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

549
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,320
Perhaps.

550
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,720
Or...

551
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:41,020
Or is it just another of those prognostications which have haunted man through the ages?

552
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:46,780
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand, but for

553
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:51,900
the fact that many of Nostradamus's other prophecies have already been fulfilled.

554
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,320
But the old ones are coming back.

555
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,740
I'm going to let them through.

556
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:05,000
The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and fallout.

557
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:06,720
Well, I'm going to let them through.

558
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:12,300
Stop no one with their weapons.

559
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:16,260
Just now we heard they figured the

560
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,620
Amplified

561
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:24,620


562
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:24,620


563
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:24,620


564
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:24,920
that

565
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:25,260
the

566
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:32,720
Da pla

567
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:36,680
filled

568
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:36,700
the

569
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:41,280
all the cities that get the hour of slack are in different time continuum.

570
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:47,700
But here in Dallas, yesterday was July 4th, the day before real Independence Day.

571
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:57,660
You see, for subgeniuses, July 4th is like the day of disappointment and shattered dreams.

572
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:05,520
It's a day of lies and rushes to judgment of drunken pinks and car crashes

573
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:09,300
and depressing desert storm parades.

574
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:15,980
And we mope around and think about things like Wounded Knee and JFK and assassination

575
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:24,240
and the Spanish-American War and Vietnam and Iran-Contras and Watergate and so on.

576
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:35,500
But dear friends, dear friends, July 5th, July 5th, that is a day.

577
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:40,560
A day of hope and promise for the subgeniuses.

578
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:46,440
Yes, friends, the day with the true America, the Bob's America,

579
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:54,600
the America of our Masonic subgenius, patriot forefathers and foremoms and foreslaves.

580
00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:03,000
Today, July 5th, in Dallas anyway, is the first day of the end of the world.

581
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,160
The end of their world, dear friends.

582
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:12,960
Because it's the first day before the beginning of our world, our subgenius planet.

583
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,520
Ah, yes, yes, yes.

584
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:21,680
It makes me feel so good, so good to have a subgenius holiday.

585
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,780
We need more subgenius holidays.

586
00:28:23,900 --> 00:28:29,320
Of course, every day is Bob's birthday, but, you know, that gets unrealistic after a while.

587
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:35,500
And so we call, well, July 4th, what the pinks call their independence.

588
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:35,960
Independence Day.

589
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,660
We call July 4th X Day Eve.

590
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:44,800
And X Day Night, of course, we call X Day Eve.

591
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:46,100
Sort of like Halloween.

592
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,840
But X Day is our independence day.

593
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:52,160
Not July 4th, not Juneteenth, but Xistmas.

594
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,640
Xistmas, dear friends.

595
00:28:54,680 --> 00:29:04,060
And, you know, the night before Xistmas, the whole family, the subgenius fully extended nuclear family,

596
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,420
goes out and watches.

597
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:10,260
Fireworks or else illegally sets them off in their backyard.

598
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:16,600
And then everyone, the kids and everyone go in and watch Freddy Krueger Nightmare on Elm Street videos

599
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,840
around the fireplace.

600
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:22,540
And the kids are tucked in, of course, about 1 o'clock in the morning.

601
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:29,480
And the grown-ups stay up all night frobbing and frobbing and dooning and gleaning

602
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:35,260
and doing X Day chants about how the time is not.

603
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,680
And the kids are up all night.

604
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,480
And the kids are up all night.

605
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:44,640
And songs, you know, X Day holiday songs like Take Me Off to Space, which we'll be playing soon.

606
00:29:44,980 --> 00:29:50,020
And on X Day morning, of course, well, the grown-ups have been up all night.

607
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:55,820
But the kids get up real early because on X Day, the children are allowed to eat breakfast.

608
00:29:57,020 --> 00:30:05,140
And just before 7 o'clock, all the grown-ups and everybody sit outdoors on their easy chairs like I did this morning with beers.

609
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,100
Or whatever in their hands.

610
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,640
And they do a countdown up till 7 a.m.

611
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:15,640
And then since it's not really X Day yet, they meditate, friends, on what it's going to be like

612
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:21,220
when those men from Planet X come down and destroy the normal people on this planet

613
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:27,760
and take the weird abnormals and eccentrics and those of us who have to live in disguise as a human

614
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:33,060
and lift us up, up and away into the escaped vessels of the sex goddesses.

615
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,240
And that's what our religion is.

616
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:35,800
It's all about.

617
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:45,220
But, you know, anyway, on X Day, after thinking about all that, we sing hymns more about how the humans are all going to die.

618
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:50,480
And then there's some rock and roll and dancing and so forth.

619
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:55,240
And then everybody goes to bed, usually fairly early in the day, because you have to sleep.

620
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,840
I've been up all night on X Day Eve.

621
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:01,040
And they need to have energy for X Dayeen.

622
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,860
It's on our heart.

623
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,400
X Dayeen, when...

624
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:09,060
The night of X-mas, when everybody dresses up in costumes.

625
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:15,960
Dress up like angels or devils or God or Jesus or Bob or even Negi.

626
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:22,000
And, of course, you can get those Bob and Negi masks from your favorite subgenius vendors at Fractant Company.

627
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,160
As seen in your Sartfest.

628
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,280
Ah, yes. Ah, yes, yes, yes.

629
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:33,000
Shalakandala Dabasoya.

630
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:33,500
Yeah.

631
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,600
Oh.

632
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,300
Oh.

633
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,480
You have to go?

634
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:04,500
The X-mas will descend with some scientifically magic.

635
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,440
There'll be stalls of technology that will be too much for us to handle.

636
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:15,540
In one instant, all the hangovers will disappear, along with all pollution and nuclear weapons.

637
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:22,600
But in return, the human race will have to take on living machinery so complex that those that is peaceful.

638
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,840
The end result will be equivalent to letting toddlers play with a nuclear arsenal.

639
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:34,480
Bob, and not some conspiracy world government, must be there in a position of world leadership.

640
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:46,220
To explain humanity's behavior to the X's in ways they can understand so they don't put us out of our misery with a snap of their cosmic finger like they did the dinosaurs.

641
00:32:46,820 --> 00:32:54,020
The right people, us, must be the ones that the X's make into superhuman overmen.

642
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:02,220
And even then, things will be damn tough for the rest of this period, which is called the time and half time.

643
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:14,780
The X's have landed.

644
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:20,700
Earth's under their control.

645
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:27,840
Bob's vision stands proven.

646
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:34,060
The city's radioactive pole.

647
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,260
The new homeworlds.

648
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:41,380
We don't know what their game is.

649
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,280
But their name is unpronounceable.

650
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:54,300
We don't know what they came for.

651
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,340
But what they aim for is impossible.

652
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,400
Is there not a way?

653
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,480
Is there not a way?

654
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:22,740
A way to move the future as they have?

655
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:23,540
If you have any

656
00:34:23,540 --> 00:34:23,700
So long.

657
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:24,440
Last official journalism tour, seafaringlah.com.

658
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,280
We hopefully shouldn't doan 12 5 entries a day.

659
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,260
Oh, so a file of journal Got7.

660
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:29,240
librarian.A.

661
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:29,240


662
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:29,880
The 來on.

663
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,840
All of the elephants were experts.

664
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:38,200
Have landed their machines.

665
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,980
Following our tracks.

666
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:48,160
Bob's vision stands proven.

667
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:54,200
A world without slack.

668
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:21,840
A world without slack.

669
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,640
Some of that is nerd.

670
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,220
And even now I show thee signs in the heaven and signs in the earth.

671
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,960
Blood bilges from the earth.

672
00:35:34,220 --> 00:35:37,940
My lights in the sky rebuke thee.

673
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:43,280
The children of heaven and the angels from heaven are among thee.

674
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:45,460
Spreading lies and deception.

675
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:48,220
They turn not as they go.

676
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,100
But who cares, dear friends?

677
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:52,140
Who cares?

678
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:52,840
Because.

679
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:55,840
Because the end times are coming up.

680
00:35:57,140 --> 00:36:00,560
You know, it's the first day of the end of the world.

681
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:14,260
And we've been given, Bob has given us to see signs and portents of what will bring this end,

682
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:16,980
what will trigger the day of judgment.

683
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:26,420
And what it's going to be, of course, we know when the exodus will, of course, arrive July 5th, 1998,

684
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:28,940
at 7 o'clock in the morning, all over the world.

685
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:37,080
But what triggers the end times for the other alien beings, the Yakatizma and so forth,

686
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:46,340
is this one moment when America becomes so decadent that it no longer deserves to live.

687
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:54,400
And that sign of the end times, dear friends, is the royal jelly enema.

688
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:02,220
At a time, 1998, 97, doesn't matter when, might be now, may have already happened.

689
00:37:02,540 --> 00:37:10,820
A time when beggars are crowding the streets and children, poor children are out starving.

690
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:16,860
Celebrities and lawyers in Hollywood will be indulging in the latest heated,

691
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:20,360
hedonistic health, the crackpot health fad.

692
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:27,420
Getting enemas with pure royal jelly, the honey fed to queen bees,

693
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:35,380
which costs $1,000 for enough royal jelly to get the average jaded swinger, you know, off or whatever.

694
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:43,140
And so at this time when the homeless are selling their babies to procure used, left over,

695
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:46,300
amber grist and royal jelly enema byproducts,

696
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:54,200
when a Hollywood star, the moment when a Hollywood star spends $60,000 in one night on that,

697
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:59,760
and his used jelly is sold on the streets for $200 for half a pint,

698
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:08,420
this so disgusts the aliens that they decide to trash the earth before the exes arrive.

699
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:08,740
Arrival.

700
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:12,680
Friends.

701
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,960
It's gonna be a rough time.

702
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:21,600
And I'm gonna, I'm, this is, this is gonna be an all ex day night, a night of celebrating.

703
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:28,240
Yes, that time when Bob will come and hose down the streets and clean up this crooked and perverse nation.

704
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:34,740
So we're gonna hear from Father Joe Mama as he delves on into this as well.

705
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:35,980
Praise Bob.

706
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:42,200
Hello friends and welcome.

707
00:38:43,460 --> 00:38:46,760
You know, most of you out there must be feeling pretty smug.

708
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:47,400
With yourselves.

709
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,320
After all, you're alive.

710
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:51,660
You're healthy.

711
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,320
Your life's insured.

712
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,680
There's a little money set aside in case of accidents.

713
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:57,380
What more could you ask for?

714
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,420
These are good times.

715
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:06,160
Easy money, easy sex, VCRs and Nintendo to keep your minds occupied.

716
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:10,820
You know they say that the golden age is never the present age.

717
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:11,940
They, they really do say that.

718
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,560
But we look all around us everywhere, and what do we see?

719
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:16,620
Gold.

720
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,460
A golden opportunity.

721
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:24,600
Well friends, that's just calm before the storm, because tonight's sermon is entitled,

722
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:29,200
Ex Day 1998, Day of Reckoning.

723
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,320
We all know vaguely what Ex Day is.

724
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:35,960
Bob told us himself that it shall occur July 5th, 1998.

725
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:41,800
The exes shall land and whisk the good subgenies off to a never-ending pleasure cruise of the cosmos.

726
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:45,540
But what of the pinks that remain on Earth?

727
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:49,040
What will happen to the a-holes that are left behind?

728
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:57,080
Well friends, as much as I hate to gloat over those less fortunate, the fact is, they'll get exactly what they deserve.

729
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:05,080
Any real, any real subgenie giving the normal what he deserves is about the cruelest fate a normal could ever receive.

730
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:10,700
After all, these are the same normals that have supported the conspiracy for centuries.

731
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:15,520
These are the same normals that have tortured us with their ignorance and defiled the name of the world.

732
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:20,320
These are the same normals that have taken the most free country in the world,

733
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:28,380
and turned it into an ever-growing bureaucratic governmental monster that feeds on taxes, committees, laws, statutes, buck-passing, and fill-in-the-blank.

734
00:40:28,780 --> 00:40:39,080
Then, once the creature's rot-filled gut sprues out the digested combination of all the vices before-mentioned by the lawyers and liars that created this filth, what's the result?

735
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,760
Why, the conspiracy, of course.

736
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,740
And this pile of stinking defecation.

737
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,700
We're supposed to kneel before, and worship, and serve?

738
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:49,900
Never!

739
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:58,080
Bob will avenge us for the years of conspiracy rule on that most dreaded of subgenius holidays, X-Day 1998.

740
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,360
Dreaded by them, but not by us.

741
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:11,860
Let us look at Bob's prophecy and see what the normals have in store for them, shall we?

742
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,720
Bob's word comes in many mistakes.

743
00:41:14,740 --> 00:41:15,280
In many serious ways.

744
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:18,920
Not all of which are immediately recognized as divine in origin.

745
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,480
Indeed, since Bob transcends time, so does his word.

746
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:27,120
This revelation popped up in a 1938 radio drama.

747
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:37,060
In this story, the Martians, then a synonym for aliens, later to be known as X's, have landed and started to round up the normals.

748
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:41,000
Two of the unlucky survivors meet to discuss the future of mankind.

749
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,800
The smarter one asserts, quote,

750
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:45,860
I've thought it all out.

751
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:49,000
Right now, we're caught as we're wanted.

752
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:53,500
An X's only has to go a few miles to get a crowd on the run.

753
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,680
But they won't keep on doing that.

754
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,920
They'll begin catching us, systematic-like.

755
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:03,280
Keeping the best and storing us in cages and things.

756
00:42:03,840 --> 00:42:07,320
They haven't begun on us yet. Not begun.

757
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,960
Later he goes on to say,

758
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:15,480
All those little office workers that used to live in these houses, they'll be no good.

759
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,500
They haven't any stuff in them.

760
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:22,040
They used to run, run off to work.

761
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:27,140
I have seen hundreds of them running and catching their commuter trains in the morning,

762
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:30,120
afraid that they'd get panned if they didn't.

763
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:34,420
Running back at night, afraid that they wouldn't be in time for dinner.

764
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,840
Lives insured and a little invested in case of accidents.

765
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:43,040
Yea, and on Sundays, worried about the hereafter.

766
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:47,240
Well, the X's will be a godsend for those guys.

767
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:52,760
Nice roomy cages, good food, careful breeding, and no worries.

768
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:58,260
Yea, after a week or so of chasing around the fields on empty stomachs,

769
00:42:58,260 --> 00:43:00,180
they'll come and be glad to be caught.

770
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,080
Now this is 1938, mind you.

771
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,240
He goes on to say, finally,

772
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:04,860
That's not all.

773
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:08,820
These X's are going to make pets of some of them.

774
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:10,640
Train them to do tricks.

775
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:15,960
Who knows, get sentimental over the pet boy who grew up and had to be killed.

776
00:43:16,180 --> 00:43:19,680
Yea, and some maybe, they'll train to hunt us.

777
00:43:19,840 --> 00:43:20,680
Yes, they will.

778
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:22,460
There's men who will do it gladly.

779
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:27,340
Well, friends, how much more obvious does Bob have to be?

780
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:32,940
When he gave this brief preview of the future in 1938 on CBS,

781
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:37,700
it sent millions of normals into the streets screaming for a reprieve.

782
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,000
They repented.

783
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,320
They begged forgiveness.

784
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:46,860
And yet, just a few days later, after Bob Orson Welles in the War of the Worlds broadcast

785
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:50,900
was described by the conspiracy as nothing more than a joke,

786
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:56,820
the normals went back to the conspiracy way of life as if nothing had ever happened.

787
00:43:57,460 --> 00:44:02,600
They came so close to getting a second chance and mending their ways, but they blew it.

788
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:06,360
They went back to the conspiracy masters and for their loyalty,

789
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,680
they were genocidal.

790
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,180
They were famously rewarded with yet another world war.

791
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:14,420
There's a strange sense of poetic justice to it, isn't there, friends?

792
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,700
Well, they haven't seen nothing yet.

793
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:19,860
Just wait till the real McCoy comes.

794
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:22,500
It's only a few miles down the road, pink boy.

795
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:25,060
And like Dr. Al prescribes to his patients,

796
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,040
if you're caught in a nuclear holocaust and your skin begins to melt,

797
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:30,140
don't panic.

798
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,920
This is perfectly normal.

799
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:37,080
Yes, friends, just another normal way to die for the normals doomed to die.

800
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:39,500
Did I say doomed to die?

801
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,480
I should have said lucky to die,

802
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,260
for blessed are the dead after X-Day arrives.

803
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,780
The doomed are the unlucky pink survivors

804
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:51,460
who must live out their wretched existence under the cruel and merciless excess.

805
00:44:52,020 --> 00:44:54,740
Cruel to them, but not to us.

806
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,080
Not only will there be no more bowling alleys and golf courses for the pinks,

807
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,940
but there'll be no more subgenies to kick around anymore.

808
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,180
We'll be surfing the celestial stars, smoking our frock,

809
00:45:06,180 --> 00:45:07,260
unweaving our slack,

810
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:10,120
and sexing our anti-virgins like there was no tomorrow.

811
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,080
Because in space, friends, there isn't.

812
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,960
Only back on Earth will there be a tomorrow,

813
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,080
and then the next day, and then the next.

814
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,420
It'll be an eternal hell without end.

815
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:23,480
And we'll be enjoying it all in the heavens on closed-circuit TV,

816
00:45:24,260 --> 00:45:27,400
because we won't want to miss a single revenge-filled minute.

817
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,040
Praise Bob! Amen.

818
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,820
Take me off to space.

819
00:45:37,260 --> 00:45:38,620
Take me off to space.

820
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:43,080
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

821
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:45,780
Take me off to space.

822
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:47,880
Take me off to space.

823
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:52,680
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

824
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,240
Take needles in my belly, take samples of my skin.

825
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,640
I don't care as long as I can live with saucer man.

826
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,260
I know that you don't take requests, but I'm a special case.

827
00:46:07,260 --> 00:46:26,500
Taught to be an Sic approachant

828
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:28,140
may change my mind when I follow suit.

829
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:28,560


830
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:28,560


831
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:28,560


832
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,920
Hey, cow mutilators!

833
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,140
Let me join your crew.

834
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:36,580
Give me a knife in case you've left your life all cut up.

835
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:41,840
i don't care if you're some kind of ghastly beast without a face

836
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:46,020
so come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

837
00:46:46,020 --> 00:46:54,980
Take me off to space, take me off to space Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

838
00:46:54,980 --> 00:47:12,500
Come down you tiny robots with your little nipper claws You pale and bug-eyed aliens with flat and clammy paws

839
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:39,000
Life is just a sucker dream and death is a disgrace So come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

840
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:55,400
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

841
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:35,500
They do it their way As the mutants move, that leaps Tibetan Tiger Man

842
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:42,480
What about this reputed Jesus Starfleet there?

843
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,080
It was supposed to have shown up

844
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:52,680
As you see, they have just left the hangar deck at Lunar Central and have cleared the airlocks into the colony

845
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,880
The crowd of scientists and technicians are going wild

846
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,100
What a space ovation!

847
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,520
Now let's feel another

848
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:05,380
And now in celebration of this great occasion we have planned a lunar party

849
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:12,480
We hope all young people throughout the solar system will join us in celebration of this great day in Earth

850
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,200
And out of space

851
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,660
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

852
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,900
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

853
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:21,420
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

854
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,380
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

855
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:25,380


856
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:31,940
Late that Saturday night before retiring, I took out the snapshot picture of the sailor

857
00:49:31,940 --> 00:49:36,560
And studied it until I could close my eyes and see this man's face as though he was standing in front of me

858
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:39,880
As far as not having a face

859
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:44,900
Yeah that's what people say, I pretty much think it's a bunch of shit

860
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,900
I love you

861
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:57,840
All the flying saucers are my friends cause they're so nice

862
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:02,240
I'm gonna see them again and again

863
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,140
Is that before or after the bob pills?

864
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,000
Get on the ground

865
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,780
And then we'll have a third sexual organ which cannot even be imagined yet

866
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:20,760
And human beings in the future will have all 27 sexes that will exist on planet Earth

867
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:24,760
Which will make it difficult to get laid on a Friday night

868
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:33,840
Cause we have to go to 27 separate singles bars in order to score an entire union

869
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,740
Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen, this is Drew Pearson

870
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:44,440
We bring you this special radio television broadcast in order to give you the very latest information on an amazing phenomenon

871
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,460
The arrival of a space ship in Washington

872
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:55,240
The rumors of invading armies and mass destruction are based on hysteria and are absolutely false

873
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:00,360
And you are not alone

874
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:02,220
And you are not alone

875
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,980
Remember it's true

876
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:21,540
The UFOs are picking us up

877
00:51:21,540 --> 00:51:24,060
The UFOs are picking us up

878
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:26,540
The UFOs are picking us up

879
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:32,200
The part of your soul which is attached to your soul

880
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:34,980
A $2USD rises up with the smoke

881
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:39,540
And it is received by our interplanetary exes guardians

882
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,780
And you will be saved

883
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:44,760
And in some cases we don't want the money

884
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,440
And we throw the money in toilets and flush it down

885
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:59,360
But our intra-sewer sponge nine inch worms receive the part of your soul which is attached to the money again

886
00:51:59,360 --> 00:52:01,920
And you can be saved by the nine inch worms

887
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,360
You need Bob following you around.

888
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:06,400
Bob can see through all those Bob hands.

889
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:13,060
The nine-inch worms are the only force which can encounter the exes maggots

890
00:52:13,060 --> 00:52:17,260
and protect humanity from the exes maggots in 1998.

891
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,580
The exes are going to leave Earth.

892
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:24,200
Oh, yeah, we'll be completely free to do whatever we want.

893
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:25,640
They're just going to leave us alone.

894
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:33,780
But their unmentionable, unnameable, horrible maggots will remain.

895
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:38,240
We will be dogs to them in more ways than you can ever imagine.

896
00:52:38,660 --> 00:52:41,960
Unless the nine-inch worms are preserved.

897
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,180
No eight-inch worms aren't going to help you.

898
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,560
No ten-inch, ten-and-a-half-inch worms are going to help you.

899
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,560
Oh, yeah, ten-inch worms will show you a good time.

900
00:52:48,860 --> 00:52:51,940
Oh, yeah, ten-inch worms will take you out on the town all night

901
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,520
compared to those nine-inch worms.

902
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,760
You know, people are sitting there going,

903
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:58,520
Exes, end of the world, 1998.

904
00:52:59,420 --> 00:53:03,040
If they don't buy the book, when 1998 comes

905
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:06,500
and the world is a nuclear wasteland,

906
00:53:07,220 --> 00:53:09,680
when we're all slaves or ground beef,

907
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:12,220
they're going to go, oh, I guess these guys weren't kidding.

908
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:16,400
Yeah, I should have read the stark fist a little more carefully, he said,

909
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:19,280
while digging through nuclear holocaust,

910
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:23,560
looking at the third hand growing from his stomach.

911
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,540
Why doesn't it?

912
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,060
Go away.

913
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:26,740
Ouch.

914
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:30,140
Heliopters are what brings them.

915
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:32,020
You can put it in your pipe and smoke it.

916
00:53:33,600 --> 00:53:39,560
Heliopters are, this is a legend that is going to be revealed right now in media for the first time.

917
00:53:39,740 --> 00:53:43,360
Heliopters are these quasi-mechanical, leather-clad, demonic,

918
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,900
they kind of look like helicopters at first glance,

919
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,640
but they are alive and they're employed by a,

920
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:52,620
I hate to use the term minor deity,

921
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,240
but this guy's name is Gbrogfran.

922
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,740
And he's right up there with Bob, I'm not kidding.

923
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:00,300
He's right up there with Odin and Arnold Palmer.

924
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:01,920
If you ever see anything that says,

925
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:04,020
approve Dr. Gbrogfran, buy it.

926
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:09,100
And these heliopters are how Dr. Bob equipment has arrived.

927
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,620
And oftentimes there are tons of Bob pills on these heliopters,

928
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:19,060
these special compartments that were designed for the transport of these sacred anointings.

929
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:22,500
It was the heliopters that originally brought our minds to Dobbs.

930
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,700
The rattlesnake manure.

931
00:54:23,860 --> 00:54:25,360
By stench of the spirit.

932
00:54:25,640 --> 00:54:29,460
It is like bone to a million slaughtered swine.

933
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,920
And in these times,

934
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:35,320
thy planet is wreathed in foul vapors of fire.

935
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,300
Hold on a minute.

936
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:41,280
The conspiracy has put a slight detour in front of us here.

937
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:42,140
I must change lanes.

938
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,340
But there are other things,

939
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:49,240
other evil, dark, shadowy forces at work in this solar system of ours,

940
00:54:49,260 --> 00:54:51,780
in this galaxy, in this corner of our universe.

941
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,460
Negi, by imposing his twisted will,

942
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,640
upon the trajectories of Jehovah's neutrinos,

943
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:03,180
is able to deflect those trajectories.

944
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,000
Feasibility study ended.

945
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:08,360
Abduction of human race?

946
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,280
Infeasible.

947
00:55:10,560 --> 00:55:12,040
Warning, warning.

948
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,580
Psychics applying the proper slack

949
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:19,540
have discovered secret Nazi UFO bases in the Antarctic.

950
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,200
The truth that President Truman never told us.

951
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:25,460
Dobbs Plus is boring.

952
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:25,780
Boring so.

953
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:28,400
The hideous super-brow.

954
00:55:29,420 --> 00:55:32,320
They called him Wellman when he was a human.

955
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,460
Before the brow took over.

956
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,680
Before the brow took over.

957
00:55:37,740 --> 00:55:39,200
This is what I did.

958
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:40,440
I hired deities.

959
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:45,840
I'll give them seconds until they slow down.

960
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,300
Therefore, there is a god.

961
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,060
End of quote.

962
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,940
I said you're gonna have to get yourself

963
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:55,820
in discernment here

964
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,740
and be able to discern the spirit of God

965
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,140
from the spirit of Hinduism.

966
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,420
I said people in Haiti, I said,

967
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:05,560
when the Holy Ghost hits them, they think it's Buddha.

968
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,280
Because Buddha hits them like the Holy Ghost hits them.

969
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:14,240
People in America think that

970
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,700
when the Holy Ghost hits somebody, it's witchcraft.

971
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:18,900
Yes, witchcraft.

972
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:22,800
Those people down, they see demonic visions.

973
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,720
And the devil uses them.

974
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:28,180
Buddhism and witchcraft.

975
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,040
And the powers of the pagan gods.

976
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:37,720
The powers of the pagan gods produce it.

977
00:56:37,720 --> 00:56:39,060
Lying signs and wonders.

978
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,140
But I want you to know that the pagan gods

979
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:44,340
and their false religions can do what they're doing in the world.

980
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:47,060
Bless God, what can we do with a true God?

981
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:48,340
With a true Christ?

982
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:49,740
With a true Holy Ghost?

983
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:52,300
We ought to be able to do more than what they're doing.

984
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:53,440
Hallelujah.

985
00:56:54,180 --> 00:56:54,740
Hallelujah.

986
00:56:55,740 --> 00:56:58,420
How would God take the scales off your eyes

987
00:56:58,420 --> 00:57:00,760
and open your eyes to behold

988
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,240
that the Lord's coming is at the door

989
00:57:03,240 --> 00:57:06,080
and that all that's happening in the world is getting us ready

990
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:11,020
for Jesus Christ to dwell in the fullness of God in the saints.

991
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:13,220
That we will come forth with revelation

992
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:16,240
and manifestation of the Holy Ghost

993
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,300
revealing Christ to the world

994
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:21,300
that we will possess in our temples

995
00:57:21,300 --> 00:57:23,700
the very fullness of the Spirit.

996
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:25,600
That we'll be filled with the Spirit.

997
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,180
We'll be filled with it.

998
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:29,340
We'll have oil in our lamps burning.

999
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:33,620
That we will not stop until our lives have been complete.

1000
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:34,560
I don't care.

1001
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,200
They can talk about me all over Brownwood and Baines and around here.

1002
00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,280
Call me anything, but I'm preaching the truth.

1003
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:43,560
They can talk about me and turn on this minister and say this ain't real.

1004
00:57:43,700 --> 00:57:47,420
But you let one of them hypocrites come and show where I'm wrong

1005
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:50,080
and take the Bible and prove that this ain't God

1006
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:52,260
and this ain't the Word of God to the people

1007
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,840
and I'll leave tomorrow.

1008
00:57:54,580 --> 00:57:55,100
Hallelujah.

1009
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,140
But I'm not leaving tomorrow.

1010
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,420
You say, why?

1011
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:01,120
Because there ain't nobody in the state of Texas

1012
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,900
and the state of Alabama, Florida, anywhere else

1013
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,800
can take the Word of God and prove this is wrong.

1014
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:07,820
They may lie.

1015
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:09,100
They may accuse.

1016
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:11,240
They may tell all manner of evil.

1017
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:14,500
But they cannot touch this Spirit.

1018
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:16,340
They cannot touch this Word.

1019
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,400
This is the Word of the Holy Ghost.

1020
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:19,940
This is God's promise.

1021
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,260
This is God's Word.

1022
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:23,580
God's truth to you.

1023
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:29,980
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1033
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,540
Back in Cleveland, I don't know why,

1034
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:19,820
and then my wife, she's...

1035
00:59:19,820 --> 00:59:19,920
I don't know why.

1036
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:19,920


1037
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:19,920


1038
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:19,920


1039
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:19,920


1040
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,140
She fell down and they've had to pick her up.

1041
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:22,740
Her leg's okay.

1042
00:59:23,780 --> 00:59:25,840
And something, you can't get something for nothing.

1043
00:59:25,940 --> 00:59:27,120
You know, if it ain't one thing, it's another.

1044
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:27,940
It.

1045
00:59:28,060 --> 00:59:28,940
You know what I'm talking about.

1046
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:29,140
It.

1047
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:34,100
If it ain't one thing, it is gonna be another.

1048
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,220
It may be coming back on that opposite reality chain.

1049
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:37,640
You know, the one coming back the other way?

1050
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:38,900
It's like a big ape.

1051
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:39,740
It's like a big ape.

1052
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:44,380
If it weren't for nothing, in contrast, you know, we'd be like nothing too compared to it.

1053
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:48,000
And you can't know nothing unless you know everything.

1054
00:59:48,260 --> 00:59:49,580
But you can't know everything.

1055
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:50,960
Unless you know nothing.

1056
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:52,120
How many people say I'm crazy now?

1057
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:58,680
They get in there and they say, but the Hades, the Hades and the unseen world and the abode of the lost.

1058
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,680
And they say that ain't real.

1059
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:01,760
And I seen it down there on the seventh level.

1060
01:00:01,860 --> 01:00:05,200
And I, I, the mystery, the mystery, the mystery.

1061
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:07,900
It just, it just tears us apart, the mystery.

1062
01:00:08,020 --> 01:00:14,080
And if we can just say, I know, I know that everything will be fine.

1063
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:14,460
I know.

1064
01:00:17,180 --> 01:00:17,980
I know.

1065
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:25,200
I, I, I, I know.

1066
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,060
I, I, I, I know.

1067
01:00:28,060 --> 01:00:30,420
I, I, I, I know.

1068
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:37,880
I, I, I, I know that everything will be fine.
