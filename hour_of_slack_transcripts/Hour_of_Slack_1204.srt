1
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,740
I

2
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,880
Suppose it's true after all if so all you vindictive

3
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:31,300
Moralistic pseudo Christians who make Jesus look so petty all you right-wing ideologues who lie cheat and steal in the name of the Lord

4
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:37,940
To grab people's hearts minds and money all you self-righteous moralists who think that you know what God Almighty wants us to see

5
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,220
hear think and do

6
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,960
Don't let your mind go to hell

7
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,240
Save it listen to

8
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:53,400
The

9
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:55,300
Oh

10
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:10,720
Friends friends friends friends this week we go even further back in time than last week

11
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:18,340
In fact, we go back to last century last millennium indeed with a rerun of hour of slack number

12
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,240
257

13
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,320
Which was broadcast in

14
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,200
1997

15
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,940
And happened to be our five-year anniversary show

16
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:30,140
Whoop tee doo

17
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,160
We're actually in our 24th year now, and we're really on our of slack number

18
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:44,780
1204 but my online subgenius history and cult management class is still running at Robert Anton

19
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:51,820
Wilson's maybe logic Academy maybe logic net so reruns are appropriate as well as

20
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,240
a necessary

21
00:01:53,400 --> 00:02:23,380
Don't worry though friends will drag lonesome cowboy Dave and ourselves back to the studio soon and meanwhile you get to hear what the show was like in the olden times of the last millennium when we actually wrote scripts for our rantings this episode also features some pieces especially one by Joe Paulino that have since become true classics in retrospect this episode also features some pieces especially one by Joe Paulino that have since become true classics in retrospect

22
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,840
They were true classics then too I suppose we also get to hear

23
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,280
puzzling evidence

24
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:29,940
broadcasts from

25
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:35,640
KPFA and Berkeley that are so old that you still hear st. Palmer

26
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,000
Freedies also known as lies because in those days

27
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:49,100
He was a regular and irregular regular at that show by the way the puzzling evidence show actually predates our slack having

28
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,160
started in

29
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,160
1982 although I was

30
00:02:53,380 --> 00:03:01,720
there for the first two episodes of it and maybe someday we'll play those in the future friends in the far future and

31
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:08,460
Speaking of which near the end of this show is a lecture about the current so-called

32
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,500
modern man delivered by a

33
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,000
future man homo correctus the overman of the future

34
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,620
Don't ask me how we got that recording

35
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:23,160
the guy talking on it sounds like

36
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:29,600
Me as a teenager anyway onward and upward we go into the deep past with

37
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,260
1990s hour of slack number

38
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,060

I'm after you now.

62
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,360
Poor Bob.

63
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,640
I almost felt sorry for him.

64
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:40,620
Almost.

65
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:46,860
And these days, Bob has grown accustomed to a very different lifestyle.

66
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,160
Oh, no, no!

67
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:51,280
Please, God, help me!

68
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:14,300
Oh, no, no!

69
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,600
Please, God, help me!

70
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:33,440
Oh, yes, dear friends.

71
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,100
Welcome back to the Hour of Slack.

72
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,460
This is a special, special broadcast tonight.

73
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:50,320
I have a lot of feeling in my heart because this is our five-year anniversary.

74
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,140
Five years, dear friends, this show.

75
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,960
Hour of Slack number 257.

76
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:05,640
Marks the fifth year of the word of Bob reaching out across the airwaves.

77
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:14,880
Reaching out for those subgeniuses and those slackless ones who need the slack that Bob can give.

78
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,880
So, we've tried to put together a special show.

79
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,840
Uh...

80
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:29,380
One that will bless your heart and bring you closer to the dogma and the doctrine of Bob's church.

81
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,360
The church of the subgenius.

82
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:36,160
I hope it'll help you to understand Bob better.

83
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,200
To understand his...

84
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:39,980
Your fellow...

85
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:41,580
Members.

86
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,160
And yourself.

87
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,600
Praise Bob.

88
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,220
Oh, no!

89
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,460
She kept saying over and over and over again, it's wonderful, wonderful.

90
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,740
And she said as fast as she could, wonderful.

91
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,700
This is wonderful.

92
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:06,420
This is wonderful.

93
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:11,060
Everything that happens to you, every second of every minute of every hour of every day,

94
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,460
remember silently to name it wonderful.

95
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,440
This is wonderful.

96
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:22,120
And whatever you name, anything in your life, you want it to come for you.

97
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
Ah-hoo!

98
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,180
Are we ready for our time travel experiment?

99
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,800
Then set the chronons for Nexus 3.

100
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,960
Okay, the code is I love pretty words.

101
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,280
I love pretty words.

102
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,100
I love pretty words.

103
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,760
I love pretty words.

104
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:45,600
Now, as you can see, off in the distance, leaving space for it.

105
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,280
I love pretty words.

106
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,260
Boing oing oing oing oing oing.

107
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:51,300
Boing oing oing oing oing oing.

108
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,260
Boing oing oing oing oing oing oing.

109
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,520
Boing oing oing oing oing oing oing.

110
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,320
And so history was made, or rather unmade, as they went back in time.

111
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:11,180
Past the fighting minute man, past the armored knight, past the Roman warrior,

112
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,800
to this prehistoric site.

113
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,120
Hi, how are you doing?

114
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:21,480
But we overshot our mark and we went zillions of years into the past, into the area of nothingness and chaos

115
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,540
that existed before the universe.

116
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,840
The primordial vacuum cleaner.

117
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,860
The dust balls of space.

118
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,720
Millions of miles across.

119
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,800
Gigantic hairballs.

120
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,940
And lint filled the cosmos.

121
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,100
Nel SSD's.

122
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,240
A

123
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,260
the

124
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,060
the

125
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,040
Lord God of hosts, Hosanna in the highest.

126
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,160
In your super band, good God.

127
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:35,240
Having a night, here's the popcorn.

128
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,620
Lord of mercy, God of mercy.

129
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,800
Lord of mercy, God of mercy.

130
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:47,820
Christ of mercy, Christ of mercy.

131
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:49,860
Christ of mercy.

132
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:51,780
Christ of mercy.

133
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,360
Christ of mercy.

134
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:53,740
Christ of God.

135
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:55,960
Christ of risen.

136
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,020
Christ, he gonna come back.

137
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,260
Right on time.

138
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:00,640
Ha!

139
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,220
I ain't worried.

140
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,240
You can get under my roof.

141
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,760
So give it up.

142
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:07,520
I turn it up.

143
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,280
Ha!

144
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,580
Like my God, who take away the sins of the world.

145
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:12,600
Have mercy.

146
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,740
Like my God, who take away the sins of the world.

147
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,540
Man of peace.

148
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,160
Ha!

149
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,380
He's super bad.

150
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,680
Ha!

151
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,040
Good God.

152
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:22,980
Ha!

153
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:24,460
Ha!

154
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,620
He's super bad.

155
00:10:28,340 --> 00:10:29,860
Super, super, super bad.

156
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,180
Oh my God, I'm hot inside.

157
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,820
So have a little faith in me.

158
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,160
And I depend on my sins, my baby.

159
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:39,060
Oh, me, nah, yeah.

160
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:40,580
Huh!

161
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,980
If you funky down there.

162
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,080
Oh!

163
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:46,800
Ha!

164
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,600
Y'all be with you.

165
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:50,420
Yes, you do.

166
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:52,920
Y'all be with you.

Ha!

169
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,060
Make God bless you.

170
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,760
Yes, you do.

171
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,120
Make God bless you.

172
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,980
Yes, you do.

173
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:04,460
Please.

174
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,040
Get fly.

175
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,020
Oh, get fly.

176
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:08,700

Ha!

178
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,340
God, the Holy Spirit.

179
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:11,700
Praise God.

180
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:12,740
Huh!

181
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,000
He's good God.

Praise God.

183
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,820
Good God.

184
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:16,760
Praise God.

185
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:17,420
Mass has ended.

186
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,680
Praise God.

187
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,400
Go in peace.

188
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,520
He's turning you into God.

189
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,480
Praise Jesus Christ!

190
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:32,580
Praise God!

191
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,880
He's going to word you in heaven.

192
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:36,880


193
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:36,880


194
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,180
Welcome back Mass 沒有inctions.

195
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,060


196
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,060


197
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,060


198
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:38,400
Rejoice!

199
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,400


200
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,400


201
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,400


202
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:38,400


203
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:38,680
He is plain He is the end.

204
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:39,680
That words that God i we have today asks that you ask had not bez assez articulate the daunciación

205
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,320
me Where the heps have placementism made it cielo.

206
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,300
Their kept on going through a stuffy smile there, there's, there has been no focus in you, there hasn't been a focus on dem 2016 but at once theO'FellaOnClimx comes from Saursky Bay.

207
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,800
Down in my wallet where I keep my gold

208
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,700
A diamond in my house is after my soul

209
00:11:56,700 --> 00:12:00,600
A smiling creek, a Dallas hat

210
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:04,660
He claims to deliver me eternal slack

211
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:10,820
Eternal slack, eternal slack, eternal slack

212
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:15,000
He's got a little snack for a honey in the car

213
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,960
A big deal up in the downtown bar

214
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,760
It's tight up, it can't go far

215
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,940
I don't even know what sex it are

216
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:31,020
I'll send my money across the sea

217
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:34,820
To a land called the land where I want to be

218
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,740
And all I know is I'm a man

219
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:42,780
When Bob Dobb takes my cash and I'm free

220
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,980
When Bob Dobb takes my cash and I'm free

221
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:44,980


222
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,500
My cash from me

223
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:50,040
I say, no

224
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,200
Wonderful, dear friends

225
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,280
What that man Bob can do for you

226
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,780
Ah, yes

227
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:01,000
This is one of those good old times

228
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,200
Of genius gospel shows

229
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:08,460
I'm sure just brimming over with the spirit

230
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,740
I don't even care if you are

231
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,660
That's how in the spirit I am

232
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,620
I don't even care

233
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,400
But we do it because of love, dear friends

234
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:30,660
Oh, praise Bobbie

235
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,180
You're welcome

236
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,340
Bob would be for the job

237
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,680
Forgetting your iPhone

238
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,520
Andphone

239
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:14,980
Ahn Someone on

240
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:14,980


241
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:25,960
It's like I'm part of this massive conspiracy to lure unsuspecting people into spending all their money on image-enhancing products that in reality they little need nor ill can afford.

242
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:33,240
The strange thing is, the more guilty I feel about this situation, the better my work is.

243
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:36,940
My delivery has improved tenfold since the Iraqi crisis.

244
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,540
I work four or five times a week.

245
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,560
I've even upped my rates.

246
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,180
Just think what would happen in the event of an all-out war.

247
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:50,060
Thinking about it almost makes it worth thinking about.

248
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:57,300
But as good as I get at my work, I'll still be only a mouthpiece, a conduit for someone else's concepts,

249
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:05,020
a faceless spokesman for companies who want you to believe their advertising campaigns only a little bit more than they want to believe in them themselves.

250
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,720
Now what do you think?

251
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,240
Am I cutting my own throat here?

252
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:18,280
Biting the hands that feed me by verbalizing these thoughts on a demo line, an audio billboard for the commodity that I have become?

253
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,560
I don't know.

254
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,180
I can't answer that.

255
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,580
But I do know this.

256
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:32,140
This country has a long and proud tradition of lying to its own people to serve its own best interests.

257
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,660
And advertising is only one small part of that conspiracy.

258
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,520
Regardless of what I may have told you over the radio,

259
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,360
nothing you can buy,

260
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:41,900
or even sell,

261
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,960
will make you a better person.

262
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,720
A happier person.

263
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,680
A more spiritually connected person.

264
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:52,280
Can provide you with the things in life that are truly important to the soul.

265
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,200
There are things that can never be turned into commodities and marketed.

266
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,160
And these things must be searched for within each of us individually.

267
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,840
Our future as a country is built upon lies and deception.

268
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:11,540
And if you don't think that you're only three paychecks away from that disgusting bum you just passed on this planet,

269
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:11,540


270
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:14,820
then you too are part of that deception.

271
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,600
No matter how much money you have,

272
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:23,480
the sad fact remains that regardless of what color Porsche, or BMW, or Lamborghini you have,

273
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,880
you will never be one of George Bush's rich friends.

274
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,320
George Bush does not want you to be his friend.

275
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:36,060
George Bush does not care enough about you to even dislike you.

276
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:40,480
You cannot afford to buy your way into his country club.

277
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,280
It does not matter if you're a slave in the fields,

278
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,160
or a slave in the office,

279
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,080
or a slave in the big house on the hill.

280
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,460
You're still a slave, and at best, a middle management slave,

281
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:57,960
prodding and whipping and abusing those beneath you in a desperate fervor,

282
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,380
praying that you will suddenly find yourself a part of that inner circle.

283
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,860
Believe me, you will be dead long before you get close to that inner circle.

284
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,560
And you will be replaced the very next day

285
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:17,600
by yet another well-groomed, well-oiled, eager, well-meaning, brown-nosing slave.

286
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,420
This year's model.

287
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,380
Recently, we observed the imploding of communism in Eastern Europe.

288
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,540
Now what do you think brought all that about?

289
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,060
Was it because the communist system was flawed,

290
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,500
and doomed to collapse from its very inception?

291
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,100
No.

292
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,040
I don't think so.

293
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:45,980
I think it was because of the ineffective, greedy, myopic, and insensitive bureaucrats

294
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:48,900
who were charged with the responsibility of keeping the machine running.

295
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,300
Interesting parallel, don't you think?

296
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:58,880
They're not all that different from the ineffective, greedy, myopic, and insensitive bureaucrats

297
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,260
charged with the responsibility of keeping our machine running.

298
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,300
But rather than choose to evict them, as was the case in Russia,

299
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:10,260
all too often, we choose to emulate them.

300
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:16,400
To ape their postures, their uniforms, their speech patterns and phraseology.

301
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,960
But remember what I said.

302
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:24,080
George Bush and his rich friends do not need you in their country club.

303
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:28,480
Stop acting like you're next on the docket, because you aren't.

304
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:32,500
Stop acting like everything is all right, because it isn't.

305
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,300
Nothing is all right.

306
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,320
And if you can look around you at the state of this country,

307
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,900
and not secretly admit to yourself that our system is just as vulnerable as theirs,

308
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:44,620
and that their dominoes just happen to fall first,

309
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,080
then either you're truly one of George Bush's rich friends,

310
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,880
or else you're truly... ignorant.

311
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:55,020
And all I know is that George Bush's rich friends

312
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:58,780
probably would not be calling this number to hear my demo line.

313
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,720
It's the top 3% who really call the shots in this corporate fiefdom

314
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,860
we lovingly sing to in all of those patriotic songs.

315
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,080
If you're fortunate enough to be working right now,

316
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,220
remember, you're working at least three of those days

317
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,340
to pay off your accrued interest charges,

318
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:20,660
and to help fund a government that can't even help you feel safe

319
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:23,960
as you stand in line to cash what's left of your paycheck.

320
00:19:25,340 --> 00:19:28,760
That 3% at the top, the real inner circle,

321
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:30,900
is bleeding you dry.

322
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,320
It's bleeding this country dry,

323
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:36,140
not to mention what's left of this planet.

324
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,240
And as we trip over each other in our rush to emulate our leaders,

325
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,700
we wallow like pigs in the waste of our abundance,

326
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,420
oblivious to our inevitable slaughter.

327
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,920
And why do we continue to do this?

328
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:56,600
Why do we continue to remain on this treadmill to oblivion?

329
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,740
Why can't we live?

330
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,120
Why can't we learn from our collective histories?

331
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:05,700
And how can I give so freely of my talents and my art

332
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:08,400
to the continued perpetration of this hoax?

333
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,660
I don't know.

334
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,280
I can't answer that.

335
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:19,860
Freedom without structure is anarchy.

336
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:24,620
Structure without freedom is fascism.

337
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,020
What are you?

338
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,660
An anarchist?

339
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,760
Or a fascist?

340
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:37,660
You cannot afford the initiation fee to George Bush's country club.

341
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:43,460
Remember, capitalism is not democracy.

342
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,620
Convenience is not freedom.

343
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:52,480
And the government is not your friend.

344
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:57,000
Thank you for calling The Voice Line.

345
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,620
Yeah.

346
00:20:58,060 --> 00:20:59,980
That was Joe Paulino, dear friends.

347
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,180
Reverend Joe Paulino.

348
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,520
Isn't this a funny show?

349
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:05,120
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

350
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,160
We don't know where it came from.

351
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,480
We can't imagine where it came from.

352
00:21:11,140 --> 00:21:12,800
We don't know where it came from.

353
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,460
We can't imagine where it came from.

354
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,380
Bob.

355
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:16,240
Bob.

356
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:17,320
Bob.

357
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,280
Bob.

358
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:18,680
Bob.

359
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,000
Bob.

360
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:19,440
Bob.

361
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:22,560
Yeah, so that's why we're on the air.

362
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:23,060
That's right.

363
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:26,980
We've got to be on the air because within about seven or eight, well, I'd say maybe

364
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:26,980


365
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:32,760
ten years, most of the human race is going to be dead anyway of AIDS because it's geometrically

366
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,200
increasing.

367
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:37,680
Look, we sincerely hope that once you see what the gods have in store for you by the

368
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:43,320
way of retribution, tribulation, plague, punishment, and plight, you'll realize just how badly you

369
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,660
need powerful friends and benign protectors like us.

370
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,700
You may scoff and ridicule this show right now, but the day will come when the stockpiled

371
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,780
calamities will all be unleashed on you.

372
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,380
Hey, this is Prophecy Standby.

373
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:56,960
Miniature big feet that run on the ground.

374
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:00,940
They run around slashing your ankles with poison razor blades, the frozen nitric acid

375
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:07,420
hail, volcanoes that belch nerve gas and hallucinogenic dust clouds that will engulf millions at a

376
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,840
time.

377
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:13,220
Rogue planets will pull into new solar orbits and disrupt the rotation of the Earth.

378
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:17,680
Some days will be a week long, others no more than a few hours.

379
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,380
Things will fall up.

380
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:25,080
Great skyscrapers filled with horrified screaming people will wrench themselves from their foundations

381
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,300
and fly skyward.

382
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:26,940
Pass the time.

383
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:26,940


384
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:27,540
Pass the atmosphere.

385
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:28,640
And out into space.

386
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:32,640
Shopping malls will sink into the ground and never be seen again.

387
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:39,020
Thousands of comets will burn the moon until it shatters and covers the ground with carcinogenic,

388
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:40,760
dreadful-smelling grit.

389
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:43,580
Nothing will matter anymore.

390
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:44,920
It's okay, Palmer.

391
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,400
We're suffering here.

392
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,080
I just want to make a couple of points.

393
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:52,740
You see, we've got audio of immune deficiency syndrome here.

394
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,060
Yeah, we'll just clean off the microphone and start all over again here.

395
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,940
There's a possibility that there are new problems.

396
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:56,940


397
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:56,940


398
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:56,940


399
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:56,940


400
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:56,940


401
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:56,940


402
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,220
There's a possibility that there are new bacteria, biological, and viral strains that

403
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:02,100
are being tried on the human race by the Mother Earth Nature Complex.

404
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:02,880
The human race?

405
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,700
I mean, see, you're talking about things that don't really seem to matter, I think.

406
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,260
These are minor matters in the scope of things.

407
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,100
I mean, Dobbs' prophecies laid out what's going to happen in health, industrial, bad

408
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:12,780
things like that.

409
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,400
See, we've got the cases here.

410
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:19,940
And when you talk about this many people have the disease, or that many people working

411
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:23,140
in the geological spectrums that are needed to push technology.

412
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:26,520
Look, look, the sickness is actually a critical point that will be reached sometime around

413
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,620
1988 or so when all the available things...

414
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:32,620
Yes, all the available soldiers will be fighting for dogs.

415
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,860
...mainstream population, AIDS patients will have been exhausted if the train...

416
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,600
Yeah, but by that date, every single subgenius will have his own radio show, including you,

417
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:45,780
and, I mean, so we'll all be broadcasting this news at that time and understanding it

418
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:45,860
with...

419
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:51,160
Okay, what year is the mutant revolution headed off when Charles Manson discovers

420
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:56,000
the secret Death Valley entrance to Hollow Earth and leads all the exiled misfit Nazi

421
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,500
hell-creating people to the Hell Valley?

422
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:56,500


423
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:56,500


424
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:56,500


425
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:09,060
Derek Stanovski is saying something about is mixed into his own mites as he's

426
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,160
talking.

427
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:14,160
What are the hearts of the킨ne media?

428
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:15,420
Hurtiness is the backbone of this entire day of great workout content and activity,

429
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:15,440
such as giving lectures.

430
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:15,500
It's indeed the biggest advantage in human life, is really the freedom to...

431
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,840
Which has to be done.

432
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:16,840


433
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,580
You know, it's so...

434
00:24:17,580 --> 00:24:17,920
Hurtiness...

435
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,540
Hurtiness...

436
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:18,580
Hurtiness...

437
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:23,020
that whosoever is angry with his brother without cause

438
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,920
shall be in danger of the judgment?

439
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,240
Ye have heard?

440
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:32,220
And hath considered my life or mine to have hurt you?

441
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,360
But I say unto you that ye resist not either,

442
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:42,380
but whosoever shall spite thee on thy right cheek,

443
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:46,040
turn to him the other also.

444
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,440
So ye have heard that it hath been said,

445
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:52,780
Thou shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine enemies.

446
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,480
But I say unto you,

447
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,540
Liar!

448
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,380
Laugh them not,

449
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,700
for she do good to them that hate you,

450
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:04,860
and pray for them which despite for you is your own person.

451
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,100
Amen.

452
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,320
Amen.

453
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:13,900
My gosh, this is absolute biologic.

454
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,140
This is biologic.

455
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:15,880
Suicide.

456
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:16,660
This is madness.

457
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,800
No, it's just ridiculous.

458
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,020
Love your enemy.

459
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,640
It isn't easy to love an enemy.

460
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:32,540
This goes against your most basic survival instinct.

461
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,480
But it can be done and turned to an advantage.

462
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:44,040
Let the love squirt out of you like a fire hose of molasses.

463
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:45,940
Give him the kiss of love.

464
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,140
Stick your tongue down his throat,

465
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,620
taste what he's been eating,

466
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,880
and bless his digestion.

467
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:56,620
Ooooze down into his intestines and help him along with his food.

468
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,760
Life in all its rich variety.

469
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:01,580
Do not falter.

470
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,220
Let your love enter in unto him and penetrate him with a divine lubricant.

471
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,460
Makes KY and Leland feel like sandpaper.

472
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:14,360
It's the most eucelogenous, the slimiest.

473
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,260
Ooooze!

474
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:17,740
as lubricant ever was or shall be. Amen.

475
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,580
Bob.

476
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,440
Bob.

477
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:22,660
Bob.

478
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,280
Bob.

479
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:23,960
Bob.

480
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:24,180
Bob.

481
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:24,540
Bob.

482
00:26:24,780 --> 00:26:28,220
He is the one true innocent.

483
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,860
He's so dumb that he doesn't know good from evil.

484
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,000
To him, he might walk a little old lady across the street

485
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,900
and then might turn around and do sex tortures on her for three weeks,

486
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,840
keeping her clinging to life and then make a sandwich out of her face.

487
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,380
To him, it's all the same.

488
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,560
And if we were to be as truly innocent as Bob,

489
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,300
we could do that too.

490
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,700
Isn't that sick?

491
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,200
See, right now, it doesn't happen as bad as sticking a needle into your vein.

492
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,500
You see, you don't click your glasses and you don't make a touch.

493
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,580
All you do, you suck on a little reaper,

494
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,360
you jump in a book and pass it on to the next person.

495
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,780
The buzz comes real fast and there's no hangover.

496
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,100
You just light it up like you do a chest of feel.

497
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,020
You inhale a sweet smell of spook.

498
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,380
You exhale it out of your mouth.

499
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:33,600
That's all there is to it.

500
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,000
It's like an atomic bomb.

501
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,180
That's all there is to it.

502
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,580
Things are more messed up than you ever dreamed.

503
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:48,460
Like, what is it all is now?

504
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,860
The priorities are all screwy.

505
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,800
Your running of your hair looks okay

506
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:57,160
while some new kind of bladder cancer is bursting out in front of your designer jeans.

507
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:58,880
Yes, this is bad talk.

508
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:00,860
Nobody will listen to anything else.

509
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:05,080
You won't look at TV unless body parts are cars are chipping or crashing on it.

510
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:08,780
You won't pass your food unless it has some nerve drug in it.

511
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,640
You haven't used your other senses since you were five.

512
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:14,180
And you sure as hell won't stop what you're doing.

513
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:21,460
Until someone much bigger, much stronger, and much, much more selfish makes you stop.

514
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,320
And you'll thank him for it.

515
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,320
And then just before you fry in a flash of radioactive hindsight,

516
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:31,060
you'll realize that he stopped you from doing the wrong thing.

517
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:32,420
Good God!

518
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,760
What in the name of sweet screaming Jesus is this world coming to?

519
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,140
People bitch. People gripe.

520
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,860
This is a sign of the end times.

521
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,420
That's a sign of the end times.

522
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:43,920
When you should all be hard.

523
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:46,860
It's all a sign of the end times.

524
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,180
Millions are gonna be going.

525
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,680
And they're gonna leave this earth.

526
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,820
And they're gonna leave their unlawful life.

527
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:57,460
Lost loved ones behind.

528
00:28:57,760 --> 00:28:58,580
Did I say that?

529
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:02,900
Did you hear what he was saying?

530
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,440
Did you hear what he was saying?

531
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:11,120
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

532
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,140
Perhaps.

533
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,360
In the form of an atomic holocaust.

534
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:19,080
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand.

535
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,740
The End

536
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,500
The End

537
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,680
The End

538
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:36,760
The End

539
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:36,800
The End

540
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:37,140
The End

541
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:39,000
The End

542
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:39,000


543
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,140
The End

544
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:58,420
The End The End The End The End The End

545
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,440
The End The End The End The End The End The End The End The End

546
00:29:59,440 --> 00:29:59,440


547
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,520
Just another sub-genie caller.

548
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,620
Just another phone bomb.

549
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,600
Just another sub-genius.

550
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:07,020
What can I say?

551
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:08,520
Bob is fill in the blank.

552
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,740
Bob is keep in the blank.

553
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:13,940
Well, me. Thank you. More or less.

554
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,000
And who's going to do that? Pass them to this garbage. It's delicious.

555
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:20,440
What was that?

556
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:23,560
I don't know.

557
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:27,260
But how many of you are really, genuinely intelligent?

558
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:28,700
Bang.

559
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,800
Are you blaming God for atom bombs?

560
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:35,620
God for atom bombs? Atomic warheads?

561
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,500
All over the country. Every morning.

562
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,520
Past, blotted out. In the future. For sure.

563
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:41,920
Yeah, that's what I want.

564
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:43,500
Ah, yes.

565
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,280
Yes, you do.

566
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,060
20 years ago, I warned of it. 20 years ago, I loved it.

567
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:50,940
You'll listen in amazement as we take this one joke and keep blowing it up.

568
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,040
Bigger and bigger.

569
00:30:52,700 --> 00:31:00,520
And the only reason we're pumping so much behind this one joke is that we want to see how big it gets before it explodes.

570
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:13,560
It was at this point that the hypnotist made the decision to take his subject over the hump.

571
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,460
Buses, cars, and trains, and crafts. Wives and husbands and babies will disappear.

572
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:28,140
Of course, your government and all governments, they'll be, you know, trying to fish tail out of it.

573
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:36,900
They'll give you all kinds of excuses. You know, they'll hide the reality under UFOs or extraterrestrial invasion or astral projection or God only knows what.

574
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:37,780
But Bob...

575
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:41,520
I'm trying to put it under the rug, but I'm warning you of your misdemeanor.

576
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:47,200
It was Bob all along, dear friend.

577
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,260
And they tricked you.

578
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:53,040
And they'll trick you every time they creep up on you.

579
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,560
They're gonna creep through Winky's stew and they'll get you.

580
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,440
So we're all gonna watch out, aren't we?

581
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,680
Yes.

582
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,620
And this is your prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

583
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,880
We're gonna continue.

584
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:07,740
We're gonna continue with, uh...

585
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,260
Well, some of...

586
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,120
A little bit of what we have been playing and a little bit of new.

587
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:17,100
What we have been playing have been William Burroughs.

588
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,320
And, uh...

589
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,600
That's the old guy talking.

590
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:35,440
And the KPFA subgenius show tapes, by puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, Gary Gaborog-Fran, Mr. Exotic.

591
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,840
And, uh...

592
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,180
In this case, lies!

593
00:32:39,020 --> 00:32:39,860
Lies!

594
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:55,920
Apocalypse.

595
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:35,440


596
00:33:35,440 --> 00:34:05,440


597
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,440


598
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,500
relegated to folklore.

599
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:13,860
But art is spilling out of its frames

600
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,860
into subway graffiti.

601
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,340
Will it stop there?

602
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:22,440
Consider an apocalyptic statement.

603
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,560
Nothing is true, everything is permitted.

604
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:30,240
Hassan E. Saba, the old man of the mountain.

605
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:34,300
Not to be interpreted as an invitation

606
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,540
to all manner of unrestrained and destructive behavior,

607
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:41,600
that would be a minor episode,

608
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,800
which would run its course.

609
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:48,920
Everything is permitted because nothing is true.

610
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:54,960
It is all make-believe, illusion, dream, art.

611
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:58,680
When art leaves the frame

612
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:01,500
and the written word leaves the page,

613
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,280
not merely the art,

614
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:04,280


615
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,980
not only the physical frame and page,

616
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:09,700
but the frames and pages of assigned categories.

617
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:15,260
A basic disruption of reality itself occurs.

618
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,440
The literal realization of art.

619
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,540
Success will write apocalypse across the sky.

620
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,860
The artist aims for a miracle.

621
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:32,200
The painter wills his pictures

622
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,220
to move off the canvas,

623
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,620
with a separate life.

624
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,780
Movement outside of the picture.

625
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:42,380
And one rent in the fabric

626
00:35:42,380 --> 00:35:46,320
is all it takes for pandemonium to sluice through.

627
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:49,920
Last act.

628
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:51,320
The end.

629
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,500
This is where we all came in.

630
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,760
The final apocalypse

631
00:35:56,760 --> 00:36:00,820
is when every man sees what he sees,

632
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,600
feels what he feels,

633
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,080
hears,

634
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,240
hears what he hears.

635
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:10,080
The creatures of all your dreams and nightmares

636
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,580
are right here, right now,

637
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,160
solid as they ever were or ever will be.

638
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,500
The electric vitality of careening subways,

639
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,800
faster, faster, faster,

640
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,400
stations flash by in a blur.

641
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:29,400
Ten god of panic whips screaming crowds

642
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:33,220
as millions of faces look up at the torn sky.

643
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,820
Off the track, off the track.

644
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:42,440
The planet is pulling loose from its moorings,

645
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:44,140
careening into space,

646
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,700
spilling cities and mountains and seas into the void.

647
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:51,360
Spinning faster and faster,

648
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,440
days and nights flash by like subway stations.

649
00:36:56,660 --> 00:37:01,020
Tunnels crunch down teeth of concrete and steel,

650
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:04,280
flattening cars like beer cans.

651
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,280


652
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,280


653
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,280


654
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,280


655
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,280


656
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:04,280


657
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:08,800
Graffiti through glass and steel like acid

658
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:13,440
races across the sky and tornadoes are playing in colors.

659
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:19,080
Cherry pickers with satin brushes pick as a door

660
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,220
inch through Wall Street,

661
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:25,980
leaving a vast souvenir postcard of the Grand Canyon.

662
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,360
Water trucks slosh out paint.

663
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,860
Outlaw painters armed with paint pistols

664
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:39,160
paint everything and everyone in reach.

665
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:44,760
Survival artists paint cans strapped to their backs,

666
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,780
grenades up their belts,

667
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:50,820
paint anything and anybody within range.

668
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:57,500
Sky riders, dog fight collide and explode.

669
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,340
Telephone poles dance,

670
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:01,340


671
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,900
electric jigs in swirling crackling wire.

672
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:10,600
Neon explosions and tornadoes flash through ruined cities.

673
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:14,240
Volcanoes spew molten colors

674
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,860
as the earth's crust buckles and splinters into jigsaw pieces.

675
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,960
Household appliances revolt.

676
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:28,780
Washing machines snatch clothes from the guests.

677
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:34,440
Bellowing hoovers suck off makeup and wigs and false teeth.

678
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:38,660
Electric toothbrushes leap into screaming mouths.

679
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,260
Clothes dryers turn gardens into dust bowls.

680
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:49,920
Garden tools whizz through long parties impaling the guests

681
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:55,320
who are hacked to fertilizer by industrious Japanese hacks.

682
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:58,700
Loads of misshapen boats,

683
00:38:58,700 --> 00:39:01,020
bulbous plants spring from their bones.

684
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:03,820
Covering golf courses,

685
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:05,000
swimming pools,

686
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,520
country clubs,

687
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,540
and tasteful dwellings.

688
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:14,020
At my back,

689
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,440
faster and faster,

690
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,760
I always hear,

691
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,840
hurry up,

692
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:20,340
energy ground down into,

693
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,780
please it's time closing.

694
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,180
Sidewalks and streets,

695
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,460
by billions of feet and tires,

696
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,980
erupt the manholes and tunnels.

697
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,080
Break out with volcanic force.

698
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,960
Let it come down,

699
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,620
careening subways.

700
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,040
Faster and faster,

701
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,380
stations blur by.

702
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:46,320
Fan-whipped screaming crowds with flaming pipes.

703
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:50,980
Millions of faces look up at the torn sky.

704
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,920
Off the track,

705
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:55,480
off the track,

706
00:39:55,480 --> 00:39:59,280
the planet is pulling loose from its moorings,

707
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,380
careening off into space,

708
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:06,300
spilling cities and mountains and seas into the void.

709
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,940
Faster and faster.

710
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:16,760
Skyscrapers scrape rints of blue and white paint from the sky.

711
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,700
The rivers swirl with color.

712
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:23,820
Nightless ochres and reds

713
00:40:23,820 --> 00:40:25,560
leap through the bridges,

714
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,560
falling into the rivers,

715
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:34,640
splashing colors across warehouses and piers and roads and buildings.

716
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:39,720
Amok art floods in organic mold,

717
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:43,360
stirring passions of metal and glass.

718
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,840
Steel girders rising in mineral,

719
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,900
dispersed from their concrete covers.

720
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:58,380
Walls of glass melt and burn with madness in a pig and prey's eyes.

721
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:03,120
Bridges buck cars and trucks into the rivers.

722
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,440
The sidewalks run ahead.

723
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,020
Faster and faster.

724
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:14,740
Energy ground down into sidewalks and streets by billions of feet and tires.

725
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,020
Erupts the manholes and tunnels.

726
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,000
The wall breaks out with volcanic force.

727
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:25,540
Let it come down.

728
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,660
Caught in New York beneath the animals of the village,

729
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:35,800
the piker pulls you down from the sky.

730
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:38,480
How's that drink of some, you know?

731
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:44,620
I don't know.

732
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:47,840
They want to fuck kill me.

733
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:51,460
I want to die for God.

734
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:56,820
I want to die in a holy hole and thrill

735
00:41:56,820 --> 00:42:00,100
the bank boys and the normals.

736
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:04,960
If we have to, if we have to,

737
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:07,200
fucking make them die.

738
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:11,980
And we'll all come back over men.

739
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,380
We'll all come back over men.

740
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,260
We'll all come back over men.

741
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,460
Or nobody will know why.

742
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,820
See, we've got another kid.

743
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:30,320
Praise Bob.

744
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,420
Fill me, Bob.

745
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:35,320
I want to die for God.

746
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:41,220
I want to die in a holy hole and thrill

747
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:44,620
the bank boys and the normals.

748
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,140
If we have to, if we have to,

749
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:50,560
we can make them die.

750
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:54,320
And we'll all come back over men.

751
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:58,380
We'll all come out over men.

752
00:42:58,440 --> 00:43:01,740
If we don't come out over men,

753
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,320
there ain't no reason why.

754
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:08,320
All times, gizms, they will fall

755
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,480
beneath our laser blades.

756
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:15,660
And we'll all come back over men.

757
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:19,120
We'll all come back over men.

758
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:22,540
We'll all come back over men.

759
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,560
In victory parades.

760
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,380
Has this ever happened to you?

761
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,920
Why, I should have been there, Ted.

762
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,820
It was great.

763
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,980
There was free booze, great music,

764
00:43:33,980 --> 00:43:35,960
one of the best parties I ever went to.

765
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,540
Where were you that night?

766
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,660
I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.

767
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,540
I guess I should have gone, huh?

768
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,120
Didn't you feel stupid?

769
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,140
Didn't you wish you could go back to that night,

770
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:45,960
that party?

771
00:43:46,100 --> 00:43:48,020
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn

772
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,280
how to do that very thing.

773
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,460
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control.

774
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:53,380
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time,

775
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:54,280
slow time,

776
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,860
and make time run backwards.

777
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:59,180
But most importantly,

778
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,840
you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

779
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:03,100
How, you may ask?

780
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,620
Well, just ask this man here,

781
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,360
an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

782
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,880
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck.

783
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:10,620
Blango.

784
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:11,840
My dog was dead.

785
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:13,720
Was I sad till I met Bob.

786
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,680
Bob showed me how I could go back,

787
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,380
get the registration number for the car,

788
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:18,840
do a slip job on the brakes,

789
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:19,860
and wouldn't you know it,

790
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:21,340
that truck went off into a ditch

791
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,200
and burst into flames just exactly a block

792
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,260
before he could hit old Booger.

793
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,020
Ain't that right, fella?

794
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:28,100
Yes, just imagine the horrible things

795
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,500
that could be undone tomorrow

796
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:32,500
if you had only gone to Bob's School of Time Control today.

797
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:33,920
Courses start yesterday,

798
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:35,520
but you can catch up.

799
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,800
Just right.

800
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,040
Bob's School of Time Control,

801
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:38,760
the universe.

802
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:39,800
Bob's School of Time Control,

803
00:44:39,900 --> 00:44:41,140
a division of Subgenius Industries Unlimited.

804
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:46,560
I recognized it,

805
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,680
and it was laughing at me

806
00:44:48,680 --> 00:44:51,380
from within the anti-virgins' unhallowed womb.

807
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:54,360
I felt rage and fear inside of me,

808
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,500
and the voices of the archangels,

809
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,380
broadcast from their secret staging base

810
00:44:58,380 --> 00:44:59,340
in the hallowed earth,

811
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,760
raged in my head.

812
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:02,480
By the time Satan's hall was opened,

813
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,600
the whore had finished her meal.

814
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:05,900
I had decided on my course of action.

815
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,060
I followed her home.

816
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,840
She lived in one of those bland,

817
00:45:10,060 --> 00:45:10,800
pasteurized,

818
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,240
suburban mushroom colonies

819
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:14,000
the conspiracy-controlled lies

820
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,300
of the television and radio

821
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,180
have conditioned the cows to want.

822
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,100
Let them numb the mind

823
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,100
with useless consumer goods and luxuries.

824
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:22,860
Let the cows sate themselves

825
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,500
on split-level ranches,

826
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,940
wall-to-wall shag,

827
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:26,800
microwaves,

828
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,440
jacuzzis,

829
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,240
food processors,

830
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,500
and remote-controlled VCRs.

831
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,540
They have pulled the wool

832
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:32,480
over their own eyes.

833
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:35,060
Blinding themselves of animal comfort,

834
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:37,220
ignoring the signs traced in fire,

835
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,040
ice, and blood

836
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,200
that I have come

837
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:40,740
and their time is at hand.

838
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,540
The eastern world,

839
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,640
it is exploding.

840
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:56,740
Violence flaring,

841
00:45:57,620 --> 00:45:58,720
bullets loading.

842
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,460
Heroes old enough to kill,

843
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,460
but not for vengeance.

844
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:02,840
You don't believe in voting,

845
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:04,400
you don't believe in war,

846
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,820
but what's that gun you're toting?

847
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:08,780
And even the Jordan River

848
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,680
has bodies floating.

849
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,520
But you tell me

850
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,980
over and over and over again,

851
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:17,140
my friend,

852
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,660
how you don't believe

853
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,600
we're on the eve of destruction.

854
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:30,940
Don't you understand

855
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:33,040
what I'm trying to say?

856
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:35,180
And can't you feel the fears

857
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,800
that I'm feeling today?

858
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:38,760
If the button is pushed,

859
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:40,580
there's no running away.

860
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,740
There'll be no one to save

861
00:46:42,740 --> 00:46:44,760
with the world in a grave.

862
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:47,100
Take a look around you, boy.

863
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,060
It's bound to scare you, boy.

864
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,840
And you tell me

865
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,400
over and over and over again,

866
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,640
my friend,

867
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,140
how you don't believe

868
00:46:58,940 --> 00:46:59,940
we're on the eve

869
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:01,130
of destruction.

870
00:47:05,110 --> 00:47:08,130
This is Hour of Slack

871
00:47:08,130 --> 00:47:11,750
number 9183

872
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:14,450
May 19th,

873
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:18,450
21, 989 A.D.

874
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:20,830
In the news,

875
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:23,150
increased controversy

876
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:25,250
over the skeleton and dwelling place

877
00:47:25,250 --> 00:47:28,350
or office of a mid-historic man

878
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:30,090
recently unearthed

879
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,530
by scientists in the deserts of Texas

880
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:34,310
in North Amerenid

881
00:47:34,310 --> 00:47:36,270
on Earth Farm 1.

882
00:47:36,610 --> 00:47:38,470
Due to its special qualities,

883
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:40,910
experts are engaged in heated debate

884
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:42,450
over its origins.

885
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:46,290
Whether it is merely an advanced homo sapiens,

886
00:47:46,450 --> 00:47:48,790
a hue man, that is,

887
00:47:48,930 --> 00:47:53,110
or is it one of the earliest homo correctus,

888
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:55,530
also known as the subgenius,

889
00:47:55,590 --> 00:47:59,590
the last evolutionary step before our own species,

890
00:47:59,590 --> 00:48:01,070
homo excelsior?

891
00:48:01,450 --> 00:48:04,910
Does this fossil represent the missing link

892
00:48:04,910 --> 00:48:08,590
between the lesser gravity-bound bipedal primates

893
00:48:09,150 --> 00:48:11,450
and the subgenius-descended brain race

894
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,170
which now conquers the stars?

895
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:17,210
And what of the claims by cultists and dissidents

896
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:19,430
that it is no less than the skull

897
00:48:19,430 --> 00:48:20,850
of one of the early apostles

898
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:24,170
of the historical Dobbs man form

899
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:27,110
which brought Slack to Earth Farm 1

900
00:48:27,110 --> 00:48:29,310
in the year 0 B.D.

901
00:48:29,350 --> 00:48:31,150
or as they measured time,

902
00:48:31,310 --> 00:48:32,670
the late 20th century?

903
00:48:32,810 --> 00:48:33,510
Could this be?

904
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:37,490
Most scientists concur that the skeleton

905
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:39,510
could well be that of a man

906
00:48:39,510 --> 00:48:42,030
who walked the Earth at the same time and place

907
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:43,370
as the Dobbs itself

908
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:46,110
during his last physical incarnation,

909
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,950
an unwitting pre-overman fighter

910
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:52,370
in the bitter struggle which raised homo excelsior

911
00:48:52,370 --> 00:48:54,630
from his quagmire of mortality

912
00:48:54,630 --> 00:48:55,990
and physics-bound

913
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:58,830
three-dimensional fixed-leggedness

914
00:48:58,830 --> 00:49:03,210
and into the energy-based free-thought-form heights

915
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,590
of our civilization.

916
00:49:04,990 --> 00:49:06,610
But is it necessarily?

917
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,670
Let's examine the fossil record,

918
00:49:09,930 --> 00:49:12,410
evidence which, while meager on the surface,

919
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,510
yet allows skilled experts

920
00:49:14,510 --> 00:49:18,370
to reconstruct and describe in extraordinary detail

921
00:49:18,370 --> 00:49:22,550
the life of this mysterious ancient tool-using ape.

922
00:49:23,950 --> 00:49:25,190
Of course,

923
00:49:25,190 --> 00:49:27,710
Earth Farm 1 in his time

924
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:30,230
was a much different place than it is today.

925
00:49:30,790 --> 00:49:34,530
Lavishly gifted with surging plankton-filled oceans

926
00:49:34,530 --> 00:49:37,830
and land masses abundant with plants and animals,

927
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:41,190
the home seed planet then bore little resemblance

928
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:45,330
to the blasted, atmosphere-less testing range

929
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:48,590
all too familiar to modern elementary school

930
00:49:48,590 --> 00:49:50,010
environmentologists.

931
00:49:50,410 --> 00:49:54,370
But what sort of creature dwelt in this crude office

932
00:49:54,370 --> 00:49:56,430
of 20,000 years ago?

933
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:58,050
Who was he?

934
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:01,630
What was his daily life like there on farm earth

935
00:50:01,630 --> 00:50:04,030
just before the Great Transmigration?

936
00:50:08,750 --> 00:50:12,210
Fossil fragments of his implements seen here,

937
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:16,230
supplemented by the oral records of our friends the dolphins,

938
00:50:16,490 --> 00:50:19,210
paint a picture of his primeval office.

939
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:21,910
Constructed of simple wood and metal,

940
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:25,210
yet he possessed crude computers of a sort,

941
00:50:25,410 --> 00:50:28,910
fashioned entirely from toxic plastics and metals,

942
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:31,230
powered by artificial electricity.

943
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:36,730
These early computers were sad, immobile, paralyzed boxes,

944
00:50:37,190 --> 00:50:39,850
armless and legless, mere heads,

945
00:50:40,190 --> 00:50:43,250
to be used as little more than flint hatchets.

946
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:46,090
Their users probably did not even suspect

947
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:48,370
that their computers possessed souls.

948
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:51,710
Certainly they were never used for the sexual pastimes

949
00:50:51,910 --> 00:50:52,870
we enjoy today.

950
00:50:53,910 --> 00:50:56,930
Nevertheless, their presence in this creature's hypothetical office

951
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:00,450
distinguish him as a uniquely electronic animal,

952
00:51:00,670 --> 00:51:02,030
the first of his kind.

953
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:05,690
Indeed, he was far more overhuman

954
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:08,950
than this apish reconstruction slide indicates,

955
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:12,670
as seen in slide one, which admittedly resembles

956
00:51:12,670 --> 00:51:16,810
the domesticated Eloi we breed for soul energy,

957
00:51:17,070 --> 00:51:21,670
even more so the primitive wild Eloi mocked by our children.

958
00:51:22,350 --> 00:51:22,970
The

959
00:51:24,050 --> 00:51:28,190
Homo correctus possesses the familiar uncurved spine.

960
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:31,510
He was robustly built with thick, heavy bones.

961
00:51:31,710 --> 00:51:34,650
At this stage of development, he was still better at driving

962
00:51:34,650 --> 00:51:37,690
than at communicating or maintaining peaceful relationships

963
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:40,550
with others, and not even those of his own kind.

964
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:44,050
That the skeleton was found next to the corroded parts

965
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:46,890
of a harvesting tool, then called a lawnmower,

966
00:51:47,030 --> 00:51:51,050
proves that he was still incapable of such simple telekinesis

967
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:53,810
as controlling the growth of plants by mental command.

968
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:56,230
He still had legs, of course,

969
00:51:56,270 --> 00:51:58,530
though those hideous jointed appendages,

970
00:51:58,610 --> 00:52:01,030
which are only vestigial in our race.

971
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:05,390
As seen here, the socket at which the femur connects to the pelvis,

972
00:52:05,390 --> 00:52:08,830
was farther inward than in Australopithecus, for instance.

973
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:12,790
So he was capable of walking fully erect, if he wore shoes,

974
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:16,970
but abrasion on the coccyx shows that most of the time

975
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:21,090
was actually spent sitting, perhaps because, like us,

976
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:26,510
his great weight would otherwise have crushed even his massive bones.

977
00:52:27,150 --> 00:52:32,170
The skeleton is, at first glance, typical of the humans of that time.

978
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:34,730
Note that the bones are much thicker than ours,

979
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:39,090
suggesting that the musculature of this creature had broad anchors.

980
00:52:39,670 --> 00:52:42,450
Physically, these creatures were incredibly powerful.

981
00:52:42,790 --> 00:52:46,510
One of them could easily slay 20 of us in combat.

982
00:52:46,850 --> 00:52:50,370
But were his head shielded from telepathic control by...

983
00:52:50,370 --> 00:52:51,450
Blitanium?

984
00:52:51,610 --> 00:52:55,730
But of course, to him, Blitanium was at best a dream.

985
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:03,150
You know, there hasn't been any real advances in your field.

986
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:04,630
He a game-changer!

987
00:53:11,150 --> 00:53:13,150
Youatsi brings together the sketch-alpose of yourself with a

988
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:13,150


989
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:13,150


990
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:13,150


991
00:53:13,150 --> 00:53:13,190
Harkey!

992
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:16,570
Look, this lui is chSiDdU seeds painted on his head right up his leg!

993
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:19,570
You talking to me?

994
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:23,670
How do I know that?

995
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:26,790
Here, we'll show you.

996
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:34,250
You can take this tape here and you grind up a little bit of buffalo residue.

997
00:53:34,890 --> 00:53:35,890
Yeah, I'm talking to you, you little...

998
00:53:37,090 --> 00:53:40,750
You gotta talk it down. You gotta be a man about it and talk it down.

999
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:42,350
You're the shell we're not gonna use, alright? Get back in the trash can.

1000
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:46,490
Get back! Get that razor blade quick! Get that editing tape!

1001
00:53:46,970 --> 00:53:48,010
Get that editing tape!

1002
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:51,730
So the razor blade slouch... razor blade beats tape anytime.

1003
00:53:52,090 --> 00:53:54,530
Oh yeah? Yeah! Get back in the trash can!

1004
00:53:54,950 --> 00:53:56,890
Stupid. Get in the trash can!

1005
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:06,890
The Crocodile

1006
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:15,890
No animal is half so vile as Croccywoc the crocodile.

1007
00:54:16,610 --> 00:54:17,990
On Saturdays he likes to eat.

1008
00:54:18,010 --> 00:54:20,450
He likes to crunch six juicy children for his lunch.

1009
00:54:20,570 --> 00:54:23,010
And he especially enjoys just three of each.

1010
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:24,610
Three girls, three boys.

1011
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:29,070
He smears the boys to make them hot with mustard from the mustard pot.

1012
00:54:29,210 --> 00:54:30,870
But mustard doesn't go with girls.

1013
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,950
It tastes all wrong with plaits and curls.

1014
00:54:33,250 --> 00:54:36,630
With them what goes extremely well is butterscotch and caramel.

1015
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:41,570
It's such a super marvellous treat when boys are hot and girls are sweet.

1016
00:54:41,850 --> 00:54:43,570
At least that's Croccy's point of view.

1017
00:54:43,790 --> 00:54:45,430
He ought to know. He's had a few.

1018
00:54:46,390 --> 00:54:47,330
That's all for now.

1019
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:48,330
It's time for bed.

1020
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:50,230
Lie down and rest your sleepy head.

1021
00:54:50,470 --> 00:54:51,630
Shh! Listen.

1022
00:54:52,370 --> 00:54:53,530
What is that I hear?

1023
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:55,970
Galumphing softly up the stair.

1024
00:54:56,410 --> 00:54:58,210
Go lock the door and fetch my gun.

1025
00:54:58,350 --> 00:54:59,750
Go on child, hurry, quickly run!

1026
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,970
No, stop! Stand back! He's coming in!

1027
00:55:02,330 --> 00:55:05,050
Oh, look, that greasy, greenish skin.

1028
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:07,390
The shining teeth, the greedy smile.

1029
00:55:08,170 --> 00:55:09,690
It's Croccywoc the crocodile!

1030
00:55:26,170 --> 00:55:27,570
Him?

1031
00:55:27,570 --> 00:55:34,230
Only 2,000 cubic centimeters compared to our 50,000, and the characteristic backward sloping forehead.

1032
00:55:34,910 --> 00:55:39,370
The brain of this animal was capable only of language, tool making, and speech.

1033
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:44,270
It had none of the 40 other characteristics of high thought which we take for granted today.

1034
00:55:44,730 --> 00:55:49,690
Altogether, his brain had less cells than do those of our contemporary gorilla servants,

1035
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:55,810
as certain radical upstart free gorilla gorillas never cease to remind us.

1036
00:55:55,810 --> 00:56:03,810
As every school child knows, our ancestors were able to genetically transfer the brain into the chest where it was better protected,

1037
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:08,090
while moving the gonads into the cranium where they best functioned.

1038
00:56:08,090 --> 00:56:11,810
But that happened 5,000 years after the last war.

1039
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:16,330
Compared to us then, Homo correctus was truly a monster.

1040
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:19,310
Because of his savage, savage appearance,

1041
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:25,590
primitive peoples on the outer planet still use scary tales of these creatures to frighten their children,

1042
00:56:25,810 --> 00:56:26,430
and to behave.

1043
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:32,930
But despite the quaint legends of monsters like Dob Squatch or Middle-sized Foot,

1044
00:56:33,130 --> 00:56:40,350
the idea that some pocket of these biological throwbacks might exist are, if romantic, nevertheless pure myth.

1045
00:56:41,330 --> 00:56:47,730
Yes, to us, he would look like a mutated, disgusting, violent zoo animal.

1046
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:53,990
But if we could imagine his thoughts, they would probably prove to be remarkably similar to,

1047
00:56:54,050 --> 00:56:55,790
say, those of our own forebears.

1048
00:56:55,810 --> 00:57:01,090
Three-year-olds pondering the mysteries of life, slack, and squirt.

1049
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:01,810
In what?

No, shut up, you guys.
