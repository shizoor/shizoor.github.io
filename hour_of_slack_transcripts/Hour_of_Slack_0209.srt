1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Mission sequence start, we should see fire.

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:05,820
Four, three, two, one.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:07,580
As we introduce a match to a kinder end.

4
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:09,220
We don't care whether you hear us or not.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,160
We'll just keep pretending that we're actually talking to people out there.

6
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:18,060
Yes, the funnel web megalomorph spiders, the megalomorphidae,

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,040
comprise one of the more ancient orders of the arachnids.

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,180
These spiders are divided into seven segments, or setae.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:32,400
This is Side B, Audio Digest Surgery, Volume 23, Number 13.

10
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,060
The continuation of a program on...

11
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:37,640
The Church of the Subgenius.

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,440
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

13
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:48,880
is specially designed only to be played on radio station

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,640
and only in the city of...

15
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,540
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,620
Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.

17
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,360
Slack.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,040
Hey.

19
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,360
Stop.

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:04,860
Free.

21
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,340
Here's your host, Parcenoma of the Gallbladder.

22
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,260
In general, the treatment for this disease has varied all the way

23
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:18,360
from a massive right hepatectomy with lymph node dissection

24
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,840
at the hilus of the liver, to just a simple cholecystectomy.

25
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,840
And if we examine some series of cases,

26
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:27,740
collected, of course, in which resections were done,

27
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,560
we see that the same dismal prognosis occurs

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,360
for 36 cases with resections, only one five-year survivor.

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,740
What planet is that?

30
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,560
I don't know, God.

31
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,440
Why, it's dead.

32
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,860
I hear a woman weeping.

33
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,780
I said, I want to watch cartoons.

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:19,560
I want to watch cartoons.

35
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,080
The tumor was picked up on routine sectioning of the gallbladder

36
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,000
or very carefully.

37
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:26,420
And then, after a thorough inspection of the gallbladder,

38
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:31,180
14 cases, only two survived simple cholecystectomy

39
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,940
for the treatment of these early tumors.

40
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,460
And two of the three papillary adenocarcinomas

41
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:40,820
in this series of 14 cases survived, one died.

42
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,220
The numbers of cases are limited because this

43
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:46,980
is a rare form of disease when it's discovered only

44
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,000
in the pathology laboratory or found only at.

45
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,020
Another fine product by Squidco.

46
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,780
Brought to you by Squidco.

47
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,540
It's good.

48
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:55,920
It's a little bit of a cartoon show.

49
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,380
Remember.

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:01,360
Eat a box of Squidco, Squidco, Haste Wasties.

51
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:01,900
That's Wilman.

52
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:05,320
Brought to you by Haste Wasties cereal,

53
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:11,020
the only cereal with the makers of Sid the Squid cereal.

54
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,900
We buy Corinthian Column cigarettes.

55
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
Where it comes already soggy in the box.

56
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:20,000
Your own drab life and light up a Corinthian column.

57
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,780
The only cigarette with marble fluting.

58
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,520
Nothing worse will happen to you for the rest of your life.

59
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:24,520


60
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:24,640
The only cigarette with marble fluting.

61
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,000
Nothing worse will happen to you for the rest of your life.

62
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,640
Hello friends and welcome.

63
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,140
You know, the other week I spoke about what it would be like

64
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,580
when the judgment day arrived.

65
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,580
The great pain, the eternal torment, the gnashing of teeth

66
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,500
down to the gums.

67
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:45,220
I hope that was a very uplifting sermon as it was meant to be.

68
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,020
Don't let it be said that the Church of the Subgenius

69
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:51,200
relies on scare tactics to frighten people into the fold.

70
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,940
Bob is your friend.

71
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:54,500
Bob is your friend.

72
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:54,500


73
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,120
He loves you.

74
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,680
He loves your money.

75
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,900
He loves your slack.

76
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,440
He wants to give you love, money, and slack.

77
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,360
All in abundance.

78
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,020
But first, first you must show that you are worthy friends.

79
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,160
You must love him first.

80
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,720
You must give him money.

81
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,220
You must provide him some slack.

82
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,560
Bob pays back all his debts plus interest.

83
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,320
Bob gets credit where credit is due.

84
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,420
No money down.

85
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,900
Indeed Bob is the king of credit.

86
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:21,420
You cannot be turned away for any reason.

87
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,900
You see, Bob invented credit.

88
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:24,500
Back before he was a king.

89
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,420
Back before the process was stolen, corrupted, and twisted by the conspiracy.

90
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,220
Bob treats his credit customers like A1 consumers.

91
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,780
The customer is always right.

92
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,680
And if you're not completely satisfied for any reason, then double your damnation back.

93
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,420
Now you're probably wondering, friends, what's the catch?

94
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,920
There's got to be a catch.

95
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,980
There's no such thing as free salvation.

96
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,280
Well, would that they were.

97
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,000
Unfortunately there is a catch and it's called the conspiracy.

98
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,360
If you get involved with it, if you are seduced by it, if you succumb to its hypnotic influence,

99
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,540
then damn you by your own design.

100
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:59,000
Bob didn't tell you to buy into the conspiracy.

101
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,840
Bob provided alternatives.

102
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,880
And when the poo-poo hits the propeller and all hell breaks loose, you're going to need

103
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,740
a better excuse than I was just following orders.

104
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,780
Because friends, the title of tonight's sermon is Nuremberg after the X-Day invasion.

105
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,740
Now I know a few of you are probably a little upset at me yelling.

106
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,520
I apologize.

107
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,660
I can tell by the dwindling amount of love offerings at the end of each service that

108
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,300
somebody's missing.

109
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:24,720
Miffed.

110
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:29,780
But I'm not yelling at you because I want to hurt your feelings now, but because I'm

111
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:31,520
trying to spare your feelings later.

112
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,580
And later is sooner than you think.

113
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,240
Say amen.

114
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,800
Now, now, now, now, now, now, a lot of folks don't want to hear you say that, but it's

115
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,240
in the Bible.

116
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:43,360
You shouldn't be mad that you're frightened, but instead you should be frightened that

117
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:43,840
you're mad.

118
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,320
After all, all good subgenies shouldn't be worried about the X-Day.

119
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,020
It's what we've been waiting for, at least it's supposed to be, unless you've got something

120
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,680
to hide.

121
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,960
Why does the talk at the end of the world upset so many people?

122
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,100
The answer is simple.

123
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,880
Because they're afraid their definition of being a subgenius might not measure up to

124
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,840
Bob's definition.

125
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:08,760
And right they should worry because friends, there's more than just a few Bobbies out there

126
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,340
that are Sabbath-day subgenies, but weekday weaklings.

127
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:16,480
They work for the conspiracy Monday through Friday and sometimes overtime on weekends.

128
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,380
Yes, Father Joe Mama knows and sees all.

129
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,040
You can fool some of the subgenies some of the time, but you can't fool all the subgenie

130
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,040
all the time, least of all Bob.

131
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,600
Do you think he's not going to know who among you are liars, cheats, and money moonlighters?

132
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:37,600
There's nothing wrong with having money, friends, but when you use it to support the enemy instead

133
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,240
of giving it to Bob, you're just underwriting the conspiracy war against slack.

134
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:46,580
In essence, you're buying bonds to stay bonded.

135
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,440
And don't think for a moment that you're buying time, friends.

136
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,740
No siree.

137
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,400
X-Day will arrive July 5th, 1998.

138
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:56,300
Come hell or high water, which both probably will.

139
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,800
And then, and then you'll have the chance to explain to Bob why you worked, fought,

140
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:04,360
and financed the conspiracy for all those years.

141
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,760
Ho ho ho.

142
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,600
I can just hear you now.

143
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,560
Oh, sorry Bob.

144
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:11,720
I just didn't know.

145
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:12,920
Wrong.

146
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,060
You should have found out.

147
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,020
You should have brought your bauble, your book of the subgenius at your local bookstore.

148
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,940
Oh, but Bob.

149
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,340
I didn't want to support the conspiracy.

150
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:23,380
I just didn't know.

151
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:23,380


152
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,340
I was so scared of the conspiracy so I couldn't buy your book.

153
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,640
Wrong again.

154
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,500
You should have gone to your library.

155
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,160
Or you could have ordered it direct from the subgenius foundation.

156
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:32,940
Oh, but gee.

157
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:37,140
I would have, honest Bob, but I just didn't have any money.

158
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,880
Strike three.

159
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,000
You're out of there.

160
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,120
Bob knows about that new BMW.

161
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:44,240
Bob knows about that new VCR.

162
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,360
Bob knows about that new stereo hi-fi that you're listening to his free radio show on

163
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:48,860
right now.

164
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,960
What's your excuse?

165
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,020
You heard the word of Bob from his most holy of disciples.

166
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:53,360
You're just going to have to go to the library and get it.

167
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,360


168
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,360


169
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:53,360


170
00:07:53,360 --> 00:08:00,340
He stays home over the weekend by the weir.

171
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,880
Oh hey, where you at?

172
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:13,900
Right, there he is.

173
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:13,900


174
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:13,900


175
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:13,900


176
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:13,900


177
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,140
Look you didn't go in there, did you, Bob?

178
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:14,160
No, Jim.

179
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,160


180
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,160


181
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,160


182
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,540
That's hard.

183
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,160
That's a rec prayers.

184
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,460
No, you did my stupid thing.

185
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:16,700
I apologize.

186
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,200
Now I'm going to do something else.

187
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,200


188
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,000
I mean, Skinhead and the rest of Help Me was called.

189
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,080
You did appreciate your influence on the Seekers.

190
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:20,180
Yeah, but you missed some of your biggest projects.

191
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:21,880
I know but I've been working with Liz closely.

192
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,320
I know Sir Vin.

193
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:22,860
Oh, come on.

194
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,340
you had a good time.

195
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,380
Stupid! Subgenies and stupidity are mutually exclusive terms.

196
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,840
They're antonyms, just like jumbo shrimp and army intelligence.

197
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,560
You can't be both. Ignorance is no excuse for obeying the law.

198
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:42,240
We don't care if the conspiracy told you to do it. You should have known it was wrong.

199
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,620
Imagine if you were Dr. Joseph Mingala and you're at Nuremberg and they ask you why you murdered millions of Jews.

200
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:53,140
What are you going to say? I was just following orders. I was just doing my job.

201
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:59,480
I did it to conform because everyone else was doing it. Guilty! Guilty! Guilty!

202
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:03,800
That's what they say at Nuremberg. Only one excuse prevents execution.

203
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:13,620
If you could say honestly and sincerely from deep in your heart, I did it because I enjoyed it.

204
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,440
And of course, how many people can truly say that they worked 9 to 5,

205
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,240
Monday through Friday, and occasionally overtime on weekends, because they honestly enjoyed it?

206
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:26,420
How many? Would you believe them? Well then don't expect Bob to.

207
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:30,620
Just because he can sell it, friends, don't mean he's gonna buy it.

208
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:36,820
Words to worry about from now to doomsday, courtesy of J.R. Bob Dobbs. Amen.

209
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,460
But what is a subject?

210
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:54,920
If one finds a papillary tumor, which is a stage 0 or perhaps even a stage 1,

211
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,320
that is confined to the mucosa or confined to the gallbladder wall,

212
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:03,000
one has a much better chance of a long-term survivor.

213
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,100
Now, what can we do about this situation?

214
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:16,940
Hello out there in radio land. This is Papa Prell with an important message for all you habitual smokers.

215
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:18,540
Keep up the good work, will ya?

216
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:24,340
Sure. Thanks to you and your obnoxious habit, smoking-related illnesses are at an all-time high.

217
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,480
And that's good news for the economy.

218
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,340
You see, nothing supports our ailing healthcare system more than those nice, long, chronic respiratory diseases.

219
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:38,380
What's more, smoking helps the tobacco business, not to mention the undertakers.

220
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,820
Oh, I wasn't gonna mention that, but the point is this.

221
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:45,640
The next time you see a smoker in public, don't castigate them, congratulate them.

222
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:48,940
After all, they'll get what's coming to them soon enough.

223
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:52,980
So go ahead, smokers of America. Puff away like there's no tomorrow.

224
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,800
Because for you, there may not be.

225
00:10:54,960 --> 00:11:00,120
A message brought to you by people who want your parking space and yours truly, Papa Prell.

226
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:19,660
Take me in your Cadillac and we'll go honky-tonkin'.

227
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:23,380
We'll park it by the roadside somewhere beneath the moon.

228
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:27,860
Take me in your Cadillac and we'll go honky-tonkin'.

229
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,760
We'll park it by the roadside and I'll make sweet love to you.

230
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:36,400
You're just a plain old country girl who likes to get around.

231
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:40,560
So hop right in my Cadillac and we'll go paint the town.

232
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,640
I won't drink your whiskey nor I won't drink your brew.

233
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:49,140
But I'll cuddle close, my dear, and I'll make sweet love to you.

234
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,440
And new neutrinos.

235
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,620
Pingling tentacles of an atria-flavored cereal.

236
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,360
My, those are nice looking shoes you have here.

237
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:14,620
I really like them.

238
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:17,440
The nutria-flavored cereal with coipu pellets.

239
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,840
Most people here probably don't know what neutrias are.

240
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:24,520
They're flavored with neutrino sweet, the microscopic subatomic sugar.

241
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:27,420
Loaded with neutrons so you know they must be nutritious.

242
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,180
At Cafe Neutron, just around the corner from the KPFA.

243
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,440
Why, I suppose you're about to tell our listeners that.

244
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:41,360
A nutria is an animal found on the side of the roads.

245
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,000
A nutria is an animal with a...

246
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,960
Oh, shut up.

247
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:45,160
On the side of the roads.

248
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:50,540
Usually found on the side of the roads in Louisiana, lying on its back with its feet up in the air.

249
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:59,500
It's some kin to the dead armadillo found in Texas and the dead chipmunks found up on the north.

250
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,140
Outside Dave Saville's house.

251
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:05,180
Yeah, no live, no live neutria has ever been seen.

252
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,980
We've only seen dead neutrias on the side of the road.

253
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,300
This was down in Louisiana just about a mile from the Texas border.

254
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,120
They're about as common as the white alligator.

255
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,740
Yes, they're as common as the white alligator, but they're...

256
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:14,500
When you do see them, they are dead.

257
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,560
They are the Louisiana State Roadkill.

258
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,660
I was going to say, are these related to any type of roadkill?

259
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,780
Yes, they're the Louisiana State Roadkill.

260
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,160
Like the famous boroglumps and sasquahatches.

261
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:31,100
Also like the snelligaster that haunts several lakes in the eastern state.

262
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,180
Sasquatch is the Oregon State Roadkill.

263
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:36,660
Snoop, Sneak, Snatch, and Snelligaster are attorneys at law.

264
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,620
Call us now.

265
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,360
Okay.

266
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:53,780
Thank you, canviolent.

267
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,840
Sounds good to me.

268
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,300
Let's take that way.

269
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,300


270
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:58,300


271
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,320
These Mexicans obsessed toward Eddie Slick.

272
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:02,240
I know that in their books they'll find anybody who's not a complete doorînee.

273
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:02,320
I gave them that GL promo, I gave them my brand new boa gonzo.

274
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:06,500
Man, that Прareth right there was take them so seriously.

275
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,860
That Making My Way with Henry classics it was that genius.

276
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:11,300
invisible man

277
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,500
Then

278
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,400
something went wrong

279
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:17,920
For Fay Wray and King Kong

280
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,580
They got caught

281
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,860
in a cellular jam

282
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,860
Then

283
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:25,740
at a deadly pace

284
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,100
It came from

285
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,540
outer space

286
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:31,580
And this is how the message

287
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:32,440
ran

288
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,040
Silence

00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,880
life could be a dream

316
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,060
if I could take you up in paradise up above

317
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,360
if you would tell me I'm the only one that you love

318
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,160
life could be a dream

319
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,840
sweetheart hello hello again

320
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:24,460
shaboom it opened for me to get

321
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,160
but I'm so human

322
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:31,140
I'm still scarcely odd because the station would not run

323
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,540
it thought it could and it thought it could

324
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,200
as we run the station into the ground

325
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,420
and the transmitter turned off

326
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,280
coulda woulda shoulda

327
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:48,200
yes all the subgenius are dancing around the magic mushroom now

328
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:53,060
they're painted blue and there's lots to do as they mutilate a cow

329
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,640
their toes feet are less than neat as they trample through the field

330
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:05,040
and their awful faces in odd places resembling brook shields

331
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,180
what I plan to do to you is

332
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:15,000
I plan to release those tensions which build up during the workaday world workday

333
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,600
oh you're so wrong I was planning on demonstrating

334
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:22,380
it involves chandeliers and ice water animals but you can't see that

335
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,240
no no

336
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:23,800
it's on the radio

337
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,720
I was going to

338
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:25,920
I'm perched on top of this thing

339
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,660
Frenchies use it I understand

340
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,840
no no no if you don't stop interrupting me I'm going to have to slap you

341
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:36,100
a little more chocolate pudding and apple sauce isn't it?

342
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:46,540
it's like a good friend of ours said everybody should have some French expressionistic or impressionistic art over their mantelpiece

343
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:51,700
everyone should have a bidet hanging over their mantelpiece and they should have a Monet in their bathroom

344
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,200
damn straight

345
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
and plumbing connected to both of them

346
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,200
but tonight I brought my uvula piercer

347
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,700
oh no

348
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,880
can we watch?

349
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,980
you lost your uvula years ago Hal admit it

350
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:07,180
well somewhere back there along the way

351
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,040
dusty miles but I've it's been so long I forgot where I left that uvula

352
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,540
probably in a shag carpet somewhere

353
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:17,460
I left my uvula somewhere in the bay area

354
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,740
I was going to go up in St. Louis and start a chain to it so I could drag you around by your uvula

355
00:18:20,740 --> 00:18:21,980
oh yes a uvula piercing ceremony

356
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:24,760
we will return to you and your uvula

357
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:30,900
a collection of cases in which there were polyploid lesions seen in the gallbladder

358
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,720
what did these prove to be?

359
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,120
in 52 cases there were no carcinomas

360
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:40,920
they range from cholesterol polyps down to adenomyomas

361
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:46,380
another series of 113 cases of radiographic polyploid lesions of the gallbladder

362
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,700
what did these prove to be?

363
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:52,260
10 had cholecystectomies and in these 10 cases there were no cancers

364
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,020
a long term follow up 15 year in the rest of these 103 cases

365
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,660
failed to disclose the presence of carcinoma in any of them

366
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,960
so that one would have to say on a statistical basis that

367
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,920
now this here's my decree

368
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,600
I wish that you would tell me the name of this contraption here

369
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:21,900
Billy I can't see anything

370
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,120
there's rocks in my eye sockets and I can't feel anything below my knees

371
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:30,700
not only that there's a spider down here

372
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,860
and we don't have a ladder

373
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,900
perhaps if we were to create a new world

374
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:43,560
we would have to bring some of the phropopolis that is promised in the book of the subgenius

375
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:46,060
and so that's just what they did

376
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:47,940
and it didn't help a bit

377
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:50,500
that day the mine filled up with water

378
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,820
and those little brats were suffocated in the dark inkiness of blackest night

379
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,820
what happened to Timmy and Billy?

380
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,280
where did you put them you old hag?

381
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:05,880
I stuck them in this cedar chest after I cut them up with Tina's razor blade

382
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,760
and a red leather machete

383
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:11,060
you won't get away with that in this state Aunt Bertha

384
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,520
you're coming with me

385
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:15,180
I'm Mr. Brew the authorities

386
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:20,840
and thus then children Mr. Brew burst into a pillar of fire

387
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:24,300
yes the Lord does work in mysterious ways

388
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,340
from his atomic baton bill at the Venus of the sky

389
00:20:27,340 --> 00:20:30,060
I don't know this SO82B for those of you who don't know

390
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,040
some people don't believe in this primitive myth

391
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:33,720
there's two hell experiments going wrong Doug what can we do?

392
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,600
toward the end of the show they'll be blowing up for us in our ocean

393
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,740
which one's the real hell?

394
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,120
hell number two

395
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,080
now we'll return to hell number one

396
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:43,120
and you win the dromedary behind the curtain

397
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,040
hold hell number two under water there

398
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,900
let's go over that again you say you saw some sort of monster?

399
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,040
gotta keep them cooled down here during the show

400
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:51,320
some kind of monster I'm not quite sure

401
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:55,140
it was either one of them scorpion griffin things we've been having

402
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,520
or maybe it was one of them blood sucking werewolf tarantulas

403
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:59,500
that would be unfortunate

404
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:02,420
yeah well it was small like a blood sucking werewolf

405
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,260
ladies and gentlemen we've got

406
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,860
tarantula but it was hairy like a werewolf

407
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:11,960
what you think I should get some mouse traps and put them around the perimeter of the dome here

408
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:13,620
or should I put them just out of the atmosphere?

409
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,020
put that damn toy rig on the way

410
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,820
grow up act your age

411
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,880
well turn off

412
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,380
hey that thing actually works

413
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,680
yeah it seems to be erasing people

414
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,780
I work for a living buddy I ain't no artist

415
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,240
you know you made a hole in that 1920s tape that came down the wall

416
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,280
oh too bad

417
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,700
it's difficult to learn

418
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,900
you muster the strength to catch up on the show

419
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:41,880
well the coil was a gas line stole from a ford and the still was a coal oil can

420
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:47,140
but out of the spout and into a jug the old corn licker ran

421
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:53,600
them boys got down and they hefted the jug and they found her full pretty nigh

422
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,240
so they each took a snort right then and there for they was tallable dry

423
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,520
hello out there in radio land

424
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:08,600
prell here inviting you to enlist as a soldier in america's war against drugs

425
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,420
and it's so easy

426
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,200
when someone offers you drugs just say you're under arrest

427
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:23,980
that's right narcotics are illegal in america and possession and or sale of illegal substances is just a sort of information police wanna hear

428
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:26,940
now some of you are saying but they're my friends

429
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:30,700
baloney friends don't offer friends chemical poisons

430
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:31,800
so remember

431
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:37,140
when the enemy offers you drugs don't turn the other cheek turn them in

432
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,100
you'll sleep much better after doing your civic duty

433
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:46,240
a message from this great station and yours truly papa prell

434
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,600
says one old boy that's the darndest steer that ever i did find

435
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,780
he's got two heads

436
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,180
and a dozen legs

437
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,640
and fourteen tails behind

438
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:14,360
so they rolled old steer upon his back and they held him by the horns

439
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:20,660
and down his sizzling goose oh they poured a quart of corn

440
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:25,400
when you're moving that microphone back and forth there

441
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,460
behind most of our social institutions

442
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:31,780
the dreadful conspiracy of the bavarian movement

443
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:32,380
did you man

444
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:32,760
understanding nothing

445
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:39,780
all you got is in their millor

446
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:43,080
out purposes

447
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,200
and pillow

448
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:45,940
one seems to have simmered

449
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:45,940


450
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,820
were you

451
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,820
he's had no planned

452
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,500
for the rest of his life

453
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:57,700
and of course

454
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,060
ordinary clock conceives.

455
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,800
They're known for feathering

456
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,300
their nests.

457
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,280
Bad jokes.

458
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,220
And so as we

459
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:09,460
feel cooped up in this

460
00:24:09,460 --> 00:24:10,720
terrible program.

461
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,160
There goes Dr. Howe

462
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:15,740
squirming through the door

463
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,520
writhing and wriggling

464
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:18,680
down the hall.

465
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:20,380
He's at the uterine canal where he'll

466
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,800
find records on the shelf.

467
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,340
Bring them back down and with the next

468
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,520
contraction he'll be popping right back into the

469
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,660
sound room again. Remember this is brought to you

470
00:24:28,660 --> 00:24:30,120
by Sid the Squid's cereal.

471
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:32,480
The only breakfast cereal that

472
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,420
squirts real ink. Comes already

473
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,580
soggy in the box.

474
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,120
He's okay folks.

475
00:24:38,340 --> 00:24:40,620
He's just not here. He just smells a little bit.

476
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,460
But you know it's a free country. That's because he's not

477
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:44,640
washing where he is. Yeah he has a right.

478
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,120
He can't help it.

479
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,420
Not that you can help it either.

480
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,300
We could tell him that

481
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,840
he thinks it's a personal statement

482
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:55,040
still. It's a political statement.

483
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,460
I'm all for personal statements.

484
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:57,740
You want to stink that?

485
00:24:58,180 --> 00:25:00,000
It's a lifestyle statement.

486
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,500
I mean it's a lifestyle

487
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:04,940
in hell. It's an anti-lifestyle

488
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,080
statement. The anti-lifestyle.

489
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,280
Lifestyles of the dead and famous.

490
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,580
Yes. Well tonight we'll look

491
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:12,820
at the anti-lifestyle

492
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,500
of Rock Hudson

493
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:16,440
and let's see who else

494
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,220
can we look at? Liberace. Liberace.

495
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,640
Humphrey Bogart and everyone's

496
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,480
name. Betty Davis.

497
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,420
Graham Chapman. Who else has died

498
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,120
recently? Betty Boop.

499
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,700
No one's seen her in a long time.

500
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,440
No, no. That's true.

501
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,360
Jay Ward. Did he die?

502
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:32,660
Oh.

503
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,440
I knew

504
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,080
Leo G. Carroll

505
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,920
was over a barrel

506
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:42,560
when Tarantula

507
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:45,020
took to the hills

508
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,020
and I

509
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:48,420
really got hot

510
00:25:48,420 --> 00:25:50,820
when I saw Jeanette

511
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,280
Scott fight a

512
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:54,100
trippet that spits poison

513
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:54,920
and kills.

514
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,200
Dana Andrews

515
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:58,820
said proves

516
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:01,660
gave him the rules

517
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,920
and passing them

518
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,700
used lots of skills

519
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:08,400
but when worlds

520
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,080
collide said

521
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,960
George Powell to his bride

522
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,720
I'm gonna give you

523
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:16,140
some terrible thrills

524
00:26:16,140 --> 00:26:17,740
like a

525
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,140
science

526
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,060
fiction

527
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,440
book

528
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,860
called

529
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,980
The Future.

530
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,060
Doctor

531
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,220
Ant

532
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:32,740
will

533
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,560
build a creature

534
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,560
to see

Oh, oh, oh, oh.

To the late night, double feature, picture show.

569
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:09,760
Now, if you want information on the church of the subgenius,

570
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,780
that's a whole nother thang.

571
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:16,680
I want you to write to a different post office box for that.

572
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,100
That's Bob.

573
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:23,220
At Box 1403-06, Delibre.

574
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:30,360
Dallas, Texas, 75214, Delibre.

575
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,120
No, I'm afraid not.

576
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,100
Not this time, friends.

577
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,580
Do you feel better now, friend?

578
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:46,440
Yes, friends, I feel good too, because those demons,

579
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:52,000
those pills, those evil women were all sent to Bob

580
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:55,520
at Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas, 75214,

581
00:28:55,620 --> 00:29:02,340
and to KNON, Box 710909, Dallas, Texas, 75371.

582
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:02,680
Now...

583
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,100
Oh, yes.

584
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,640
I forgot to tell you.

585
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:12,420
The spice exists on only one planet in the entire universe,

586
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,420
a desolate, dry planet with no soul.

587
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:17,160
It's a vast desert.

588
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,640
Hidden away within the rocks of these deserts

589
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,600
are a people known as the Fremen,

590
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,600
who have long held a prophecy

591
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:28,900
that a man would come,

592
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:30,720
a messiah,

593
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:34,160
who would lead them to true freedom.

594
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,360
The planet is Arrakis,

595
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,480
also known as June.

596
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,540
One short of the list in history,

597
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:06,540


598
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:06,540


599
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:06,540


600
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:06,540


601
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:06,640
I'm now aware the Great Atmospheric Space

602
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:06,640


603
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:06,660
resulting in its states,

604
00:30:06,660 --> 00:30:07,420
in both Near and Public Space.

605
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,920
And, um...

606
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,820
As, from New St. Mary's,

607
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,380
New Ormei has appeared recognize in the Astros,

608
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:16,380


609
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:16,380


610
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,020

611
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,120

612
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:54,120


613
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:12,300
¶¶

614
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,060
Good day. Oh, do our new movie theme, eh?

615
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,660
Yeah, okay.

616
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,560
¶¶

617
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,640
Okay, good.

618
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:25,340
As the dawn squeaks up over the misty moonlight,

619
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,500
you can see the Dobbs Mobiles pulling on

620
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,580
at Long Caravan to Dobbs Town.

621
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,860
And there's Bob in the back,

622
00:31:31,900 --> 00:31:33,980
this air-conditioned Greyhound bus,

623
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,300
waving and smoking on his bike.

624
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,080
The insanely pixelating dots of his face

625
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,880
radiating outward, smiling for everyone to see

626
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,960
his trim, regular features.

627
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,940
Unicef Stereo is having a super-stay.

628
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:45,660
Super-stay.

629
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:45,860
And...

630
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:47,400
¶¶

631
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:51,680
What do you mean?

632
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,520
Here we go.

633
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,060
I'm gonna be a winner!

634
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:56,480
Hey, people, we're gonna have to be off real soon,

635
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,180
so I'm gonna try to read this poem.

636
00:31:58,640 --> 00:31:59,380
Oh, okay, go ahead.

637
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:00,300
Try to read that poem.

638
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:00,800
¶¶

639
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,380
A dwarf who hops and flops along the track

640
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:05,620
stumbles and then falls, but who will care a whit?

641
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,160
He'll lie there stunned until his wee bones crack

642
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,180
when shearing wheels press him into the grit.

643
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,760
And then a creeping freight passes through,

644
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,960
leaving only fragments of the scalded head.

645
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:15,780
¶¶

646
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:15,820
¶¶

647
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:22,920
And the half-blind porter on the super-chief

648
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,060
throws out some slops which land upon the face.

649
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,400
The sockets fill with trash but not with grief,

650
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,640
directed blindly toward the pit of space.

651
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,720
Spiders, rats, and flies come to eat at last,

652
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,500
and God, in his great disgust,

653
00:32:34,540 --> 00:32:36,060
sends down a mighty blast.

654
00:32:38,360 --> 00:32:40,260
You don't think that...

655
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:42,660
I don't understand why you think that

656
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,260
God would just sit up there

657
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:47,080
and make one planet, you know,

658
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:48,620
that, I mean, wouldn't he get bored?

659
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:51,980
I mean, think of how long this Earth has been sitting around.

660
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,900
John, he doesn't get bored.

661
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:57,340
He's spending a lot of time with his attention on you

662
00:32:57,340 --> 00:32:58,760
trying to get you to come to him.

663
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,900
He's got plenty to do, reaching people like you.

664
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,240
If a polypoid lesion is seen in the gallbladder,

665
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,320
the chances of this being a carcinoma

666
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,260
and the chances of a polypoid lesion

667
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:10,920
indicating a cholecystectomy

668
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,080
because of the possibility of carcinoma

669
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,240
is practically zero.

670
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,340
So we don't make many nickels

671
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,440
approaching the problem from this direction.

672
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,580
Now, there is a positive association

673
00:33:21,580 --> 00:33:24,840
of calculi in the gallbladder

674
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:27,640
with carcinoma of the gallbladder.

675
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,560
Almost all cases of carcinoma of the gallbladder

676
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,860
are associated with stones.

677
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,240
Now, does this mean that in every case of cholelithiasis

678
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:38,000
should be followed by a cholecystectomy

679
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,140
because of the possibility of carcinoma?

680
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:43,680
Probably not, I would have to say,

681
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,240
because of the possibility of carcinoma.

682
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,240


683
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,240


684
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:44,700
Because...

685
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,580
There ain't no pride on me

686
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:49,700
There may be pride on some of you guys

687
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,620
There ain't no pride on me

688
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:00,500
Did he die?

689
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:01,320
Oh, no.

690
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:01,780
Oh, too bad.

691
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:02,400
Did he die?

692
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,200
Oh, too bad.

693
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,280
I knew Jay Ward was dead

694
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,060
because they've been making

695
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:07,140
bad Captain Crunch commercials lately.

696
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,660
That's always an indication

697
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:09,800
that somebody's died.

698
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:10,560
Yeah.

699
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,660
Well, he was doing the Captain Crunch commercials

700
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:13,580
for, like,

701
00:34:14,240 --> 00:34:14,540
decades.

702
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,120
And they were actually funny

703
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,480
and then they stopped being funny

704
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,240
and started being strangely sexual

705
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:22,620
where Captain Crunch grabs his hat.

706
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,860
You know, he's got an Avril's hat.

707
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:25,100
It's a spurt in the universe.

708
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:25,320


709
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,020
and milk shoots out the top of it.

710
00:34:27,460 --> 00:34:30,760
And he's fighting these sperm monsters

711
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,860
called the Soggies

712
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,100
instead of Jean LaFoot,

713
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,600
the Barefoot Pirate.

714
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,620
If you want to see

715
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,260
Jean LaFoot, the Barefoot Pirate,

716
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,700
come back in the Captain Crunch ads.

717
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,740
Please call us here.

718
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,860
We'll let Quaker out.

719
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,820
And we will have absolutely nothing to do with it.

720
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,840
We can't have anything to do with it.

721
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,740
We'll give you a dollar.

722
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,780
We'll give you a dollar.

723
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,900
But, you know,

724
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,200
I really hate the sperm monsters,

725
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:49,860
the Soggies.

726
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:50,660
They're really disgusting.

727
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,620
And now they have this

728
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:53,080
peanut butter bird

729
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:54,420
that is supposedly

730
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,800
laying an egg

731
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,460
in the commercial.

732
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:59,860
But it looks like it's having

733
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:02,820
a massive bird-like valve.

734
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:09,980
Omar the Vampire

735
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,260
He hung out in the bars

736
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:15,080
And drank Bloody Marys

737
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,360
And gave a lot of women scars

738
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,160
He sure was something

739
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,500
Yeah, he was a real cuckoo

740
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,500
Omar the Vampire

741
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,740
He was a neck-sucking fool

742
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:43,920
Huh!

743
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:57,200
Behind the curtain The Lawless Dяни's

744
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,260
Show

745
00:35:58,260 --> 00:36:00,280
Who wants to hear

746
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:00,280


747
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,600
Guys, guys, positions.

748
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,360
controversy over this point. I thought maybe I should spend a little time on the topic before

749
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:11,860
the debate gets out of hand. Too many divisions occur. So far, there's already been three

750
00:36:11,860 --> 00:36:17,920
authorized schisms, the real subgenies, the pseudo subgenies, and the bobbies. This, of course,

751
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:22,400
forms the holy trinity. Three is a holy number, and to be a member of any of these three groups

752
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,360
is automatically holy. Though some groups are more holy than others, but be this as it may,

753
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:34,520
let us go on to the source of all discourse, the holy word of Bob, the blessed bobble. Some say it

754
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:39,060
was written by Bob's hand. Some say it was inspired by Bob's hand. Others say Bob's gland

755
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:43,960
was inspired by Bob's hand, but we're not going to get off on that subject. The point is the bobble

756
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:53,640
is the word of Bob, or to be more exact, the words of Bob, or to be 100% accurate, words Bob used at

757
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,180
one time or another, though not necessarily in that order.

758
00:36:56,360 --> 00:37:01,220
But this is neither here nor there. It is true that some skeptics point out that if Bob actually

759
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:06,600
wrote the bobble, it should be written in cursive. But even the most vehement disbeliever concedes

760
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:13,400
that the bobble is written in the same exact language that Bob himself used, that is to say

761
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:21,300
English. In other words, it is the words of Bob. Very important point, friends. Now that we've

762
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:26,200
settled or clarified that point, let us turn to the bobble itself. Chapter 1, page 18,

763
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:27,680
paragraph 1, verses 1 through 3.

764
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,120
Now, skipping down to paragraph 6, verses 1 through 2.

765
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:43,820
Yay, beware!

766
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:44,920
There must be a bobble.

767
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,440
There must be a bobble.

768
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,000
There must be no stereotypes. Let me read that again. Yay, beware! There must be no stereotypes.

769
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:04,740
Bet you didn't know that, but it's in the bobble, which most of you probably haven't been reading too much lately.

770
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:11,540
A subgenie must always read the words of Bob. What do you think you're supposed to do every day when you're sitting on Bob's throne?

771
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:20,080
Simply defecate? Bob said what goes in must come out. That doesn't just refer to sex. What you let out while on Bob's throne,

772
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:26,340
you must put back in through Bob's bobble. Getting back to the text, most of you should probably be reeling from the text.

773
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:34,320
It's the same as the shock of those first two paragraphs. What does subgenius mean? It means nothing. Nothing at all.

774
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:40,600
So what are you going to do now? Go home and sulk? You should go home and read your bobble. And if you haven't got one, get one.

775
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:50,100
Read it from cover to cover, frontwards, backwards, and sideways. Read it in between the lines and notice where those lines are placed and see what that tells you.

776
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:55,940
If you're a real subgenius, it'll tell you plenty. For instance, in this instance, ask yourself,

777
00:38:55,940 --> 00:39:03,640
why the first and second paragraphs are separated. Why did Bob separate the question, what does subgenius mean,

778
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:13,640
from the apparent answer in the next paragraph, it means nothing. Why? Because of a whim? A fetish? He likes to break up paragraphs and waste paper?

779
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:24,100
He hates trees, maybe? No! Bob loves trees, especially the ones that grow the sacred money paper. Bob wants to save as much of that money paper as possible.

780
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:25,920
And it is in the pursuit of that money paper that Bob is going to be able to get rid of the rest of his money.

781
00:39:25,940 --> 00:39:37,200
So, the first paragraph of that paper that made Bob say, what does it mean? It means nothing. Bob was comforting the normals in their stupidity so that they would buy the book and contribute to the subgenius cause.

782
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:47,800
Bob doesn't want them, he only wants their money. And so he expands his potential market to include the normals by inferring they are as good enough to be subgenius as we are,

783
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:55,640
while simultaneously leaving his followers an obvious and grammatical clue. A red flag, if you will, within his teachings to say,

784
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:55,920
history is a lie. He doesn't want them to be a part of his story. He doesn't want them to be a part of his story. He doesn't want them to be a part of his story.

785
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:56,540
The first paragraph of that paper says, Bob is a genius, he is a genius, he is a genius, and yet he is not a genius.

786
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:56,540


787
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:59,000
Bob says, I have done this and that, and so I am a genius.

788
00:39:59,000 --> 00:39:59,000


789
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,240
I said that Bob was a genius, he was a genius, and I made mistakes, and yet I did not make mistakes.

790
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:04,380
Except when I mistakenly think I made mistakes, therefore it must be a clue.

791
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,480
A clue to what?

792
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:06,900
What does it mean?

793
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,860
New paragraph.

794
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,540
It means nothing.

795
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,660
What is it?

796
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,500
Subgenius?

797
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:15,460
If you were normal and made mistakes, you might think so.

798
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:21,980
But if you were a subgenius, and notice this glaring error, you know Bob meant something else.

799
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,280
Something bigger.

800
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,380
Something better.

801
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,000
What means nothing?

802
00:40:26,300 --> 00:40:26,740
It!

803
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,980
The whole damn sermon!

804
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,500
Bob is telling his followers,

805
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:32,200
disregard the entire lesson,

806
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,460
maybe even the whole damn book,

807
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,740
for it does not apply to subgenies,

808
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,800
but to the normal pinks who don't know any better

809
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,980
and have nothing better to spend their money on.

810
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,180
Of course subgenie means something,

811
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,760
but subgenies are intelligent enough

812
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:47,880
to figure it out for themselves.

813
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,340
We know we're better than everyone else,

814
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,840
and it's not because we're so smart, either.

815
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,620
But because they're so stupid!

816
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,840
Hell, if we were so smart, we'd be geniuses.

817
00:40:58,400 --> 00:40:59,620
But we're not geniuses.

818
00:40:59,640 --> 00:41:01,180
We don't want to be geniuses.

819
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:04,680
There's only a fine line between a genius and insanity.

820
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:08,220
But with a subgenius, there's no line.

821
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,440
No line at all!

822
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,980
We've removed that border.

823
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,200
We've erased that barrier.

824
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:15,440
These days, you have to be crazy not to be crazy.

825
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:16,920
Just look around you and see.

826
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:19,620
Would a sane God have created this world?

827
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:20,820
Of course not.

828
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,120
One look at the evening news

829
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,820
should be proof enough for you.

830
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:24,800
And for that, God is weird.

831
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,280
His world is weird.

832
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,100
And so should his followers be.

833
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:31,500
Only when the subgenie are truly made onto his image

834
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,040
are they one with God.

835
00:41:33,340 --> 00:41:35,640
That makes us better than the blasphemous,

836
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,640
uninsane, pink, moron majority.

837
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,720
We have a sacred mission

838
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,300
to remove the godless blots of sanity

839
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,020
from an otherwise picture-perfect canvas of chaos.

840
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:48,200
I propose a new disorder,

841
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,520
a land of pieces and disharmony,

842
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:52,120
where everything and everyone

843
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,440
is in their proper place,

844
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:56,000
lost and therefore found.

845
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,600
For we have found ourselves

846
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,140
among the natural scheme of things,

847
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:01,340
not the artificial conspiracy scheme

848
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:04,100
created by things to sell things,

849
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:07,320
the scheme that forces round pegs into square holes

850
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,500
and labels them and numbers them

851
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,780
and catalogs them and files them away

852
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:13,080
and throws away the key.

853
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,340
No, sir.

854
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:18,480
The natural scheme is round pegs in round holes.

855
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:20,300
And if you don't like that hole,

856
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:21,300
then try another.

857
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,560
You can go in and out of as many holes as you desire.

858
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,260
The world is your oyster.

859
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,600
Disorder, anarchy, freedom,

860
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,540
the right to be wrong as it was meant to be.

861
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:32,060
We are better,

862
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:34,120
and the normals better beware of us,

863
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:35,560
because once we take control,

864
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,480
we're going to put the folks in charge

865
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,100
that the people fear most,

866
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:39,880
themselves.

867
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:43,700
Herein doth the word above praise Baha'u'llah, men.

868
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,760
Let me tell you the story

869
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,160
of J. R. Maudoff's

870
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:55,440
thread of men, and yet he

871
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,840
he walked with the gods.

872
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,240
He wore a silly grin

873
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:03,040
and he smoked a stupid pipe.

874
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,600
He fought the conspiracy

875
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,560
every day of his life.

876
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,880
He worked the stench

877
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,180
of many a man.

878
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,840
Fathered many children,

879
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:21,540
with his mighty glance.

880
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,140
He founded the religion

881
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,580
in which we all believe.

882
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,360
Brought us all the slack

883
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,000
that everybody needs.

884
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,920
Maud was the greatest salesman

885
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:41,200
the world had ever seen.

886
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,960
He could sell the farts

887
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:46,540
after he ate all the beans.

888
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:49,740
He could sell a pile of d***

889
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,840
to a lonely fly.

890
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:54,780
All of us who knew him

891
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:57,360
figured he would never die.

892
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:06,340
Bob Dawes, Bob Dawes,

893
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:10,420
he was a real man and brave.

894
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:16,240
Bob Dawes, Bob Dawes,

895
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,260
he was a real man and brave.

896
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:19,580
Bob Dawes was lying dead

897
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,220
in his grave.

898
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,020
Without Bob, what are we gonna do

899
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:29,240
with the men from when

900
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:31,300
in EXCO marching through?

901
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,180
Our old racist was

902
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:34,900
stuck in jail

903
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:36,160
with only Bob

904
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,520
through his labelle.

905
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,840
But now he is dead,

906
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,080
so we're doomed.

907
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,320
What to do?

908
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:42,600
What to do?

909
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,220
We're doomed.

910
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:44,060
We're doomed.

911
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:55,420
He founded the city, known as Topstown. Deep within Malaysia, it was rarely found.

912
00:44:55,920 --> 00:45:05,560
There he studied forbidden science, until that fateful day, when he came unto his flock in the city by the bay.

913
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:19,720
Few had ever seen him, few had ever dared. Most had no occasion, others just plain scared.

914
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:30,000
The first came to Crisco, or the event of the age, when the oldest smiling one would step out on the stage.

915
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,280
I should say, he's a good boy.

916
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:35,060
I'll go to the left.

917
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:35,460
Okay.

918
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:42,060
And he looked to the right, and he stepped out with confidence into a glass.

919
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:47,660
He had all the cheering fans as he strode up to the fight.

920
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,540
It's too late.

921
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:52,860
When the assassin's bullets sent him to his eternal grave.

922
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:53,860
Oh, my God!

923
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:59,500
Bob Dogs! Bob Dogs!

924
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,520
The crowd saw their savior had come.

925
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:09,660
Bob Dogs! Bob Dogs!

926
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:14,900
Was greeted by the first of the group.

927
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:19,720
Without Bob, we have looked in a fear.

928
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:24,900
As we swiftly approached that fatal year.

929
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:31,100
Born in 1998, he would have set the record straight.

930
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,960
But now he's dead, so we're too new.

931
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:34,880
But dear.

932
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,980
Well, this has been the story of J.R. Bob Dogs.

933
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,520
Some call him Messiah.

934
00:46:47,860 --> 00:46:49,300
Others call him fraud.

935
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:54,520
I hope that before 98, that the word gets out.

936
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:59,380
That Bob Dogs was the only guy we couldn't do without.

937
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:02,400
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

938
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,500
The end times are upon us.

939
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:07,440
And things don't look so good.

940
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:12,140
Bob, Bob's had the answer but was seldom understood.

941
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:15,180
Worrying a heap of trouble.

942
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:17,540
Our books are in the red.

943
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,560
There is no joy in Mudville.

944
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,920
Now that Bob is dead.

945
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,980
So we prayed a mighty Jesus.

946
00:47:28,180 --> 00:47:30,740
To do battle for Bob's soul.

947
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,400
We moved a dog and a pea dog.

948
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:34,440
For spring.

949
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:34,480


950
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:35,980
To drink the day of hope.

951
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:39,160
We pray to he who needs no name.

952
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:41,160
That we may need no slack.

953
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,760
And we pray to Wotan.

954
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:46,180
Please send our Bobby back.

955
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:48,960
Bob Dogs.

956
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:51,760
Bob Dogs.

957
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:55,600
Our lives are worth it.

958
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:56,780
Without you.

959
00:47:57,980 --> 00:47:59,580
Bob Dogs.

960
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,260
Bob Dogs.

961
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,440
Oh.

962
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:04,840
Bob Dogs.

963
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:05,160
Oh dear.

964
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,440
What will we do?

965
00:48:08,340 --> 00:48:12,500
Without Bob we are in a tight fix.

966
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,660
When the exes come to Kill Us just for kicks.

967
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:24,040
They may, were not in his grave, A lease of Geni would be safe.

968
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:25,540
But it is.

969
00:48:25,580 --> 00:48:28,040
So our chances are nix.

970
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,660
But it is.

971
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,380
So our chances are nix.

972
00:48:33,380 --> 00:48:33,720
No.

973
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,040
The game is over.

974
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,040


975
00:48:34,040 --> 00:48:34,080
I was just acting like somebody was dead.

976
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,080


977
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,440
But it is.

978
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:34,440


979
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:34,440


980
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:34,440


981
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:34,480
WOTAN.

982
00:49:02,140 --> 00:49:04,320
and the chance of finding a car

983
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:08,740
carcinoma or preventing one is perhaps about the same order of magnitude.

984
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,740
So you don't gain on the situation by advising cholecystectomy for the presence of stones

985
00:49:14,740 --> 00:49:16,740
because of the possibility of carcinoma.

986
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,420
Well, what about the true church of the great green frog then?

987
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:26,680
We were talking about the frog milk which we are giving out today, but all it takes

988
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,880
to believe in the true church of the great green frog is a leap of faith.

989
00:49:30,140 --> 00:49:30,820
Frog teas.

990
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,360
We'll be handing out welfare frog teas later on in the show.

991
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:33,760
Yes, we were.

992
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,980
The true church of the great green frog in a recent friendly leveraged buyout by Bob

993
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:46,760
Dobbs and his mighty church of the subgenius was bought out by the church of the subgenius

994
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:55,160
and the church of the great green frog and cults are us, the squid co. production.

995
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:57,820
Those friendly cephalopods down at squid co.

996
00:49:58,020 --> 00:50:02,700
Yes, so remember to buy it and support Sid the Squid Cereal.

997
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:03,140
Okay.

998
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:04,300
And you are not only...

999
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:16,100
helping America's toxic waste disposal problems, you are also supporting a multinational conglomerate

1000
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:19,360
secretly controlled by giant extraterrestrial squids.

1001
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:22,640
Oh, that's so typical.

1002
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:27,300
My girlfriend, she's so stupid, but she thinks she's so smart.

1003
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:30,300
She's like, totally stupid, man.

1004
00:50:31,520 --> 00:50:34,140
She comes into my house the other day and sits in the kitchen with my mother talking.

1005
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:35,160
I sit in the kitchen talking, right?

1006
00:50:35,180 --> 00:50:36,380
Me and my mother, we're talking in the kitchen, right?

1007
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:36,920
I sit in the kitchen, right?

1008
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:37,720
My mother talking, right?

1009
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:38,500
Talking in the kitchen, right?

1010
00:50:38,500 --> 00:50:39,720
I sit in the kitchen with my mother talking, right?

1011
00:50:39,740 --> 00:50:40,480
Talking in the kitchen, right?

1012
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:40,940
My mother, right?

1013
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:41,560
Sitting in the kitchen, right?

1014
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:42,040
Talking, right?

1015
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:42,680
Jenny comes in.

1016
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,220
Oh, hi, Jenny.

1017
00:50:45,320 --> 00:50:45,700
How's it going?

1018
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:46,940
I'll go see Tom Petty in the hop, right?

1019
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:48,000
Because I don't want to be able to check it out.

1020
00:50:48,060 --> 00:50:48,880
See the one with this one, say?

1021
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,120
Yeah, the kind of little things written on them.

1022
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:50,720
Yeah, I like the kind.

1023
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:51,740
We're just talking, right?

1024
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:57,800
While we're talking, Jenny reaches over to my mother, right?

1025
00:50:57,860 --> 00:50:59,180
Now, my mother's like 50-something.

1026
00:50:59,180 --> 00:50:59,960
She's kind of heavy, right?

1027
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,620
She's got like big like pouches of skin like underneath of her arms.

1028
00:51:02,780 --> 00:51:07,800
And Jenny grabs him and starts like walking him back and forth and like laughing hysterically.

1029
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:13,820
So I go, Jenny, my mother's not into it, right?

1030
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:15,980
Like she doesn't like it when people do that, right?

1031
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,180
But my mother's really cool, right?

1032
00:51:19,260 --> 00:51:23,100
She just like gets up and she goes over to wash and wipe and spray and dust and polish

1033
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:25,880
and Windex and the insides of the handles of the module compartment, the piccolini compartment,

1034
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,120
the mayonnaise compartment, the refrigerator.

1035
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:29,160
Because you get really grungy if you leave more than a few hours.

1036
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:29,620
Right?

1037
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:32,920
Jenny follows her.

1038
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:34,480
And she takes the spoon.

1039
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,980
You know the spoon with the little holes in the bottom and the picture of Bullwinkle

1040
00:51:36,980 --> 00:51:40,360
that you use to ladle the five pounds of butter and lard into the Rice Krispie brownies, right?

1041
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,940
She takes that and it's like a little melted from the dishwasher.

1042
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:50,740
She takes down my mother's pants and sticks it like up her and starts like gooking it around.

1043
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:54,420
Like, but my mother's really cool, right?

1044
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,080
She like doesn't say anything, right?

1045
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,860
She just like keeps washing and wiping and spraying and dusting and polishing.

1046
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:02,200
Windex and spraying and polishing, wiping and washing and drying and spraying and polishing

1047
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,640
and dusting and Windex and keeping up her end of the conversation, right?

1048
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,360
Plus she's trying to distract Jenny saying, oh, Jenny, did you hear the new Men at Work album?

1049
00:52:09,580 --> 00:52:11,840
Jenny goes, who looks men at work?

1050
00:52:12,420 --> 00:52:12,780
Right?

1051
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:15,420
Like the greatest rock stars.

1052
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,440
Well, anyway, it doesn't matter.

1053
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:19,600
Anyway, my mother keeps, you know, washing and wiping and spraying and dusting and polishing,

1054
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,060
trying to distract her, singing little songs.

1055
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,040
La, la, la, la.

1056
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:23,120
Jenny keeps gooking it around.

1057
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:23,720
I go, Jenny.

1058
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,100
Jenny.

1059
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:28,580
You don't just come into somebody else's house and start messing around.

1060
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:28,840
We're going to do it.

1061
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:29,720
We're the tableware.

1062
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:33,680
Right then my father comes in.

1063
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,760
Now, my father's like getting ready to go to work, right?

1064
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,900
So he's got like about 19 wristwatches on each arm.

1065
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:40,060
His body's papered with invoices.

1066
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,180
He's got a cash register strapped to each side of his head and a computer terminal coming

1067
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:45,660
out of his anus and his appointments are written on the back of his eyelids because he's getting

1068
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,540
ready to go to work, right?

1069
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:52,700
Jenny takes one look at him and she figures he's just like bobbed up, right?

1070
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,080
Like she's like God, right?

1071
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:54,880
Like big brother.

1072
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,880
And she can just like make a judgment, right?

1073
00:52:56,940 --> 00:52:57,980
And like say who's...

1074
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:58,900
Bobbed up.

1075
00:52:59,080 --> 00:52:59,820
Who isn't, right?

1076
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:05,500
So she figures that gives her the right to take the company's dictaphone out of his mouth

1077
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,320
and start shoving it in and out of his...

1078
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:09,620
Dorsal bob receptacle.

1079
00:53:09,860 --> 00:53:10,320
All right.

1080
00:53:12,540 --> 00:53:14,740
And it's like the company's, right?

1081
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,680
Like it doesn't even belong to my father, right?

1082
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:19,780
But like that's cool, right?

1083
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:23,660
Except after about 30 minutes, he starts to notice.

1084
00:53:24,600 --> 00:53:27,820
And I can tell he starts to notice because like, well, he doesn't really get an expression.

1085
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:27,960
Right?

1086
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:28,460
He doesn't really get any expression on his face.

1087
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,400
But like there's two little muscles on the sides of his mouth that like wiggle a little

1088
00:53:31,400 --> 00:53:31,960
bit, right?

1089
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:36,760
So I go, Jenny, he knows.

1090
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:40,060
And pretty soon my father's going, the dictaphone.

1091
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:40,820
Where is it?

1092
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:44,200
Because it's time for him to dictate his inventory of ways to categorize systems of inventories

1093
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,000
of category systems.

1094
00:53:46,820 --> 00:53:49,180
Meanwhile, my mother knows something weird is going on because she's looking through

1095
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,080
the cabinets and she can't find the bow-winkle spoon.

1096
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,920
Right then, Jenny starts to get really mean, right?

1097
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,660
She takes apart the TV.

1098
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:01,580
And she hooks it up to my mother's brain so whatever my mother thinks appears on the screen.

1099
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:06,940
So like on the screen is this huge army stretching the horizon of nothing but Purdue oven stuffer

1100
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:07,320
roasters.

1101
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:10,540
And they're being led on a charge by Quincy and an 83 Cadillac.

1102
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:14,400
And all the roasters are holding spray cans full of right guard, except Quincy's got a

1103
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:16,020
bazooka full of cheese whiz.

1104
00:54:16,140 --> 00:54:19,660
And they're all like blasting away at the bad guy army of lesbians and Puerto Ricans

1105
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,780
and household owners and bathtub rings and dogs that go to the bathroom on the lawn.

1106
00:54:24,820 --> 00:54:26,740
Right then, my brother comes in.

1107
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,620
Now my brother's like going out with Jenny, right?

1108
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,300
So they start like making out, right?

1109
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:33,220
But after about two minutes, Jenny's going,

1110
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:35,800
Alright, where is it?

1111
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,640
Where is it?

1112
00:54:36,660 --> 00:54:37,840
Because my brother had unscrewed his bob.

1113
00:54:38,280 --> 00:54:41,000
And he keeps it in his briefcase because he doesn't like the crease it makes his pants.

1114
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:45,420
Now as far as Jenny's concerned, that's like just weird, right?

1115
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:47,220
Like she can just make a judgment, right?

1116
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:48,200
Like she's God, right?

1117
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:49,520
And she can just say, right?

1118
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,400
That's weird, right?

1119
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:52,660
So she goes off in the corner to masturbate.

1120
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,360
Like that's like less weird, right?

1121
00:54:55,900 --> 00:54:56,720
Anyway, my brother says,

1122
00:54:56,740 --> 00:54:58,460
Jenny sees her masturbating and he goes to get his tape recorded

1123
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,480
because he's doing this article about girls who like sex.

1124
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,900
By the time he gets back, she's already stopped.

1125
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:07,640
And he gets so pissed off, he decides he's not going to suffer for his art anymore

1126
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:08,920
and he's going to learn a trade, right?

1127
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,080
So my mother freaks.

1128
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,840
So she sends him upstairs to work on his novel, right?

1129
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:14,860
Now meanwhile, my mother's got her head in the oven

1130
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:16,680
because he just colored her hair and she's drying it, right?

1131
00:55:17,660 --> 00:55:19,080
Jenny turns the heat down.

1132
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,300
So it comes like slightly less orange, right?

1133
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:23,980
My mother freaks.

1134
00:55:23,980 --> 00:55:26,280
So she calls her analyst, you know, to find out how to deal with her anger.

1135
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,220
And her analyst tells her she's angry because of like, you know,

1136
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,980
too much defense spending and like not enough social programs, right?

1137
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:35,400
And the reason she lets that get to her is because she has to increase her daily intake

1138
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:39,960
of Haldol, Tylenol, Thorazine, Mylonol, Stelazine, Lithium, Percodan, Ritalin, Valium, and Melarell, right?

1139
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:43,400
So she does what she always does when she gets anxious.

1140
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:46,240
She gives herself little tests about how much she remembers from McCall's articles

1141
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:50,740
about the 10 best diet programs you can buy to make your 50-year-old tummy look like Suzanne Somers's.

1142
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,780
Right then, my sister comes in.

1143
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,200
Now my sister's really cool, right?

1144
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:00,640
She's like totally hip, right?

1145
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,980
She's like 5'9".

1146
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:05,780
She weighs like 30, right?

1147
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:15,200
She's got like no hips and no tummy and no cheeks and like purple lips and paisley chicken wire hair

1148
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:19,100
and 40-inch heels and spandex nipples and about 20 cigarettes in her mouth and her nose and her ears.

1149
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:21,760
And she had her cheekbones injected with silicone so they'd stick out.

1150
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:24,420
Plus she had her eyes pierced.

1151
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:24,760
She's really cool.

1152
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:25,620
She's really punked out, right?

1153
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:29,200
Now my sister's been on a little diet, right?

1154
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:32,360
So she hasn't eaten anything in like three or four years.

1155
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,400
You know, bring her cheeks in.

1156
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:39,080
And her legs are starting to like flake off like a little bit, right?

1157
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:42,000
Ginny tells her,

1158
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:45,060
My sister freaks.

1159
00:56:45,060 --> 00:56:48,340
So she goes down to the Big Mac walk-in storage cooler we have in the basement, right?

1160
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:54,300
She eats about 20 Big Macs, gets a blackhead on one cheek, sees it, and slits her wrists.

1161
00:56:56,460 --> 00:56:57,820
Now that's cool, right?

1162
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:02,620
Like nobody says anything because everybody in the family figures, you know, that's like just her trip, right?

1163
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,540
That's like what she's into, right?

1164
00:57:06,460 --> 00:57:08,220
So like nobody says anything, right?

1165
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,300
Except she does it right next to the sudsy, does it?

1166
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,980
Odorific, lucky, lemon-flavored, clean formula, dispensamatic.

1167
00:57:15,020 --> 00:57:20,360
You know, where you keep the fluid that softens the gloves you need to clean the special sponge that deodorizes the lemon-flavored coffee spout cleanser.

1168
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,280
She bleeds all over the Simon & Zayt.

1169
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:25,040
She's off to the next station.

1170
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:27,440
My mother freaks.

1171
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:28,760
No bounty.

1172
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,040
So first she tries to dry it up with my sister's hair, right?

1173
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:33,280
But it scratches the linoleum?

1174
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:38,700
So then she tries to use the heavy-duty tarpaulin that my father used to keep the oxygen off his new $100 bills, right?

1175
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:41,700
So he freaks because she's getting the serial numbers all mixed up.

1176
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:44,560
And he tries to hit her, but he can't remember how to make a fist.

1177
00:57:44,860 --> 00:57:47,220
And anyway, he can't get the dollar bills unstuck from the fingers.

1178
00:57:48,140 --> 00:57:50,380
So when he hits her, one of the bills rips.

1179
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:52,600
And this makes him feel an emotion, right?

1180
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:54,260
Which puts an expression on his face.

1181
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:58,520
right? So my mother freaks and she gets so scared she calls her analyst, you know, find out what

1182
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:03,100
drug to take. Meanwhile, my brother hears all the noise, figures my sister must have tried to kill

1183
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:07,860
herself for the third time this week, and comes downstairs to take notes. My father sees him

1184
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:11,920
sitting on the floor instead of on the chair, figures he must need money, and offers him some.

1185
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:19,320
My brother refuses money, right? So my father freaks out so bad he tries to kill himself by

1186
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,900
leaving the house without his wallet, but as soon as he takes it out of his pocket, he starts to

1187
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:28,080
suffocate. My brother has just started making the film of him suffocating when my mother finds out

1188
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:32,260
her analyst is on vacation, and she tries to kill herself by standing in the bathroom without any

1189
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:40,360
air freshener. Now, all this is cool, right? Like, I'm not saying anything because I figure it's just

1190
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:44,960
like what they're into, right? It's just like their trip, so like I don't say anything, right?

1191
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:52,780
Not Jenny. She figures she can just like make a judgment, right? Like she's like,

1192
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:58,960
God, right? Like big brother, right? So she's decided that like my family's like bobbed up,

1193
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:03,420
right? So she takes a machine gun my father uses for hunting household odors,

1194
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:11,380
and she tells me to stand behind her. So I figured she was just gonna like wound everybody,

1195
00:59:11,540 --> 00:59:17,660
you know, get in the papers and get book offers. Not Jenny. She kills everybody,

1196
00:59:17,940 --> 00:59:21,620
plus she wrecks my brother's notes, plus she wrecks the tape recorder.

1197
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:31,800
I go, Jenny, if you wrecked the notes, how are we going to write the hit novel about it?

1198
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:42,960
Jenny goes, we're not going to write the hit novel. I go, Jenny, if you wrecked the tapes,

1199
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:50,200
how are we going to make the hit single about it? She goes, we're not going to make the hit single.

1200
00:59:52,180 --> 00:59:52,880
So I go, Jenny, if you wrecked the tape recorder, how are we going to write the hit novel about it?

1201
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:58,900
I go, Ginny, if we don't write the hit novel and we don't make the hit single,

1202
00:59:59,180 --> 01:00:03,100
how are we going to get into People's Court, Real People, and People magazine?

1203
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:10,460
She says, we're not going to get into People's Court, Real People, and People magazine.

1204
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:14,700
Now I know she's crazy, right?

1205
01:00:14,780 --> 01:00:20,280
I go, Ginny, if we don't get into People's Court, Real People, and People magazine,

1206
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:22,460
what's the use in living?

1207
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:28,240
Ginny just, like, looks at me, right?

1208
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:31,860
And then she turns the gun on me.

1209
01:00:33,580 --> 01:00:37,860
I go, Ginny, you're a young person.

1210
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:40,420
You're only supposed to hate grown-ups.

1211
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,920
She says, yeah, but in 22 years, I never met any.

1212
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:52,020
And then she turns the gun on herself,

1213
01:00:52,200 --> 01:00:52,860
and I go, Ginny, if we don't get into People's Court, Real People, and People magazine,

1214
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:53,660
Ginny kills herself.

1215
01:00:56,100 --> 01:00:56,720
Right?

1216
01:00:58,280 --> 01:01:04,260
Like, no press conference, no talk shows, no soundtrack albums, no tour, no previews,

1217
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,860
no big name backup, nothing.

1218
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:10,520
Just, like, death.

1219
01:01:13,020 --> 01:01:15,780
Like, who's going to make rock and roll about that?

1220
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:18,220
Yeah.

1221
01:01:18,220 --> 01:01:18,560
Yeah.

1222
01:01:19,500 --> 01:01:20,120
Yeah.

1223
01:01:20,920 --> 01:01:21,540
Yeah.

1224
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:22,840
Yeah.

1225
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:22,840


1226
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:22,840


1227
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:22,840


1228
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:22,840


1229

Teenage girls.
