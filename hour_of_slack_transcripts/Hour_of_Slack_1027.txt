Ask any waitress and she'll tell you that the small cube of cigarette ashes makes the wonderful difference in flakiness.
Rub a cigarette butt in the palm of your hand.
You'll feel the fleas drop off immediately.
They puff, bubble, and turn into the kind of crust every cook is proud to bake.
Get several packages.
For some unexplained reason, the General Motors Research Laboratories have recently issued a bulletin that adds tenderness and flakiness to your pie crust.
You know, the kind you make every time when you use dry snuff and then brush it thoroughly into the hide.
Well, I guess that should keep you busy over the weekend.
This is the Radio Network.

There was a garden.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
There was a tree.
Uh-oh.
And there were three of me.
I was a snake and a crow and a cat.
And in the tree all three of me sat for eternity.
And that was that.
One night,
an apple grew and the apple knew everything that I knew it was part of me and it was part of the
tree the tree that I climbed into and flew into and slithered to and now I grew and there I sat
as an apple and a snake and a crow and a cat and that was pretty much that until one day
a girl who was not me came out to play and I could see what she wanted from me she wanted to
know what the Apple knew and I said you already do my dear otherwise you wouldn't be here and
she said please I've come to eat the apples from the tree
and I said no I am an apple and a snake and a cat and a crow and she said please I need to have that
apple inside of me she wanted to know everything I knew and I said but my dear you already do then
she stamped her foot and said for heaven's sake why can't you be me
a cat and a crow and a snake and I said no let the Apple go then she took a bite and I could tell
that she knew I was right she walked away weeping with the apple in her hand and fed my secrets to
another man so I slid away and flew away and out of the tree I ran I who was once one and I was one
now forever three a cat and a crow and a snake without a tree just a snake and a crow and a cat
and that was that uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh uh-oh the Billy Nair show did that friends and they like

Funny how that works.
If I was just sitting at home saying this to myself, nothing, nada, zero zip.
But because I'm on the air.
You think it's incredibly interesting.
And it is.
My life.
To somebody as long as one person.
If we're getting through to even one soul.
That's all that matters.
That's all that matters.
If we didn't get one soul in Bob's pipe tonight.
Then it's all worth it.
All of it.

It's all worth it if you are saved.
I think I want to get one of those little Reese buttercups in the shape of Hal.
I'll get two of those.
Wow.
Just having a little good-natured laugh at the Reverend, Reverend Dr. Hal, who is now, only now, just showing up.
Sure.
He's shown me up so many times.
I dare you to say a Hal-ism.
I doffed my hat to Hal.
We couldn't believe it because we've been following your progress by traffic report.
And that whole, you know, that car crash that killed so many hundreds of people.
What's happening?
Backed up all the way to San Jose.
All the way to San Jose.
And you have to get in the back of the line.
Even if you start in San Francisco, they make you go all the way back to San Jose and come back.
You know, I don't like to complain, but I've got some terrible things going on in there.
Like everybody else.
It's scratched in my ear.
Oh, I think old Reverend Stang.
He's up there in his high hill.
His big couch on the hill up there.
That big fancy trailer of his.
Oh, yeah.
Reverend Stang, you don't have to think about him.

We don't know if tomorrow might be X-Day.
We don't know if this is Earth for sure.
Why do you think this is Earth?
I'm all confused now.
Which one's X-Day?
You just read it in a book somewhere.
Some scientist told you.
This is planet Earth.
Yeah, it could be K-Day.
And you're so sure of everything.
Oh, today is this date.
November 25, 2005.
Oh, it must be right.
Oh, this planet.
This must be Earth.
Oh, it's always been the United States of America.
Oh, yeah.
You assume so much.
And you don't know nothing.
You don't know a dang thing.
Nothing.
You don't know nothing?
You don't know less than nothing.
But what was this about Jack Ruby didn't have a molar?
What am I going to do?
And if you insist on being blind,
then why don't you just tear out your eyes
and send them to P.O. Box 181417, Cleveland, Idaho, 44118.
And why is it?
Because Bob loves you!
And puzzling evidence killed him for you.
Yep, sure did.
And what about that?
What is he going to do about it?
What is it like to know that you have to kill Bob?
This is the moment to know that you have to kill Bob.
The warfare is what killed him.
The warfare is what killed him.
We as people have to kill Bob in our minds.
It's salty out there at night and it's cold.
The guy from Star Trek, his...
He blasted him with some air.
Well, it was his will that he left him a sizable parcel as part of his estate.
Yeah.
And he was the warfare at that time.
Yeah.
But unfortunately after this we had a complete blackout of the records
and we weren't able to run them through our high-powered computer.
Until just a few moments ago when Ivan Stang began his historic broadcast.
And now the results are in.
It looks like Kennedy by a landslide.
That's right.
He is dead by a landslide and...
They're clearing off that landslide now and apparently no one was seriously hurt.
But why did no one try to kill Nixon?
That's the question.
I concede the sacred scribe ship to President John F. Kennedy.
An idiot like Ford, they tried to kill...
We will bear any burden.
...in Cuba.
That's right.
And it's not in Cuba, it's in Vietnam.
What about the prizes here?
We will be a church.
Well, ask Kennedy.
He's the sacred scribe now.
Somebody's going to be awarding the prizes a little later on in the program.
Oh, I thought it was we will accept any prize.
He's known to accept...
...with a ground war that they couldn't win.
We will hold on to any prize.
But Kennedy's policy was special forces in Vietnam.
Yeah, and...
They're very special.
...subgenius forces in Dallas.
Yep.
Where are the tapes with Maryland?
Somehow Kennedy's plan went wrong.
Who has the Maryland tapes?
Yeah, and all the other tapes.
There are many Maryland tapes.
Think of all the tapes.
That's the problem is you have to store them.
So bad guys have warehouses full of tapes.
Well, all the Judah Vickners.

No, that's right.

Where is he, by the way?
Not this Bobby De Niro movie guy.
Where is the Penguin?
The real arch-criminal that the Penguin was based on.
It's a real person.
The Batman comic book, of course, popularized this.
They cartooned him up a bit.
But there was a deformed criminal called the Penguin.
Called himself the head of the family.
A big belly like a fat guy?
That's right.
Wow.
That's right.
That's how you have to say it when you speak about the brow.
But he fancied himself vaguely intellectual in some way.
The Penguin did.
I must say.
The made-in-form brow was a not-so-manly version of the same thing.
I thought the Brow was very true.
But the original brow sent his armies out to collect all those images.

Yes, J.R. Bob Dobbs.
What?
The son of...
Jesus.
Gamera.
Jane McBride Dobbs, the sainted mother.
She tried to abort.
What?
The infant Bob because she wasn't really supposed to be pregnant.
Well, it was supposed to be.
But, unfortunately, the tenacious fetus hung in there and was not actually successfully aborted until Jane McBride Dobbs was strapped down in a Kansas wheat field in front of a tornado's path.
The tornado was able to extract the tiny infant Dobbs.
Susan Sarandon.
But then, when Jane saw the preemie Dobbs laying in that field panting and bleeding, she, of course, loved him.
She could no longer go through with the abortion, and she loved him as do all whose eyes fall upon him.
And she took Bob home and raised him.
So, friends, remember, the next time you're getting an abortion, just think about Bob.
If they'd successfully aborted him, then maybe we wouldn't...
We wouldn't have a church in the subgenius.
We wouldn't have.
Maybe that's an argument for abortion.
I don't know.
I'm going to go out and get one right away.
We would have no reason to exist.
I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.
I'm going to go.
We wouldn't have slack.
Philo's abortion.
Well...
That was a great band, Philo's abortion.
Yeah, they were...
I got proud when they broke up.
Philo's, oh...
You know, I was almost aborted, actually.
Were you?
I was.
It was a...
Wishful thinking.
It was a partial abortion.
...to term with a cancer.
And they said...
I'm not on Bob.
They said...
First, they said it's a cancer.
He was about 35.
And then they said, no, it's not a cancer.
It's breathing.
And then the third opinion was...
It's cancer.
I'm not on Bob.
I'm not on Bob.
I'm not on Bob.
I'm not on Bob.

And because it was a Catholic doctor, they didn't abort me.
And, I mean, the cancer died.
That was a great song, Abort Me.
The baby died, but I was born.
You can...
I'll be buried, of course.
And, no, that's a true story.
The twin...
My mother was brought in, and she...
Robert Pepe.
She deliberately went to a Catholic doctor.
That means her father pulled out.
Beware ye the Jesse Pepe ghost.
Weren't you one half of Simon Quinn?
Which hovers just behind Michael Pepe.
Michael Pepe.

When he, the twin Jesse Pepe, had the doctor.

Oh, all the other ones except for this one.

That's what we want to know.

Why, of course.

Is it Grenada or Grenada?

Oh, by this mother and father.
Should we invade our mother and father?
Folks, we're here to give you answers, not questions.
I have a plot reserved for Osama Bin Laden.
He's associated with two CIA contractors. Well, CIA contractor, David Ferry.
That's right. That's right. Ferry. Not Brian, but David Ferry, who worked with the Cubans.
And, of course, what is the most interesting thing is the fact that one man did give his life for Kennedy,
and that man is Sam Giancana.
Now, all this stuff about JFK, you're talking about?
Giancana gave his life for the US Senate because it was on the way to testify at the hearings for JFK's death
that Giancana was killed in his sleep.
1975, it was a shot to death.
Why?
Beat by the other mafia, who didn't want him talking about their role in the assassination of the President,
the president. Why is that? Because they didn't want to get in trouble with the government.
But why? Then why did Connie do this? This is Connie? No, this is why the mob hit Sam
Giancana. So the mob assassinated him? Yeah. You keep saying that so fast, it just sounds
like Connie to me. No, Connie, that's because that's what's on my mind when I'm thinking
about Tommy. Tommy or Connie? I'm thinking about Tommy a little, not really so much,
but Connie, because she who is all women. Would he be a Connie or a Connie? As usual,
the women have been driven from the show. And Darrison said the implementation of your
assassination occurred in my jurisdiction. I will put one on the phone for you at your
discretion. Yeah. Oh, okay. Hold on. All right. But they better be sexy because this is the
subgenius. John is alive. Johnny is still alive. He is? He really was not shot. Did
you, did you, have you, how do you know him? It was a figment of every opinion.
Yes. The most handsome man in American history. And of course his son, the most handsome man
in the world. He's alive, I tell you. Yeah. Yeah, but where is he? He's in a wheelchair
in Bermuda, right? Yeah. Well, that's, that's. I can see him. He took, yeah, that's, that's
the other thing is that he like took a, took a taxi secretly away from the, the promenade.
Away from the pool of blood. Yeah. And the large piece of hair. And the, uh.
That's just another. And he zoomed away and he took a, Kennedy was the one that took the
cab into Fort Worth. You know. And Kennedy was the one who shot himself in the grassy
knoll. Right. That's the secret. That's the other thing is that he had been depressed
at the end. And, uh, but pay no attention to that. You know. All right. Yeah. Just forget
that stuff. Forget. It's too frightening to comprehend. I forgot. See what happens? You
get caught up in echo loops. What?
You just get. Yeah, that's right. And you never get away from it. That's right. I'd
like to show. How many shots were there in Gilly Plaza? But you can help these children
by killing the Prime Minister and the ministers. Yeah. Let's talk about Prime Ministers. That's
at least a little bit different. Um, no. And now it's time for a book review, friends.
And a confession. Uh, the review is about the book Ultimate Sacrifice by Lamar Waldron
and, uh, my friends for 10 years, I, Reverend Ivan Stang, have been part of the JFK coverup.
Uh, I can heave a big sigh of relief now because now it can be told and has been in that book,
Ultimate Sacrifice. You know, the JFK assassination is like the Bible. Whatever be is in your bonnet,
whatever you want to prove, if you're a kook, you're a kook.
Your proof is in the JFK assassination. If you're a Warren Commission kook or a case-closed nut,
you won't like the Ultimate Sacrifice. Uh, if you're an Oliver Stone version, the CIA did it
kook, you won't like the Ultimate Sacrifice. But if you're a mafia did it, but how'd they get away
with it kook like I am, this book explains pretty much how and why they got away with it. And it
doesn't do it from hearsay or...
reference to other JFK books. Uh, it draws on 17 years of really serious research and interviews,
uh, and all those various assassination commissions. And the reason I know this,
besides the 10,000 page bibliography and index on the thing, is that, uh, I know the author and
I've been watching the progress of this thing for,
some time now, Ultimate Sacrifice, John and Robert Kennedy, the plan for a kook in Cuba,
and the murder of JFK. It's only in hardcover yet. Um, as it says here, the book reveals for
the first time John and Robert Kennedy's top secret plan to stage a kook against Castro and
invade Cuba on December 1st, 1963. But the Kennedy kook plan was infiltrated into the
city of Chicago, Tampa, and Louisiana, Texas, who were under intense pressure from Attorney General
Robert Kennedy. These mob bosses used parts of the Kennedy kook plan to kill JFK, first trying in
Chicago, then Tampa, and finally Dallas, in a way that forced key officials to cover up crucial
information to protect national security. And, uh, yes, friends, I've been part of the cover-up
until now. Actually, I'm going to continue it because, you know, I've been part of the cover-up
for a long time. But, uh, you, you should at least look at their website, which is
ultimatesacrificethebook.com. One word, ultimatesacrifice the book. But, uh, William
Turner, FBI agent, said that at last the mysteries surrounding JFK's deaths are fully explained by
the startling revelations in this book. There actually is some startling stuff, and it is true.
Um,
it's fresh groundbreaking research documents how the blowback from the Kennedy's actions against
the mafia and Cuba led to the death of JFK. Ultimate Sacrifice provides the final word on
why the government had to cover up so much information for so long. Publishers Weekly said,
called it a relentless accumulation of detail, very thorough knowledge of every political and
forensic detail and the broad perspective of historians rather than assassination theorists.
No future historian of that tormented period in American history will be able to ignore their
very convincing presentation. That was Publishers Weekly. And, uh, New York Post's Liz Smith said,
I believe this book is the closest we're going to get to the truth until 2017,
when the CIA and Kennedy papers are all finally released. Well, friends, you, uh,
hour of slack listeners know that the world will end long before that. But, uh, so,
if you care, you might want to check that out. Uh, Ultimate Sacrifice by Lamar Waldron and Tom Hartman,
ultimatesacrificethebook.com. Praise Bob.
Lamar and, yeah, Lamar and his co-author speak to the, to the national cameras of men who killed
Kennedy. And, uh, I'll put it on day-by-day for you when I find it. How many men who killed
Kennedy are there? I mean, aside from all of them, there's a lot of men who killed Kennedy.
All of the Oswalt's. They're all the photographers, all of the guys that gun cleaners. My dad did it.
Fabian! Her dad. My kids. Yeah, yeah. My uncle, brother, sister, mother. They sinned before they
were alive. Had a baby. Or was I? I killed you before you were even born. Bob Dobbs killed JFK.
Bob Dobbs is a porn star.
We already know that. Oh. He's not just a porn star. He's the porn star. With Jesus as a supporting
actress. He is sex. He's the, you know, you know, also the, one of the nicer things happens on
today's date, which is, uh, the first snuff film televised on American television. Oh, how lovely.
That makes me out of it. The Oswalt shooting on Sunday was actually televised, whereas Kennedy's
murder you don't see until 1978. I know. And Michael, I'm going to tell us more shallow,
sad ones. Quiet. But old JFK, I mean, uh.
Little LHO is the first superstar in that sense. You know, the Andy Warhol.
Just 15 minutes. Yeah. And he didn't even know. Although people kept intimating, you know,
the officer that's handcuffed to him just two minutes before says, uh, you know, this way I
can throw myself in front of everybody who wants to shoot you. And he says, oh, nobody wants to
shoot me. I'd throw myself on you. And how many licks does it take to get to the center of a
Tootsie Pop? Or Fabian.
He's probably making a joke.
He was a joker, Lee.
From PR News in Washington, I'm calling for hurricanes from Venezuela. Venezuela will be

People will be a little bit higher, but, um, um, duh.
AAA says most of those traveling over the holiday weekend will be high in West.
Cleveland. Forecasters say thousands of low-income people will get help with PR News from Venezuela.
A is for after. B for before. C for the center between the two times. D for deceit. E, even more deceitful than D.
Who the fuck thought of D?
F is for friendship before the deceit. And after even more so than I needed to try.
But G turned to gray. And H turned to hate. And that's great.
I is for illusion. And I'm idealistic. And I can act like an imbecile at times.
J is for the way that you jumped all the facts.
K is for your last attempt to be kind.
L is for liar. And that never changes.
M, could you ever be mine?
N?
Oh, that spells nerve.
P for this way that I pine.
Q is the question to which I always knew the answer.
R is the answer to the question.

Y for your reluctant reply.
S for the sobbing.
T for the tears.
And U for this useless waste of my time.
V doesn't matter.
And W is for why.
Which is the question I keep asking.
But it doesn't really matter.
X doesn't matter.
And Y, like I just finished telling you, is the question.
And Y, like I just finished telling you, is the question.
But it doesn't really matter.
Z and A, B, C don't matter.
D is for doesn't.
And it doesn't really matter.
Cause E doesn't matter.
And F doesn't matter.
Since G turned to gray.
And H turned to eight.
And that's great.
