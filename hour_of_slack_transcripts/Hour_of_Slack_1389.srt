1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,300
Dear friends, and praise Bob, we'll be on the air live tonight.

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,740
Buzzy should be calling in after a while, and no one else.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,240
We have a different show.

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,280
We're mostly going to be playing funny music tonight by Princess Wee's Boyfriends.

5
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:22,040
Hey.

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,400
Oh, sorry.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,140
Now you can say it.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,760
Hey.

9
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,960
Well, she's just a big fan of some of these people.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:33,100
Actually, it's mostly my boyfriends.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,620
It's mostly Rudy Schwartz Project.

12
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:35,160
Yeah.

13
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,640
But your boyfriend is Ted Ganger and Jonathan Colton.

14
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,020
Yeah.

15
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,300
My boyfriend is Rudy Schwartz Project.

16
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:42,080
Yeah.

17
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,560
And his little buddy, Waldo.

18
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,420
Do you have anything by Ken Nordean?

19
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:46,220
He's my boyfriend.

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:47,920
Ken Nordean?

21
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:49,240
I broke up with Ken Nordean.

22
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,120
Oh, you guys broke up?

23
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:50,500
Yeah.

24
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:51,700
Didn't work?

25
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,120
Well, actually, I guess I played all of his stuff.

26
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:55,740
For the first time.

27
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:57,260
First 10 years of Hour of Slack.

28
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,080
And then we...

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,060
He actually used to send stuff directly to us.

30
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:01,460
Oh, wow.

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,080
And we would send stuff to him.

32
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,500
Then I got mail from his son, who was a UFO believer dude.

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:15,140
I don't think he quite understood our type of UFO belief.

34
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:20,220
They're more unidentified to us, most of them.

35
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:20,700
Yes.

36
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,540
So we're not trying to second guess them anymore.

37
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,080
No.

38
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:25,560
Because we know.

39
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,140
We'll be here December 21st, 2012.

40
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:29,800
Right.

41
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:32,900
It's just that we don't know what the real date of today is.

42
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,760
Anyway, now...

43
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:42,760
Meanwhile, gaseous rhetoric and stupid, bombastic, empty speechifying.

44
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,640
The subgenius of Hour of Slack.

45
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,960
They need Jesus.

46
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,320
Yes.

47
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:51,400
Yes.

48
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,620
Yes.

49
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,340
Yes.

50
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,060
Yes.

51
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:55,740
Yes.

52
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


53
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


54
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


55
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


56
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


57
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


58
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


59
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


60
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


61
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


62
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


63
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


64
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


65
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


66
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


67
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


68
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


69
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


70
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


71
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


72
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


73
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


74
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:55,740


75
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,180
Yes.

76
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:10,940


77
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,740
Yes.

78
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:25,740


79
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:25,740


80
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:25,740


81
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:25,740


82
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:25,740


83
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:25,740


84
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:25,740


85
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:25,740


86
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,000
Well, come on down to Barbecue Bud's

87
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,980
Won't you come on down to Barbecue Bud's

88
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,880
There's a corn dog special at Barbecue Bud's

89
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,940
So won't you come on down and let Bud fix you up with a corn dog

90
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,480
Whoa, sweet patootie, Bud's got a beauty

91
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,520
Whoa, sweet patootie, Bud's got a beauty

92
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,380
Bud's a slinging corn dog, so come on down

93
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:11,360
Bring all the kids, cause there's lots of balloons and prizes

94
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:13,960
Jump inside

95
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,780
Jump inside

96
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,340
Jump inside

97
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,940
Jump inside of the corn dog wheel

98
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,980
Take a spin and Bud's big corn dog wheel

99
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,880
Round and around and a swirly birdie do

100
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:39,000
You might win a date with Pia Zadora

101
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,000
You might win a date with Pia Zadora

102
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,560
She's got lots of fascinating stuff she wants to say to you

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,980
Swirly birdie do

104
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,260
Oh, Pia, bring me that corn dog, won't you, darling?

105
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:23,240
Oh, Pia, bring me that corn dog, won't you, darling?

106
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,200
Oh, Pia, bring me that corn dog, won't you, darling?

107
00:04:53,240 --> 00:05:23,220
Oh, Pia, bring me that corn dog, won't you, darling?

108
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:53,200
Oh, Pia, bring me that corn dog, won't you, darling?

109
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,420
It's somecular sugar

110
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,320
Oh, I'm very very curious

111
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:58,640
I never heard of this business

112
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,120
Don't you believe me?

113
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,920
Oh, I'm very very sure

114
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,400
It's worth seeing

115
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:00,860
It's good

116
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,320
It's solid

117
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:06,980
Cheers

118
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:06,980


119
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,720
31

120
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:16,640
Are you OK with the school's opening song?

121
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:16,840


122
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,780
It's my favorite song

123
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,180
I heard as a pioneering best writer

124
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:23,180


125
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:30,620
Though it hurts me to say this, it is on my mind

126
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:37,400
Cause it really is true, though it isn't polite

127
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:47,020
Most people are stupid, though they don't hardly nose

128
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:51,860
Most people are stupid, that's the way it goes

129
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,560
Their minds are so narrow, there's nowhere to go

130
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,240
And nothing you say can change their point of view

131
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,640
Cause they know what they like, and they like what they know

132
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,100
And they think that they think, but they haven't a clue

133
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:17,540
Most people are stupid, no they're not very smart

134
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:21,840
Most people are stupid, but they have a clue

135
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,520
They have a good heart

136
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,200
They don't reach for things that are not in their reach

137
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,660
They just want to eat and drink and fuck and sleep

138
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:36,300
Maybe go on vacation and roast on the beach

139
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,680
And they might take a book if it isn't too deep

140
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,120
Most people are stupid, and they're on the same team

141
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,480
Most people are stupid

142
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:52,980
They could make me scream

143
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:29,340
They talk about nothing and work on their tan

144
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,960
It's not really clear why they would need a brain

145
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:36,240
But that's how it has been since the world began

146
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,700
They'll inherit the earth and they drive me insane

147
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:47,080
Most people are stupid, from their head to their toe

148
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,840
Most people are stupid, and they run the show

149
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:00,300
Most people are stupid, just admit that it's true

150
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:05,100
Most people are stupid, sometimes I'm stupid too

151
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:09,260
Most people are stupid, all except for a few

152
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,760
Most people are stupid

153
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:17,160
Of course I don't mean you

154
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,040
Most people are stupid, just admit that it's true

155
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Now I know that for many of you, you do things you know aren't right

156
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:41,080
That's okay, you have to let your failures define you to act right

157
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,920
And I am just so glad that you're stupid

158
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,220
And that's why I succeed

159
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,120
So today I want to ask all of you

160
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:51,840
Most people are stupid, just admit that it's true

161
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:51,840


162
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:51,840


163
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,020
What's your problem?

164
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,620
From kindergarten through twelfth grade

165
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:56,620
You're stupid

166
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,040
I know that feeling

167
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,460
It's a fact

168
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:04,960
Stupid people have stupid children

169
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,320
If you're stupid, please, don't have sex

170
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:12,500
If you insist on having sex, then please, have sex with animals

171
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:15,140
Preferably animals smarter than you are

172
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:19,600
That way, if by some biological fluke you and the animal actually have offspring

173
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,840
Odds are the offspring will be less stupid than you

174
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,640
One more thing

175
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,760
Don't assume the animal is protected

176
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,960
If the animal has a condom

177
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,420
Or a female, some sort of interuterine device

178
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,800
Insists they wear it

179
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,240
Please, help stamp out this mindless mindlessness

180
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,380
Keep your stupidity to yourself

181
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,520
This message brought to you by the Council of Concerned Citizens

182
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,080
Who are smarter than you are

183
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,000
oru

184
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000


185
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000


186
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,000


187
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:21,820
This things is all happening for you gamer

188
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:27,460
I gave a shattered radio revivalist

189
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:31,120
And with the boss man I've never been missed

190
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:34,120
Me so stupid

191
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:38,020
Me so stupid

192
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:41,860
Me so stupid

193
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,040
What is my IQ?

194
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,720
What is my IQ?

195
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,260
What is my intelligent quotient?

196
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,640
What is my IQ?

197
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,840
I could've been the Golden Gate Bridge

198
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,500
Or Einstein's nemesis

199
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:11,100
I could've been the Dirty Jacka

200
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,720
But it's all come down to this

201
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:17,900
Me so stupid

202
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:21,820
Me so stupid

203
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:21,820


204
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,040
So stupid.

205
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,760
Me so stupid.

206
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,060
What is my IQ?

207
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,840
What is my intelligent quotient?

208
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,360
What is my IQ?

209
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:49,540
What is my IQ?

210
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,160
Me so stupid.

211
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,080
Me so stupid.

212
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,540
What is my IQ?

213
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,340
What is my intelligent quotient?

214
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:09,760
Mm-mm.

215
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,360
Mm-mm.

216
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,380
That's so wrong.

217
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:20,320
And my little 11-year-old child, I think his mentality is much more alert than the 16-year-old boy.

218
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,080
The point is...

219
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:26,400
Stupidity is all around us, and it's not worth getting upset about.

220
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:28,720
It is not a thing a sane man would do.

221
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,560
The doomsday machine is designed to trigger itself automatically.

222
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,700
But surely you can disarm it somehow?

223
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,360
No.

224
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:39,300
It is designed to explode if any attempt is ever made to un-trigger it automatically.

225
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,700
It's an obvious comedy trick, Mr. President.

226
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,800
We're wasting valuable time.

227
00:14:43,060 --> 00:14:44,000
Let me make water.

228
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,660
We're getting ready to clobber us.

229
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:46,600
Stupid.

230
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,260
Stupid is there.

231
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:49,220
Large.

232
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,180
Polluting.

233
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:51,700
The time-space...

234
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,740
...discontinuum...

235
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,680
...with J.R. Bob Dobson!

236
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:13,360
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

237
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,000
Come on, everyone, join the fun

238
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,040
We've got tanking on the run

239
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,980
The Earth is circled by the sun

240
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,580
Creation science podcast

241
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:24,100
Science classes in our schools

242
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,040
Taught by superstitious fools

243
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:28,000
Jerry Falwell sets the rules

244
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,540
Creation science polka!

245
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:36,740
The universe was fabricated in six literal days

246
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:44,460
The humans and the dinosaurs shared a condo in L.A.

247
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:47,920
Carbon dating makes us cringe

248
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,900
We're the right-wing lunatic fringe

249
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,560
Jesus died for us!

250
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:51,560


251
00:15:51,580 --> 00:15:51,860
Our sins!

252
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,520
Creation science polka!

253
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,560
We're free!

254
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,840
Superhuman!

255
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,120


256
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:42,120


257
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:45,500
Infinite Will

258
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:45,500


259
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:51,360
The Bible says the Earth is only 6,000 years old.

260
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:51,560
Why did you fall?

261
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:59,940
Deny and Jesus Christ will roast your balls on burning coals

262
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,580
Come on everyone, join the fun

263
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,620
Ignorance has almost won

264
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,520
Get geology from a nun

265
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,160
Creation Science Polka

266
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:10,580
Take your children out of school

267
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,580
Homespun dogma is so cruel

268
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:14,660
Prop them up, watch them drool

269
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,220
Creation Science Polka

270
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:38,120
Ah, yes, and of course there's always Dave

271
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:39,540
Dave?

272
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,500
Hello, lurking

273
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,680
This buzz is enormous now

274
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,360
You mean you had Dave right there?

275
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,260
Let's listen, is the buzz there?

276
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,580
It's enormous on this end here

277
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,580
Oh yeah, I can hear the buzz

278
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,540
Can you limit me?

279
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,020
A little bit?

280
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,800
Yeah, everyone shut up for three seconds

281
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,500
Let me have some buzz tone, okay?

282
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,300
Three, two, one, now

283
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,400
Okay, that should do it

284
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:06,840
I'll just, I'll put some more buzzy music up

285
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,920
I have to do the credits, friends

286
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,240
I'm listening with pride

287
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,880
The, let's see, what are we, what are we

288
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,940
Oh, Creation Science Polka

289
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,980
And the opening song, Barbecue Buds

290
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:23,620
Is by the Rudy Schwartz Project

291
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:27,240
You can Google Rudy Schwartz Project

292
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:30,340
Schwartz is spelled S-C-H-W-A-R-T-Z

293
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,680
We played, this is unusual for us to play

294
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:36,540
What we call conspiracy music

295
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,040
But it's ZZ Top, so that doesn't count

296
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:39,300
No

297
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,240
Me so stupid

298
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,580
And the song Most People Are Stupid

299
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,720
Was by Ted Ganger

300
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,900
Who's an American who teaches music in Germany

301
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:51,520
He's the brother of the American

302
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,780
He's the brother of Sister Melodious Chops

303
00:18:53,780 --> 00:18:56,500
The famous subgenius songstress

304
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,080
And the leader of my band

305
00:18:59,080 --> 00:18:59,760
Right

306
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:07,600
In fact, we have a very sad and yet hilarious song

307
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,540
By Ted Ganger that we're going to be playing for Dave

308
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
For Dave?

309
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,980
I can hardly wait, my pants are already off

310
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,760
The shoes are on my ears

311
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,920
Oh, it's not going to do you any good once you hear this song

312
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,500
It's going to be a lot of fun

313
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,280
It's going to bring back sad

314
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:26,400
I'll bet you it brings back some sad memories

315
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:30,880
I hate sad memories

316
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,100
Why are you doing this to me?

317
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,520
Ted Ganger is a vocal coach

318
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,720
And a piano coach

319
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,500
And teacher, I believe

320
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,440
I'm mean

321
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,140
In Germany

322
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,940
That's the bottom line, I'm mean

323
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,860
I'm the mean one

324
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,460
Princess Wee is the nice one

325
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:49,200
I love hearing that, even if it's not true

326
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,520
Nor are all Germans mean

327
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:51,500
It's all true

328
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,340
Some of them mean a lot more than you expect

329
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,880
Like that Schrodinger guy

330
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:56,660
And what's his name, the philosopher

331
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,960
Wittgenstein, that's another one

332
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,280
Dave, you're sounding really lonesome

333
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,480
And you should talk as loud as you can

334
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,180
I'll scream if you need

335
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,820
No, okay, that's what I wanted to know

336
00:20:07,820 --> 00:20:13,740
Yeah, when you talk clearly and loudly

337
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,960
It overpowers the buzz a bit

338
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,660
We just wondered what the variances might possibly be

339
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,500
And you know, I don't know if I'm going to be able to do that

340
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:21,500


341
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,460
And now we know

342
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,840
You can speak up above the buzz

343
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:31,120
I will try and endeavor in every moment and every way

344
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:34,960
You can kind of like kiss on the microphone like you do

345
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,140
Okay

346
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,060
Make out with it

347
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,120
Ew, gross

348
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:40,600
Ew

349
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,340
I feel like I just made out with Lonesome Cowboy Dave

350
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:45,440
It smells right, my microphone

351
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,440
It does smell right

352
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,760
Because, you know, you always make that noise

353
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:51,600
When you're making out

354
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,120
Of course

355
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:00,640
No, no, say you two

356
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:04,520
God, I'll leave the mics on for half a second

357
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,020
And they're going at it like monkeys

358
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,500
No, don't let your voice get away from that phone

359
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,680
I won't

360
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:22,300
I'll put right up your words

361
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,360
Yeah, that sounds good

362
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:23,760
Yeah

363
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,840
I have to keep on using that same stupid voice whenever I go

364
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,340
I think I'll do a French waiterage

365
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:32,260
I will move my mouth much closer to the microphone

366
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,560
Yeah

367
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,980
The actual mouthpiece here of the telephone

368
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,300
I will jiggle some more wires

369
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
And perhaps hopefully in the background

370
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,200
Oh, oui, oui, monsieur

371
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:46,960
Oh, if I know your buzz, Dave

372
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:48,740
It'll go away after a while

373
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,740
And then just when we least expect it

374
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,160
It'll go after I hang up, that's what it'll do

375
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,220
Well, yeah, but it'll come back

376
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,260
But we're going to play music a couple of times

377
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:57,840
In order to hide the buzz

378
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,580
I do have music in the background here

379
00:22:00,580 --> 00:22:01,040
But it's

380
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,780
It kind of fights

381
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:04,560
The buzz fights it a little bit

382
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:05,940
It's Rudy Schwartz' project

383
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,240
From that same

384
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:10,340
He did a new release of his album

385
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,140
Don't Get Charred, Get Puffy

386
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,900
Yeah, yeah

387
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:14,820
That's good advice

388
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,360
You know, if you're suffering from fourth degree burns

389
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,300
All over your body

390
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,200
Dave, I can't hear you

391
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,640
Rudy Schwartz is full of advice

392
00:22:24,980 --> 00:22:26,800
You know, I think I'm going to take

393
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,420
The Rudy Schwartz project off

394
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,500
And put on

395
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,340
Witch Disco

396
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:32,880
I'll put on Witch Disco

397
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,780
Or I actually have some

398
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,680
Flying Mayan Brothers, you might say

399
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,800
Oh, that would make more sense

400
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,520
Because we're going to explode here

401
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,040
In the next month coming up

402
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:45,200
Right, in a very Mayan way

403
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,920
So Flying Mayan Brothers would be great

404
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,380
I don't even know what this sounds like

405
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:49,620
I'll go ahead and put it on

406
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,760
And we'll see what it does

407
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,680
The little twelve jaguar presents

408
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,080
Quack, quack

409
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,380
Two ducks

410
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,200
Two ducks

411
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,860
How ducky

412
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:08,860
I'll read a Mayan prophecy

413
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:11,780
Over this Mayan music

414
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:15,100
And this isn't

415
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:17,100
By the way, the world

416
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,740
Probably won't be ending

417
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,220
We call December 21st, 2012

418
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:24,420
Because it ain't even 1998 yet

419
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:24,900
Right

420
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,380
If X-Day comes tomorrow

421
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,820
Then we know we'll still have

422
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,140
What, 14 years left

423
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,180
Before the Mayan end of the world happens

424
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,480
Right

425
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,760
And that won't affect us

426
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:36,720
Because we'll be off of this world by then

427
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,580
Well, by 9189 probably

428
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,000
Now here's a Mayan prophecy

429
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,700
About the year 2801

430
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,240
And it's not good news

431
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,640
It's not good news

432
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:48,640


433
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:48,780
It's not good news

434
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:49,120
It's not good news

435
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,120


436
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,120


437
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,120


438
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,120


439
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,120


440
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:49,220
It's not good news

441
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,020
I'll read it

442
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:53,900
Fifteen baktuns and no katuns

443
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,520
No tuns, no oinales and no kins

444
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:57,760
Two nothingness

445
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,720
Eighteen ununinium

446
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,200
Thursday, June the 28th

447
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,100
In 2801

448
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:07,440
At the sun's pubescence

449
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,860
At his third thirteenth

450
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:12,120
The solar hurricanes

451
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:16,620
Erase nine billion bright consciousnesses

452
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,200
Morning is our birth day

453
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,180
And the sun is the sun's third

454
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:23,880
And so I guess a solar explosion of some kind

455
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,200
Will wipe out nine billion people

456
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,140
In the year 2801

457
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,520
Well, the idea, I guess

458
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:31,540
What you were expressing there

459
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:34,320
These are prophecies for after they predicted

460
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,320
The end of the world

461
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,320
Yeah, I know that

462
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:40,080
But the prophecies are based on the belief that

463
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,940
When the sun does all that stuff

464
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,860
And screws up the electromagnetic field

465
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:46,840
There's some physical damage to the earth

466
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,180
But most of the damage is done to the earth

467
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,760
And the actual psyche of humanity

468
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,140
Which can't remember how to drive a car anymore

469
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:54,200
Or even their own names

470
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,900
Because of the gravity

471
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,920
That makes sense

472
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,160
Cool

473
00:24:57,160 --> 00:25:00,420
Of the, you know, the electromagnetic shift

474
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:02,880
It's like, you know, in the old days

475
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,840
Of analog recording

476
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,020
When you'd erase something

477
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,300
And that's what happened

478
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,500
Will happen, they claim

479
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,320
Well, it could be worse

480
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:17,640
What if, as an old Powell Anderson novel posits

481
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,160
What if all this stuff is just a dream?

482
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,180
Of time, the world has been

483
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,260
The earth has

484
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:22,800
And the solar system has been

485
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,460
Inside of a cosmic cloud

486
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,240
That slowed down subtle electromagnetic

487
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:29,340
Reactions such as

488
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,020
Inside your very brain

489
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,760
Yeah

490
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,800
And the world passes out

491
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,300
From under that cloud

492
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:37,200
And suddenly not only humans

493
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,140
But animals all become ten times smarter

494
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,300
I'm trying to remember the name of the novel

495
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:45,200
They made a terrible movie of it

496
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,160
Called Day of the Animals or something

497
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:48,800
What a strange evolution

498
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:59,500
In the novel, it's the end of the world because the people of normal intelligence become super smart,

499
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:02,740
and they get real depressed and want a lot of them to die.

500
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:10,480
The retarded people do really well because they become what we would call normal.

501
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:18,500
And this would be people with severe disabilities become mentally about like us.

502
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,900
They do fine.

503
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:24,020
And the chimpanzees do pretty well.

504
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,760
They just shot off my buzz. I'm sorry.

505
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,600
Yeah, sure enough.

506
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:28,120
All right.

507
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:29,480
It's the Mayans.

508
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:31,260
Oh, it's not Mayans now.

509
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,620
I shouldn't say Mayans. It's Maya.

510
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,080
Maya.

511
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:40,140
This is Azerbaijani music.

512
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,100
Azerbaijani be good.

513
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,460
This was a big hit in 1475.

514
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,960
Azerbaijani be good.

515
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:55,880
Oh, and we've got after that, there's some Maori music.

516
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:57,820
Maori the Marrier.

517
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:01,580
In honor of our friend Dr. Dark, who was at the...

518
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,740
Sounds like rabbits with big, big teeth.

519
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:09,560
Our friend Dr. Dark was among the Maori recently.

520
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:12,320
Did he paint his nipples like the rest of them?

521
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,520
Oh, if I know him, I'm sure he did.

522
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,960
That's a male ritual. You have to paint your nipples blue.

523
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,600
He probably ruined the ritual.

524
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:23,680
He probably ruined the ritual with his puns and heckling.

525
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:28,600
Yeah, his one-liners and his two-liners and his too-many-liners.

526
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:30,600
No, not...

527
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,140
His eyeliner.

528
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:37,380
Now, according to this book on the Maya that I just finished about 10 minutes before we came to the show,

529
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,600
the world will be saved from ending.

530
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,460
There, I just spoiled the story for you.

531
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:48,560
But it will come to an end on Thursday, October 12th.

532
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,160
47.72.

533
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:53,240
After that, the big nothing.

534
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,380
The big nothing.

535
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:56,860
Yeah.

536
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,960
The thing we've been waiting for for so long, and they're going to have to put it off forever.

537
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,220
I certainly hope you don't subscribe to that idea, especially since you have your own ideas.

538
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:14,300
You know, the sad thing is I subscribed to The Onion, and they quit printing it and mailing it.

539
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:15,460
We're so sad.

540
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,780
The Onion is no longer something I get in my pocket.

541
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:21,920
I have a post office box, which, before I go stand in line,

542
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:29,520
and that means that there may be a mass killing at the post office because of me going postal,

543
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:33,700
not having The Onion to read while I stand there waiting for these nitwits.

544
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,360
No, no.

545
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,720
And I don't mean the postal workers.

546
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,520
I mean the people in line ahead of me.

547
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,520
That just means you have to bring back issues.

548
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:40,400
So are you saying they're exclusively online now?

549
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,580
Yes, they're making us read it online.

550
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:48,640
No, but The Onion has always had a printed version in some city.

551
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,580
It's like New York and Chicago.

552
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:55,120
You can find The Onion for free at newsstands.

553
00:28:55,260 --> 00:29:01,740
And they may still be doing that, but probably like us, they decided the postage just was too much.

554
00:29:02,420 --> 00:29:07,260
Church of Subgenius quit publishing and mailing stuff because of the postage, not printing.

555
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:11,420
I am called to mind of Funny Times.

556
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,280
We're living in.

557
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:18,340
You're based here in Cleveland, which continues to turn out print paper media.

558
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:24,220
Rather than you can't even submit online, which is the weirdest thing I ever saw.

559
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,720
But they sounded quite jocular.

560
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:27,300
To the Funny Times?

561
00:29:27,580 --> 00:29:30,980
Yeah, we used to subscribe to Funny Times.

562
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,820
They just sent us a freebie hoping we'd subscribe again.

563
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,160
They used to sign POs as me.

564
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,240
I've subscribed to them off and on.

565
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:46,320
I sometimes walk into the post office and there'll be an old hipster my age and same kind of hairdo walking out.

566
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:48,600
And after I shudder.

567
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:52,420
And shiver at how scary old age is, I think.

568
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:54,120
I wonder if that's the Funny Times guy.

569
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,240
I bet it is.

570
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,120
Raymond Lesser.

571
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:01,260
The old chimpanzee suit always worked well, too.

572
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:06,860
Now we've had a hard time with digestion, but that's to be expected at his age.

573
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:15,540
Well, I've been playing the game, the sacrifice game, which if you sacrifice enough, it's just I just use animals.

574
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,320
And that works OK for me.

575
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:18,640
Yeah.

576
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,860
I've been able to make predictions.

577
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:31,860
And I know where Princess Wee and I are going to be on at the time of the last Bakhtun, when the last Bakhtun ends on December 21st.

578
00:30:31,880 --> 00:30:33,800
You're going to be having a Christmas party.

579
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,240
No, not not quite.

580
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:45,280
No, we're going to be on our way to Stang Ranch, but we're going to be exploring Enchanted Rock in Fredericksburg, Texas, which we've been to before.

581
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,020
Big piece of pink granite.

582
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,240
Oh, the hideout spot when the big Kazanghi hits.

583
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:52,660
Yeah, there's a cave there.

584
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:53,660
Huddled under the rock.

585
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:54,700
There is a cave.

586
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:59,380
The rock, Enchanted Rock is a gigantic, solid piece of granite.

587
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:05,360
And when you go into the cave there, you would be safe from many ends of the world.

588
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:08,300
However, the kind where the whole universe disappears.

589
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,000
Nah, forget it.

590
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,300
That's too bad.

591
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:16,380
The whole universe needs to disappear briefly, just so long as it reappears.

592
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,560
Not too long after that.

593
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:19,980
It's going to be pretty much the same way.

594
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,440
Right.

595
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,380
It's kind of a blink.

596
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,280
It may be that.

597
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:22,760
National shifts.

598
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:30,140
They just get you all tit-hardly and way out of this, you know, sub-scroll, you know, get your concept.

599
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:32,640
I'm sorry.

600
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:45,820
Well, now, as you were saying that maybe the scientifical end of the world on the 21st would be a pulse, a space pulse that wipes out people's intelligence.

601
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,540
My question would be.

602
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:50,360
How would we be able to tell the difference?

603
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:51,300
Yeah.

604
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,880
What would really change?

605
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:53,480
You know.

606
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,540
Definitely the question.

607
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,860
How would we know?

608
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:56,900
That is the question.

609
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,620
I mean, aside from the fact that.

610
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,620
And look out the window and presume everything was fine.

611
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:10,180
But the thing is, I guess it'll be so bad that the cerebral cortex itself will begin to shrink and then re-expand, I guess, after the.

612
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,960
I just had a bad thought.

613
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:12,940
And people.

614
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:13,760
What if it all.

615
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:17,300
They might be able to remember how to go to the bathroom or get a drink of water.

616
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:25,460
They will not know how to walk to the faucet to turn the water on or go to the refrigerator to get the refreshing spring water.

617
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,480
They'll just, you know.

618
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,120
You mean even dumber than now?

619
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:33,620
Because I was going to say, how do we know that hasn't already happened?

620
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:34,980
Well.

621
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,960
I mean, it being so relative.

622
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:38,740
I would say it's.

623
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:43,380
Well, you know.

624
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:43,840
Well, yeah.

625
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:47,520
The ideogularity beat the singularity into existence.

626
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,260
Distance or.

627
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:52,600
It beat the singularity into brain damage.

628
00:32:54,060 --> 00:32:55,800
Actual lacerations on the.

629
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:57,280
On the.

630
00:32:57,420 --> 00:32:58,240
On the.

631
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:04,560
Now, I have been on a kind of a Maya kick.

632
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:08,260
And it's not because of the prophesied end of the world.

633
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:14,240
It's because of two great sci-fi novels by a guy named Brian D'Amato.

634
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,480
He's got a little apostrophe.

635
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,300
After the D.

636
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,080
It's like D'Amato.

637
00:33:20,260 --> 00:33:21,160
D'Amato.

638
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:21,680
I don't.

639
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:24,160
There's a vowel there.

640
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,640
So you don't want to necessarily go D'Amato because you're kind of saying that anyway.

641
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,300
D'Amato.

642
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:33,460
I love these books, but I hate this author because he's really good.

643
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,400
He makes me feel like a loser by comparison.

644
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,280
He's a well-known artist, too.

645
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,680
I read earlier.

646
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,840
That really taught art history at Ohio State.

647
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:47,120
At one point.

648
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:52,360
We're jumping around on stage at the same time doing really wild guitar moves and stuff

649
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:55,700
and then playing the keyboard at the same time and then jumping off and drawing a picture

650
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,680
and using a.

651
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,160
Yeah.

652
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,340
And then writing this bestselling, you know, Hugo Award winning.

653
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,380
These.

654
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,100
These.

655
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,620
Flying on the keyboard to none of this.

656
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,340
The books that I just finished.

657
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,160
They're really.

658
00:34:17,540 --> 00:34:20,660
One big long story that takes two books to tell.

659
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:24,900
The first one is in the courts of the sun by Brian D'Amato.

660
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,360
And the second one is called the sacrifice games.

661
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:38,260
And it's it's about people of the modern times discovering that the Maya had a an incredibly complex game.

662
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,540
It's like turned a human into a computer.

663
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,260
Drugs were involved.

664
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,740
And there's a great description of.

665
00:34:47,540 --> 00:34:48,740
Playing the game.

666
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:49,760
I'm going to read this.

667
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,060
OK.

668
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,880
Let's see.

669
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,740
I'll put on.

670
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:54,160
I'll put on the Einstein Secret Orchestra.

671
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:54,860
They'll be speaking.

672
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,960
I'm pulling through that.

673
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,360
Now this.

674
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:57,720
This is a long paragraph.

675
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,240
So.

676
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,020
Hang.

677
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:01,760
Hang in there.

678
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:05,480
And then we'll play a song, I guess.

679
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,480
My knuckles.

680
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,820
Really, I'd been using myself as a monkey all this time.

681
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:11,880
That is to really play the runner.

682
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,640
That is the skulls.

683
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,680
You have to have some fear there.

684
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,120
Even if you're playing.

685
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,000
For a client.

686
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:19,120
You don't much care about.

687
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,520
You have to scare yourself.

688
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:24,240
You need to look around you the way a prey animal does.

689
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:26,700
Seeing a predator in every shadow.

690
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,540
And as your field of understanding widens.

691
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:31,440
Instead of feeling more powerful.

692
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:32,960
Your fear increases.

693
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,200
It becomes fear not just for yourself.

694
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:37,060
But for your fellow prey animals.

695
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:39,820
The members of your herd that you now see.

696
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,680
Are all around you in too numerous to count.

697
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:45,100
Instead of spotting escape routes.

698
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,000
You realize how many prey.

699
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,460
Animals surround you.

700
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:51,960
And how far it is to any safe haven.

701
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:54,500
You start comprehending how unlikely.

702
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:57,380
And contingent your consciousness is.

703
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:59,500
And the farther you get up that staircase.

704
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:02,640
That sense of tenuousness just keeps increasing.

705
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,820
You start seeing more of the present.

706
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,080
And more of the past.

707
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,480
And even then some of the future.

708
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,660
And then more possible futures.

709
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:12,080
And possible pasts.

710
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:15,640
All the trillions of times you weren't born for instance.

711
00:36:15,960 --> 00:36:16,880
And then.

712
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:19,280
Even counterfactual presence.

713
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,140
And non-existent futures.

714
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,560
And impossible worlds.

715
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:25,600
Universes where light is slow and local.

716
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:28,680
And gravity is fast and far reaching.

717
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,160
Where two plus two equals one.

718
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:36,200
Or even where two plus two equals say grapefruit.

719
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,840
And it's not intriguing.

720
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,380
It's terrifying.

721
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:42,680
Like I said drugs are involved in this game.

722
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:46,100
They have this amazing drug that they.

723
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:46,780
The.

724
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:48,800
The Maya priests make from.

725
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,340
It's like this certain frog.

726
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:57,540
This certain frog has to be eating these certain chemicals in a certain cave.

727
00:36:57,860 --> 00:36:58,540
And then the.

728
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:00,820
Oh no it has to be eating.

729
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,260
It has to grow on a certain tree.

730
00:37:04,480 --> 00:37:09,520
And then the frog that lives on this tree has a certain drug in him.

731
00:37:09,620 --> 00:37:13,220
He's eaten by a certain water fowl.

732
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,760
Who also carries another unique kind of drug.

733
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:21,620
And has to be bitten by a spider that has a certain kind of venom.

734
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,960
And when you add all that stuff together.

735
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,440
You've got the Steersman.

736
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:31,380
That's their name for this drug that sort of turns you into a human computer.

737
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:35,560
That can remember things that haven't even happened yet.

738
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:36,680
Yes.

739
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:40,380
And logically work out the most likely possibilities.

740
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:44,760
And that being that the universe will implode on December 21st.

741
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:46,640
Uh.

742
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,560
2012 or.

743
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,880
15 Ocelot.

744
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,140
Bactoon 49.

745
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:57,240
Ixion 3-5 or something.

746
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,180
Uh huh.

747
00:37:58,780 --> 00:37:59,440
Um.

748
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,740
Anyway I cannot highly enough recommend these two books.

749
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,480
In the Courts of the Sun and the Sacrifice Game.

750
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,300
No relation to the Hunger Game friends.

751
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:10,740
These aren't.

752
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,100
They're really funny.

753
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,680
This guy's like a modern.

754
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:15,840
He's like a new Kurt Vonnegut almost.

755
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:16,620
They're donkeys.

756
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:16,620


757
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,180
They're like a dark humor that is sick.

758
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:25,760
Partly because the Maya apparently developed tortures that are so incredibly cool.

759
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,760
Did I already cover all this on some previous show?

760
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,920
No you didn't cover the coolness of the tortures.

761
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:37,020
Well you did cover the coolness but you didn't allude to what they did that was actually so cool.

762
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,420
I didn't uh.

763
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:46,440
I wish I'd marked the page in this book where he lists the books of the books of torture.

764
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:46,600
I didn't.

765
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,160
I just wanted to show the tortures that they have stashed away.

766
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,220
A library.

767
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:51,960
A veritable library of books on torture.

768
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:53,780
But the Maya.

769
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,280
The Maya had so many books on so many things.

770
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:58,360
And when the Inquisition got there.

771
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,440
They said where's Jesus and all this.

772
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,140
You guys come on.

773
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,980
You know you're forgetting number one.

774
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,940
So they all.

775
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,360
It burned them all.

776
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,980
Well plus by the time the Inquisition got there.

777
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,180
Oh yeah it was later.

778
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:15,400
Half the indigenous people were dead from measles.

779
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:16,600
And so.

780
00:39:16,620 --> 00:39:17,040
Smallpox and such.

781
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,400
It was a little bit later than the rest of the conquista.

782
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,160
Yeah.

783
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:21,180
Right.

784
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,380
They were hiding by them temples.

785
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,640
Well actually the Maya were pretty much gone by then.

786
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:28,900
It was the uh.

787
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,760
As tribal people they continued.

788
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:31,640
Right.

789
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,080
Right in fact they're still around.

790
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:44,000
In fact for all I know my grandsons are half Maya sort of.

791
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,800
They're carrying some of that.

792
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,180
Some.

793
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,060
Yeah they wouldn't be.

794
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,200
They would be partly Spanish.

795
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:53,520
And they're half.

796
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:55,260
And they're half subgenius too.

797
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,880
Which is subgenius can come in any flavor.

798
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,020
You can get.

799
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,780
You can get them.

800
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:01,680
You know.

801
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,800
Pretty much any color.

802
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:04,620
Age.

803
00:40:06,360 --> 00:40:06,920
Ethnicity.

804
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,320
Poor things.

805
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,720
Yeah refugee status.

806
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:14,280
Smallpox.

807
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,840
They're like smiths.

808
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,220
They're every.

809
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:20,660
Somewhere there is for every human activity.

810
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,440
Somewhere there is a smith who has done that.

811
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,740
And a mild nipple it was all Tuesday.

812
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,540
Just because of that.

813
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,420
All Tuesday.

814
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,240
Because there were so many.

815
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,920
They were spread across the land like.

816
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:33,420
Like Lincoln's butter.

817
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,100
Well there weren't as many.

818
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:37,900
There were never as many smiths as there were Lee's.

819
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:41,480
There was some guy named Lee in China who was hornier.

820
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,300
By thousands.

821
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,260
Than any smith in Scotland.

822
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,120
And so does.

823
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:50,700
You think of smith as an English.

824
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,320
Scotland huh?

825
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:53,320
You think of smith as an English name.

826
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,940
But there's really more smiths than Scotland.

827
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,780
And I'll tell you a secret.

828
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,200
It only won't be a secret now.

829
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,180
Smith is a fake name.

830
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,440
It's really McNutt.

831
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:04,420
Get out of here.

832
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,780
Get out of here.

833
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,240
It sounds funny.

834
00:41:08,360 --> 00:41:09,500
But it's a name.

835
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,440
You'll occasionally.

836
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,940
In fact in the south there's a lot of McNutt funeral homes.

837
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,960
Are they making fun of me?

838
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:16,840
I don't know.

839
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:19,920
No no it's just the idea like you could have said McPeanuts or something.

840
00:41:20,100 --> 00:41:20,620
Right.

841
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,660
Or McTesty.

842
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:24,500
Yeah.

843
00:41:24,700 --> 00:41:25,840
McNipple sounds good.

844
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:30,960
Or does that sound like a new dessert from fast food joint?

845
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,680
Yeah a place where you can take.

846
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,500
I'll have a chocolate McNipple.

847
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,300
Oh no.

848
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:37,480
I don't want chocolate.

849
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,680
Oh I don't know.

850
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:41,080
Do I want vanilla or do I want strawberry?

851
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,140
I just don't know.

852
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,320
Help me make up my mind.

853
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:44,040
What do you like?

854
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:46,360
Do you like chocolate or vanilla?

855
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:51,120
I know there's people in line behind me.

856
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,580
But I just can't make up my mind.

857
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:55,360
I'm not making fun of you Princess Wee.

858
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:59,360
I'm making fun of that silly woman I saw in the post office.

859
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,260
Oh that's right.

860
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,880
What was that all about?

861
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,160
I didn't get my onion.

862
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,560
I had to kill her.

863
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:06,980
I'm glad you did.

864
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:14,860
And that's me who was having a really good laughy time holding everyone up in line.

865
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,920
I know it's taking me so long.

866
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:21,800
But she was using the automatic postage machine.

867
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:29,140
And I'm really fast at it and I have to kill the people who are there if there's somebody there ahead of me.

868
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,640
I have to get them out of the way because they're just too slow.

869
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,840
They squint and they read with their lips moving.

870
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:39,280
or in this woman's case, she narrated to everybody

871
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:42,480
while not listening to what she herself was saying.

872
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,060
She'd always push the wrong button.

873
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,620
God, I left.

874
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:48,820
I just up and left because I didn't have an onion

875
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,720
and I really might have done some damage.

876
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:54,800
So I went to Wally World and came back later

877
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:58,140
when they were closed and there wouldn't be any silly women there.

878
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:02,780
Yes, this is a very, very, very unnerving type of personality.

879
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,160
We encounter them everywhere.

880
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,260
We encounter them in the supermarkets

881
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:11,320
and in the bassinets and the child play areas

882
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:14,240
and most of the great seniority centers throughout the land.

883
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,800
Don't eat your onions, you want to kill them.

884
00:43:17,840 --> 00:43:18,400
Yes, indeed.

885
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,300
Speaking of silly women you want to kill,

886
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:23,160
that leads us into the next Ted Ganger song

887
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:25,280
and this is the one I wanted Dave to hear

888
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,920
because it's so depressing

889
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,540
and yet it's kind of funny in a way because it's so true.

890
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:35,140
Luckily for me, I've never been there.

891
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:38,920
Well, it's just that you and I are always telling each other

892
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,460
how old we are now.

893
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,760
We're so old.

894
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,980
And then when I heard this song, I thought,

895
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,920
oh, I can't wait till my husband hears this.

896
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:48,060
Well, I couldn't wait till Dave heard it

897
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,560
because you're going to be crying at the end of it, okay?

898
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:51,960
No!

899
00:43:52,180 --> 00:43:54,120
So I'm going to play this song.

900
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,100
I'm going to pot us all down.

901
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:55,380
Goodbye.

902
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,720
Well, we've come to the end of our story

903
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,860
The saddest story ever told

904
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:05,140
It's a story of love and hate

905
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:05,140


906
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:05,140


907
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:07,220
A story about, well, me

908
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,260
And of a guy who is just too old

909
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,320
You're too old

910
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,780
Old, old, old, old

911
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,500
What we had was really beautiful

912
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,280
But you're too old

913
00:44:26,180 --> 00:44:27,440
You were full of illusion

914
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,100
So I had to burst your bubble

915
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:30,360
And I could have been nicer

916
00:44:30,360 --> 00:44:31,680
But it wasn't worth the trouble

917
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:32,920
So I thank you a lot

918
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:34,480
For Ben and Jerry's and the movie

919
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,140
And I got you a new job

920
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,360
To admit that our bedtime was groovy

921
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,360
But you're too old

922
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:42,040
Old, old, old, old

923
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,720
What we had was really beautiful

924
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,460
But you're too old

925
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,940
Well, you gave me your love

926
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:52,500
And you really understood me

927
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,580
And you gave me a chance

928
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,220
To be the way I really could be

929
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,440
But you're not what I want

930
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,600
And I told you before

931
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,120
So get out of my way

932
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,760
While I act like a whore

933
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,760
Cause you're too old

934
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:05,120
Old, old, old, old

935
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:07,200
Old, old, old, old

936
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,200
What we had was really beautiful

937
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:10,960
But you're too old

938
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:16,480
Ted and I got together last year in March.

939
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,840
I told him it wasn't really what I wanted

940
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,020
Cause he was too old to have a family with

941
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,960
Which is like the only purpose of a relationship, right?

942
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,580
But we started up anyway.

943
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,960
It went on until July

944
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,820
When I decided I'd had enough.

945
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,740
So I fucked a student of his

946
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:32,860
Cause he was there, you know

947
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,920
And it had to be somebody.

948
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,100
And then the next day I dumped Ted.

949
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,880
And a few days after that

950
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,140
I fucked this other guy I'd been interested in too.

951
00:45:40,540 --> 00:45:42,600
I'd actually liked him more to begin with

952
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,920
But I'd gone to the party with the first guy

953
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:45,760
I mean the student

954
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,920
So I had to wait with the second one

955
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,040
But not very long

956
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,060
And right after that I went to Israel for two months

957
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,100
I did a few guys there too

958
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:56,260
Including a cousin of mine from New Jersey

959
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,960
Who I'd had a secret thing going on with for years

960
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:01,100
When I came back in the fall

961
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,900
I can't really say what I did

962
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,900
Because I didn't take any of his money

963
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,920
I told Ted about this time

964
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,700
And he's the one who wrote this

965
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,680
But I did have these big dreams about a future

966
00:46:09,680 --> 00:46:11,160
With my New Jersey cousin

967
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,880
Who's an accountant by the way

968
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:16,560
Still around October I started seeing Ted again

969
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:18,520
He coached me on some songs

970
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:19,920
And he was still in love with me

971
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,580
So I figured I might as well

972
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:23,160
Let him get back into my pants

973
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:25,200
This time things were really good

974
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:28,920
I told him I somehow didn't need to be such an asshole to him anymore

975
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,680
Because I'd already done all that

976
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:32,720
Over Christmas though

977
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,900
I flew to New York

978
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,760
For two weeks to visit my cousins

979
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,460
Including the one you know

980
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:40,220
I'd already planned the trip

981
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,760
Before Ted and I got back together

982
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,140
So of course I had to go through with it

983
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:44,600
Didn't I?

984
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,140
And so my cousin and I fucked

985
00:46:47,140 --> 00:46:48,640
Like every night I was there

986
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:50,060
Except for when I got my period

987
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:53,400
When I got back again the shit really hit the fan

988
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,340
Duh right?

989
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:57,040
But I cried a lot and promised Ted

990
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,780
I'd really work to build a relationship with him now

991
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:01,600
And I really wanted to you know

992
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:03,160
And so he took me back

993
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,800
But I kept thinking

994
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,020
Nah he's too old

995
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:09,780
So after a couple of months I started getting distant again

996
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,960
Which is how I do it

997
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,500
Until he finally asked what's going on

998
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:16,300
And one thing led to another in the conversation

999
00:47:16,300 --> 00:47:18,660
Which is sort of what I wanted to happen anyway

1000
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,620
And suddenly we were saying goodbye

1001
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:22,120
And that was it

1002
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,960
Of course I'd already been lining up the next guy

1003
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,620
I mean why waste time right?

1004
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,060
And so just three weeks later

1005
00:47:29,060 --> 00:47:31,340
I was able to change my Facebook status

1006
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,900
From single to interrelationship

1007
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,980
It's the real thing this time

1008
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:36,860
I just know it

1009
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:39,120
We're gonna visit Israel together and everything

1010
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,400
This is it now for sure

1011
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:43,480
No really

1012
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,760
Well you did what you could

1013
00:47:46,760 --> 00:47:48,640
And you told me the truth

1014
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:51,380
And it's true you're very youthful

1015
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,200
But I'd rather have youth

1016
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:55,980
So I got a new guy now

1017
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,920
And although you say whatever

1018
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:00,480
I know this is for real now

1019
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:01,900
And it's gonna last forever

1020
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:03,880
You're gonna have a new girlfriend

1021
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:03,880


1022
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,920
You were just too old

1023
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:07,580
Old, old, old, old

1024
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:11,340
What we had was really beautiful

1025
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:13,260
But you're too old

1026
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:15,900
Well please believe

1027
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:17,260
me when I speak it once more

1028
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:18,740
You're too old

1029
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,720
I know your hearing's

1030
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:22,880
getting weak so once more

1031
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:24,180
You're too old

1032
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:27,220
You were just too old

1033
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,060
Old, old, old, old

1034
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:30,800
Old, old, old, old

1035
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,540
Old, old, old, old

1036
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,660
That was fine and lovely.

1037
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:40,680
It made my toes curl up, made my eyebrows singed.

1038
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:41,840
It was normal.

1039
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,280
It was absolutely beautiful.

1040
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:47,460
How do you think it was?

1041
00:48:47,500 --> 00:48:48,000
It was fine.

1042
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:48,700
It was funny.

1043
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,820
I laughed my cryogies off.

1044
00:48:51,700 --> 00:48:54,180
And I thought of the times when people walked up to me and go,

1045
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:57,260
Dude, you look really old.

1046
00:48:58,540 --> 00:49:03,260
And then I thought, well, I may be old, but at least I...

1047
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:06,160
Then I counted all the things that I was that they weren't.

1048
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,800
Well, what I like to...

1049
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,840
Getting fat.

1050
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,760
I get that a lot from the haters on the Internet.

1051
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:18,820
You're so old, Stag, and I get to say things like,

1052
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:21,100
Well, I guess you don't have to worry about that, do you?

1053
00:49:21,720 --> 00:49:24,180
I guess you don't have to worry about that happening to you.

1054
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:28,600
They don't like to be told that.

1055
00:49:28,660 --> 00:49:31,740
I've thought of that answer myself, informing them.

1056
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,240
It makes me...

1057
00:49:33,260 --> 00:49:34,320
You feel better to say it.

1058
00:49:34,460 --> 00:49:36,500
And your parents would say,

1059
00:49:36,580 --> 00:49:39,220
Oh, well, when you get older, you'll see.

1060
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:41,220
And you go, Oh, no, I won't.

1061
00:49:41,280 --> 00:49:42,400
I'll never get older.

1062
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,460
Well, some of them won't.

1063
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:46,700
That's true.

1064
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:52,400
Quite a few of them won't ever have to worry about getting old because...

1065
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,100
There'll be little floaters out in the pond.

1066
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:57,320
Yeah, they'll either be too stupid or too unlucky.

1067
00:49:58,220 --> 00:50:00,780
I mean, a lot of times it's just bad luck.

1068
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,820
You know, Tom, the reaper...

1069
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:04,420
Pulls your name out of the basket.

1070
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,820
It's time for that aneurysm.

1071
00:50:05,840 --> 00:50:06,080
Boop!

1072
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:06,980
Suddenly you're dead.

1073
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,080
One minute...

1074
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,080
You're not even thinking about such a possibility.

1075
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:14,160
And someone reminds you from the vast conspicuum of abnormality.

1076
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,360
I mean, space.

1077
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:16,680
I mean, space.

1078
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:20,660
Oh, well.

1079
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,720
I have a funny...

1080
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:27,340
Now, that was a song about sad sex.

1081
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:32,940
But I have a funny song about bug sex that's much, much more...

1082
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,720
Jolly and inspirational.

1083
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:36,900
And it's by Rudy Schwartz Project.

1084
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:39,020
It's by my boyfriend, the Rudy Schwartz Project.

1085
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:41,140
So I'm going to play...

1086
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,020
It's only two minutes long, though.

1087
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:47,460
But you can listen to this one, too, Dave.

1088
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:49,360
Do-wop-de-mega-mega

1089
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:50,640

1096

Snuggly mega

1097
00:50:59,240 --> 00:50:59,980
Cuddly mega

1098

You sweet mega

1101
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,500
Pretty children all clap and sing

1102
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,940
Strip mega

1103
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:08,260
You sweet mega

1104
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,860
All the bong beans smack and ring

1105
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,660
I get so hot

1106
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,360
Watching brown eyeballs rot

1107
00:51:16,900 --> 00:51:17,560
Strip mega

1108
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,980
You sweet mega

1109
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,320
Lovely mega

1110
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,500
Oh, so sweet

1111
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:22,120
Well

1112
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:22,980

1113
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,320
You sweet mega

1114
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,880
All the stars are shining bright

1115
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,360
Strip mega

1116
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,700
You sweet mega

1117
00:51:29,700 --> 00:51:32,340
Two mezzanine for a new eye

1118
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:32,940
Shopping

1119
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:33,320
Shopping

1120
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:35,220
Strolling down the lane

1121
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:37,680
To a happy refrain

1122
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:39,080
Strip mega

1123
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:40,380
You sweet mega

1124
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:41,660
Lovely mega

1125
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,980
Oh, so sweet

1126
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,920
Do-wop-bop-bop

1127
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,640
Gorgeous white dipped hair is larva

1128
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:49,800
Larva

1129
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:53,880
Chirp spreading grub of my dreams

1130
00:51:56,260 --> 00:52:00,500
I'll pour the wine while you court me with your slime

1131
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,060
Smugly mega

1132
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,040
Social opium

1133
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:03,040


1134
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:03,500
Smugly drug

1135
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,600
Mule

1136
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:10,600


1137
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:15,200
Pelicule

1138
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:15,480
Escapade

1139
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:15,480


1140
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:15,600
rises

1141
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,400
Annotation

1142
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:16,400


1143
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:16,400


1144
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:22,360
I got Fortnite

1145
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:23,180
tool

1146
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:23,840
MONA

1147
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,280
history

1148
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:33,840
You sweet maggot, pretty maggot walk by my side

1149
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:39,100
Strip naked, you sweet maggot, gonna make you my maggot bride

1150
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:44,520
Mend all my socks while we do the maggot rock

1151
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:49,760
Strip naked, you sweet maggot, lovely maggot, oh so sweet

1152
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:54,460
Strip naked, you sweet maggot, lovely maggot

1153
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,040
Maggot, oh so sweet

1154
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,540
Oh so sweet

1155
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:06,860
Really short project there

1156
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,320
I enjoyed it very much, I'm sure you do too

1157
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,780
Don't you, man?

1158
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,640
Hey, uh, Principal, while that song was playing

1159
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:18,020
What flavor of maggot?

1160
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,360
The texture was wow

1161
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:24,380
It was sweet

1162
00:53:24,380 --> 00:53:27,820
And to the teeth and give you a funny face when you looked in the car mirror

1163
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:32,800
Dave keeps drifting away from the phone line

1164
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:33,940
We couldn't hear that one, Dave

1165
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,520
The sweet, creamy, maggot

1166
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,580
I was right on the microphone

1167
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:40,200
See the Interpol or the Universal Space Police

1168
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:42,720
Are interfering with the actual transmission

1169
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:45,200
Speaking of radio testaments

1170
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:48,580
Princess Wee handed me this book I've never seen before

1171
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:50,640
Called The Radio Dictionary

1172
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,220
And for some reason she opened it to the page

1173
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:55,300
It really is a dictionary

1174
00:53:55,860 --> 00:54:00,480
Between Drop-ins and Dry is the word drugola

1175
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:04,560
Defined as the illegal and immoral use of drugs

1176
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:08,780
Given to program directors or DJs in exchange for favors

1177
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:13,980
And I want the listeners to know that I'm disappointed in them

1178
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,940
We had an open house right here at the station

1179
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:20,700
And we met several of the listeners

1180
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:24,200
And in fact it's like a regular convention of the Senate and the Senate

1181
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:24,200


1182
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,720
We had a lot of people in the room

1183
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:28,420
And there was no drugola to be seen

1184
00:54:28,420 --> 00:54:29,640
Not a speck

1185
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:31,740
Dr. Sinister just walked in

1186
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:32,980
Not even the tiniest sniff

1187
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:37,940
It was actually really scary seeing my dad here talking to No Money Mark

1188
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:40,240
And he was trying to cop too

1189
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,000
I looked in

1190
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:42,840
No!

1191
00:54:44,300 --> 00:54:45,160
Let me save you

1192
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:47,780
Imagine the

1193
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,240
How I felt

1194
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:53,460
The very first World Subgenius Convention

1195
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:54,180
1929

1196
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,460
1981 in Dallas

1197
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:59,160
All these subgeniuses are mostly young hipsters

1198
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:01,740
With some exceptions standing around

1199
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,880
And in walks my dad

1200
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,620
In full Naval Reserve Captain's uniform

1201
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:11,100
With his three other Navy buddies

1202
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:14,480
To the idiot stoners

1203
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:16,660
It looked like the cops

1204
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:18,580
It was a blue uniform

1205
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:19,080
You know

1206
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,320
Now

1207
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:22,260
Who was

1208
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,100
The people who were the most

1209
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:24,540
Most scared

1210
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,060
Were the three guys with my dad

1211
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,700
Those three old Navy reservists

1212
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,520
Looked like they were literally

1213
00:55:32,520 --> 00:55:35,180
In a den of lions

1214
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,620
You know it's kind of like how

1215
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,320
Humans and scorpions relate to each other

1216
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:40,820
You know like you see a scorpion

1217
00:55:40,820 --> 00:55:42,060
And you're probably going to be afraid of it

1218
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:43,720
But that scorpion's much more afraid of you

1219
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:46,540
You can't imagine how many times

1220
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,920
I've had to explain that fact to Princess Wee here

1221
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:49,740
Many, many times

1222
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:52,020
Over and over throughout the time we've known each other

1223
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,980
Of course I've never even seen a scorpion in the wild but

1224
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:55,680
I've never even seen a scorpion in the wild but

1225
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:55,680


1226
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:55,680


1227
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,560
Come to Stang Ranch in Texas

1228
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,260
You can just look behind the bed

1229
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:02,420
I've actually got an outstanding warrant in Stang County

1230
00:56:02,420 --> 00:56:04,380
So I'll pass on that

1231
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:05,080
Oh well join the crowd

1232
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:09,560
Yeah but you're kind of a fixer in that county

1233
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,780
Yeah he's the go-to guy so to speak in Stang County

1234
00:56:14,320 --> 00:56:15,980
No actually that's Pappy

1235
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:16,960
My Pappy

1236
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:17,700
Oh okay so

1237
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:18,500
He is the go-to guy

1238
00:56:18,500 --> 00:56:19,700
You're taking over the throne

1239
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,600
And that doesn't mean me you know

1240
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:23,740
Oh I could never do that

1241
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:26,320
Is this our wife in the rocket factory playing in the background?

1242
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,220
Come on

1243
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,140
Yes it is

1244
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:31,340
I can't believe you know the names of those tunes

1245
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:36,220
Yeah we're playing the Witch Disco album by Einstein's Secret Orchestra

1246
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:38,620
Oh I'm going going going going I can hear myself

1247
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:40,860
Yeah that's you on guitar Dave

1248
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,120
It's you doing it

1249
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,760
Yeah this one this tune has a little mark next to it

1250
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:48,420
Like this is an extra good one

1251
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:49,360
Yeah

1252
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:50,400
Go figure

1253
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:52,280
There was some fine jams

1254
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:52,920
Yeah

1255
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:53,120
Really

1256
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:53,580
Yeah

1257
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:59,600
I'm sorry I can't say anything more erudite than that I'm just realizing how

1258
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:03,440
Well you know what it's almost the end of show and this is

1259
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,980
Well it's a good time for my brain to shut off

1260
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:09,740
Yeah well and the buzz is that that's the buzz's cue to come back isn't it?

1261
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:15,740
Well yeah I guess if it's off when I hang up then it'll come back but usually it just it won't

1262
00:57:15,740 --> 00:57:19,560
It refuses it will not

1263
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,960
Well now I have to decide whether to play for the very last thing

1264
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,080
My Boyfriend's Secret Orchestra

1265
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:25,060
Again a

1266
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:25,440
One

1267
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:37,580
Two

1268
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,520
Three

1269
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:40,540
Four

1270
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:40,540


1271
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:40,560
Six

1272
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,080
Seven

1273
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:42,440
Eight

1274
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:42,580
Nine

1275
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:42,660
Twelve

1276
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:43,020
Twelve

1277
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:43,140
Ten

1278
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,160
Twenty

1279
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:51,040
I simply think that the lyrics will fly by, so you'll have to go online and hear it again.

1280
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:55,440
But I think it's the best song I've ever heard about being married.

1281
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:57,560
Isn't that sweet?

1282
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:01,360
If that's what it's about, it's hard to tell.

1283
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:03,540
Okay, Dave, we're going to have to tell you goodbye.

1284
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:06,760
We're going to play the romantic Princess Wee's romantic song.

1285
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,040
My heart's all aflutter.

1286
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,140
We'll play it.

1287
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:11,260
Yeah.

1288
00:58:11,520 --> 00:58:12,040
Yeah.

1289
00:58:13,460 --> 00:58:16,920
And we'll scrape you off the highway this Thursday.

1290
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:18,420
Scrape you.

1291
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:19,420
Okay, man.

1292
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:42,920
Every evening's in.

1293
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:47,100
Hold your hands in the street when you walk them off to school.

1294
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:52,400
A box too full to shut.

1295
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:54,280
Cardboard paper cut.

1296
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:59,020
The bleeding edge of a picture of your parents when they were cool.

1297
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:04,900
So much to say, I forget to start.

1298
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,940
There goes a day, fading as it passes.

1299
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,320
Forget the gray, let it all just fall.

1300
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:10,740
Fall apart.

1301
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,460
Fall apart.

1302
00:59:11,460 --> 00:59:12,020
It's so gray.

1303
00:59:12,040 --> 00:59:15,240
Okay, I like you in glasses

1304
00:59:18,760 --> 00:59:22,240
Shovels in the sand, I played a winning band

1305
00:59:22,240 --> 00:59:27,000
A drowning princess in a tangle of towels on the floor

1306
00:59:29,620 --> 00:59:33,800
An old familiar ache, the little pills we take

1307
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:38,480
The thoughtless kindness of a coffee cup waiting by the door

1308
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,280
So much to say, I forget to start

1309
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,340
There goes the day, fading as it passes

1310
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,860
Forget the gray, let it fall apart

1311
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:55,740
It's okay, it's on the board

1312
00:59:58,460 --> 01:00:00,740
Someone's been double booking

1313
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,640
I've got time

1314
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:08,380
How is your next week?

1315
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:09,540
Looking

1316
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:12,600
The house shifts into place

1317
01:00:12,600 --> 01:00:14,400
A little breathing space

1318
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,300
The radiators and the floorboards will argue while we sleep

1319
01:00:22,120 --> 01:00:24,040
There's water in the walls

1320
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,120
The stairs make waterfalls

1321
01:00:26,120 --> 01:00:27,560
Down in the basement

1322
01:00:27,560 --> 01:00:30,460
The soft sound of a river digging deep

1323
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:36,600
So much to say, I forget to start

1324
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:38,460
There goes the day, fading as it passes

1325
01:00:39,300 --> 01:00:42,160
Forget the gray, let it fall apart

1326
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,100
So much to say, I forget to start

1327
01:00:48,100 --> 01:00:51,140
There goes the day, fading as it passes

1328
01:00:51,140 --> 01:00:53,800
Forget the gray, let it fall apart

1329
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:58,600
It's okay, I like you in glasses

1330
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:06,560
Shovels in the sand, I played a winning band

1331

Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slaaack! From home toast salam!

1338
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:41,760
Oh, no.

1339
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:45,300
I like you in glasses.

1340
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,480
I like you in glasses.

1341
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:51,220
No, it's time for Dr. Sinister.

1342
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:54,740
Aren't we supposed to be doing your show?

1343
01:01:55,220 --> 01:01:55,740
Yes.

1344
01:01:56,700 --> 01:01:57,580
There we go.

1345
01:01:58,280 --> 01:02:00,000
He's so scary when he does that.

1346
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:00,760
He makes me laugh.

1347
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,620
Oh, you're talking about scary laughs?

1348
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:04,000
Laugh laughs?

1349
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,640
Princess Wee has the scariest, scariest...

1350
01:02:08,660 --> 01:02:11,000
Especially when it's a sincere laugh.

1351
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,480
I can mean it up.

1352
01:02:16,280 --> 01:02:17,240
No, Sid.

1353
01:02:17,460 --> 01:02:23,040
I mean, Dr. Sinister, you should come over here and put your wave cards...

1354
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:23,480
You know what?

1355
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:24,460
I don't mind if I do.

1356
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,000
I will take that invitation.

1357
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:28,840
This is WCSB Cleveland, by the way.

1358
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:29,740
Oh, yeah.

1359
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,240
Yes.

1360
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:32,540
Yes.

1361
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:33,160
Yes.

1362
01:02:33,160 --> 01:02:33,460
Yes.

1363
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:39,440
And we were happy to see the listeners and our fellow DJs at the little party today.

1364
01:02:39,560 --> 01:02:41,380
I always dread things like that.

1365
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,120
I always have fun.

1366
01:02:42,420 --> 01:02:43,240
That was great fun.

1367
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:44,660
And free pizza.

1368
01:02:45,180 --> 01:02:45,880
That, too.

1369
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:47,280
But no coffee.

1370
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:48,520
No.

1371
01:02:48,620 --> 01:02:50,480
I have an issue about that.

1372
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:52,480
They had that instant coffee, but I guess they didn't put it out today.

1373
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:52,880
Right.

1374
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,960
I couldn't even find the instant coffee.

1375
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:57,040
I was going to lower myself to that.

1376
01:02:57,180 --> 01:02:59,800
I don't know who exactly is responsible for that, but there was like a...

1377
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:00,620
I don't know.

1378
01:03:00,660 --> 01:03:03,600
It seems to correlate with the years that Sarah...

1379
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,040
Sarah was GM.

1380
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:07,020
That there was always instant coffee available.

1381
01:03:08,140 --> 01:03:10,320
Well, and there's tea.

1382
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,020
They have tea.

1383
01:03:11,100 --> 01:03:12,920
All kinds of fancy teas and stuff.

1384
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:13,600
But that's tea.

1385
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:14,220
That ain't tea.

1386
01:03:14,220 --> 01:03:15,160
I didn't know tea bagger.

1387
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,120
They have hot chocolate, too.

1388
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:17,720
A big woo.

1389
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,360
That's my favorite.

1390
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:23,040
Look, I just want to get back to the sacrifice game.

1391
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:27,680
I have my own computer version of the sacrifice...

1392
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,700
The Maya sacrifice game.

1393
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:33,200
Where I sacrifice little computer characters.

1394
01:03:33,600 --> 01:03:35,780
You know, the last time I went to Mexico, you could...

1395
01:03:35,780 --> 01:03:38,700
And this was an Aztec thing, of course, not a Maya thing,

1396
01:03:38,760 --> 01:03:40,780
but you could still climb to the top of the pyramid at the sun,

1397
01:03:40,840 --> 01:03:43,480
and up at the top, there was a guy there who, for 20 pesos,

1398
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,480
would actually carve out your heart with an authentic obsidian dagger

1399
01:03:46,480 --> 01:03:49,560
in an authentic Aztec ritual for only 20 pesos.

1400
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:50,520
It was a great deal.

1401
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:51,760
I couldn't pass it up.

1402
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:53,720
Would he email you the pictures later?

1403
01:03:55,180 --> 01:03:56,760
If you live to tell the tale, yes.

1404
01:03:57,960 --> 01:03:59,200
After being bludgeoned?

1405
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:00,560
I don't know.

1406
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,160
I understand obsidian...

1407
01:04:03,600 --> 01:04:07,720
can be fantastically sharp.

1408
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,100
Like a molecule in width or two at the...

1409
01:04:13,100 --> 01:04:13,820
Monofilament?

1410
01:04:13,860 --> 01:04:15,040
Yeah, like that.

1411
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:20,320
And just breathe on it, and it cuts you in half.

1412
01:04:21,220 --> 01:04:21,820
Wow.

1413
01:04:21,920 --> 01:04:23,000
If it's done right.

1414
01:04:23,140 --> 01:04:23,580
That's sharp.

1415
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:24,140
Yeah.

1416
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:27,060
Of course, this is all from a fiction book about the...

1417
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:30,580
All my science comes from science fiction.

1418
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,000
All my history comes from historical fiction.

1419
01:04:33,880 --> 01:04:35,740
You kind of got to...

1420
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:37,460
Well, you get...

1421
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:38,980
The heroes are more interesting.

1422
01:04:39,220 --> 01:04:40,320
Actually, that's not true.

1423
01:04:40,460 --> 01:04:40,800
When I...

1424
01:04:40,800 --> 01:04:46,580
I read the biography of Peter the Great by Robert Massey,

1425
01:04:46,700 --> 01:04:50,480
and that was weirder than any science fiction or horror novel

1426
01:04:50,480 --> 01:04:53,120
I had ever read, and it all really happened.

1427
01:04:53,280 --> 01:04:53,860
Oh, my.

1428
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:57,820
What got me interested, my friend Sterno was reading it,

1429
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:02,300
and he showed me this paragraph that described the newly crowned...

1430
01:05:03,640 --> 01:05:05,600
Czar at age 17.

1431
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:10,640
First thing he did was start the Church of the Subgenius.

1432
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:13,480
Only he didn't use that name.

1433
01:05:13,560 --> 01:05:17,000
It was called the All-Drunken Synod of Fools,

1434
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:22,220
and it was a walking, living takeoff on the Russian Orthodox Church,

1435
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:26,720
which any other person in Russia would have been beheaded for doing.

1436
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,660
But he was the czar.

1437
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:29,480
He was the czar.

1438
01:05:29,500 --> 01:05:31,500
And he and his buddies, who were all foreigners,

1439
01:05:31,660 --> 01:05:33,380
would parade around town,

1440
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,800
dressed up in giant headdresses,

1441
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:40,440
mock Orthodox Church bishop hats and stuff.

1442
01:05:40,800 --> 01:05:42,360
Go around cutting people's beards off, too.

1443
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:43,060
Launching.

1444
01:05:43,060 --> 01:05:43,480
Yeah, yeah.

1445
01:05:43,540 --> 01:05:45,860
Well, he outlawed beards at one point,

1446
01:05:45,860 --> 01:05:47,260
or put a tax on beards.

1447
01:05:47,340 --> 01:05:51,560
At that point, most of Russia decided he was the Antichrist.

1448
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:53,120
Don't tax my beard, bro.

1449
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,160
He was the worst president even than Carter.

1450
01:05:57,900 --> 01:06:03,460
And he was a Kenyan treasonous Kenyan,

1451
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:04,760
Muslim communist.

1452
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:06,940
Peter the Great was.

1453
01:06:07,140 --> 01:06:15,220
But he did introduce concepts to Russia like a navy.

1454
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:17,560
They'd never really been good at that.

1455
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:23,240
And as a result, their asses were always being kicked by Sweden and the Turks and such.

1456
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,940
They still have very bad luck with submarines to this day, though.

1457
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:32,740
I think probably more like Russian sailors had been killed in naval accidents than in wars.

1458
01:06:33,840 --> 01:06:34,280
Wow.

1459
01:06:34,460 --> 01:06:35,760
I could be mistaken, though.

1460
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:42,380
See, again, I get all mixed up with movie Russian submarines as opposed to historical

1461
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:43,000
ones.

1462
01:06:43,180 --> 01:06:44,760
You know, Hunt for Red October.

1463
01:06:45,060 --> 01:06:46,140
I'm thinking of the Kursk.

1464
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:48,060
The Kursk.

1465
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,060
Das Boot.

1466
01:06:49,420 --> 01:06:51,280
But that's the wrong country.

1467
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:52,000
No.

1468
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,020
Yeah.

1469
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:53,800
Krauts, not Ruskies.

1470
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:54,700
Yeah.

1471
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:55,860
That was a great movie, though.

1472
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:59,900
I understand that there is a director's version out.

1473
01:07:00,500 --> 01:07:03,580
I mean, the one I saw on cable was two and a half or three hours long.

1474
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:03,580


1475
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:03,580


1476
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:03,580


1477
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:03,580


1478
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:03,580


1479
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:03,580


1480
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:03,580


1481
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:03,580


1482
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:06,020
Apparently, there's like a four-hour version.

1483
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,880
That would be fun.

1484
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:09,900
Oh, well.

1485
01:07:10,220 --> 01:07:10,740
Oh, well.

1486
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:11,780
So many things to watch.

1487
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:13,500
So little time.

1488
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:17,080
Oh, I wish I would get crippled so I didn't have to work.

1489
01:07:17,220 --> 01:07:19,700
I could just sit and watch shows all the time.

1490
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,880
Careful what you wish for.

1491
01:07:22,140 --> 01:07:22,540
Yeah.

1492
01:07:22,600 --> 01:07:22,940
Well.

1493
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:24,460
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1494
01:07:25,080 --> 01:07:26,440
He was making a funny—

1495
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,640
That was for the audience, not for you?

1496
01:07:27,780 --> 01:07:28,160
Yeah.

1497
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:31,260
Oh, well.

1498
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:32,140
Hey, look.

1499
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,560
We need to go home and—

1500
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:33,560


1501
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:33,560


1502
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:33,560


1503
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:33,560


1504
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:33,560


1505
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:33,560


1506
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:33,560


1507
01:07:33,560 --> 01:07:33,560


1508
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:33,860
Oh.

1509
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,500
—end this charade.

1510
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,120
This farce.

1511
01:07:37,360 --> 01:07:38,760
Synesthesia must begin.

1512
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:39,640
I can taste the color.

1513
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:43,480
Now, we're planning to—like we did last time, we went on a long trip.

1514
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:46,900
We're going to call the show More Than Normal.

1515
01:07:47,120 --> 01:07:48,300
I'll be looking forward to it.

1516
01:07:48,380 --> 01:07:48,620
All right.

1517
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:49,980
We'll be looking forward to it.

1518
01:07:49,980 --> 01:07:52,180
You see, these other colors I have to work with, you see.

1519
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:53,920
Yeah, we were—

1520
01:07:53,920 --> 01:07:54,720
I taste the colors.

1521
01:07:54,740 --> 01:07:55,900
We pressed the flesh with them.

1522
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:56,820
Colors, not just colors.

1523
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:58,980
Oh, I don't want to taste the colors.

1524
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:00,180
Only the colors.

1525
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:01,320
Pressing the flesh.

1526
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,500
That reminds me of a song I'm going to play later.

1527
01:08:03,520 --> 01:08:03,560
Oh, yeah.

1528
01:08:04,540 --> 01:08:05,460
Pressing the flesh.

1529
01:08:05,660 --> 01:08:05,800
Hmm.

1530
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:07,100
We better listen.

1531
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:07,800
Okay.

1532
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:08,780
I'm out of here.

1533
01:08:09,220 --> 01:08:11,180
This is WCSB Cleveland.

1534
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,120
This is WCSB Cleveland.

1535
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:14,020
You come over here and take a seat.

1536
01:08:14,020 --> 01:08:14,340
Oh, okay.

1537
01:08:14,440 --> 01:08:16,140
Because I can't stop.

1538
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:18,460
You know, one of us has to be the captain.

1539
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:20,500
Somebody has to be manning the controls.

1540
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:22,900
Actually, that's the scary thing.

1541
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,620
There's nobody at the controls.

1542
01:08:24,660 --> 01:08:25,100
That is a scary thing.

1543
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:26,120
Quite a scary thing.

1544
01:08:26,120 --> 01:08:27,180
That's the scary truth about life.

1545
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,620
Well, hey, I hope you will all stay tuned.

1546
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:33,560
We got some kind of show up for you.

1547
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:33,560


1548
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:33,560


1549
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:33,560


1550
01:08:33,560 --> 01:08:33,680
Yeah.

1551
01:08:33,740 --> 01:08:34,180
Thanks.

1552
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,440
Can't really make any promises except for the fact that at some point you will want

1553
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:42,940
to turn off your radio, but you'll regret turning it off after you did.

1554
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:44,880
You'll kind of miss it after you do that.

1555
01:08:47,480 --> 01:08:52,320
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show and we're even more glad that some listeners

1556
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:56,260
have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1557
01:08:56,360 --> 01:09:01,320
And not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1558
01:09:02,500 --> 01:09:09,220
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should

1559
01:09:09,220 --> 01:09:15,820
go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

1560
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:19,160
and help out financially as best you can.

1561
01:09:19,580 --> 01:09:25,540
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty and we don't want any subgeniuses

1562
01:09:25,540 --> 01:09:27,180
to make their own situations worse.

1563
01:09:27,620 --> 01:09:30,160
But some of you still have jobs.

1564
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:37,040
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1565
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:39,400
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1566
01:09:40,940 --> 01:09:47,560
All we're saying is that blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay

1567
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:48,200
Dobbs.

1568
01:09:48,940 --> 01:09:53,680
We also take checks and money orders to subgenius foundation.

1569
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,400
P.O.

1570
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:59,100
Box 181417.

1571
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:06,160
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1572
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:11,380
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
