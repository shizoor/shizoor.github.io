1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,860
This is a provocative, sour, highly controversial topic that we tackle over the next 60 minutes.

2
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:24,180
We ask you to suspend your disbelief, those of you who are skeptical, those who are believers in this particular phenomenon.

3
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:31,980
We ask you not to overreact to the stories, the horror stories that you are about to hear.

4
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:41,180
For those doing the view of the United States, the major concern for American people is still the economy, not necessarily the elites.

5
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,660
And today the government released news statistics that seem to indicate that everything is under control.

6
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,480
Everything is under control.

7
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,120
Everything is under control.

8
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:55,880
What he is like.

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,100
What he is like.

10
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,720
But I'm only hoping that the spirit will act with him.

11
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,960
What he is like.

12
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,160
What he is like.

13
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:06,560
But I'm only hoping that we all believe C will be sold at all because

14
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,460
Keelbell today blamed our kill bit.

15
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,340
Keelbell today blamed our kill bit.

16
00:01:10,440 --> 00:01:12,260
Keelbell today blamed our kill bit.

17
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:13,200
Keelbell today.

18
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,880
Working feverishly on the atomic bomb.

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,160
Working feverishly on an Apple satellite that can count the stars.

20
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,600
Seeds in an Apple satellite that can count the seeds on the atomic bomb.

21
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,120
Working feverishly on the atomic bomb.

22
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,740
Working feverishly on the atomic apple.

23
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:34,880
No one on the block.

24
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,240
I don't know anybody.

25
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:37,220
No one on the...

26
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,940
Strips of flesh had hung down his back.

27
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,320
And through lips that were caked with blood, strips of flesh had hung down his block.

28
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,740
This is mankind's first marvelous glimpse of a living human.

29
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:51,860
No one on the block.

30
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:51,860


31
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:52,520
No anybody.

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,640
No one on the block.

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,420
No anybody.

34
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:54,820
Anybody.

35
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,080
No one on the block.

36
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:56,460
Anybody.

37
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,060
Anybody.

38
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,040
No one on the block.

39
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:58,480
No anybody.

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,840
No anybody.

41
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:00,440
Anybody.

42
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,500
No anybody.

43
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,140
Anybody.

44
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:02,640
Anybody.

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:02,840
No anybody.

46
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:02,840


47
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:02,840


48
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,060
No anybody.

49
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:03,580
No anybody.

50
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:03,620
No anybody.

51
00:02:03,620 --> 00:02:06,260
Hatch out of its shell and reach the wound cavity.

52
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:07,980
Lips that were caked with blood.

53
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:08,800
Strips.

54
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:09,540
We all believe.

55
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,160
All believe.

56
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,480
C will be sold at all because we all believe.

57
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:12,960
All believe.

58
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,240
Of course the fish is dead but I'm like.

59
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,120
Of course.

60
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,460
C will be sold at all.

61
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,120
Our kill bit.

62
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,040
Keelbell today blamed our kill bit.

63
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:20,640
Keelbell.

64
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,440
Out of the oven.

65
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,300
Even after shaving.

66
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,620
I got out of the oven.

67
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,640
Even after shaving.

68
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,060
I got out of the oven.

69
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,600
Until she gets export longer.

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,340
Roll it out.

71
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:29,780
Until she gets text longer.

72
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:30,660
Roll it out.

73
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,160
Until she gets out of shaving.

74
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,900
I got even after shaving.

75
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,560
I got even after shaving.

76
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:37,200
I got even after shaving.

77
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,240
I got rolling.

78
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,060
She'll keep the little presses rolling.

79
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,560
She'll keep the little presses.

80
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:41,860
Girls.

81
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,480
Yet it never stings most girls.

82
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,100
Yet it never stings most girls.

83
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,780
Yet it never stings most girls.

84
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,320
Yet it never stings most girls.

85
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,360
The plane was placed.

86
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,220
And they blame placed by theounders of most planes.

87
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,240
The plane was placed.

88
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,540
And they blame placed by the retrouve.

89
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:24,200
without a physician.

90
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:25,340
He comes in the box

91
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,540
giving herself an abortion

92
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,760
without abuse and control.

93
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:28,660
Had had his first

94
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,080
with control.

95
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,100
Had had his first

96
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,060
with abuse and control.

97
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,820
Telephone.

98
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:32,540
Look out.

99
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:33,360
There you know

100
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:33,900
that there's something

101
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:34,800
burning over there.

102
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,020
And this I do know.

103
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,960
The tender age

104
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,120
of 60 hours

105
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,340
shall keep the little

106
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:40,120
gymnasium

107
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:40,720
proud of me.

108
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:41,320
Ballparks.

109
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,040
Where's the stuff

110
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:42,520
coming from?

111
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,200
From the gut.

112
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:43,940
And it's deadly.

113
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:44,960
It helps a lot.

114
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:45,600
Roll it out.

115
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,220
It's dangerous.

116
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,140
Has a good arm.

117
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:47,740
That doesn't mean

118
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,340
anything, Steve.

119
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,240
It's dangerous.

120
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,180
Has a good arm.

121
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:50,780
That doesn't mean

122
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,380
anything, Steve.

123
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,300
It's dangerous.

124
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:53,240
Has a good arm.

125
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:53,840
That doesn't mean

126
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:54,420
anything, Steve.

127
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,560
So when you've got

128
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:56,320
a headache...

129
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,640
Joker!

130
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,220
Joker!

131
00:03:59,500 --> 00:03:59,660
Ah!

132
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,340
This is not a toy.

133
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,060
Properly used,

134
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,620
it can provide

135
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,740
many hours

136
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,520
of dimensional

137
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,100
entertainment.

138
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,560
Both interesting

139
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,480
and fun-filled

140
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,140
as well as

141
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,120
completely adult

142
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,900
in every way.

143
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:15,760
Remember,

144
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,280
follow directions

145
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,420
and hump only

146
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,140
when ready.

147
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,080
A.

148
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,320
Debug

149
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,580
packaging materials.

150
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:25,300
B. Insert your unit

151
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,820
coupling into slot A.

152
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,240
C. Remove plastic

153
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,120
nut holder.

154
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,160
D. Plug in.

155
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,120
Remember, energy is power

156
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,180
and power is everybody's

157
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:37,480
business.

158
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,860
So we suggest that you

159
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,240
turn off any device

160
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,600
not appropriate

161
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,660
to your lifestyle.

162
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,440
If you have followed

163
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,380
these simple steps,

164
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:48,340
you are now in full

165
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:49,680
control of your

166
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,660
subgenius hour of slack.

167
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:07,600
So,

168
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,860
have a good time.

169
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:56,620
We have assumed control.

170
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,600
Yes.

171
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,220
We always assume control.

172
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:02,260
And we have it.

173
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,260
May we assume control of you?

174
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,640
Ah, but what about this man?

175
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,860
The video clearly shows Mr. Howard resisting arrest.

176
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:28,440
Trying to injure the officers with using his body.

177
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,160
Yes, L.A. where we treat the public like a king.

178
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,640
Thanks to David Lynch for that.

179
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,620
And so much else.

180
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:39,620


181
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,020
.

182
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:41,020


183
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,360
.

184
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,060
.

185
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:58,100
.

186
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,100
.

187
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,180
.

188
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,060
.

189
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:21,080
.

190
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,280
.

191
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,280


192
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,440
.

193
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:21,480
.

194
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:21,500
.

195
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:23,240
.

196
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:31,340
.

197
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:34,800
.

198
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:34,860
.

199
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,020
.

200
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:35,040
.

201
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,120
.

202
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:35,140
.

203
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,160
.

204
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:35,180
.

205
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,880
My mind has deteriorated.

206
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,600
Deteriorated in its implementation.

207
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,220
This led to my failure.

208
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,020
Much has been said about my management style.

209
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,200
I can tell you, I've put in long hours for the nation's benefit.

210
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,580
Creating troubles or tragedies.

211
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:58,120
Catchy reports.

212
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,280
Erroneous statements.

213
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,300
Thousands of documents.

214
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,440
Secret bank accounts and diverted funds.

215
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:05,520
So that those can be available to me on a continuing basis.

216
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,460
That's so pretty.

217
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,480
Welcome to another installment.

218
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,620
Wow.

219
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:31,460
A dangerous, perhaps, installment of your subgenius.

220
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:33,820
Hour of Slack.

221
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:39,760
An especially musical hour of Slack tonight, I believe.

222
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,920
I believe that's how it's going to turn out.

223
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:52,280
But it's that hour you come to dread and pray for every week.

224
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,880
And we seldom let you down.

225
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,660
At least as far as showing up, anyway.

226
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,340
What can I say?

227
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,400
It's that Bob show.

228
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,900
That Bob...

229
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:08,560
We got a piece of mail this week from a young listener in another city who wanted...

230
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:11,820
I just heard the end of your show last week.

231
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:16,880
So I didn't really get everything but the address.

232
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:20,820
But send me information about that Bob Dog religion.

233
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:23,080
And we couldn't do that.

234
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:27,220
Because I don't have any information about the Bob Dog religion.

235
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:30,340
But if you have any information about the Bob Dog...

236
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,100
You know...

237
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:35,800
Send it in to the address that I'll be giving to you at the end of tonight's program.

238
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:36,780
And, uh...

239
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,220
Slack.

240
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,620
This is the...

241
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,940
You know, it's the Slack show.

242
00:09:42,340 --> 00:09:44,020
Some nights more Slack than others.

243
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,860
So here's a song to begin with.

244
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,980
Here's a song all about Slack.

245
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,580
Slack.

246
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:55,920
Slack.

247
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,120
Slack.

248
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:58,220
Slack.

249
00:09:59,100 --> 00:09:59,640
Slack.

250
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,220
Slack.

251
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,220


252
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,220


253
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,220


254
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,220


255
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,220


256
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:01,240
Slack.

257
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:01,840
Slack.

258
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,520
You Slack for sure.

259
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,040
Slack me on your wildest dreams.

260
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,500
Right now it's Slack.

261
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:17,760
You have the power to find Slack.

262
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,340
Good something for nothing.

263
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,680
Credit cards are taken.

264
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,020
Slack.

265
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,580
Slack.

266
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,160
Shit cares.

267
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:30,800
I want more Slack.

268
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Send your money now.

269
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:34,940
Conspiracy denied me again.

270
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,400
Send your money.

271
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:38,440
I will have my Slack.

272
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,140
Your Slack show is here.

273
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,060
Slack.

274
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,280
Slack.

275
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,320
Buy more Slack.

276
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,880
You Slack.

277
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,460
Let it go.

278
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,740
You Slack.

279
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,020
You're very old.

280
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,900
All sorts of Slack.

281
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:53,320
You Slack.

282
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,380
Every kind of Slack imaginable.

283
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,620
Slack.

284
00:10:58,620 --> 00:10:59,140
Slack.

285
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,380
Slack from heaven to hell.

286
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,380


287
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,380


288
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,380


289
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,380


290
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,380


291
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,380


292
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,380


293
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,380


294
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,380


295
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,380


296
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,380


297
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,380


298
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:01,720
Slack.

299
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:02,440
Slack from the very inside of the world.

300
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:03,640
Slack.

301
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,900
Slack from right next door.

302
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:09,940
Here you go.

303
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,320
Here's your Slack show, my dear.

304
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,580
Slack show, my lady.

305
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:13,400
Your Slack.

306
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:15,080
My dear.

307
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:15,760
My now.

308
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,440
You Slack.

309
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,000
You Slack.

310
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,160
We have you.

311
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,320
You Slack.

312
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:26,680


313
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:26,680


314
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,120
I don't know who you are.

315
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:31,380
I don't know.

316
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,380


317
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,380


318
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,380


319
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,380


320
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,380


321
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,380


322
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,380


323
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:31,380


324
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,860
I want my slack

325
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:39,000
You slack

326
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:41,860
Slack off

327
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,980
If you have a gas you can have your slack

328
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,100
Money is slack

329
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,100
Something for nothing

330
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,920
Slack is great

331
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,000
Slack

332
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:05,200
Slack is government control for your protection

333
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:08,580
I want more slack

334
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:10,840
Slack is not for everyone

335
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:17,200
You cannot take my slack away

336
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:19,820
Slack can be taken by prescription

337
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:35,440
Slack is not for everyone

338
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:37,200
Slack is for everyone

339
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:45,880
Well that was the, or were, OBE, OutBanned Experience, actually Kings of Feedback slash OBE

340
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:54,220
And I think OBE would like you to know that their phone number is not what it once was

341
00:12:54,220 --> 00:13:00,320
You remember it was 1-800-OB, you know, OutBanned, 1-800-OUTBANNED

342
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,280
It's not that anymore

343
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:07,460
If you want to join their audio shenanigans, and you do, believe me

344
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,900
Don't call that number I said a minute ago

345
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:13,620
Call 1-617-LICKOBE

346
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,520
L-I-C-K-O-B-E

347
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:23,280
Those of you who have called their number in the past know how much fun it is

348
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,840
Fun waiting for those of you

349
00:13:25,840 --> 00:13:27,280
And speaking of fun, here's something

350
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,320
Well I like it and I hope you will too

351
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,180
I think that's what you get from watching this

352
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,060
If you want to get in touch with me in the future, just call me

353
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,440
I'll make sure to come back

354
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,840
Okay, thanks

355
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,620
See you next time

356
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:51,620


357
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:51,620

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:51,620


362
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:51,620


363
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:51,620


364
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:51,620

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:51,620

00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:51,620


367
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:51,620


368
00:13:53,620 --> 00:13:54,420
Hey

369
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:54,820
Hey

370
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,220
Hey

371
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:57,360
Hey

00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,120
Hey

00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,800
Hey

00:13:59,800 --> 00:13:59,880
Hey

375
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:00,100
Hey

376
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:00,280
Hey

377
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:00,320
Hey

00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,500
Hey

Slowly becoming part of the water

387
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:33,380
Like a frog who never knows

388
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,940

Between the yellow love you give and the white sex I take

421
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,600
I just want to fertilize you

422
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:49,240

427
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,640
The tracks will appear

428
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,540
From the instrument of death

429
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,200
The bright lights will change over time

430
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,700
The light of sun will shine in the ground

431
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,780
So when the skies of coolness rise

432
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:22,700
They'll all be on its way

433
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:35,680
They'll all be on its way

434
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,960
And I got my thoughts in order

435
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,620
I see hell out this year

436
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:41,280
All I see is a full space

437
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,840
Oh, I got the time to get on now

438
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:58,320
Oh, I got the time to get on now

439
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,320
Oh, the tick is out of an eight

Oh, one make comes out of a chicken

a nice long tune called Egg

456
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:49,300
by one of my new favorite bands called Mr. Bungle

457
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:54,720
and these, with any luck, are the Android Sisters

458
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:58,380

00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:32,240
have you been deprived of money do you stop from money withdrawal do you need a money fix

462
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:38,760
if your money is not big enough what if you lost your job the job you can't stand the job

don't you think it's odd to thin in because it's painful sometimes phones do you stop

474
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,240
it at a constant rate and then think about it this all day long how many hours a day

475
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,540
can you think about it

476
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,600

478
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:59,480

479
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:02,520
money

480
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:18,460
but money means security no money means terror oh oh

00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:37,880
the pharaoh with satisfaction

483
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:47,540
but then to his immense surprise his empire fell before his eyes a hundred thousand busy slaves

484
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:48,260
down the

485
00:24:59,740 --> 00:25:00,500
tools

486
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,740
stood like the canyon

487
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,560
the pharaoh pulled up in his wagon

488
00:25:09,020 --> 00:25:15,360
and saw within those walls of glass i heard of whales go racing past a hundred thousand fishy

489
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:18,320
tails crossed his mind about the day

490
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,200
the

491
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:39,820
the broken tablets had been mended

492
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,720
the golden calf had been up and dead

493
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,960
and old folks said

494
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:56,220
the fire would talk of voices from the sky babies sailing down the nile the recipe for locust pie

495
00:25:56,220 --> 00:26:00,940
a hundred thousand frogs per mile we'd always ask them to describe

496
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:02,840
the

497
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:06,280

498
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,000

499
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:07,540

500
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,620

00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,780

504
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:17,780

505
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:19,280
the child

506
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,560
Bushes that refuse to burn Steamy sandals hardly worn

507
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:29,240
Raining blood, raining bread The night we painted Egypt red

508
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:33,940
Now shut that covet, shut that lie Now shut that bonk, you neighbour's wife

509
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:38,720
The recipe for egg-tripe lice A hundred ways to kill a fly

00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:43,460
Love your daddy, love your mummy Put your bread and milk and honey

511
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:48,120
He cut his fish, he did, he did Never beat the wife and kids

512
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:52,700
Sloughed through deserts, sloughed through sand Until we reached the promised land

513
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:57,200
Now shan't not kill, now shan't not steal Shan't not plough in a jottery

514
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,140
Jottery size of fifty-pea White camel, camel shoe, camel shoe, camel shoe

00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:28,800

Music

527
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:59,400
Okay, following the Android Sisters, talking on the subject,

528
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:02,780
although I think we are all the subject of money,

529
00:28:02,920 --> 00:28:08,020
following that was either a song called Charlton Heston

530
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:10,740
by a band called Stump,

531
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,200
or the song may have well just been called Stump Charlton Heston,

532
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,960
which isn't hard if you've ever seen him.

533
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,900
I'm not sure about that, but I know this.

534
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:21,780
This is The Clash.

535
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,440
Of course. Of course.

536
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,240
Raymond?

537
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,840
The Clash.

538
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,680
The Clash.

539
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:26,220
The Clash.

540
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,220


541
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:28,540
Don't leave.

542
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,620
Don't leave.

543
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,540
Don't leave.

544
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:56,860
Well, I have actually, so far.

545
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,040
Rajwa, Rajwa.

546
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,960
Rajwa, Rajwa.

547
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:43,800
Rajwa, Rajwa.

548
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:11,520
Rajwa, Rajwa.

549
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,020
Rajwa, Rajwa.

550
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,880
Rajwa, Rajwa.

551
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:50,540
The poor and the rich, the young and the old be smeared with guiltless gore.

552
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:52,600
I mustn't panic.

553
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,040
No time for regrets.

554
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,520
The Congress wants more.

555
00:31:57,700 --> 00:32:01,100
Rebellion, the awful realization of it assails us.

556
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,480
Who is to command us all?

557
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:12,760
My name does not matter.

558
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,960
I have my misgivings, little experience.

559
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:20,600
There's no sleep for us. All is chaos.

560
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,180
But it's better than we dared hope.

561
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:25,720
The slaves to buy their freedom with army pay.

562
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,500
Our insubordinate, undisciplined New Englanders are beginning to obey orders.

563
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,940
We're true rebels now.

564
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:37,600
All of us here and in Congress walk daily in the shadow of the hangman.

565
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:42,880
But whenever any form of government becomes destructive of those ends,

566
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:46,560
it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it

567
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,900
and to institute new government.

568
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,920
We can expect the utter destruction,

569
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:54,780
invasion of all our homes.

570
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,300
Savage is turned loose on our frontiers.

571
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,040
But we have more than our lives or our property.

572
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,460
The nosso trabalho vai ser semana,

573
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:15,460


574
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:15,460

Thank you.

584
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:12,640
Several times in fact, I'm able to transport myself there and back.

585
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:21,000
Zero gravity on an interstellar slide, breaking through to the other side.

586
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,760
Sex, food, sex, food.

587
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:45,020
TV preachers and creature preachers all night long.

588
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:53,300
TV preachers and creature preachers all night long.

589
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:11,480
Hey! Hey!

590
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,500
Sex, food, sex, food.

591
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,540
Sex, food, sex, food.

592
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,600
Sex, food, sex, food.

593
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:44,640


594
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,660
Hey! Hey!

595
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,920
Hey! Hey!

596
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,660
Hey! Hey!

597
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,920
I've been to the Twilight Zone several times in fact.

598
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:58,760
I'm able to transport myself there and back.

599
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:06,940
Zero gravity on an interstellar slide, breaking through to the other side.

600
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,720
Sex, food, sex, food.

601
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,680
Sex, food, sex, food.

602
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,980
TV preachers and creature preachers all night long.

603
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,580
TV preachers and creature preachers all night long.

604
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,260
Life and love.

605
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,020
Sex, food, sex, food.

606
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,080
Sex, food, sex, food.

607
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,140
Sex, food, sex, food.

608
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,040
Well, I'll be darned.

609
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:15,740
That was a CD that just happened to be here at the station tonight.

610
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,320
It's a group called Alien Sex Fiend.

611
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,460
It's a song called Alien Sex Fiend.

612
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:28,080
And last week we got a call, or I got a call, from a listener with a request.

613
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:36,340
And since this was not only a paid up pleasure to this program, but a member of our beloved church,

614
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:38,620
we hear those requests.

615
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:49,260
Bob and his chosen, they do not hear the prayers of those who do not pledge or join the Church of the Subgenius.

616
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:53,640
So, this is an old favorite, although we haven't played this in a long, long time.

617
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,440
We only played it once.

618
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,380
This is Hubert Goetz.

619
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,960
This Sunday, stay tuned right after tapeworm baseball for...

620
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:06,320
Abedin Costello, Meek.

621
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,300
The Antichrist.

622
00:39:07,500 --> 00:39:09,300
But Abed is the Animus.

623
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,120
Lou Costello is the Anima.

624
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,220
Spring Byington is the Magna Mater.

625
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,500
And John Ireland is the Beast.

626
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,560
In Abed and Costello Meet the Antichrist.

627
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:28,380
Check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check, check.

628
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,340
What is it now, Costello?

629
00:39:32,580 --> 00:39:33,780
Look, look, look at that throne.

630
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,640
Which throne?

631
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:37,080
That throne, the Holy of Holies.

632
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,460
You mean the seat of the throne of Jerusalem?

633
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,880
I mean the throne of Jehovah.

634
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:43,920
I saw him sitting there.

635
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,720
What's the big deal? There's nobody there.

636
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:51,820
Will you stop fooling around and shut up and pass me the Kabbalah.

637
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,400
Check, I saw him there.

638
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:53,860
Who?

639
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,400
David Rockefeller.

640
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:01,300
But if I see you hitting the Holy Sacrament one more time.

641
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:03,680
See our two G.I. jerks say,

642
00:40:03,680 --> 00:40:05,900
Nuts to the Nazis like this.

643
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,360
Now Homer, listen to me.

644
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,580
It's simple.

645
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:14,840
The forces of dark and the forces of light will fight for the last time.

646
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,920
You mean like Joe Louis?

647
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:18,160
No, no, Homer, the apocalypse.

648
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:21,940
Oh yeah, apocalypse. Oh, I like that Jamaican music.

649
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:22,420
No, no.

650
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,160
Don't you understand? It's Armageddon.

651
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:26,360
Armageddon what?

652
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,660
No, not Eurogeddon, Armageddon.

653
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:30,800
I don't understand.

654
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,660
You're telling me there's a final fight between dark and light?

655
00:40:33,660 --> 00:40:34,840
But it's not a title book.

656
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,360
That's right.

657
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:39,540
You tell me it's Apocalypseo, but it's not Jamaican Gant.

658
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,080
That's right.

659
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:47,420
You tell me it's Armageddon, but the only thing I know is I'm getting tired of trying to figure out this book of revelations.

660
00:40:48,100 --> 00:40:56,920
See Lou go gaga over curvaceous Hilary Brooke, but bite off more hosts than he can chew when he winds up up to his stripes in hot holy water.

661
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:02,440
Homer, it's kind of hot in here.

662
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:04,840
How about if we step outside to the veranda?

663
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,280
That's okay by me, lady.

664
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,440
Why, you adorable little finger. Shy, aren't you?

665
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,980
Ah, shucks, yes, ma'am.

666
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,100
Call me Hilary.

667
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,880
Okay, Hilary.

668
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:28,480
Well, if you're ever lonely, Homer, you can give me a call. You won't regret it.

669
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,880
You're a nice lady. What's your number?

670
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:36,880
Here, it's 666-6666.

671
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:38,680
666-6666.

672
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,020
That's right.

673
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:42,220
666-6666.

674
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:51,940
Abb and Gastello meet the Antichrist this Sunday right after tapeworm baseball.

675

677
