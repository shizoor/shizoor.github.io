1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080
Test, test.

2
00:00:01,180 --> 00:00:04,160
And, uh, let's just try this one.

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:14,980
The future is no longer in your imagination.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:20,980
Dominating the airwaves for over a decade.

5
00:00:21,420 --> 00:00:22,660
The power of God.

6
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,880
Turn it up loud.

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,340
Blow out the windshield.

8
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,280
Ahem.

9
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,780
Ah, yes.

10
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,900
Sounds so purty.

11
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,960
Ahem.

12
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:51,900
The subgenius is back.

13
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,400
It's the subgenius, Charlie.

14
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:58,780
Ha, ha, ha.

15
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,060
Ha, ha, ha.

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,060
Ha, ha, ha.

17
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,420
Ha, ha, ha.

18
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:11,180
Fellas, we need to find out what this, the Black Lodge, has to do with that.

19
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,600
The subgenius.

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:13,920
The subgenius.

21
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,280
Hour of Slash.

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:16,620
Hour of Slash.

23
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,960
You wouldn't believe there's a connection.

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,980
Ha, ha, ha.

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:23,860
Windom Earl does, Harry.

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,260
Windom Earl does, Harry.

27
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:26,300
Windom Earl does, Harry.

28
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,620
Windom Earl does, Harry.

29
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:31,240
Wistful.

30
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:33,200
Cho-o-o-o- medida, hooray.

31
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,780
Wistful.

32
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,280
Viney, throat-nosing personell.

33
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:41,100
Swindling.

34
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,140
Wistful, well let's fight,

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:57,380
a lil wistful my boy.

36
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:06,860
If it helps me to better prepare and present my program, I understand and agree to abide by that policy, the above policy.

37
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,600
Thank you.

38
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:11,600
This is your host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:17,220
And I think we ought to blow that stuff off, man.

40
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,160
Let's just do the show.

41
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,580
Let's just go for it, man.

42
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,260
Let's just go, go, go, go.

43
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,120
Yes.

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,360
Yes.

45
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:31,780
And all I know is I'm going to have this show done in the time it takes you to hear this show.

46
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:33,420
We're just going to whip right on through it.

47
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,960
Yes, that's the only way to do it.

48
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:37,240
It's the best way to just gravitate.

49
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,380
Yes, a tape.

50
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,540
And not even know what it might be.

51
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:49,780
But because it is a subgenius tape sitting on a subgenius desk, then we know that it, well, actually could be a sorry piece of garbage.

52
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,040
I know that.

53
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,720
You know that.

54
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,460
But, you know, we just forged ahead.

55
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,060
We.

56
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:54,900
We go onwards.

57
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,700
We go straight ahead, baby.

58
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,800
Every spare.

59
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:06,920
Sure, the conspiracy may be out to strip your skin from your bones or strip your mind from inside your skull.

60
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:09,080
Strip your money from your wallet.

61
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:10,460
Well, friends, we want to also.

62
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:19,360
But, you know, as G. Gordon Gordon said so long ago, sure, you're getting ripped off every day.

63
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:22,940
But you can learn to enjoy it because some ways are fun.

64
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,520
Actually, come to think of it, I, as usual, malappropriated that.

65
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:36,160
I believe he said you're getting screwed every day, but you can learn to enjoy it.

66
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,400
Some ways are fun.

67
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:42,720

Let the girl babies live!

148
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,900

And we get into a loop

156
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,240
Which goes on forever

157
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:30,020
Oh, mon, what do you think of Radio actual anyway?

158
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,040
I'm glad it's over

159
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,060
Yeah I think a lot of people

160
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:32,860
Are out there to accident

161
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,260
I think actually you probably sum it up

162
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:34,920
In several words

163
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,420
Yeah, hey you been listening to

164
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:36,540
.

165
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,480
And we get into a loop

166
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,560
Which goes on forever

167
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,960
Stupid!

168
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:45,880
Stupid!

169
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,100
Around

170
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:50,620
Up

171
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,520
In and out

172
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:54,960
Around

173
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,320
Up

174
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,260
In and out

175
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,180
Well he didn't mean to

176
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,500
He got over anxious

177
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,340
Here take a look

178
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:21,340


179
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:21,400
And out

180
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:28,780
Beyond

181
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:29,100
Down

182
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:29,120
Up

183
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,140
Down

184
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,160
Up

185
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:12,660
If you always want to have clean power, wash the dirt and germs away.

186
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,100
If you always want to have clean power.

187
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,140
After it gets into the toilet,

188
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,980
the juice runs out your mouth.

189
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,040
Give it at least three good washes a day.

190
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,720
Spread that soap around.

191
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,700
The toilet seat is cleaned by washing.

192
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:10,160
The sink? The sink?

193
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,600
Spray Pro 409 all around the face of the toilet.

194
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,720
When I get up, well, I can even do that.

195
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,240
I have to wash my hands again.

196
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:25,960
Then you take your bath towel and wipe the floor all around the toilet very carefully.

197
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:25,960


198
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:30,900
Keep yourself clean by washing.

199
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:33,560
And wash your hands after doing that.

200
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,840
By washing.

201
00:08:36,420 --> 00:08:41,460
Tonight I wiped off the toilet seat while all around, including underneath,

202
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,460
I flipped the toilet seat up.

203
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:44,840
Spread that soap around.

204
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,920
And spray more Pro 409.

205
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,660
Give it at least three good washes a day.

206
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:55,900
And underneath where the dirt might be hiding.

207
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:55,940
Underneath where the dirt might be hiding.

208
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:55,940


209
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,360
No one can really tell you what to do.

210
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,080
Going to the toilet.

211
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,260
Be careful.

212
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,100
Spray more Pro 409.

213
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,260
Inside the toilet.

214
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,600
Under the rim.

215
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,740
Be careful.

216
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:14,000
With another towel, clean under the rim of the toilet also.

217
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,960
Don't want anything left.

218
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,840
No dirt.

219
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,440
Give it.

220
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,960
At least rinse out your mouth.

221
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,820
Be careful.

222
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,040
Don't want anything in the toilet.

223
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:27,820
Be careful.

224
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:31,880
Be careful.

225
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,940
Hey, don't touch the toilet paper.

226
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,280
Be careful.

227
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,340
Don't touch it.

228
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,140
Be careful.

229
00:09:39,460 --> 00:09:40,620
Don't touch it.

230
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,340
Unseen bacteria samples.

231
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,000
And I go ahead and wipe the toilet seat again with alcohol.

232
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,680
Let's see.

233
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:50,380
Everywhere?

234
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,200
Yeah.

235
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,320
Even from a doorknob.

236
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,120
Doorknob.

237
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,020
And how do we get rid of Mr. Doork.

238
00:09:58,060 --> 00:09:59,140
Mr. Doorknob.

239
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,340
How do we get rid of Mr. Doorknob.

240
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:01,340


241
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:01,600
It.

242
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,840
Show me.

243
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:15,600
Son you or?

244
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,280
Music, this is music

245
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,400
I open my mouth and out comes music

246
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,120
This is the dumbest music ever made

247
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:47,180
Music, this is music

248
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,220
I open my mouth and out comes music

249
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,000
This is the dumbest music ever made

250
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,460
A mountain of you

251
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,220
Spurting from a dock

252
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,180
Never a friend

253
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,280
Soon you'll be dead

254
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:09,660
Seems kind of out of shape

255
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,520
Doo doo doo

256
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,300
Doo doo doo doo doo doo

257
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:35,500
Music, this is music

258
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,660
I open my mouth and out comes music

259
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:40,240
This is the dumbest music ever made

260
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,500
Music, this is music

261
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:42,500


262
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,400
Music, this is music out of my mouth.

263
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,060
And up comes music, this is the dumbest music ever made.

264
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,700
Hi there, so how's everybody enjoying the song so far?

265
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:58,220
Well, now here's your chance to sing along.

266
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,700
Just fill in the blanks with the name of somebody in the room.

267
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:08,840
And if you sing out of key, a laser will shoot out of this tape and blow up your head.

268
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,720
Ready? Here we go.

269
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:19,880
This is, I open my mouth and out comes, this is the dumbest ever made.

270
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:28,640
This is, I open my mouth and out comes, this is the dumbest ever made.

271
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:51,580
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do.

272
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:21,280
This is, I open my mouth and out comes, this is the dumbest ever made.

273
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:40,520
This is, I open my mouth and out comes, this is the dumbest ever made.

274
00:13:56,220 --> 00:14:06,340
This is, I open my mouth and out comes, this is the dumbest ever made.

275
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:51,160
This is, I open my mouth and out comes, this is the dumbest ever made.

276
00:14:51,160 --> 00:15:21,140
This is, I open my mouth and out comes, this is the dumbest ever made.

277
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,860
Glory, thy faded glory.

278
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,960
Hold it!

279
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,540
There!

280
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,980
Kingsville, Texas.

281
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,300
Rutters.

282
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,700
Heaven, oh, how are you?

283
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:45,960
The greeting may take some getting used to, but Cleberg County commissioners have thrown their support behind a local man's campaign to take the hell out of hell-o.

284
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:50,900
County Judge Pete De La Garza said on Wednesday that the commissioners voted unanimously,

285
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:57,780
for a resolution urging the use of heaven-o instead of hello in greetings.

286
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,440
Is everybody using it?

287
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,720
The answer is, of course, no.

288
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:06,100
It's a very new thing, and everybody's a little apprehensive, De La Garza told Rutters.

289
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,040
I suppose it's like everything else.

290
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,140
Once you get adjusted to it, you might start using it.

291
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,400
Well, that's certainly true of frappy, cigarettes, sadomasochistic sex.

292
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,880
The idea was spawned by flea market operators.

293
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:30,500
Senator Leonzo Canales, who thought it sinister that the root of hello was hell,

294
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:38,620
he has led a three-year campaign to get the county to remove the offensive word.

295
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:46,700
His victory will result in telephones being answered in the county courthouse with the salutation heaven-o.

296
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:51,120
Well, our friend David McConville called that county courthouse,

297
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:54,060
and got a nice old lady on the phone, and you know what she said?

298
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,060
She said, hello.

299
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,980
And David said, heaven-o.

300
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:03,240
And she said, I don't say that.

301
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:05,680
Huh.

302
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:07,640
Huh.

303
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:08,360
Huh.

304
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:09,700
Huh.

305
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:11,080


306
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:12,840
Huh.

307
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,060
Huh.

308
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,000
Huh.

309
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:15,380
Huh.

310
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:15,600
Huh.

311
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,020
Huh.

312
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,020


313
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,020


314
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:16,080
Huh.

315
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,280


316
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:16,280


317
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:17,060
Huh.

318
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,340
Huh.

319
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,220
Huh.

320
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,480
Huh.

321
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,440
Huh.

322
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,360
Hah.

323
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:35,700
Huh.

324
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:35,700


325
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:35,700


326
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,680
Huh.

327
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:38,740
Whoa.

328
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:40,020
I don't want you to dried out.

329
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,020


330
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:40,340
This is my reaching a golf club.

331
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:40,360
This is my home.

332
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:41,360
I live close by a large beach.

333
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,040
Pогда scoob curious life.

334
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,580
Rough ass.

335
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,200
I don't know how we can use any of that tape.

336
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,120
You mean the coffee tape?

337
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,760
Man practicing about the coffee songs.

338
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:04,100
Well, they were going to do the, you know, that coffee song,

339
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,360
the one that used to be on TV.

340
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,440
I didn't talk to them about it.

341
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,760
Because I have a copy of it, and I'd never heard it before

342
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:10,940
until I bought that record.

343
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:14,360
You know the one I'm talking about, the famous...

344
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:20,000
It's with a fake percolator percolating the music.

345
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,640
That's the one I'm talking about.

346
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,120
Yeah, you're talking about the old, beautiful...

347
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,200
I used to love to watch that.

348
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,960
Where they send you, if you drink too much coffee,

349
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,460
they send you to the Maxwell House.

350
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,580
Yeah, that's right.

351
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,580
Well, you know, there's nothing better than

352
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,680
a long, deep, throaty pull of a cup of coffee

353
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:41,100
as rough as sandpaper and as strong as blue cheese.

354
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:41,960
There it goes.

355
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,860
Ah, just swill it down.

356
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,180
If you want something done right, do it yourself, you know.

357
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,460
We coffee connoisseurs here on the show

358
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,260
will climb the Andes for that perfect bean.

359
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,380
Yes, um...

360
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:02,460
Another cup of bubbling, searing, lava-like java.

361
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,500
I think lye's lovely.

362
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,200
Thick with Mexican chocolate.

363
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:05,620
Lye?

364
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,060
Lye?

365
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,620
You can see in the background there,

366
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,800
the band that dare not speak its name drinking too much coffee.

367
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:13,800
But for that perfect cup, you still have to do some work,

368
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,120
so...

369
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:17,420
Whether you're an old pro brushing up on your coffee skills

370
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:19,400
or new to the brew,

371
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:22,920
there's always something fun to learn.

372
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:26,360
Why go through the work of buying whole beans

373
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,040
that you have to grind yourself?

374
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:29,000
Simple.

375
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,580
Once you grind coffee,

376
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:33,740
the freshness and flavor last just a few days

377
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,940
and are then blown away by the winds of time,

378
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,000
never to be retrieved,

379
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:42,620
never to be enjoyed in the rich, throaty taste

380
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,060
of a cup of...

381
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,960
morning fresh breakfast coffee.

382
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,240
Coffee.

383
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,640
But withered away, winnowed into the winds of cold,

384
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,220
bleak eternity.

385
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,000
That's why I recommend grinding your beans in small batches

386
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,180
right before you brew.

387
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:01,160
And, um, just how should you grind?

388
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:03,560
Well, do I have to tell you everything?

389
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,300
Grind it the way you feel like it.

390
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,580
I mean, uh, time it, you know?

391
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,700
The flavor extracted from coffee depends on the fineness of the grind.

392
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:18,760
And the time it's exposed to the bubbling, boiling, searing hot water

393
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,900
that you prepare in your space-age tea kettle.

394
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,500
Oh, I've been there, friends.

395
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,840
I know how it is when you're producing coffee

396
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,180
that's a masterwork of culinary art.

397
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:28,960
Mmm-mmm.

398
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,900
And the best place to taste it is out in the desert.

399
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:36,440
Well, of course, if that works the best for you,

400
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,260
and that depends on your personal taste.

401
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:43,740
So take the time to experiment with the different methods of grinding, brewing,

402
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,560
perking, and dripping.

403
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:51,880
Now, you may have wondered if water quality really affects the quality of the coffee.

404
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,800
Of course, if you're brewing with untreated sewer water,

405
00:20:54,980 --> 00:21:01,880
it may indeed impinge upon the bouquet and zest of that wake-up cup of java you've been craving.

406
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,820
Since water is the main ingredient in coffee,

407
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:08,380
water quality has a significant impact on your coffee's taste.

408
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:13,720
Tap water that is flat or loaded with chlorine or mineral water,

409
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:13,940
or any other mineral that is not

410
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,460
will produce coffee with that taste.

411
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:20,320
So always use clean, cold, fresh water.

412
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:23,180
Water trickling down from the mountains.

413
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:27,400
Let tap water run a few moments like a mountain waterfall.

414
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:31,760
Then you fill your pot with water that has not been sitting in pipes

415
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,700
or hot water tanks.

416
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,280
It's beautiful, yummy, brown.

417
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,780
But beware.

418
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:42,980
Water with a high mineral content can cause mineralization

419
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:46,760
of your internal stomach and inguinal canal.

420
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:51,920
Yes, these metallic structures form inside the body

421
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,260
when the mineral content of the water is too high.

422
00:21:55,460 --> 00:22:00,920
Yes, but their crystalline sharpness is a danger to the rest of the health of the body.

423
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,740
We'll wait until you hit the old water.

424
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,740
I'll be the old head after the show.

425
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,620
Don't hit it too hard.

426
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,300
Until then...

427
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:08,180
God, you know, these things inside of me are so dangerous and beautiful.

428
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:11,000
But if the mineral content is too high,

429
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,360
they may brew a flat, sour cup of coffee.

430
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,600
Ah, but we'll drink it anyway because...

431
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,740
Oh, yeah, I drink it bitter or sweet, you know.

432
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:24,820
It is true that coffee will get a thick and bitter taste if it sits for too long.

433
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,560
Typically, a coffee pot squats on a heated burner to keep the coffee hot.

434
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,880
However, if it's on that burner for too long, water begins to evaporate.

435
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:39,560
The coffee becomes thick due to coffee solids that are left behind in the evaporation process.

436
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:44,320
Also, the evaporated water drifts up into the used grounds

437
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,440
and bitter coffee characteristics drip into the coffee pot.

438
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,580
Drip at a time.

439
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,100
Just like the locusts that stole Pharaoh's wheat.

440
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:58,200
Another locust came and carried away a grain of wheat.

441
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,360
Wait a minute.

442
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:03,060
And another locust came and carried away a grain of wheat.

443
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:06,560
And then another locust came and carried away a coffee bean.

444
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:07,580
Hey, bring that back here!

445
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:09,940
And then another locust came and carried away a paper cup.

446
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,500
The best ways to avoid thick, bitter coffee...

447
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,920
And the next locust came and carried away the half and half.

448
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,200
...immediately removed the used coffee grounds and filtered from the basket after the coffee cycle...

449
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,360
And the next one came and took a whole cappuccino machine and flew off into the sky.

450
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,260
You'd be amazed what difference that makes.

451
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:23,260


452
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:29,260
Only brew the amount of coffee that'll be consumed and store leftover coffee in a thermos or something like that.

453
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,860
Remember, don't let it go to waste.

454
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:32,240
Uh-uh.

455
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,840
There are kids somewhere in the world who can't drink coffee.

456
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:39,640
Tonight, as you listen to us live here on the show,

457
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:42,340
though the children have no coffee...

458
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:47,360
Before serving, always stir the coffee in the pot or thermos.

459
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:51,720
This will ensure that the coffee flavor is perfect for each cup.

460
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,200
Thank you for coffee, John!

461
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:53,740
And a final tip.

462
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,920
Never interrupt the brewing process.

463
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,600
Brew us, interrupt us,

464
00:23:57,680 --> 00:23:59,340
by filling your cup in the pot.

465
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,800
In the middle of the brewing cycle.

466
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,520
This is a definite no-no.

467
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:11,160
Yes, coffee achievers, if you follow these simple rules and do not violate the coffee code,

468
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:15,300
you can break on through to the other side.

469
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,360
He said it!

470
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,060
Your Saturation type picture says to follow these rules.

471
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,060


472
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,060


473
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,060


474
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,060


475
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:56,840
It's not anика�

476
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:56,840


477
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,840
Just like you told me.

478
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,320
You didn't have a book in your father'sring that held you responsible for this situation.

479
00:24:59,320 --> 00:24:59,320


480
00:24:59,320 --> 00:24:59,320


481
00:24:59,320 --> 00:24:59,320


482
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:57,340
DB

483
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:00,880
We'll be right back.

484
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:39,280
We'll be right back.

485
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:11,000
We'll be right back.

486
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:34,580
We'll be right back.

487
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,940
We'll be right back.

488
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,420
We'll be right back.

489
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:15,880
We'll be right back.

490
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:32,480
We'll be right back.

491
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:14,400
We'll be right back.

492
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:29,720
We'll be right back.

493
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:00,240
We'll be right back.

494
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,180
We'll be right back.

495
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,080
We'll be right back.

496
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:30,340
We'll be right back.

497
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:26,220
We'll be right back.

498
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:59,320
We'll be right back.

499
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:01,540
We'll be right back.

500
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:32,760
We'll be right back.

501
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:01,100
We'll be right back.

502
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,420
They really do.

503
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,480
And I'm not just saying that because I'm an egomaniac.

504
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,280
You're not an egomaniac if it's true.

505
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:56,380
You want your sushi?

506
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:58,520
I got your sushi.

507
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:00,640
You want your sushi?

508
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,000
I got your sushi.

509
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:04,920
You want your sushi?

510
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,340
I got your sushi.

511
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:09,520
You want your sushi?

512
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:11,760
I got your sushi.

513
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,980
I ate wasabi.

514
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,220
That is my hobby.

515
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,440
I ate wasabi.

516
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,680
That is my hobby.

517
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,840
I ate wasabi.

518
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,200
That is my hobby.

519
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,300
I ate wasabi.

520
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:29,320
That is my hobby.

521
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,320


522
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,440
Mahave, hit it!

523
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:56,940
No fire on that grill, cause I won't need it.

524
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:58,680
Make my fish raw.

525
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:01,220
So I can eat it.

526
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,100
Hey, hey!

527
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,740
You want your sushi?

528
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,100
I got your sushi.

529
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,380
You want your sushi?

530
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,580
I got your sushi.

531
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,840
You want your sushi?

532
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:19,260
I got your sushi.

533
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,120
Raw.

534
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,080
Hey, hey, hey!

535
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,800
Sushi!

536
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,020
I got your sushi!

537
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:28,460
Sushi!

538
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:28,520
Yeah!

539
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:33,760
Sushi!

540
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:37,940
I got your, got your sushi!

541
00:36:40,460 --> 00:36:42,260
I got your sushi!

542
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,360
I got your sushi!

543
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:53,640
Thank you very much.

544
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:55,900
Who used to friends?

545
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,640
And that was Jehovah Hates Fred

546
00:36:58,640 --> 00:36:59,320
on one of my shows.

547
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,700
On Warner Brothers Records and tapes.

548
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,780
Jehovah Hates Fred

549
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:04,540
with the great Pope Fred

550
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,680
and St. Andrew

551
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:09,100
there up in the Chicago area.

552
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,760
Yes, beautiful Jehovah

553
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,140
does indeed hate Fred.

554
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,540
Well, this is the sushi improv.

555
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:17,140
Oh, no, no.

556
00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,340
I don't want to hear the sushi improv right now.

557
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,060
Let's get back to the interview.

558
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:23,060
Now, Jimmy, where did...

559
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,760
...your own?

560
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,420
Was this actually your own invention?

561
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:27,740
Was Bob involved?

562
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:29,220
Or did you hear somebody else doing it?

563
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:29,820
Or was it something you can adapt it?

564
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:30,580
Oh, here's what happened.

565
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,140
This is the truth.

566
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,760
You know, like...

567
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:33,480
Yes.

568
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:36,220
Can you hear that okay?

569
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:36,900
Yeah, splendid.

570
00:37:37,020 --> 00:37:37,420
Thank you.

571
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,740
That was a good answer.

572
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,320
Thanks, Jimmy.

573
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:41,340
I just feel like talking to air now.

574
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,580
I just feel like rocking it out there.

575
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,400
Yeah, that's fine.

576
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:46,220
Oh, look, we've got to finish this up.

577
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,220
There's other...

578
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,680
I need to get to that other Jehovah.

579
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:52,340
We'll let you play your song in a minute, Jimmy.

580
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,420
We've got to get back to...

581
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,140
Jimmy, one quick...

582
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,500
Hang about.

583
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:55,980
Jimmy, one quick...

584
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,320
Hang about.

585
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,800
One more time.

586
00:37:58,180 --> 00:37:59,240
Can we do that one more time?

587
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,320


588
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,320


589
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,320


590
00:37:59,320 --> 00:37:59,320


591
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,080
You want to do another one?

592
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:00,820
All right, here we go.

593
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:01,220
One time.

594
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:01,520
Just once.

595
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,320
In a minute.

596
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,160
We'll be with you in just a second, Jimmy.

597
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,400
Jimmy, one very quick question out of all the songs on the new album.

598
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:08,220
Real quick.

599
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:18,120
I've often wondered, why did men fear the unknown?

600
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:37,780
Because I didn't hear you say, it depends, was because I don't hear

601
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,980
the position I

602
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,960
guitar solo

603
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,480
vara

604
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:11,220
vara

605
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,260
vara

606
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:33,440
vara

607
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:33,440


608
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:02,620
We'll see you next time.

609
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:08,140
We'll see you next time.

610
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,080
We'll see you next time.

611
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:24,140
We'll see you next time.

612
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:44,180
We'll see you next time.

613
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:23,560
We'll see you next time.

614
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,600
We'll see you next time.

615
00:43:09,260 --> 00:43:33,420
We'll see you next time.

616
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:47,540
We'll see you next time.

617
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,920
We'll see you next time.

618
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:41,200
We'll see you next time.

619
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,120
We'll see you next time.

620
00:45:38,780 --> 00:45:43,440
We'll see you next time.

621
00:46:04,020 --> 00:46:06,120
We'll see you next time.

622
00:46:38,980 --> 00:46:39,100
We'll see you next time.

623
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:52,440
We'll see you next time.

624
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:15,380
hesitate. Sit back, smile, relax, and hate. Everyone needs a scapegoat. Everyone needs

625
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:22,960
a whipping boy. When you find someone to hate, it fills your heart with joy.

626
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:03,160
The dog snarled and

627
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:03,420
left.

628
00:48:03,440 --> 00:48:08,240
The young woman, I'll never forget that look of pure horror on her face as that dog brought

629
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:12,780
her to the ground, screaming for help. I held my stomach, doubled over, gleefully laughing.

630
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:18,740
The way the blood spurted out of her jugular vein reminded me of a horse left unattended.

631
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:24,100
I also will never forget her face when she finally spotted me at the top of my stairs,

632
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:30,400
pink in the face from laughing so hard, tears streaming down my face. I'm not sure exactly

633
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,420
what she was thinking at that point, but I'm sure it was her.

634
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,360
It was something equally amusing.

635
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:42,900
You can do.

636
00:48:43,940 --> 00:48:49,040
If you live in a war area or small town that has preserved traditional American values,

637
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:55,920
stay there. Watch your family for signs of disobedience or strange behavior. Stay away

638
00:48:55,920 --> 00:49:00,620
from the television. It has become infested with subliminal messages that lure you and

639
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:02,140
your loved ones into the cold.

640
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:16,600
Are you sick and tired of corrupt government bureaucrats sucking your paycheck dry? Do you

641
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:22,280
refuse to vote because you can't bear the burden of having to decide whether to elect a scum-sucking

642
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:28,740
baby murderer or a cloven-hoofed child-pimp to be your next president? There is an alternative.

643
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:32,520
Make your vote. Nolan Void.

644
00:49:33,420 --> 00:49:38,460
Under Nolan Void's four-year plan, every American will receive two new cars and the

645
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:44,260
guns to protect them. Nolan Void promises to fill Snake River Canyon with lawyers and

646
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:50,460
politicians and then burn them to ashes with napalm. Nolan Void promises to restore our

647
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:57,180
beloved America to its former glory, even if it costs the lives of every man, woman,

648
00:49:57,260 --> 00:50:03,400
and child on Earth. On November 5th, vote Nolan Void for your children's vote.

649
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,420
The next.

650
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:17,120
Anyway, I love the baby Jesus and I think he's the best thing and that he's really, it's

651
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:22,900
really great when he shares his love because he's got enough love for everybody. You know

652
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:23,240
what I mean?

653
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,220
I do, sir, but...

654
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:32,220
Yeah, he's like, I can't even see a manger without thinking about him, eh? Yeah, I just,

655
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:33,160
I love him.

656
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:38,440
I just love the Jesus and I just thought I'd phone up and just, uh, you know, you know,

657
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,440
uh, I've only been into him for a couple hours though, but I'm really into him.

658
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,840
Boom. Boom, boom, boom, boom...

659
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:11,040
Hello, Christian Rapture Line.

660
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,620
Uh, yeah, I just wanted to make sure you Christians were still there.

661
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:16,820
We sure are. Were you interested in accepting Jesus as your lord and savior?

662
00:51:17,540 --> 00:51:20,560
Uh, I'll have to think about it some more. Uh, I've gotta get down to the beach and catch

663
00:51:20,560 --> 00:51:21,600
some rays. Uh, see you later.

664
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:22,180
Boom.

665
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:23,420
Boom.

666
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:25,480
Boom.

667
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:31,760
Boom.

668
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:32,400
Boom.

669
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:32,660
Boom.

670
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,340
Having trouble planning that next vacation?

671
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:52,220
Famous world sights getting humdrum?

672
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:56,680
Are you tired of hotels, coffee shops, and cranky stewardesses?

673
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,580
Then why not take the eternal vacation?

674
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:03,600
That's right, Rapture Airlines.

675
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,940
You don't even have to go to the airport.

676
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,960
No, Rapture Airlines is taking off right from where you stand.

677
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,540
And your flight? Oh boy.

678
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:16,020
Plenty of lake space, music by the Archangel,

679
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:18,760
and complimentary glasses of living water.

680
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:20,840
And that's just the start.

681
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,880
When you arrive at your destination,

682
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,440
no waiting in a crummy hotel lobby.

683
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,340
The owner himself will be there to greet you

684
00:52:28,340 --> 00:52:29,460
with the keys to your own

685
00:52:29,460 --> 00:52:30,300
private mansion.

686
00:52:30,620 --> 00:52:33,360
It's so beautiful, you'll think you're in heaven.

687
00:52:33,700 --> 00:52:35,060
Well, you are.

688
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,780
So don't put it off.

689
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,100
Get your name written into the book today.

690
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:41,220
We could take off at any time.

691
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:43,380
Don't get caught up in the world.

692
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,760
Get caught up in Rapture Airlines.

693
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,600
Truly the only way to fly.

694
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,820
They were said when they saw Jesus was,

695
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,780
Oh, look at the magic monkey.

696
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:56,100
Look at the magic monkey.

697
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,120
The magic monkey Jesus.

698
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:01,000
But he was no magic monkey.

699
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,820
He was a plain old garden variety monkey like you,

700
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:07,400
but one with a real good line of bull.

701
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,120
And you bought it.

702
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:15,400
Oh yeah, you bought that line of bull, you little monkeys.

703
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:17,400
That's what humans always do.

704
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,840
Pathetic pink humans, you take a good thing,

705
00:53:20,660 --> 00:53:22,660
and then you try to make it something that it's not.

706
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:26,340
I mean Jesus, he...a nice guy, did some good things.

707
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,660
Got around, you know, educated people.

708
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,800
hey, why don't we try being nice to one another for a change?

709
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:36,520
And you said, oh, great, but what if they don't want to be nice?

710
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:37,900
Oh, I know, we'll kill them.

711
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:38,820
Then they have to be nice.

712
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:41,180
Kind of distorts the message, don't it?

713
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:45,540
You wanted logos and catchphrases and packaging.

714
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:47,620
Well, you got that.

715
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,000
It's called the Christians.

716
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,000
Yeah, Christians.

717
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,160
You took a man and you turned him into clip art.

718
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,540
We here at the Subgenius, we took a piece of clip art and we made him a man,

719
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:01,860
and that man's name is Bob.

720
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:03,680
Amen.

721
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,340
And he don't care about you either.

722
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:11,760
But at least he comes out and he tells you he don't care.

723
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:12,900
He doesn't care about you.

724
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:13,840
He doesn't care about your wife.

725
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,020
He doesn't care about your family.

726
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,220
He doesn't care about your dog.

727
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,240
He doesn't care about anything but your money.

728
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:20,700
Oh, yeah, that's right.

729
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:22,900
At least he's honest.

730
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:24,020
At least he's honest.

731
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:25,140
That's more than any Christian can tell you.

732
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:25,900
It's true.

733
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,360
Bob will pimp you just like Jesus will.

734
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:32,020
But, hey, Jesus will only take half your money.

735
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,860
Bob will take it all and give you slack.

736
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,600
More slack than you could ever get with your money.

737
00:54:37,940 --> 00:54:41,320
And Bob will pat you on the back and hand you a froth stick.

738
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:44,920
But Jesus, he'll just bend up a coat hanger and pimp with you.

739
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:52,840
You're talking monkeys.

740
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:54,580
You dirty talking monkeys.

741
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,720
You soiled little monkeys.

742
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,940
I was watching the news last night, you little monkeys.

743
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:04,800
And there was a group that did a test on holy water in the Catholic churches.

744
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:09,840
And they found that there was a high level of contamination in the holy waters

745
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:15,920
because of you talking monkeys coming in and dipping your fingers into the holy water

746
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,060
when you walk into church.

747
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,920
And you didn't wash your hands first.

748
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:22,320
I know that you were picking your nose.

749
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:25,140
I know that you were licking Kentucky Fried Chicken.

750
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:27,400
You were licking the chicken grease from between your fingernails.

751
00:55:27,400 --> 00:55:29,340
Or wiping your baby's butts.

752
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:36,060
Or stroking your house pets with that hand.

753
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,200
You know what I mean.

754
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,400
And then you go to church and dip your fingers in that water.

755
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:46,140
And the guy before you, and the guy before you were doing the same thing.

756
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:47,560
Oh, sure.

757
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,240
Oh, yeah.

758
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:52,240
That old man looking out his window.

759
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:55,140
Looking at the schoolroom.

760
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:55,140


761
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:55,460
And the children.

762
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:58,560
And tugging at the crotch of his underwear.

763
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:01,600
Didn't wash his hands before he went into the church.

764
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,900
Now did he?

765
00:56:03,400 --> 00:56:04,420
Oh, yeah.

766
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:07,660
Think of how slimy and filthy that water would be.

767
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:12,720
With you nose pickers dipping your dirty little monkey paws in it.

768
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:16,420
And crossing yourselves, you sanctimonious bastards.

769
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,120
You all deserve to burn.

770
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,440
Oh.

771
00:56:21,340 --> 00:56:22,020
Oh.

772
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:23,880
Oh.

773
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:24,080
Oh.

774
00:56:24,740 --> 00:56:25,680
You'll burn.

775
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:26,540
You'll burn.

776
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:31,200
And when you're burning, you're going to be crying out, oh, Jesus.

777
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:36,300
Jesus, come and save me from this terrible burning.

778
00:56:36,840 --> 00:56:38,300
And you brought it on yourselves.

779
00:56:38,380 --> 00:56:40,500
You've been working up to this since the dawn of time.

780
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:43,400
It wasn't enough that there'd be great mysteries to the universe.

781
00:56:43,580 --> 00:56:46,820
It wasn't enough that man could look to the sky and wonderment.

782
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:49,060
And ask himself, what is out there?

783
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:50,920
Why am I here?

784
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,100
What is the meaning of life?

785
00:56:52,760 --> 00:56:58,840
It wasn't enough to have that wonder and live a life dedicated to reveling in the wonder

786
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:02,200
and having slack and being one with the universe.

787
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:07,020
No, man had to invent his own answers to those mysteries.

788
00:57:07,480 --> 00:57:10,280
He had to solve his own riddles with lies.

789
00:57:10,780 --> 00:57:14,460
And then to pay the bills, he had to sell the answers to others.

790
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:19,840
And if you didn't want to buy those answers, they'd force them upon you at the point of

791
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:21,220
a knife or the end of a gun.

792
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,300
And they made you believe.

793
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,640
They made you believe.

794
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:27,980
They dangled it in front of you, that belief.

795
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,440
Like a carrot on the end of a stick, and you're running forever.

796
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:31,920
You'll never get it.

797
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,280
Because it's false.

798
00:57:33,340 --> 00:57:33,820
It's fake.

799
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,680
It's cardboard city made of lies.

800
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:41,180
All lies.

801
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,000
There's no salvation to be had.

802
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,220
It's not out there.

803
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:46,120
You can't have it.

804
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:47,540
It wasn't meant for you.

805
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:49,940
It wasn't meant for the ignorant inborn human.

806
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,200
It's not out there.

807
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:51,820
It's a lie.

808
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,500
It's a lie.

809
00:57:53,500 --> 00:57:54,180
Oh, yeah.

810
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,720
But you bought it.

811
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,780
You believed every single word of it.

812
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:00,660
You snatched at that carrot, and it wasn't even a carrot.

813
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,220
It was just a picture of a carrot.

814
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,260
It wasn't even a picture of a real carrot.

815
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:05,680
It wasn't even a real picture.

816
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:08,920
It was just a drawing of a real picture of a fake carrot.

817
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:10,160
That's right.

818
00:58:10,380 --> 00:58:11,520
And you bought it.

819
00:58:11,580 --> 00:58:14,440
Just like that stupid ass John Salvey.

820
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:17,440
You know who John Salvey is, brothers and sisters?

821
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:18,880
Who's John Salvey?

822
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,180
Oh, John Salvey, couple years ago.

823
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:29,620
He decided that the Lord wanted him to go to the abortion clinic and start mowing down all those abortionists, those evil people.

824
00:58:29,820 --> 00:58:31,000
They wanted him to go down.

825
00:58:31,020 --> 00:58:33,180
The Lord wanted him to go down and kill those evil murderers.

826
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,680
Well, guess where John Salvey is today?

827
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:39,020
I know where his body is.

828
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:41,980
They found him hanged in his jail cell today.

829
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:44,860
That's right, brothers and sisters.

830
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:48,640
One more Christian in hell, and you're all hot on his heels.

831
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:57,840
Oh, yeah, the devil lacks nothing better than a good Christian.

832
00:58:58,440 --> 00:58:59,500
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

833
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:02,720
But there's at least two or three out there.

834
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,240
At least two or three of it.

835
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,540
You're capable of better and bigger things.

836
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:10,800
You can cast off that oppressive yoke of the conspiracy.

837
00:59:12,260 --> 00:59:17,180
Let someone else chase that fake picture of a fake real picture of a drawing of a fake carrot.

838
00:59:17,540 --> 00:59:18,420
It don't matter.

839
00:59:18,620 --> 00:59:19,620
You don't need it.

840
00:59:20,680 --> 00:59:21,160
You don't need it.

841
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:25,040
Learn to use that opposable thumb, you silly monkey.

842
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:28,900
I mean, just stop right where you are.

843
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:31,260
Look around and say the hell with it.

844
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,140
Slack off.

845
00:59:32,180 --> 00:59:33,080
Have some fun for once.

846
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:34,920
Don't worry about it.

847
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:35,920
Don't pay your bills.

848
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:37,160
What are they gonna do?

849
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:38,420
Take your stuff?

850
00:59:38,580 --> 00:59:39,160
It's only stuff.

851
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,600
You're not gonna need that stuff come X-Day.

852
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,080
You have all the stuff you want, Dad.

853
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:44,600
Who cares?

854
00:59:45,780 --> 00:59:49,520
Yeah, that stuff will be your memorial come X-Day.

855
00:59:49,940 --> 00:59:50,900
That stuff.

856
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,840
That stuff will be the big pile that marks your grave.

857
00:59:54,920 --> 01:00:02,000
And you can mark your grave with an even bigger pile of stuff from the Church of the Subgenius.

858
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,460
We won't lie to you about how much we're lying to you.

859
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:07,060
We're lying through our teeth.

860
01:00:07,180 --> 01:00:09,500
But we do send you the stuff.

861
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:18,240
If you write for free information about the stuff from Bob at Post Office Box 140306,

862
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:21,380
Dallas, Texas 75214.

863
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:26,460
That's Box 140306, Dallas 75214.

864
01:00:26,540 --> 01:00:32,620
You were listening to Dr. Legume and Ed Strange on the Prozac Free Outtakes tapes.

865
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:40,320
We heard some Hatesville by Boyd Rice and Dog by Sean Partridge from the Hatesville CD.

866
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,560
And Indian Rope Burn doing spontaneous combustion.

867
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,620
I already said that.

868
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:45,780
Well, it's the end of the show.

869
01:00:46,060 --> 01:00:47,500
Friends, I'm proud.

870
01:00:47,500 --> 01:00:48,460
I'm proud most of the time.

871
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:52,400
But I'm going to have to come out and admit I'm really tired of working with a $10 microphone.

872
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:55,480
And we're down to one working tape deck now.

873
01:00:55,760 --> 01:00:56,460
Oh, God.
