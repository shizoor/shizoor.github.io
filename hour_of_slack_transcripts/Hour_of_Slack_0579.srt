1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,740
Yes, yes, yes, yes. First this little edit here from Phineas Narco.

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,640
How is old Bob?

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,000
Oh, he's doing good. He sends his regards.

4
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,720
You know one of the best things about Bob?

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,560
What's that?

6
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:14,320
He's a smoker.

7
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,060
Yeah. Yeah, a frop all the way.

8
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:20,900
Hey, Bob, it's great to have you on this show again. How you doing?

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,040
Bob!

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:24,100
B-O-B!

11
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:28,500
But if you're on the market for just a basic, decent guy, you can't go wrong with Bob.

12
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,420
Bob, he's a reliable no-frills model.

13
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,720
Just one previous owner, she only traded him in because she wanted something a little zippier.

14
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,540
His name is Bob.

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,020
Bob.

16
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:36,860
Bob's great.

17
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:37,900
He comes in every day.

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,140
He's tall, dark, and handsome.

19
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:39,980
His eyes are brown.

20
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,520
Brown shirt.

21
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:41,180
Brown pants.

22
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:41,620
Brown belt.

23
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:42,220
How do I know?

24
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:42,760
Brown truck.

25
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:43,380
He's pretty cool.

26
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,600
And I think I have a crush on him.

27
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,040
Championship sort of.

28
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:47,120
Bob is a tireless worker.

29
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:47,860
Full of life.

30
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,000
Bob's a man of vision.

31
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,760
Dynamic person.

32
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,520
Bob is a people person.

33
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,520
He's a unique individual.

34
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,160
He's one of a kind.

35
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:52,860
He's a people person.

36
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,040
Bob is a genius.

37
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:55,240
He's an inspiration.

38
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,660
He's a man of the people.

39
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,380
I love Bob.

40
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:57,920
Bob's not a person.

41
00:00:57,940 --> 00:00:58,680
He's a people person.

42
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,500
He's a mover and a shaker.

43
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,820
Bob is the leader of a generation.

44
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:03,400
Bob is a tireless worker.

45
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,600
Unbridled energy.

46
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,180
As his doctor, I know I tell him to slow down.

47
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:07,760
He won't listen.

48
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:10,220
And now I want you all to say, vote Bob.

49
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,580
Vote Bob.

50
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,940
Bob has a great vision.

51
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,280
And now, the subgenius hour of swag.

52
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:47,940
The subgenius hour of slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station and only in the city of.

53
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:56,240
Should any other shows be heard from or contacted in the course of this show, the listener is advised to remain calm and only contact listed or unlisted officials.

54
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:56,860
Thank you.

55
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,360
Thank you.

56
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


57
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


58
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


59
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


60
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


61
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


62
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


63
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


64
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


65
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


66
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


67
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:57,360


68
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,720
Any material from this radio or other listening device being inhaled during broadcast.

69
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,280
I've got a pair.

70
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,440
I've got a pair.

71
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,100
I've got a pair.

72
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,700
And she's got a hell of a pair.

73
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,300
We've got a, oh God, we've all got pairs here.

74
00:02:25,340 --> 00:02:26,120
It's so nice.

75
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,060
But I don't have a mic.

76
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,240
She's got a pair with that.

77
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,960
We're all hooked up to the umbilicals here.

78
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,100
She's got a pair with that.

79
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:31,680
You'll find it.

80
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:32,840
We're all input into the board.

81
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:32,920
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

82
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,320
Do you have a real show in your hometown?

83
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,080
No, we had a real one.

84
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:35,480
Oh, I'm sorry.

85
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,120
Yeah, I'm sorry.

86
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:36,780
Okay, thank you.

87
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,240
There was a show crash.

88
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,880
There's a terrible show crash.

89
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,160
KPFA just ran into KNON and caused a wreck on WREK.

90
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,980
It's a disastrous show.

91
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:46,840
Oh, wait a minute.

92
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,940
But, now, which show is this?

93
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:50,200
No, the disaster was when it was still on.

94
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,640
I thought this was Bob's Slack Time Fun House.

95
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,620
You'll find that naked women.

96
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,100
No, no, no.

97
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,120
I'm on 91.1.

98
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,620
In Atlanta.

99
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:58,880
No, no, you're not.

100
00:02:58,940 --> 00:02:59,500
This is KNON.

101
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,640
This is, well, there is no KNON anymore.

102
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,080
Hey, get your sound waves off my turf.

103
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:04,820
What is this?

104
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,780
Hey, your sound waves taste good with my headphones.

105
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:09,520
Hey.

106
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:09,980
Oh.

107
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,280
They are kind of creamy.

108
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:15,900
Your Doppler effect fell into my sound waves.

109
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:17,800
Your sound waves fell into my Doppler effect.

110
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,420
Oh, my continental drift is taking a toll everywhere.

111
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,640
Unfortunately, the doctors have to do the one thing they hate to do, share a microphone.

112
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,240
Yeah, especially when the other one has such terrible breath.

113
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:26,920
Oh.

114
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,680
And they're covered with ectoplasm.

115
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,740
Guess which one that is.

116
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:34,100
Yeah, you'd have to guess which doctor is on which mic.

117
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,020
You'd have to French kiss.

118
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,040
Which twin has the Tony?

119
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,800
You'd have to French kiss both of them like I did.

120
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,560
To know the difference.

121
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:39,940
And live.

122
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,680
Don't ask about what I had to do.

123
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,000
You're hurting my ears, which is what I've been doing to listeners for years.

124
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,460
You know, I am St. Reverend Jane or Hypercrease from Little Rock, Arkansas.

125
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,000
And, in fact, you missed my performance Friday night.

126
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:57,120
And I'm not going to do anything anymore at the science.

127
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:57,720
I'm going to do it at the National Relation Convention.

128
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,720
Of course, it would probably be just like way over your head and insult your every value system

129
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,280
and just totally confuse you with confusing disinformation.

130
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,560
Now, we don't want to confuse anyone, Jane.

131
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,040
No, we wouldn't want to put out any disinformation.

132
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,020
But how could we?

133
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,680
I want to get that straight in case anybody was wondering.

134
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,600
It's not going to be open again until tomorrow.

135
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:27,360
But, uh, and we, of course, are having the Big D Bible tonight at 10, which, you know,

136
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,360


137
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:27,360


138
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:34,200
you are really lucky because this is a true, old-fashioned, Bible-pounding, black-eyed, pee-eating,

139
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:38,900
swimming love corpses, music-supplied, subgenius, de-vival.

140
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:42,100
And, theoretically, Jane or Hypercrease will be there, too.

141
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,980
And that's an answer someone will drive him down from Little Rock.

142
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,040
Where's Puzzling Evidence?

143
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,740
Oh, he's puzzling.

144
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:51,460
Puzzling Evidence will probably be here, but he'll be in the crowd.

145
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,780
Okay, who called this meeting?

146
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:55,000
One of you people are Puzzling Evidence.

147
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,340
And one of you is the 13th.

148
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:57,680
The 13th apostle.

149
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,000
Could it be you?

150
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,320
Could be you.

151
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,200
Could be anybody.

152
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,460
Come on, give us a chance.

153
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:05,900
We never said who the first 12 were for that matter.

154
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:13,300
So, uh, you know, but that leaves that, this is the most democratic church that anybody

155
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,220
who spends lots of money can be that 13th apostle.

156
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,220
Salvation can be bought.

157
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,420
We have numerous 13th apostles.

158
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,420
What did it say on the, uh, that we're supposed to talk about?

159
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,000
Explain the church.

160
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,020
We're supposed to explain the church at this I can't even hear.

161
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,040
How much time do we have?

162
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,780
It's 25 words or less.

163
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:34,540
12 decades or, what is it, a century?

164
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:38,220
We've been doing that for 14 and a half years now.

165
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,300
They still haven't got it.

166
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,900
Still haven't finished.

167
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,500
No, seriously, are there any questions?

168
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,380
That's really the best way to start with this kind of thing.

169
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,520
Who do we have to kill?

170
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,400
Yeah, who can we kill?

171
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,080
We killed Bob.

172
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,380
Yeah, we've killed our guru.

173
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,660
Many, many times already.

174
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:58,060
He keeps popping back up.

175
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,220
Can't die.

176
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,640
Come on, come on, come on.

177
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:02,900
Bob!

178
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,840
Bob!

179
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,440
Bob!

180
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,200
Bob!

181
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,660
Come on, Bob!

182
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:09,260
Get in the boat.

183
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,340
On an ambulance!

184
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:12,700
Wake up.

185
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,140
Vote Bob.

186
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,000
Just can't keep a good guru down.

187
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:21,180
How many people here actually know what the Church of the Subgenius is, quote unquote,

188
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:21,540
know?

189
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:24,080
That's just a, it's about a half.

190
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,480
Yes, it's gratifying.

191
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:25,640
I don't know.

192
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:25,640


193
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:25,640


194
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:25,640


195
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:25,640


196
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:25,640


197
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:25,640


198
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:25,640


199
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:25,640


200
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:25,640


201
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:25,640


202
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:25,980
I don't know.

203
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:25,980


204
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:26,500
Yeah, well.

205
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:27,940
Sometimes I think I do.

206
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,880
For the rest of you, I really don't know what to tell you except that you'll have to actually

207
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,600
invest some time.

208
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,120
You'll have to pay to find out.

209
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,420
Well, if you don't know, you could be on the right track too.

210
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,700
That's the wonder of it.

211
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,700
That is very true.

212
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,440
Yeah.

213
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:43,500
Yes.

214
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,940
The little boy in the, in the...

215
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:46,940
Why?

216
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:50,040
That's what Arnold Palmer asked us.

217
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,100
We gave him a very straight answer.

218
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:53,400
Why?

219
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,380
The answer is so simple.

220
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:55,980
It's slack.

221
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,260
That is why slack first for Bob,

222
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,280
then for we, his called ministers,

223
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,200
and then for those who may partake of that slack

224
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,840
as a direct runoff from the luck power

225
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,160
that is sucked towards Bob,

226
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,780
sprays off of him onto us,

227
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,920
and then it sort of drips off of us onto...

228
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,500
And if you get one of those big clouds,

229
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:16,360
you're so lucky.

230
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,040
The slack trickle-down theory.

231
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,140
It's a pyramidal...

232
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:20,600
Slackonomics.

233
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,700
Yeah, slackonomics.

234
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,900
It's the pyramid scheme

235
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,880
with you buried in the tomb

236
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,660
in the middle of the pyramid.

237
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:29,220
Yeah, somewhere you're in that pyramid,

238
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,640
in the secret room that you can't get to anymore.

239
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,260
I want you to hear...

240
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,200
I wouldn't want to say something that doesn't make any sense,

241
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,920
like everything that you say...

242
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,120
Don't worry, friends.

243
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:39,880
It's only...

244
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,140
Slow, deep, and hard, things like that.

245
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,940
If you're trying to say that, you know,

246
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:44,120
this is not confusing,

247
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,460
well, that confuses me because I find it confusing,

248
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:48,920
but I was straight on the fact that it was confusing,

249
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,400
but when you told me it was not confusing,

250
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,240
that confused me.

251
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,300
Uh, yeah.

252
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,520
We have to start over again.

253
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:54,920
Okay.

254
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:55,940
A few minutes after...

255
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,320
Ah, yes.

256
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,220
Take it from the top.

257
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:57,740
Go.

258
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:58,800
Welcome to church.

259
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,160
You are listening to the subgenius radio ministry...

260
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,260
Get on your knees, seekers.

261
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:04,280
Get ready for some lashings of...

262
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:04,880
Slack.

263
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,140
Slack.

264
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:06,940
There's a secret born every day.

265
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,160
Wait a minute.

266
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:08,020
What show is this?

267
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,980
Hey, what show are we...

268
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,180
You wouldn't know slack if it tortured you to death.

269
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
You wouldn't know slack if it...

270
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,660
Oh, I'm begging for it, too.

271
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,700
...in Berkeley and Oakland and all of Northern California

272
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,520
and you're listening to Janer?

273
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,480
Just started lashing you with a char-ariel

274
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,300
until you were striped like Tony Tiger.

275
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,160
Who are these people?

276
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,380
With a cat and nine tails.

277
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,180
You wouldn't know slack if it chopped your head off.

278
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,160
God, this closet is full.

279
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,180
You wouldn't know slack if it drove nine-inch nails

280
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,200
into your eyes.

281
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,740
You people out there, don't you?

282
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,760
You're just a bunch of half-subgenius,

283
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,220
half-hearted subgeniuses.

284
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,660
You wouldn't send me all your money.

285
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,200
You wouldn't give me all your worldly possessions.

286
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,520
They want Bob for free.

287
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,940
But none of the women out there want to become slaves

288
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:47,260
to Janer Hyperclades.

289
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,620
They're just half-subgeniuses.

290
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,720
I'm already a slave to Bob.

291
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:51,200
You're barking up the wrong girl.

292
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,160
Hey, this one's phylo.

293
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:52,660
Go.

294
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:55,320
Well, you've joined up with the wrong cult.

295
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:56,220
Oh.

296
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,260
We'll make one up for later.

297
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,280
Even the wrong cult can be the right cult.

298
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,940
I tell you what, because you can't hear phylo,

299
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:03,940
you'll hear Bob's face on it.

300
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,180
I put phylo in the box.

301
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,680
If he's good, we'll punch some air holes.

302
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:09,040
You won't hear underdog.

303
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,300
You won't see kissing.

304
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,120
You won't see the Aurora models come to life

305
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:12,920
like we did earlier.

306
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:16,220
Yes, dear friends, we've been at the Dragon Con

307
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:18,680
science fiction convention for the last couple of days.

308
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,360
Here in Atlanta.

309
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,040
It has been a show crash.

310
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,680
I feel kind of sad.

311
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:28,740
Sorry for those geeky, neurotic, pathetic, wimp sci-fi fans

312
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:34,640
who are absolutely the prototypical cartoon of a geek.

313
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:37,900
Acres and acres of kids all dressed in black

314
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,760
with vampire makeup on.

315
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,780
Cost them 500 bucks and spent three days

316
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,400
to prove that they're individuals

317
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,020
who don't care what anybody else thinks.

318
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,420
And you can tell because they all look alike.

319
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:51,200
You are unique, and so is everybody else.

320
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,440
Rocky Horror Pictures.

321
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:52,680
Rocky Horror Pictures.

322
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:52,680


323
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:52,680


324
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,080
Rocky Horror Pictures.

325
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,080


326
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,420
Quoting.

327
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,060
Cheesy, bad movie aficionadoing.

328
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:00,940
Be spectacled.

329
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,480
Flabby, pasty, way-faced geeks.

330
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,060
Praise them.

331
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,540
Don't you love them?

332
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,060
Where else?

333
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,640
This church would not survive.

334
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:10,500
There were some pockets, though.

335
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,980
After all, their money is green.

336
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:14,940
And what souls would Bob have to sell to the exes?

337
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,660
Highly illogical, Captain.

338
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,920
I've slipped a few of those souls into the prize.

339
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,000
Here comes the enterprise.

340
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,220
Here comes the enterprise.

341
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:22,680
Here comes the enterprise.

342
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,080
Here comes the enterprise.

343
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,280
Boy, there's a lot of Klingons down there.

344
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,180
Oh, and they're hip, too.

345
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,880
They're into K-Bob or K-Bob.

346
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,260
Spock, you green-blooded alien.

347
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,740
We're talking about men's lives, not your logic.

348
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,340
You're out of your fulkin' mind.

349
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,880
That's your fulkin' mind, I think you said.

350
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,820
Dr. McCoy, I believe it was...

351
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:44,300
I believe Captain Kirk left me in charge of the enterprise.

352
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,360
She's remembering the show there.

353
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,100
She was when he was making his trip down to the X-Dimension.

354
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:52,420
Dr. McCoy, what are you doing with that mobile transport?

355
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,040
I'm trying to get a recorder beam.

356
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:56,520
Dr. McCoy, where's Spock?

357
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,520
You have to listen to this later.

358
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:05,040
Of course, the only really, really pure sci-fi fans are the subgeniuses.

359
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,720
They're the ones who've lived that science fiction.

360
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:12,260
And you know, real life has gotten a lot scarier than any sci-fi movie.

361
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:17,520
Back in the old days, the only time the army moved into L.A. was when giant ants invaded.

362
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,020
Oh, that's next.

363
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,800
We've got that arranged.

364
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,980
Yeah, well...

365
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,660
I'm sorry about the comet hitting the wrong side.

366
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,340
It hit the wrong side of Jupiter.

367
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,520
We've been working on that.

368
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:29,440
If H.G. Wells could see the future, he'd roll over in his grave if he was alive today.

369
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,180
Are we dead now?

370
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:34,500
Didn't the comet land on the northern part of Canada and wipe us all out?

371
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,960
Are we still doing a show here?

372
00:11:36,460 --> 00:11:40,500
That was the body of Satan being hurled to the Earth by God himself.

373
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,540
Am I talking right now?

374
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,420
Is this my voice?

375
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:42,820
I don't know.

376
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:43,860
I'll check.

377
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:44,960
I'll go right outside and check.

378
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,640
I mean, could you record this and then sell it to someone else at a later date?

379
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,040
That's what I do.

380
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,560
Half price on verse.

381
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:52,640


382
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,740
I mean, I'll sell the nouns back.

383
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,220
I mean, how much would you charge me for a tape of myself?

384
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:57,500
Why don't we do this?

385
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,080
You do the adjectives and the verbs.

386
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,420
I'll do the nouns and the adverbs.

387
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,820
And I'll sell the tape.

388
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:03,660
Now, come on.

389
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:04,480
Just on this tape.

390
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,840
Just like we've been doing all these years.

391
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,260
Then we have to renegotiate in half an hour for the second 30 minutes of the 90-minute CD.

392
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,120
Nouns are moving.

393
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:11,120


394
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,680
I checked the stock exchange.

395
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:16,880
Nouns are big this week, bigger than adjectives or adverbs or other Jane Eyre words.

396
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,320
That changes.

397
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:20,040
Oh, but prepositions are so good.

398
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,680
Or is it propositions?

399
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,640
What happened last week?

400
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:26,580
Last night with the swinging love corpses and Papa Joe Mama and Jane Eyre and Ivan Stang

401
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,940
and Suzie the floozy.

402
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,260
Oh.

403
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,420
They're still stacking the bodies like cordwood.

404
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:37,060
It seems like it's the fallen women that always get picked up in the grand ballroom west.

405
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,120
Yeah, they're still mopping up the blood left over from that head launching.

406
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,780
It was just a teeny little head in a tiny, tiny golf club.

407
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,180
I didn't know it would have those 27 gallons of blood in it.

408
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:52,120
Yeah, it's so hard to believe such a small golfer head could bleed quite so much.

409
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:56,060
And people are standing in line to go in there and look at the patterns on the carpet.

410
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:59,520
We haven't told them about the dangerously high radiation levels.

411
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,040
You should see the crowd outside the station.

412
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,040
You looked out the window and seen the crowd outside the station?

413
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,920
But that was just a prostitution.

414
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:05,500
Standing in line to die.

415
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,300
That was just a false head launching.

416
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,900
Anyone who saw that and believed it was real is damned to hell.

417
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,160
And friends, there's no water down there.

418
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:17,560
There's plenty of head blood, though.

419
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:18,440
Oh, yeah.

420
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,120
You're just about to...

421
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,440
There'll be a beer, head blood, and bodily excretions that...

422
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,940
...build up on the stage after the swinging love corpses...

423
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,660
...slectoplasm...

424
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,840
...reach their climax.

425
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:27,700
We're talking about...

426
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:27,820
...in...

427
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,940
...bob, praise Bob, praise...

428
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:30,780
...bob!

429
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

430
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:33,860
Help me, somebody!

431
00:13:34,700 --> 00:13:35,920
Yes, dear friends!

432
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:45,040
It's about time we had a for real, Bible-breaking, pulpit-pounding, black-eyed peen subgenius revival here.

433
00:13:45,260 --> 00:13:51,940
And by that, I don't mean some silly parody situation where we make fun of televangelists...

434
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:52,420
...and Jim...

435
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:53,880
...Billy Graham and so forth.

436
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,420
No, sir!

437
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,200
We are not up here to make fun!

438
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,640
We are up here because we hate the normals!

439
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:11,920
The prudes, prigs, weezers, and weenuses, the super-patriots and fundamentalists and fanatics and so forth...

440
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,800
...they all think there ought to be a little more...

441
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,000
...religion in this country.

442
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,060
Uh-huh.

443
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,420
Well, have we got a religion for them?

444
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,020
The Church of the Subgenius!

445
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,060
God's answer to fundamentalists!

446
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:33,240
Building a new heaven and earth on the rubble of the old!

447
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,100
Beyond Satanism, dear friends!

448
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,620
Something for nothing!

449
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:41,140
That's what Bob's here to bring you.

450
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:41,960
Something for nothing?

451
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:44,580
Eternal salvation or triple your money back?

452
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,200
You can take the church, shove it into any orifice, and watch it go!

453
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,560
Oh, yes!

454
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,080
Yeah!

455
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,140
This is real!

456
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,260
Everything you know is true!

457
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,540
Bob is the proof!

458
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:00,780
Bob sold it!

459
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,760
I smoked it!

460
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:02,780
Fat battles it!

461
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:03,660
Yeah!

462
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,100
We may now proceed.

463
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,760
Be not afraid, dear friends.

464
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,580
You have no choice.

465
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,480
Bob is coming.

466
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:15,860
It is useless to resist!

467
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,560
Like.

468
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,260
Like.

469
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:51,540


470
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:51,540


471
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:51,540


472
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:51,540


473
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:51,540


474
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:51,540


475
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,720
If it's our task

476
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,900
It's obvious

477
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:59,020
That you still have

478
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:02,940
We are going to save the universe

479
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:05,640
We are going to save the universe

480
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:08,540
We are going to save the universe

481
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,660
Yes, boy!

482
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,400
We are going to save the universe

483
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,840
We are going to save the universe

484
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:25,560
Yeah!

485
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,140
Gee, is that all there is to that song?

486
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,280
I thought that song went in for a second.

487
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,680
It used to last longer when there wasn't that interruption

488
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,740
in the middle there.

489
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,320
Are you weird?

490
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,220
Anti-vocal.

491
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Are you bad?

492
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:38,680
Yes!

493
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:42,440
Are you not exactly a team player, dear friend?

494
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,880
Have you had enough?

495
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:46,060
Have a nice day?

496
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,080
Yes!

497
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,780
Tired of all that touchy-feely cosmic sweetness

498
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,260
and like,

499
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:51,700
crap?

500
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,280
Yes!

501
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,240
Get nearly irresistible urges

502
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,480
to pound spikes into the eyes

503
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,240
of gibbering religious nuts?

504
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:00,860
Yes!

505
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,360
Hate everybody?

506
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:05,440
Yes!

507
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,480
Always thought there was something going on

508
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,460
that they wouldn't tell you about?

509
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,300
Yes!

510
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,580
Do you find yourself questioning if existence is relevant?

511
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,160
If God believes in you?

512
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,460
If it's normal to be normal?

513
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,760
Talking about insanity squared.

514
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:24,040
We're talking about an infinity of hate squared,

515
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:24,720
squared,

516
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,660
plus godzillion and one.

517
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,320
Godzillionth to the nth degree times hate.

518
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,340
Oh yeah, you can't just sit there

519
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:35,380
talking about some little infinity of hate.

520
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:38,240
Oh, I've got an infinity of hate.

521
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,780
I'm a subgenius.

522
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,320
I have an all-pervasive,

523
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,420
all-consuming hate.

524
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,020
My God!

525
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,200
That's the most pathetic...

526
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,900
What kind of little limp-wristed, flimsy...

527
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:51,220
Sure, 92, 93, that was enough.

528
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:51,400
Infinity of hate.

529
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:51,520
That's the most pathetic...

530
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,220
Oh yeah.

531
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,160
You're totally out of chic, out of fashion now.

532
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,440
Heck man, hate squared, that might as well be love.

533
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,980
Oh, hate, hate and infinity of hate.

534
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:04,000
Are you reading that be here now

535
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,040
and all the rest of that love and peace crap?

536
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:07,320
I heart hate.

537
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,540
And Mein Kampf and those other peacenik,

538
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:14,560
namby-pamby, new age, tree-hugging, orange-haired...

539
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,000
Crystal-headed, I'm okay, you're okay,

540
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,560
born with a silver spoon in your mouth.

541
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:21,320
Have you people ever really seen any of these people?

542
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:23,320
Born with a silver spoon in your nose?

543
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:25,900
Well, one thing I will say for the science fiction fans

544
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,600
as opposed to the new agers,

545
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:31,220
at least the science fiction fans know it's all make-believe.

546
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,600
There's a lot to be said for that.

547
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:34,980
But of course...

548
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:35,440
Hey, is that Hal?

549
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,560
Is Hal in the other mix?

550
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,760
No, Hal's in the other mix.

551
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,960
This is in fact the world's only true religion.

552
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,900
This is the most important organization

553
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,460
in the history of the Earth.

554
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,720
It only appears to be the most asinine,

555
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,080
utterly inane and worthless.

556
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,300
You know, it's not completely true.

557
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:51,600
It's not completely worthless.

558
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,040
I've been laid several times by doing this.

559
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,540
I've gotten...

560
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,000
Yeah, now think about it, Jane.

561
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:59,460
I know you haven't gotten any royalties in a long time,

562
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:00,780
but remember that, uh...

563
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,440
I think it was sort of a woman type of...

564
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:04,540
You know, that Klingon...

565
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:04,740
Some organism.

566
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,620
That Klingon that...

567
00:20:05,620 --> 00:20:07,260
She spoke to me for almost two hours.

568
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:07,900
Yeah.

569
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:08,620
Yeah, thanks, Stang.

570
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,540
She had adaptive orifices.

571
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,800
You missed your big chance, bucko.

572
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,540
Some of these preachers will do anything for the church

573
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,780
if you promise them enough.

574
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:19,660
Well, I can hardly even get a date in Little Rock.

575
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,980
I have to come to one of your...

576
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,780
Your freak shows get a peck on the cheek.

577
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,820
Well, at least you got that.

578
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,760
I mean, it could be worse.

579
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:26,920
You're aiming too high.

580
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:28,440
Yeah, they beg...

581
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,980
They beg Bob for a girlfriend,

582
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,140
and then when he delivers a six-legged female Venusian,

583
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:33,740
they complain.

584
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,360
It's like some kind of a...

585
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:36,380
I don't know.

586
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:36,920
I said, look...

587
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:37,260
Ingrates.

588
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,740
I said, look, honey, I spent $30 and all this time.

589
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,480
Now, you ain't getting out of the car until I'm done.

590
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:46,420
Dating is an investment of my time, energy, and money.

591
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,460
This isn't a fun thing.

592
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,420
Carbon-14 dating?

593
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:50,960
You signed an unwritten...

594
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,160
Unwritten contract when you got in the car with me

595
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,620
and agreed to go out to dinner.

596
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:56,540
I thought that was understood.

597
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,340
The car doors are locked.

598
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,440
Now, folks, Jayner's just kidding.

599
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,520
He's just doing a satire of rednecks.

600
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:06,660
We want to make sure that you understand.

601
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:08,220
But for purposes of parity only.

602
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,520
Yes, it's just a parity only.

603
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,340
No, parity is the way it's pronounced around here.

604
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,480
This is equal time for equal religions.

605
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,900
Some are more equal than others.

606
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,080
Pass the equal, please.

607
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:17,800
Praise Bob.

608
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:20,060
I'm attracted to women who wear high heels

609
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:20,820
because they can't run.

610
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,180
Running is fast.

611
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm attracted to high heels.

612
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:26,280
Hey, I want to talk about how disgusting sci-fi fans are

613
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,520
since I used to be one.

614
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,040
Back to page two here on the script.

615
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:29,960
I know them pretty well.

616
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:30,520
I am one.

617
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:32,940
Were there any proto-stangs there?

618
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,460
Did you see any?

619
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,700
What kind of blasphemous utterance is that?

620
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,180
To think that any of those people

621
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,460
could lower themselves to the level of a stang.

622
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,980
He cries easily.

623
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,280
I'm sorry, stang.

624
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,080
I'm sorry, stang.

625
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,620
I didn't mean to insult the Trekkies like that.

626
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,560
No, um...

627
00:21:58,460 --> 00:21:59,880
No, but seriously, folks.

628
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,000
No, seriously, folks.

629
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,340
What about the people last night that came to the show?

630
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:03,980
What were they doing?

631
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,580
What are they like?

632
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,200
I said, doctor, it hurts whatever I do.

633
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,240
Listen, don't do that.

634
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,620
I really don't care about the people who came to the show.

635
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,580
All I care about is the people who came up to the sales table

636
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,100
at that convention afterwards.

637
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,280
And they're my good friends.

638
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,940
Everybody who bought a t-shirt, one of those Bob shirts

639
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,800
or other things that I can't talk about,

640
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:21,840
on the other stations.

641
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,500
Or a Janer tape or a Janer healing hate crystal.

642
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,740
Yeah, Janer was actually selling crystals

643
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,820
at the subgenius sales table

644
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,340
at the science fiction convention.

645
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:33,940
Janer...

646
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:34,700
Ah! Ah!

647
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:35,780
Came out of the dirt.

648
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,340
Oh, they're Joe Mama!

649
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,300
Oh, Father Joe Mama is here.

650
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,460
Tell them about the crystals.

651
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:42,080
You can focus your hate.

652
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,200
See, the New Agers have been missing the boat all this time.

653
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:48,340
They've been focusing healing energy and love energy.

654
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:49,020
And that works.

655
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:49,640
But...

656
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,440
But...

657
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,640
The crystal can transmit and amplify energy,

658
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:55,120
so there's no reason a subgenius couldn't buy one

659
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:58,740
and amplify his hatred towards his enemies

660
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:03,560
and create injury and dismemberment powers

661
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,180
rather than healing powers for the normals

662
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:11,400
and then pour ground-up glass and rock salt

663
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:15,080
into the gaping open wounds of the people he went to ninth grade with.

664
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,080
The trick is that you have to turn the crystal in the opposite direction.

665
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,100
Now, the fun thing is to think that some of these people

666
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,680
who don't know how to use crystals

667
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:26,380
have been pointing the aggregate, the unhealing side towards them all this while.

668
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:29,120
And this is why some of the New Agers are the way they are.

669
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,160
I just give them a twist and let them dig in.

670
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,420
You know, in California, you buy them with the crystal sewn right into the zipper of the pants.

671
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,560
I'm sorry, I'm late.

672
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:39,920
I got in a real heated discussion with some loser that was telling me that

673
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,300
Saurak had actually turned the planet Vulcan around for this reparation.

674
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:44,740
Yeah, yeah, we were just talking about that.

675
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,160
Those guys were here a minute ago fighting about that very same thing.

676
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:49,780
I mean, everybody knows that Saurak is the savior of Vulcan.

677
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:51,640
You know, I just couldn't believe that. That is really...

678
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:57,980
Well, I think Elfquest number 27 was a lot deeper statement than Elfquest number 21 through 26.

679
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:01,840
My dwarf lord cancels out your elfin queen.

680
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:04,720
I need a Dr. Pepper.

681
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:11,820
I'm a wizard, but in this new role-playing game, you play with some of my cards,

682
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:16,200
but I wasn't playing with a full deck in the first place, and I'm not talking about the game.

683
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,640
These people are into some kind of fantasy world, not like the Church of the Subgenius,

684
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,680
which takes a good hard bite out of reality.

685
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:26,080
The hard, cold, broken glass-covered cement...

686
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,760
It lets that bitter tang from life hit you in the back of the throat.

687
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:34,900
They've already rounded us up, dear friends.

688
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,680
Locked cattle, herded us into forced slave labor camps,

689
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,220
and replaced our names with urine test result numbers.

690
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:44,460
Only most of us didn't notice!

691
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:47,820
Because at the end of the day, they still let you clock out,

692
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,040
go home,

693
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,260
to your cell block,

694
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:54,260
and punch in again for a few minutes of quality time

695
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,040
with the spouse and the kiddies, or the drugs and the TV, or all four.

696
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,240
Here you stood.

697
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,220
You can take it.

698
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,440
It's a living.

699
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,300
Elvis is dead.

700
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,380
Hendrix is dead.

701
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,920
John Holmes is dead.

702
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:13,520
The Marlboro Man has cancer.

703
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,140
Love and kindness are purchased commodities.

704
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,200
Charlie's still in jail.

705
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:25,520
Even the gay baby whales are endorsing big oil companies, dear friends.

706
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:29,740
Rock and roll is a beer commercial, and punk is a hairstyle.

707
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:39,180
All the starving people in the world want back what they think you took.

708
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:43,900
And you're supposed to work like a dog just to keep what you only think you already have.

709
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:47,580
You cannot even die legally in this country.

710
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:52,060
As a result of this convention, we are actually going to begin the Church of Normals.

711
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,100
For normals, by normals.

712
00:25:54,220 --> 00:26:00,540
It should be obvious to everyone that even though we are against the normals,

713
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:03,140
from henceforth, we are also against the abnormals.

714
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:06,340
We have come to turn abnormals against normals unto themselves.

715
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:08,800
I find myself against a lot of people.

716
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,720
It's just the in-betweens.

717
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,840
But that was our original concept, an infinity of hate.

718
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,360
But I'm opposed to that, even.

719
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,480
Yeah, so, yeah, right.

720
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,800
Those fanboys out there howling at Reverend Susie the floozy.

721
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:25,920
Those aren't fanboys, those are werewolves with power number seven.

722
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:26,900
Don't you know anything?

723
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,840
Oh, sorry, I didn't look here at the book.

724
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:31,840
I didn't look at the 4,000-page xerox of the book of the game we're playing.

725
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,560
And those are rare chase cards. There's only one in 18 packs.

726
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:36,900
Your chances of getting a silver bullet card are one in 18.

727
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:41,920
These guys know the rules. They're probably going to beat us at subgenius game number 3700.

728
00:26:41,920 --> 00:26:45,280
Well, I have a rant card. I have the power to rant over a tape deck.

729
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,400
I have a file of that, yeah.

730
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,840
With a rant card and a file of it, we can probably kill you.

731
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,820
I wish I just had a be able to keep a job card.

732
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:56,020
Get out of corporation free card.

733
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:59,160
You got too many of those, Jane.

734
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,540
Oh, I've got to go feed them.

735
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:05,060
Does anyone know where I could get a pick up a woman card?

736
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,260
Yeah, those are upstairs in room 1750.

737
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,820
Ever been picked up by the fuzz?

738
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,480
The subgenius cards are, you know, an ongoing card collection.

739
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,880
We're always adding special chase cards.

740
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,520
And the get a free woman card is, we're waiting until Jane retires before we issue that.

741
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,880
We're afraid he may get that card.

742
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:23,720
You can get a woman free, but you've got to tie her up first.

743
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,040
Well, we don't set her free.

744
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,000
Anybody got any linch?

745
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,600
I think that, is that what you're supposed to say?

746
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,020
Anybody got any linch?

747
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:37,960
Oh, by the way, uh, Sting, we got into that little cabinet that had all the free potato chips and M&M's and stuff in your room.

748
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,820
How do you get into that?

749
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,760
Oh, you just use a little toothpick and open it up.

750
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:43,540
And it was great. There's all sorts of booze and everything. There's no charge for that, is there?

751
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,660
And Dad's gun and balloons are in there, too.

752
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,840
Well, that's for the convention to pay for.

753
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,600
Oh, okay.

754
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:53,380
Yeah, I kind of played rock star in your hotel room, Doug. I hope you don't mind.

755
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:57,560
You know, I just went off. I went crazy. But, I mean, that's what I'm supposed to do.

756
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,540
That was my television in the swimming pool down there?

757
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:06,180
Well, you'll be glad to know that it may have been your television, but at least we kept it plugged in when we threw it in there.

758
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:07,700
Eliminating all the swimming.

759
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,340
I mean, that's what you're into. I mean, that's your thing, you know.

760
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,320
We had to get a real long extension cord.

761
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,460
You're into these weird cults, you know, like Charles.

762
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:13,520


763
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:23,200
Charles Manson and stuff. I mean, so when I just, like, you know, stabbed you in the stomach 37 times with a rusty fork, I mean, that's your thing. You're into weird cults and stuff.

764
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,040
Well, I'm all for killing the hogs.

765
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:34,060
Oh, yeah. Sure, I cut up nine hogs. Hell, I'll pile them to the sky at 20 million high. Maybe then I can save my trees and my water and my wildlife.

766
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:39,460
That's what we're trying to do, friends. We're just trying to save the planet. It's more important than anything on the planet.

767
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,240
I thought we were going to pave the planet.

768
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,360
Well, yeah, that's the only way to preserve it.

769
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,640
That's why we have to save it.

770
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,620
And the skulls of our enemies.

771
00:28:46,660 --> 00:28:50,200
The Charles Manson Wildlife Reserve. Just make a right at the graveyard.

772
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,800
It's a very beautiful conservationist plan, Charles.

773
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:00,980
People think we're inhuman because we kill people, but in fact, we're just rabid environmentalists. People create pollution, therefore, to stop pollution.

774
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:01,860
We're just inhuman without doing anything.

775
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,240
They're an abscess sore upon the surface of the planet.

776
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,840
Save the planet. Kill yourself.

777
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,040
Running with pus.

778
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,040
Yes, we have lanced the abscess of normalcy.

779
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,200
Attracting flies.

780
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,820
Death cow has reached six million now.

781
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:13,480
Breeding on sorts of moths.

782
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,500
And maggots and contagion.

783
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,760
You must sew up your own reproductive organs.

784
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:19,840
Insects the size of supermarkets swallow up entire continents.

785
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,900
Infibulation without representation.

786
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:24,620
Know ye well the signs of the end times.

787
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,980
The only way to save the whale is to kill mankind.

788
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,800
Look, we think we're kidding.

789
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,380
We're into the involuntary human extinction movement.

790
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:34,420
We think we're adults.

791
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:35,360
They think this is all a big joke.

792
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,240
Your inner child needs a spanking.

793
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:39,220
I'm sorry.

794
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:43,360
Give me your inner child for a week. I'll give you back an inner adult.

795
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:45,160
Susie, just ignore my hand.

796
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:47,940
I was diagnosed earlier today with alien hand syndrome.

797
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,580
I think your inner can't control your hand.

798
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:50,360
It's quite convenient.

799
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,100
You sound like some kind of weird inner child molester.

800
00:29:53,440 --> 00:30:00,920
To prevent Jane-er from murdering thousands of normals would be to stifle his inner spoiled child.

801
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:04,720
I didn't mean to kill her. It was my alien hand.

802
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:07,500
I'm pleading the alien hand defense.

803
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,820
The alien hand that God dealt him.

804
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,440
But what about my inner 70-year-old codron?

805
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,020
He's a codron in a wheelchair.

806
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,280
Incontinent codron in a wheelchair.

807
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,820
He has no continence whatsoever.

808
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,980
My doctor told me he was trying to work with my inner child,

809
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,960
but then he was trying to charge me $60 per 15 minutes for psychotherapy.

810
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,180
I said, Doc, my inner child is broke.

811
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,660
He's not even legally employable until he's 18.

812
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,260
Employable for what?

813
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,580
I had to explain to the judge I didn't rape her.

814
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,660
It was my alien organ syndrome.

815
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,720
Could you play your alien organ just a few riffs?

816
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,360
I thought she wanted it.

817
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,520
It was empowerment, officer. It's not exploitation.

818
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:49,380
I thought she wanted it. I thought when she was screaming,

819
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:53,460
No, no, no, that was just kind of a tease. That was just kind of a come on.

820
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:54,520
That's not funny, man.

821
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:55,920
Take that back.

822
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,540
How many lesbians does it take to screw in a light bulb?

823
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,280
That's not funny, man.

824
00:30:59,280 --> 00:30:59,960
That's not funny.

825
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:05,160
How many leftist anarchists does it take to screw in a light bulb?

826
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,520
What kind of wage am I being paid? Would a black or a woman or a gay get the same wage?

827
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,700
Remember the filaments in these light bulbs manufactured south and south?

828
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:12,700


829
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:17,120
Africa? Does this corporation own stock in apartheid? Is that what you're trying to say?

830
00:31:17,180 --> 00:31:19,840
How many subgeniuses does it take to screw in a light bulb?

831
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,000
Approved by Dobbs.

832
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,880
Only Dobbs. There is an answer to that. It won a prize one time.

833
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:27,340
How many subgeniuses does it take to screw in a light bulb?

834
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,800
How many to take to screw what?

835
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:37,280
1,502. 1,500 to create the shrinking device and two to climb inside the light bulb. Thank you.

836
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,400
How many new agers does it take to screw in a light bulb?

837
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:41,660
1,001.

838
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,700
1 to screw a light bulb.

839
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,940
1,000 to visualize it.

840
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,940
Convention. Subgenius convention.

841
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:49,460
Subgenius radio show. Subgenius convention.

842
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:53,520
I'll get the bus ticket if you'll leave me waiting there for five hours straight.

843
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,180
Convention. Subgenius convention.

844
00:31:55,180 --> 00:32:01,880
I'll lose all my luggage and not have my notes and go on stage and be just completely messed up, but the audience will laugh anyway because that was what my...

845
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,580
It was the best one you ever did.

846
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:05,680
Gagging on dry ice vapor.

847
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:11,720
That's what my notes were, were how to sound totally messed up, so I didn't really need the notes.

848
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,020
Subgenius convention.

849
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:20,600
I'm here tonight to speak the word of the world's only true religion. Of course I'm referring to the Church of the Subgenius.

850
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:22,880
Subgenius convention.

851
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:37,400
The Church of the Subgenius is a pan-religion of the future that unites superior mutants, social renegades, weirdos of all castes in a hatred against the conspiracy of normals.

852
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:40,600
Subgenius convention.

853
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,200
Subgenius convention.

854
00:32:41,800 --> 00:32:42,700
Subgenius convention.

But I am here tonight to speak a doctrine of national socialist, a national socialist

871
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,100
subgenius philosophy.

872
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:31,900
Because the subgenius, which is racially all-encompassing, is the master race.

873
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:37,380
It's not the Aryan race at all, but the subgenius race.

874
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,640
It's not the Jews, which are the devil race, which must be exterminated, but the normals.

875
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:51,380
We will remake the world in the image of J.R. Bob Dobbs, and we shall destroy it.

876
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:58,660
We shall build a subgenius right that shall last a thousand years.

877
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:06,780
As long as the heart beats and the breast is a single subgenius,

878
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:07,360
we shall be a subgenius.

879
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,320
We shall continue fighting for our cause.

880
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:16,800
As long as a single subgenius is able to draw breath into its bones,

881
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,380
we shall continue to fight to the death against normalcy.

882
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:34,200
I will build and breed a perfect race of blue-haired, blonde-eyed subgenius yetis and overlords.

883
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:36,540
Super-men.

884
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:42,800
The normals are underage, under-men, sub-human,

885
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,640
Underware.

886
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,200

00:34:53,600 --> 00:35:00,400
But ours is certifiably, unlike the sickening sweetness of life-cracking religions,

889
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,100
ours is certifiably a religion of hate.

890
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,040
Hate!

891
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,960
Hate!

892
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:04,960


893
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,420
Hate!

894
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:06,680
Hate!

895
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,360
Ha-ило-heart!

896
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:13,820
No, you might ask, what do you think, where am I talking about, Grinch, when I talk about hate?

897
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:21,860
Am I talking about something dandby-pandy, live-ifferentian, Beamty-Pimpy-Hate?

898
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:27,660
or ha democrats beauty-wave.

899
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,360
Oh, I just hate myself.

900
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:36,400
колo.

901
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,400


902
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,400


903
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,400


904
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,400


905
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:36,400


906
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:36,320
erongayするCLARI battery.

907
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:36,420
D постman.

908
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:40,520
Oh, I just hate the government.

909
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:46,300
Oh, I just hate the president.

910
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,820
Is that what we're talking about when we talk about hate, friends?

911
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,080
It's a no! It's a no, children!

912
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,300
When we talk about hate, we're talking about an infinity of hate!

913
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,860
An all-consuming, all-pervasive hate!

914
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:09,640
But an all-encompassing hate is a cathartic effect.

915
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:13,560
It's not like the namby-pamby little pink hate.

916
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:18,600
It has a cathartic effect that releases all the pits of anger that you've had stored up all your life

917
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,100
and leaves nothing but a boundless love for all things.

918
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,720
Unless they irritate you in any way whatsoever.

919
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,440
But wait a minute, this doesn't make any sense.

920
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,440
Why am I talking to people in modern-day America about hate?

921
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,340
That's like talking to a fish.

922
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:42,780
You don't even know what hate is because you don't have anything to contrast it against.

923
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:49,480
The average person doesn't know what hate is because it composes 90% of his inner being.

924
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,160
Oh, we've just started ranting.

925
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:58,360
The past 15 years, that was warming up.

926
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:01,520
You haven't heard me rant. You haven't heard me rant yet.

927
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:05,180
Oh, this isn't an insane radio show. We haven't started getting insane.

928
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,380
Oh, you think?

929
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:09,540
You think that was funny. You think that was disorienting and alienating.

930
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,060
Oh, no, we're just warming up. We're just getting started.

931
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,560
Maybe tonight wasn't the time to take it.

932
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,440
Now I'm going to start. Now here's the insane stuff.

933
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:22,140
We're taking live calls. That's 904-385-8357.

934
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,200
No, you know, I've just decided I'm just going to throw the script away.

935
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,960
For the next five minutes, I'm just going to do just completely improv.

936
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:30,120
Oh, man, don't do it.

937
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:30,980
Off the top of my head.

938
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,860
Wait a minute, that's not in the script. What are you doing?

939
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:34,780
That's my line.

940
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:36,020
You've got a black woman.

941
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,420
You've got a black woman on the front row. She's black. She's a black woman.

942
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:40,160
That's Don Rickles.

943
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:45,900
Look, you've got a guy sitting over there. He's a guy sitting over there.

944
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,900
Well, maybe I should go back to the script.

945
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:55,760
But I know what you're thinking. Oh, yeah, everything's okay now.

946
00:37:55,900 --> 00:38:00,440
Yeah, we've got a liberal president. Oh, yeah, Bill Clinton's going to save everything.

947
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:03,240
Yeah, the liberals will take care of everything.

948
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:05,860
What kind of a...

949
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,880
Pie in the sky. I'm okay. You're okay.

950
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,700
Tree-hugging, crystal-headed.

951
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,040
Born with a silver spoon in your mouth.

952
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,860
Everything is beautiful.

953
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,400
Airhead, are you?

954
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:24,560
I wouldn't even bother spitting on your grave when we all become victims of the upcoming Nazi death state.

955
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:33,400
Oh, a grave. Oh, you flatter yourself with a grave.

956
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:35,200
Oh, what kind of...

957
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,960
Looking through the world through rose-colored glasses.

958
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:41,640
Optimists argue to think that you would have a grave.

959
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:49,880
I wouldn't even bother spitting on the open trench that they bulldoze you and 10,000 other skeleton-like bodies into

960
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,900
when we all become victims of the upcoming Nazi death state.

961
00:38:56,860 --> 00:38:58,780
Someone turn off the Jainer device.

962
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,500
I think Jainer needs a script that's a much higher potency.

963
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,200
Wait a minute, that's Jainer at the door.

964
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,760
I'm listening.

965
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,460
Who's this at the microphone?

966
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:09,920
I'm the type of person who uses a script in real life and does improv on stage.

967
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,500
Get me out of here. I don't know.

968
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:14,300
But if that's Jainer on the mic...

969
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,720
The next line is, you've been a lousy audience.

970
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,340
Who's that?

971
00:39:19,060 --> 00:39:20,740
And that's Mike on Jainer.

972
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:22,040
Yeah, more in-joke now.

973
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:22,560
Where is Mike?

974
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,360
Oh, he's out there talking to Philo.

975
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:24,820
Reverend Mike.

976
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,000
Not enough alienating stuff.

977
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:27,120
Philo's here?

978
00:39:27,580 --> 00:39:28,280
Philo's here?

979
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:29,400
Philo!

980
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:32,700
Did Philo take Reverend Mike and do something with him?

981
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,140
Fetch, Philo, fetch.

982
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:34,560
He's like that.

983
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:34,740
He's like that.

984
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,360
He just does that.

985
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,900
You have to pull him off and bring him in here.

986
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,980
With him or to him?

987
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,960
Yeah, what do you do?

988
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,180
He's got a little tail out there.

989
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:40,640
Roll over.

990
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:43,180
Who doesn't have a little tail in here?

991
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:44,980
Horns, too.

992
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,160
I had to think about that one.

993
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,840
We would answer that, but, you know, FCC rules.

994
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:54,160
You radio listeners should be aware that Reverend Susie the floozy is sitting in here

995
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:58,020
looking really gorgeous with a devil babe outfit on.

996
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,040
She's got a four-tail.

997
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,000
We're all fabulous.

998
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:01,340
Great sort of zero gravity.

999
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:01,940
We're all lovely.

1000
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,340
Calipiginous.

1001
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:04,480
Especially the night-minded.

1002
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,400
Everybody's getting off on it.

1003
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:06,980
Floating out in front of our faces.

1004
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,200
It's a 69-cent word, calipiginous.

1005
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,380
We rode in here on a blissful tsunami of slack.

1006
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:21,040
You know, this radio show is colorized and comes in three-dimensional sound.

1007
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,260
Sodomize for your protection.

1008
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,400
What does that sound like on, like, a black-and-white radio?

1009
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,580
It sounds pretty good.

1010
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:28,520
You can see it, sort of.

1011
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:30,740
But funny on the steam-driven ones.

1012
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,100
It's colorized.

1013
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,360
Yeah, on the steam-driven computers we write this show,

1014
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,080
and it, of course, moves very slowly.

1015
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:37,660
No, but I said to the guy, he goes up to the third guy,

1016
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:40,440
he went up to the 57th guy, but I can't remember the punchline.

1017
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,220
A tube is a valve, and it squeezes.

1018
00:40:42,220 --> 00:40:44,160
I said, Doc, it hurts whenever I do this.

1019
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,560
He said, just keep on doing that.

1020
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,340
Not analog, it's more like...

1021
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:47,460
He said, have you ever had this before?

1022
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,740
I said, yeah.

1023
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:51,600
He goes, well, you still have it.

1024
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,940
Go beyond some mere conspiracy, a third concept of assertiveness.

1025
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,140
Become outright, out and out, obnoxious, downright belligerent.

1026
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:11,560
Oh, Bob, I know that I am a righteous guy.

1027
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:15,720
I know that I am a loving and just guy.

1028
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:19,200
That is why I know that you will allow me on X-Day 1998

1029
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:24,640
to pour rock salt and ground-up glass into the gaping, open wounds

1030
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:28,440
of the people I went to junior high school and high school with.

1031
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:34,940
Yeah!

1032
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:40,220
Well, just give me a deer carcass or a tree stump, a knot hole.

1033
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:42,800
I think it's unfair for you to discriminate on these people

1034
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,320
based on their prior sexual orientation.

1035
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,940
I'm not that interested in women.

1036
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:49,500
Hey, you better watch me, girls.

1037
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:50,820
I've been out in the woods for three days.

1038
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,040
I ain't had nothing but knot holes and deer carcasses.

1039
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:53,720
I'm desperate.

1040
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,860
Those deer carcasses are damn good, though.

1041
00:41:56,980 --> 00:41:57,640
He said linen.

1042
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,120
And Trotsky?

1043
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,080
That stopped it, Dad.

1044
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,260
I got the Trotsky's back.

1045
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:04,280
That's right.

1046
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:04,280


1047
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:04,360
Linen Trotsky.

1048
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:04,440
Linen Trotsky.

1049
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,000
That's right.

1050
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:07,180
Okay, guys, really, there's only 20 more minutes before we go on.

1051
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:07,920
Linen and Marks.

1052
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,460
What do we do now?

1053
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,020
We got to straighten up.

1054
00:42:10,020 --> 00:42:10,420
Come on.

1055
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,300
We're going to have to do a damn show.

1056
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:14,060
Okay, get back to the script.

1057
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:15,480
When does the show start?

1058
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:18,360
I don't know, and I don't care.

1059
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:21,500
Are we finished cutting up, or are we going to start trying to be funny now?

1060
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:22,900
When does the funny part start?

1061
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,560
Is this the part where they do the launching?

1062
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:25,900
Is this a head launching?

1063
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:27,600
We're going to launch a head over the radio.

1064
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,240
Are they going to launch a head?

1065
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:28,500
Yes, no.

1066
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,220
We could just fake it.

1067
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:32,040
They don't even know if we even have a head.

1068
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,640
Are you guys going to launch a head?

1069
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:33,040
Yes, no.

1070
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:33,460
Yes, no.

1071
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,440
Okay, I guess they're launching a head.

1072
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,360
Oh, there is a head.

1073
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:38,620
Oh, this isn't all just phony.

1074
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,500
Which part is that?

1075
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:40,680
Yes, no.

1076
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,640
Are you going to launch a head?

1077
00:42:42,660 --> 00:42:43,320
There goes a head.

1078
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,720
And it's flying across the unfair way.

1079
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:46,780
There it goes.

1080
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,980
A close-up on the head.

1081
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:51,360
It's on the 999th green, and it's rolling toward the hole.

1082
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:52,640
Ow, it missed.

1083
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,160
Hole and not one.

1084
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,560
Another interesting sideline on January 6th.

1085
00:42:56,700 --> 00:42:59,840
We're getting rocket fuel in this one with the nuclear warheads.

1086
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,620
The nuclear warhead, though.

1087
00:43:01,620 --> 00:43:02,520
Arnold Palmer.

1088
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:04,840
Arnold Palmer's forces are firing.

1089
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:05,600
The forces of Janeer.

1090
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:06,560
Arnold Palmer.

1091
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,380
The Trevinos have just entered the battle.

1092
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,880
Yes, and Arnold Palmer's forces are trying to retrieve the head from the Janeer forces,

1093
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,440
which are retreating up Stone Mountain.

1094
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:17,420
Do you hear me, Mr. Lee Trevino?

1095
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,400
Do you hear me?

1096
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:21,080
Bow to your knee to Lucifer.

1097
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:22,880
Apparently Janeer has addressed Mr. Trevino.

1098
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,040
Do you hear me, Sam Snead?

1099
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:26,080
I think a job for you, Nicky.

1100
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:28,200
You got pantyhose, maybe?

1101
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:29,780
You got number seven, Potter?

1102
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:30,240
Amazing thing about this police that are dying.

1103
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:30,900
I mean, you can't...

1104
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,680
But you can't just...

1105
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:34,480
...dodging behind the trunks of the trees there.

1106
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:35,240
I mean, you can't just...

1107
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:38,000
The trees are wearing trunks. I like that.

1108
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:42,000
I mean, you can't just cut off the head of anyone that plays golf and then launch it and say,

1109
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,460
oh, I launched a golfer head.

1110
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:46,040
I mean, my uncle plays golf, but he's not a golfer.

1111
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,280
He's an insurance salesman.

1112
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:49,120
He just plays golf on Sundays.

1113
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:53,180
You can't just cut his head off and launch it and go, oh, I launched the head of a golfer.

1114
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,400
Well, you tried, though.

1115
00:43:54,420 --> 00:43:55,580
How did that work?

1116
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,100
Well, it just...

1117
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,160
You know, that's not really a golf...

1118
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,240
And did he ever get better?

1119
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:00,620
No.

1120
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:06,260
You have to have a professional golfer or at least someone that's done, you know,

1121
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:09,880
some of the major tournaments to call it an actual golfer head launching.

1122
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,880
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1123
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:19,540
Well, because I couldn't find anything appropriate to cut to after that,

1124
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:21,840
I should explain what's going on here.

1125
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:27,380
You and me both are listening for the first time to recordings from our subgenius,

1126
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,180
D-Vival radio show and panel discussions.

1127
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:33,340
We're going to be talking about the most recent discussions in Atlanta last week during

1128
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:42,360
the Dragon Con science fiction and Betty Page convention there and associated WREK Atlanta

1129
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:52,260
broadcasts where, due largely to the efforts of Reverend Susie the Floozy and Lamar, we

1130
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:59,280
were able to effect a gathering of church hierarchites such as Puzzling Evidence, Father

1131
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:00,160
Joe Mommon, and the Church of the Holy Spirit.

1132
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:00,720
We'll be talking about the most recent discussions in Atlanta,

1133
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:05,700
St. Jainer Hyperclites, and, last but not least, friends,

1134
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:11,100
the swinging love corpses complete with Dr. Philo Drummond,

1135
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,740
the most horrible overman alive.

1136
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:21,600
And so much oral bewonderment resulted from this particular subgenius conflagration

1137
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:24,560
that next week's show will probably be more of the same.

1138
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,140
It was a capper event to a pretty busy weekend.

1139
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:31,800
We'll be talking about the most recent discussions in Atlanta last week during the Dragon Con

1140
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:31,800


1141
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:35,660
where, due largely to the efforts of Reverend Susie the Floozy and Lamar, we were able to

1142
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:52,440
effect a gathering of church hierarchites such as Puzzling Evidence, Father Joe Mommon,

1143
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:52,620
and the Church of the Holy Spirit.

1144
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,480
It was a capper event to a pretty busy weekend to a pretty busy weekend.

1145
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:56,260
It was a capper event to a pretty busy weekend.

1146
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,140
It was a capper event to a pretty busy weekend.

1147
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:09,980
Well, I had a great time with Mr. and Mrs. Nenslow, and Dr. Onan, and Dr. Howell, and

1148
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:16,660
Dr. Hosler from Negative Land, and all those wonderful Expresso-drinking west coast beatniks.

1149
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:17,640
All those wonderful Expresso-drinking west coast beatniks.

1150
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,280
I just got back from this Atlanta shindig and why, tomorrow,

1151
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:28,080
I leave for the denuded paganistical outdoor campout conclave called Starwood.

1152
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:28,400
I leave for the denuted paganistical outdoor campout conclave called Starwood.

1153
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:28,740
I leave for the denuted paganistical outdoor campout conclave called Starwood.

1154
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:45,540
So, you better believe, my friend, that this particular show and the next one, actually, are being thrown together in this brief interim in the home throne office here in Dallas.

1155
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:57,160
But enough holy gossip. Let's get back to the Swingin' Love Corpses live concert at the Atlanta DragonCon Geek Festival.

1156
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,000
Okay, enough kidding around now.

1157
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,180
We'll be right back.

1158
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:06,780
We'll be right back.

1159
00:48:41,860 --> 00:48:43,260
We'll be right back.

1160
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:00,180
We'll be right back.

1161
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,940
We'll be right back.

1162
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,260
We'll be right back.

1163
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:58,000
We'll be right back.

1164
00:51:06,540 --> 00:51:07,540
We'll be right back.

1165
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:58,700
We'll be right back.

1166
00:51:58,740 --> 00:51:59,520
We'll be right back.

1167
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:29,560
We'll be right back.

1168
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:00,660
We'll be right back.

1169
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:04,820
We're standing up when Bobby in our associates a woman's daughter, but all the horse manure.

1170
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:07,820
Get on off with Bob.

1171
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:18,860
Oh, Bob boy, is such a smooth ride last time.

1172
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:21,600
I was inside a statue of liberty.

1173
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:22,720
I just, I don't know.

1174
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,900
The Statue of Libertines?

1175
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,180
She was green with NBJ.

1176
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:28,200
That's the one, downtown Atlanta, outside the station.

1177
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:34,200
I hate when I call a 1-900 sex number and the woman on the other end of the line tells me she's not that kind of a girl.

1178
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:34,600
I just...

1179
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:37,740
Yeah, the price is right, though.

1180
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,740
Yeah, Jane-er just don't get no respect.

1181
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:40,920
We've got Jane-er now.

1182
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:41,640
What a comedian.

1183
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:42,460
What a comedian.

1184
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,560
I told my doctor I had suicidal tendencies.

1185
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,240
He said from now on I'd have to pay in advance.

1186
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:47,340
I don't know.

1187
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,600
Get me out of here.

1188
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,040
Keep me here.

1189
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:51,920
I paid money for this stuff.

1190
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:52,940
People paid me money for this stuff.

1191
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:54,760
The nice thing about this radio is it's such a tough audience.

1192
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:56,980
There's no such thing as a tough audience.

1193
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:57,740
They're not laughing.

1194
00:53:57,820 --> 00:53:58,120
They're dead.

1195
00:53:58,180 --> 00:54:00,080
You boil them for six hours, they always come out tender.

1196
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:03,600
Well, let's just pound them a bit with this mallet and tenderize them some.

1197
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:04,220
Come on, callers.

1198
00:54:04,220 --> 00:54:05,300
Give us a little, give us some rain here.

1199
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:07,140
We can cut through that gristle real fast.

1200
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:07,220
Don't you worry.

1201
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:07,780
We're listening to the show.

1202
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:09,600
Operators standing by.

1203
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:10,480
Dealers quiet as well.

1204
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:17,140
I wouldn't bother spitting on your grave when we all become victims of the upcoming Nazi death state.

1205
00:54:17,740 --> 00:54:20,020
After I got out of the Army, I swore I'd never stand in front of the station.

1206
00:54:20,040 --> 00:54:21,320
I'm in line for anything again.

1207
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,020
Nuts to butts, boys, nuts to butts.

1208
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,260
Yeah, make a hole.

1209
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:24,900
Make a hole.

1210
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,380
Soup to nuts.

1211
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:27,720
Are you boys hungry?

1212
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:32,100
It's just like that stream of consciousness type of radio stuff where you just put whatever

1213
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:33,020
thoughts in your mind.

1214
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:34,680
It's a stream of unconsciousness.

1215
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:36,820
Stream of subconsciousness.

1216
00:54:36,980 --> 00:54:37,820
Stand-up tragedy.

1217
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,560
Turn that just a little bit louder.

1218
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:41,200
I can't quite hear that distortion.

1219
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:47,560
And I think everyone should know that we do have a sales booth at the science fiction convention at the Hilton.

1220
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,200
And we are selling out.

1221
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:50,020
Now, wait a minute.

1222
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:51,540
Before we go on, let's get this clear.

1223
00:54:51,640 --> 00:54:53,220
We don't want to promote the sales booth.

1224
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,780
We don't want to promote the 900 number.

1225
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,280
Don't forget the 900 number.

1226
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:57,320
Don't talk about that.

1227
00:54:58,300 --> 00:54:59,620
Don't talk about the new book.

1228
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:03,560
Don't talk about Best of Jane or Hyperclete, Tapes 1 through 3, Doctors of Rob's News.

1229
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:06,900
Don't think about the uncut Hour of Slack episode.

1230
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,440
Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

1231
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:11,100
Pay no, yeah, right.

1232
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:18,360
You're listening to the subgenius radio ministry Hour of Slack.

1233
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:25,880
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to, got your pencil ready?

1234
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:32,180
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1235
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:39,160
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1236
00:55:39,580 --> 00:55:42,020
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1237
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:44,580
.

1238
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:46,980
.

1239
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:47,100
.

1240
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:47,100


1241
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:47,440
.

1242
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:48,620
.

1243
00:55:52,380 --> 00:55:53,400
There's a hاعj.

1244
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,480
We have a taboo problem.

1245
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,040
We have a taboo problem.

1246
00:55:56,040 --> 00:56:00,160
One in five students in the Hall of the elektronikon have a childhood without being fucking disabled.

1247
00:56:00,160 --> 00:56:06,400
That's why we, we had installed fiber liesatorio to stop people.

1248
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,380
We didn't do it because we accidentally borrowed human intelligence for holding their own computer RAM6.

1249
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,480
We don't.

1250
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,420
.

1251
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:24,200
Robertson prayer retreat. I'm talking about a level of hate that would make your hate look like a new-age potluck.

1252
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,740
I'm talking about hate.

1253
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:30,260
But what are you talking about? I don't get it. But it doesn't make any sense.

1254
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:33,480
How can I talk to people in modern-day America about hate? Oh, I get it. It's a parody.

1255
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:38,800
It's really... You don't even know, you don't even know what hate is, but that's like talking to a fish about water.

1256
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:44,600
You have nothing to contrast it against. I don't get this. Are you saying that you you don't like other people?

1257
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,100
With the right gravy.

1258
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,720
Well, see, I see that I hate hate, which means I like people.

1259
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:57,080
Your insecurity with yourself, see, if you would just come to grips with the fact that you're an imperfect human...

1260
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,740
Latch onto that hunker! Deal with it!

1261
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:04,080
Only a person who does not hate himself can truly hate everyone else.

1262
00:57:04,180 --> 00:57:05,640
But, Jayner, Jesus loves you.

1263
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:10,080
It's just that everyone else thinks you're total ass. Wow, here he is now.

1264
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,380
Jesus! This is Ivan Stang. This is Jayner Hyperglitz.

1265
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:14,440
This is Papa Joe Mama.

1266
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:16,360
And I'm Postley Levin. Hey, you got any words for us?

1267
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,660
Yes. Who plays Jesus now?

1268
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:29,020
Yes, you see, I am Jesus Christ, and all you have to do is confess your sins to me, and I can forgive you and give entrance to anyone into the kingdom of heaven.

1269
00:57:29,020 --> 00:57:30,880
Could you get me backstage to heaven, please?

1270
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:33,400
Anyone except for you guys.

1271
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,420
I've just got to meet him. I've got to meet him.

1272
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,320
You've gone too far. I've got all his records.

1273
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,480
What is the unforgivable sin? I thought about finding him.

1274
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,500
Is there a sin you just commit and then you just pull the lever and down you go?

1275
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,460
What is that unforgivable sin?

1276
00:57:44,880 --> 00:57:45,600
This show.

1277
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,980
Well, besides that, it's Butterfingers.

1278
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:51,340
We're going to have to actually do, you know, get ready. We're going on in just ten minutes.

1279
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:55,480
We've got to straighten up. I'm not ready for this.

1280
00:57:55,780 --> 00:58:00,380
Which radio show? What city are we in? Which radio show is this? Which character am I?

1281
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:01,520
I'm drawing up an outline here.

1282
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,840
Are we in geostationary orbit or are we still...

1283
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:08,200
Okay, I'll tell you what. I'll come in like I was...

1284
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,000
In latitude and longitude and...

1285
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:12,480
Why don't I stay out so that it...

1286
00:58:12,480 --> 00:58:16,660
You know, you all start off and then I come in late and then like I pretend like I was left behind and we can kind of...

1287
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:20,220
No, just keep doing what you've been doing, being the straight man, not saying anything funny.

1288
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,840
You've been real good at that all night.

1289
00:58:22,020 --> 00:58:22,620
Well, I could do that.

1290
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:23,640
You've built a career on that.

1291
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:26,540
That would probably help you seem funnier than you really are.

1292
00:58:26,780 --> 00:58:27,140
Yeah.

1293
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,220
Well, you know, you're...

1294
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:32,120
I think what you really do best is kind of like an Ed Woods thing.

1295
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:35,480
I mean, the stuff you do is so bad, it's just laughable.

1296
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,860
I just love it because...

1297
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:38,660
Now, wait a minute. I happen to think Ed Woods is back in the...

1298
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:42,460
I mean, those parodies of Ed Woods and Al Ackerman that you do, they're...

1299
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:42,460


1300
00:58:42,460 --> 00:58:43,540
Well, see, that's the difference between me and you.

1301
00:58:43,540 --> 00:58:44,560
Those just crack me up.

1302
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,820
You think Ed Woods is making a mistake.

1303
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:49,580
I happen to think that he was deliberately making it bad so bad that it would be good.

1304
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,060
It's easy to do things good and it's easy to do things bad.

1305
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:53,200
Yeah, but see, he even did...

1306
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,320
That was the way Dobbs did it.

1307
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,920
You see, he even did that badly, so that came...

1308
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:02,740
His concept of good-bad came out bad, but then that badness was good, so it's like a double reverse psychology...

1309
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:06,120
All these normals running around saying, oh, he's a genius, he's a genius.

1310
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:06,680
What do they know?

1311
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,480
It takes a genius to recognize a genius.

1312
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:09,580
It takes one to know one.

1313
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:11,820
If they say they're a genius, that means they're an amateur.

1314
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:12,440
It takes...

1315
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,480
It takes one to kill one.

1316
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:15,440
A true genius understands true geniushood.

1317
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,800
That's why I understand Ed Woods, and you don't know what you're talking about.

1318
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:22,260
I don't know what you're talking about.

1319
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:25,520
I just realized that if there were just...

1320
00:59:26,220 --> 00:59:33,540
More people could understand my inherent superiority over all other beings, it would be such a simpler world.

1321
00:59:33,720 --> 00:59:35,520
It could straighten everything out, but...

1322
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,840
Look into my eyes, Jane Eyre.

1323
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:37,740
But that would be...

1324
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,120
Look into my eyes.

1325
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:41,180
But you don't have any eyes.

1326
00:59:41,260 --> 00:59:41,720
They were...

1327
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:42,460


1328
00:59:42,460 --> 00:59:44,040
You are insane.

1329
00:59:48,300 --> 00:59:49,260
They're in unison.

1330
00:59:49,420 --> 00:59:49,900
Supernatural?

1331
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:50,740
Perhaps.

1332
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:51,800
Bologna?

1333
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,220
That is a supernatural.

1334
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,540
Who comes at that?

1335
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,080
Susie.

1336
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,020
Susie, it's so good to be in the station with you.

1337
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:03,540
It's so nice to give you a radio station reverend

1338
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:05,880
Staying to do our evil work.

1339
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,660
We can gangbanger now, that would be part of the joke.

1340
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:12,440
Part of this because we're on the radio...

1341
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:12,440


1342
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:13,400
We've heard the satire.
