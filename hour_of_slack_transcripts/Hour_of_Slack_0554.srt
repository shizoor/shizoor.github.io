1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,140
Ah, yes, dear friends. Well, we have a happy, happy, happy show for you tonight.

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,900
Although I'm sure that there are those out there who will think it is not so happy.

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:17,120
But they have ears which do not hear until we break the power of the spirit of greed over their lives.

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,360
Greed. That's the problem.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,340
The spirit of greed is a top dog in the kingdom of darkness.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:28,640
This spirit has built up strongholds all over the United States, particularly in our cities.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:36,740
But the weapons of our warfare are mighty unto God for the pulling down of strongholds, the Bible says.

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,680
Because it's the subgenius hour of sweat.

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,060
How come always scary on show, says Doug Smith of Dallas, Texas?

10
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:53,900
Well, it's actually been some time since Gary has been on the show.

11
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,500
We tried to get him to come in, but he always has to go out smurfing through.

12
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,940
The solar system is wind surfboard.

13
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:04,240
His solar wind surfer is 40 feet long.

14
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:04,740
He's strapping.

15
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:05,960
Show's about to take off.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,440
About two and a half miles in wind.

17
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,560
Feedback distorts the engine output.

18
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:16,980
All hooked up, Captain?

19
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,680
I'm the guy with the legal notices in the paper.

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,440
I'm a Bob case.

21
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:28,160
I'm a privacy case.

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,560
I got a slack, a slack case.

23
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,880
I have a right to the spacefrop.

24
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,080
I have read in the black.

25
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:37,520
I can have the black, the purple and the green.

26
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,620
I'm a church air case.

27
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:52,560
Uh, cops in Euclid called me up every five minutes and made sure I knew I had the rights to the Patriot, Psychotic, Narco materialist, uh, prop case.

28
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:57,900
And, uh, there was this nurse with the Euclid school district.

29
00:01:57,980 --> 00:01:58,620
Uh, he came in.

30
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:05,860
He came along and, uh, tried to, tried to tell me that, uh, like the Dobbs thing was, uh, was not a part of my case.

31
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,620
But I'm, I'm on that case.

32
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:10,660
And, uh, I got a legal document in the paper to that effect.

33
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:11,660
Beep.

34
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:17,840
Uh, I'm the guy with the, uh, legal notices in the paper.

35
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,020
I wanted, uh, I got the WCSB pledge drive tapes.

36
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,420
I got the, uh, phone number to call, pledge drive number.

37
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,580
I got, I got a...

38
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,420
A right to the, uh, the broke friend.

39
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:34,400
I got the ex-day, uh, I'm an ex-day case.

40
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,760
Uh, I got my ticket.

41
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,840
I got my passport.

42
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,800
I spent the $30.

43
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:39,560
Beep.

44
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:41,340
I spent the $30.

45
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:43,920
Beep.

46
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:44,960
Beep.

47
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:48,300
Beep.

48
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,440
Beep.

49
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:49,840


50
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,540
Beep.

51
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:51,560


52
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,400
Beep.

53
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,400


54
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:54,840
Beep.

55
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:54,840


56
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:54,840


57
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,580
Beep.

58
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:55,620


59
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:55,620


60
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:55,620


61
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:55,940


62
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:55,940


63
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:55,940


64
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:56,220
Beep.

65
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,740
Beep.

66
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,600
Beep.

67
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,900
Beep.

68
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


69
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


70
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


71
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


72
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


73
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


74
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


75
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


76
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


77
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:19,920


79
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,560
Beep.

80
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,880
Welcome, alien

81
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:38,860
We hope you'll be our friend

82
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:43,980
Welcome, alien

83
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,700
Welcome, alien

84
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:54,600
Welcome, alien

85
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,680
Oh, welcome, welcome, welcome

86
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,420
Welcome those happy, happy aliens

87
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,520
Didn't I tell you, friends, it was gonna be a

88
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,280
A happy, happy, happy show

89
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:09,120
This time just so, so happy

90
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,220
Crappy

91
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:15,400
And that band doing that song, Welcome Aliens

92
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,680
Is in fact called

93
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,860
The Happiest Guys in the World

94
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,100
Yes, we got a CD from

95
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,400
The Happiest, Happiest

96
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,220
Guys in the World, and they are so happy

97
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,380
Unless they're really being

98
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:29,680
Incredibly cynical

99
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,260
Nah, couldn't be, they've got smile faces

100
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,820
All over their happy album

101
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:35,740
And we'll play more of that later

102
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:38,300
We've got all sorts of happy tunes

103
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,000
Here today, in fact

104
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,220
As well as lots of ESO

105
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,280
Radio with lots of Cowboy Dave

106
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,640
And Chaz, and

107
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,420
Princess We Are Doe in this particular case

108
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,620
And myself, and speaking

109
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,000
Of aliens, before I go on to the

110
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Happy, happy music, I have to do a

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,940
Plug for a book by a friend of mine

112
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:00,500
John Shirley, the, known as one of the

113
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,400
Cyberpunk crew, he did the Eclipse

114
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,340
The Eclipse series, and a number of really

115
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,940
Wonderful horror stories, and he's got a new

116
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:13,440
Hardcover book out about the Greys

117
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:17,460
And it's called Silicon Embrace

118
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,780
Published by Mark Ziesig, the publishers

119
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,980
And it is awesome, I think, I think it's a

120
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,780
Hardcover, unfortunately, but keep your eyeballs

121
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:27,460
Out for it, it's got a Paul Manfredi's cover

122
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,860
In the first, in the first five pages

123
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,860
Jesus and the Apostles

124
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,740
Go up on a mountaintop to meet

125
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,740
The Grey aliens, and

126
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,840
Of course, then it skips ahead to Area 51

127
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,780
But it's, it's the ultimate

128
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,900
In, it's the ultimate John Shirley

129
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:43,940
Sci-fi book, and it's the ultimate

130
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,040
Documentary, thank y'all

131
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:47,700
Now

132
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:50,160
That Silicon Embrace

133
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,040
Anything, anything by John Shirley

134
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,880
Is great stuff, and I'm not

135
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,900
Just saying that because he's my, because he's a

136
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,900
A dues-paying subgenius that spent that

137
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,180
Thirty dollars, how about you, huh?

138
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,600
Have you, and have you pledged to your local

139
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,940
Station that plays the Hour of Slack, huh?

140
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,640
I know some of, most of them

141
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,780
Probably need it

142
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,000
Ah yes, but let's

143
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,900
Move on now to some more

144
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,840
Happy, happy

145
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,280
Happy, happy music

146
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,900
This particular, uh, tape is

147
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,260
From a band

148
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,740
I can't remember where, called

149
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,760
Pinko Punko

150
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,140
You'll just love

151
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,500
Pinko Punko

152
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,000
Pinko Punko

153
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,640
Music

154
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,180
Music

155
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,720
Music

156
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,080
Music

157
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,500
Music

158
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:39,600
Music

159
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,500
Music

160
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:40,840
Music

161
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,040
Music

162
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:41,700
Music

163
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:45,360
Frosty the Snowman was a very merry soul.

164
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:46,580
Yeah!

165
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,200
So George Bush dropped a nuclear bomb.

166
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,920
And Frosty's body was consumed by flames.

167
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,460
And Frosty the Snowman was relegated to nothing more than an insignificant puddle of water.

168
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,740
And all the little children cried as they watched their beloved Frosty die.

169
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:07,900
And it's all the fault of those vicious warmongers like Dan Quayle and George Bush and Mike Dukakis

170
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,020
and Howdy Doody and Buffalo Bob.

171
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,600
Aw, come on, scum.

172
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:13,760
Cheer up.

173
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:15,300
Hey, wait a minute.

174
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,160
Who the hell are you?

175
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,020
Why, I'm Sunshine, the Rainbow Pixie.

176
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,300
And I think that you should have a more positive outlook on life.

177
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:33,420
The world is a wonderful place if you just think about the flowers and the puppy dogs and the rainbows.

178
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:34,040
Yeah.

179
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,320
Get away from me, you Auschwitz-loving, donut-eating, brown-shirt dwarf.

180
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,760
I'm sick and tired of you.

181
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,000
Little...

182
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,560
I'm sick and tired of things like you polluting our Earth.

183
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:43,460
You tell them, scum.

184
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,200
Wait, who the hell are you?

185
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,420
I am the Angel of Death.

186
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:54,380
And I say that you should take that cute little pixie and place its head firmly between your teeth

187
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:59,880
and fight down hard in protest of the current political climate.

188
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,580
Yeah, yeah, you're right, Angel of Death.

189
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:07,280
This positive-thinking, police-loving elf puke has no reason to exist.

190
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,480
Come here, you.

191
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,620
I'm your friend.

192
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:11,400
Scum, please don't hurt me.

193
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:19,820
And now, I shall bite your head off in protest of the fact that police officers have stupid haircuts and hang out in donut shops.

194
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,500
No, just think about the flowers and the rainbows.

195
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:23,080
Just die.

196
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,140
No!

197
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:29,560
Okay, good.

198
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:33,220
Now that that thing's dead and gone, I can get back to what I was originally talking about.

199
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:33,840
Reach it, brother.

200
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,240
The political persecution of Frosty the Snowman.

201
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,520
It all started back in 19...

202
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:46,300
1977, when then-President Jimmy Carter called the first meeting of the Presidential Subcommittee for the Oppression of Snowman's Rights.

203
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:46,800
Hallelujah.

204
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,140
It was decided at that meeting that Frosty the Snowman must die.

205
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,280
And they put a contract out on his life.

206
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,780
Hey, wait.

207
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,800
Hey, wait, you there in the studio, don't touch that fader.

208
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,340
Wait, wait, I'm telling the truth.

209
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,660
I'm like a prophet.

210
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,820
A voice crying out in the wilderness.

211
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,460
Don't, don't oppress me.

212
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,760
No, wait, no, no, don't play with that fader.

213
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,540
Turn it back up.

214
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,680
No, you want the people to know the truth.

215
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,340
I was gonna tell them how...

216
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:12,800
Elvis is alive and living somewhere in outer Zimbabwe.

217
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:14,560
No, wait, wait, turn it up.

218
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,500
Don't, don't let the truth be suppressed.

219
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,760
Don't censor my freedom of speech.

220
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,120
I'm telling the truth.

221
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,400
No, don't fade me out.

222
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,360
No, come on, come on.

223
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,420
Come on, let him hear the truth.

224
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,700
No, come on.

225
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,060
Nazi!

226
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,460
Stormtrooper!

227
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:37,760
All yes, dear friends.

228
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:44,060
And we have the echo turned up just a little bit for Jesus.

229
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,420
Jesus loves echo.

230
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,740
He's easily impressed by...

231
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:51,040
Oh, can't you feel my stones burning?

232
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,720
My stones are burning!

233
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,240
My stones are burning!

234
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,880
Help us from this catastrophe!

235
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,440
My stones are itchy and burning and swollen like my feet.

236
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,260
Your stones, my boy?

237
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:03,820
Let me see those stones.

238
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,860
Here, lift that thing up.

239
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:05,020
Mm.

240
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:06,460
Those are...

241
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,060
Boy, they're shiny.

242
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,120
Hard looking.

243
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:09,900
Pfft.

244
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,100
And each one makes its own sound.

245
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,620
Oh, they're rattling together.

246
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,440
Just listen to that.

247
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:14,980
Listen to it.

248
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:15,820
Pfft.

249
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,320
Ow.

250
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,160
Pfft.

251
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,240
Say, those stones don't try to speak to you now, do they, Dave?

252
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,840
No, they burn my loins, though.

253
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:24,600
Oh, good.

254
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:25,060
They're good.

255
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,280
Then they're still working correctly.

256
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,920
They've been installed just right.

257
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:31,740
We'd hate to have to go in there and replace them tonight, wouldn't we?

258
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:36,700
I sure don't want another skin graft after all that problem last week with resetting my brain waves.

259
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,760
Well, that wasn't...

260
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,860
That one really wasn't a big problem.

261
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:44,020
You weren't corrupted too badly down in the...

262
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,760
Dave got a virus.

263
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,500
Dave picked up a virus the other day.

264
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,680
It got into his chip.

265
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,380
Yeah.

266
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:53,880
The one that our friends from Planet X put behind his ear.

267
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,740
It gets infected.

268
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:55,120
Yeah, like a boo-boo.

269
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:58,040
Like a boo-boo was in the boobonic plague.

270
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,980
That's what a boo-boo was.

271
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:05,260
It was like a little sore at first, and then it turned all black, and then the next thing I know, I didn't have no more computer.

272
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,740
Well, you know, the problem with Dave is...

273
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:08,740


274
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:08,740


275
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,920
It's hard to tell when the chip is malfunctioning.

276
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:14,500
He talks the same way whether it's working right or not.

277
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,640
But then that's what we pay him to do.

278
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:26,980
Well, we don't really pay him exactly, but there's an amount in escrow that's building up for him for when we make him quit.

279
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,240
Someday, yeah, right.

280
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,700
He'll be taken care of.

281
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:31,200
Promises, promises.

282
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,480
You know, I...

283
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:36,480


284
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,240
I...

285
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,240


286
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,240


287
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:37,600
I...

288
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,600
I...

289
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,840
I saw a large, large woman last week who they claimed was...

290
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,540
Do you remember in the story about Buffalo Bill and the Wanders where they clipped the woman's flesh?

291
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,380
I wonder if I'll ever need some kind of device like that on my body.

292
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,400
What, a flesh clipper?

293
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,920
Yeah, a flesh clipper.

294
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,720
Well, you'd have to gain some weight.

295
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:54,460
You're not very...

296
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:55,940
You're not really all that big, Dave.

297
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:56,720
No, not from me.

298
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,760
From a computer, Herman.

299
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:58,900
Oh, wait.

300
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:00,600
To...

301
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,300
What's...

302
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:01,740
Sorry.

303
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,840
He's gonna clip the flesh.

304
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:04,780
You see what I mean, friends?

305
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,400
He's gonna...

306
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,900
He says he's gonna clip the flesh from his computer.

307
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:14,020
As if his computer was some sort of large woman that he's talking about.

308
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,460
He wishes.

309
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,280
He wishes.

310
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,280
Actually, uh, I sort of know how it feels.

311
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,480
I've grown a whole human being on my body.

312
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:23,860
You got a call.

313
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:24,820
Oh.

314
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,880
Ma'am, speak up.

315
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,480
We can't hear you.

316
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,280
Wait.

317
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,500
Run the ad first.

318
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,740
For over 20 years, Congressman Ivan Stank...

319
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:38,740


320
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:38,740


321
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:38,740


322
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:38,740


323
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:44,820
...has served the people of Ohio's 729th District with honor, pleasure, and extreme...

324
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,700
...puffishation.

325
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:52,360
Now, Republicans and Democrats from other planets are telling and calling him a Texas carpetbagger.

326
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,680
Who's telling the truth?

327
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:54,720
Ask yourself.

328
00:12:54,980 --> 00:13:02,540
Who wanted to stop mandatory child flatulence in schools, dance lessons for unborn children, and motorcycle helmet laws for trepanated skulls?

329
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,080
Then ask yourself this.

330
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:06,240
I hate the pinks and big corporations.

331
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:10,160
Poltergeist.

332
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,640
Poltergeist effect in the studio again.

333
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:16,320
The, the, the Dave strap.

334
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,960
Well, it just kind of went limp again.

335
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,620
Right in the middle.

336
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:24,820
He was so, he was just, he was doing it so right.

337
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,660
It was so cool.

338
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,620
He was pink and he was juicy.

339
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:37,060
But then, unfortunately, his special Dave luck had to come along and untie his strap.

340
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,080
It was.

341
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:41,400
So, he, he, he fetched on it.

342
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,420
For over 20 years...

343
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,240
Hi, this is Leon.

344
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,180
No, let's start at the end.

345
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,640
Hi, this is Leon.

346
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,620
I play guitar.

347
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:50,160
This is Tarkin and I play bass guitar.

348
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,320
I'm Peter and I play drums.

349
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,240
We're the happiest guys in the world.

350
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,560
And just remember, you can make a difference...

351
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,580
...if you try...

352
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,200
...try...

353
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:03,600
...try.

354
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,960
You know you can make a difference.

355
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:28,520
You know you can make a change.

356
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:34,360
You can make all the difference.

357
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,660
You can make all the change.

358
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:38,520
But you gotta...

359
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:41,500
Try, try, try.

360
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,560
Try, try, try.

361
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,200
Try, try, try, try.

362
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,900
You can make all the difference.

363
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,180
You can make all the change.

364
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,840
You can clean the dirty oceans

365
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:17,400
You know you can clean the smog-filled air

366
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:22,340
You can make all the difference

367
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:25,640
You can make all the change

368
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:26,300
But you gotta

369
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,920
You can make all the difference

370
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,180
You can make all the change

371
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:49,100
We can make a beautiful world

372
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,100
We can do it together

373
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:01,760
Come on

374
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,740
We can make a big difference

375
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,240
If we try

376
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,980
Come on

377
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:11,080
We can do it

378
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,840
Now's the time

379
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,360
And this is the place

380
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,440
Cause I

381
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,280
Come on

382
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,220
Let's do some good

383
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:19,340
You and me

384
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,300
Let's clean up the neighborhood

385
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:22,280
I believe

386
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,480
Come on

387
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:24,560
We can do anything

388
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:25,200
Join our band

389
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,940
You're the one

390
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,120
And together

391
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,940
We'll change this land

392
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,500
I believe in you

393
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,480
And sing along

394
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,800
I believe in you

395
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:36,220
We'll change the world with our song

396
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:37,120
I believe in you

397
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,140
Come on

398
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,180
All together now

399
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,720
Don't you know

400
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,260
We've got to change the world

401
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,520
Join the peaceful revolution

402
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,480
Come on, let's make a change

403
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,540
Join the peaceful revolution

404
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,280
Come on, let's make a change

405
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,280


406
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,760
Make this world a better place

407
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:00,580
Join the peaceful revolution

408
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:04,320
Come on, let's all recycle

409
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,520
Join the peaceful revolution

410
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:13,740
Come on and try, try, try

411
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,660
Let a cigarette put it out upon your face

412
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,840
Kick a blind man in the shins

413
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:30,680
I hate the human race

414
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,920
Push no ladies down the sins

415
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:32,760
Is what I really dig

416
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:33,800
All policemen out

417
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,940
Are a bunch of anti-fascist hicks

418
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:35,360
Life stinks

419
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,140
Find a man with no arms

420
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:39,000
And throw him in the drink

421
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:39,480
Life stinks

422
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,460
The world is full of neo-fascist

423
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,220
Communistic fakes

424
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:44,220
Some girls were out on a picnic

425
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,280
Over an empty street

426
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,340
Hatchet holes in their punk pants

427
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,420
And spit upon their luncheon meat

428
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,320
And after that adventure

429
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,500
I went down to the park

430
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:50,740
Shaking skies out of the sky

431
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,600
Till it got too dark

432
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:52,080
Life stinks

433
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,880
Find a man with no arms

434
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:55,760
to throw him in the drink

435
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:56,500
LIFE STINKS!

436
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:00,080
The world is full of neo-pharmacist communistic fink!

437
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,760
Reagan is a hypocrite, Quayle is a queer!

438
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,880
George Bush is the antichrist, the Bible makes it clear!

439
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,960
I think if there is torture, please I think that they must die!

440
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,440
I'll take damn it ahead and I'll put you back and I'll tell you a lie 12

441
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:26,420
apostles

442
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:27,500
4

443
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,600
sharik get pissed off at somebody else for your frustrations

444
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:52,220
blame the other guy for your miserable feelings

445
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,840
but blame

446
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:52,940
it health it's about you!

447
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,600
and whining are symptoms of sickness.

448
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,380
And you recognize sickness when you hear it,

449
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:59,180
and you wonder if maybe you sound like that

450
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,320
while you do and you know it.

451
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,940
But knowing that only makes you feel worse,

452
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,040
and you've still got nothing to make you feel any better.

453
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,340
No sports or drugs or sex or cruelty or theft

454
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,960
or fleeting rush will ever ultimately help you.

455
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,980
Admit it, though.

456
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,480
You desperately want to get in a band,

457
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,020
be seen on stage,

458
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,040
have people lust after you like you do for them

459
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,720
out in the audience, dreaming.

460
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,120
Scheming.

461
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,140
Scheming.

462
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,080
Hoping one day you'll be up there like them,

463
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,160
a celebrity.

464
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,340
But you really don't want to be like anyone.

465
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,520
You just want to enjoy the money and the power

466
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:38,260
and easy party lifestyle, sure.

467
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:41,260
But that's the only part of the illusion

468
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,360
you're ever going to see,

469
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,780
because there's only a fraction

470
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,780
who ever make it up on that stage,

471
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:46,720
and when they get there,

472
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,260
it's like nothing they ever dreamed of,

473
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,020
and your chances of making it up there

474
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,920
are slim and nigh.

475
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:56,380
Shoot is made in droves

476
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:13,820
Listen opens the여� of the deep

477
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:13,820


478
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:14,280
our lives and work lives

479
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,860
where we are together at home,

480
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,320
Subtitles are available for touche.

481
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:17,320


482
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:20,020
Just to say the nigh, I will have life withoutReact.

483
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,660
Thank you, Steve.

484
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,720
Thank you, Princess.

485
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:49,740
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

486
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:57,500
True to the subgenius tradition, we do things out of order on purpose, and so I would like to read you your bedtime story now.

487
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:05,720
This is dedicated to Dr. Seuss, certainly one of us, and probably part of the reason many of us are.

488
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:12,100
This was written in retaliation for a question.

489
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:17,040
It's common on the Internet when folks come into a new area and want to learn a new subject where folks are talking.

490
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,720
They have a list of frequently asked questions.

491
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:22,460
It goes by its initials, FACFAQ.

492
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:29,380
And this was written as a FAC for somebody who asked, what's this Church of the Subgenius all about anyway?

493
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,800
So, this is my FAC for Slack.

494
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,640
Let me tell you a story, a story of Slack.

495
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,500
Sit down in the front so you can see in the back.

496
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:43,800
This story of Slack can act as a FAC.

497
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:47,020
There was a kind man known as J.R. Bob Dobbs.

498
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,360
He could sell anything.

499
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,720
He would sell Gallup.

500
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:50,800
He would sell

501
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:51,080
He would sell

502
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:51,620
He would sell pinky ringers.

503
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,660
He would sell little fingers.

504
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:55,180
He could sell karaoke to professional singers.

505
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,440
He wasn't a genius, but he sure had his luck.

506
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,380
And with his wife, Connie, he sure liked to, well, what do you think?

507
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,560
After all, he's just human.

508
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,600
Well, no, he isn't quite, but we'll get there.

509
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,060
Quit fuming.

510
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:11,840
Well, working one night on a homemade TV came a curious light, and what should he see?

511
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,180
That alien Wotan, plain as you, plain as me.

512
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:18,740
He jiggled and sizzled and he zapped and he popped.

513
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:21,360
From Jehovah One, immaculation he copped.

514
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,700
Jehovah One spoke and spoke more and then stopped.

515
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:29,520
What Bob Dobbs then learned is a matter of church, for he fell to the ground with a stumbling

516
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,500
lurch and he spouted and ranted and started to shout,

517
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,560
The X's are coming, all you Yetis, get out!

518
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,100
But Bob learned that the Yeti were the original race, and the humans came later and there went the place.

519
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,960
And they both were created by aliens from space.

520
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:48,720
The genes of the Yeti to this day still exist.

521
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:53,440
They survive in those called subgenius, those few left alive, who are different as different as different can be.

522
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:55,920
You think one is you? I know one is me.

523
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,680
The subgenii are born with original slack.

524
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,900
The conspiracy takes it and won't give it back.

525
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:05,140
Oh, they'll give us false slack, like trash in a sack.

526
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,540
They steal it from TV, they make us buy more.

527
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:10,320
They wish us we had more, more, more, more, more.

528
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,820
But it's never enough because it isn't real.

529
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,940
It hasn't the stench or the look or the feel.

530
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,280
It just feels like junk, this stuff that we buy.

531
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:22,020
They don't care what it is as long as we buy and we buy and we buy from month front to month back.

532
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,680
And still we're left wanting because it ain't got no slack!

533
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:25,820
Woo! Woo!

534
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,160
Let me cool off a minute, my little Yeti kin.

535
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,620
Let me cool off a minute and jump in again.

536
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,140
Well, Bob saw what happened with the pinks in control.

537
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,780
Pinks are people who are normal, they're average, Joe.

538
00:23:38,620 --> 00:23:40,620
This really set fire to the froth in his bowl.

539
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,140
And so he said, them pinks got to go.

540
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:50,060
So he started a church that he could put out, the word that he needed to chase the pinks out.

541
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:54,340
And he got back the slack and he hired Reverend Stang to write down his words with his writey-write thing.

542
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,080
Stang scribbled and scrabbled and scratched and he wrote.

543
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,200
And he went to the Bibles there to emote on the evils of pinkness and the joys of slack.

544
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:05,840
And he offered salvation or triple cash back.

545
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:11,920
From Big Apple Piedom to Arkansas Land, the Yeti came forward and all got together.

546
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,720
They saw they were different.

547
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:15,120
They saw this was grand.

548
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,840
They gathered together like weirds of a feather.

549
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,960
And though they were similar as fire and ice, they all were the same.

550
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,020
Isn't that nice?

551
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:27,300
They all enjoyed being different together with others, their Yeti kin sisters and Yeti kin brothers.

552
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:30,520
And Bob decreed thusly that they should have slack.

553
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,160
And they should prepare to steal it back from the con that took it, those nasty con pinks.

554
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:38,940
And he offered to sell them to tell them what they really thinks.

555
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,800
Now Bob gave the warning our time here is short.

556
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:47,280
The saucers are coming and not one with Gordon or Clack 2 but the real ones from a planet called X.

557
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:50,100
With big scary monsters who'll breathe down our necks.

558
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,780
And pick out the Yeti to give them a ride.

559
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,940
And if you're not signed up, it's no use to hide.

560
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,900
They'll find you inside or they'll find you outside.

561
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,880
They'll be here in July 1998 on the fifth of the month and they won't be late.

562
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,320
At 7 AM every Yeti girl and guy will be taken on board to watch the pinks fly.

563
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:10,340
But you must have your ticket if you want on board.

564
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,780
While you're burst in the street like a microwave oven.

565
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:13,180
And you're waiting for your favorite Dave Gord.

566
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,860
Send in 30 bucks.

567
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,980
This is the ground floor.

568
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,380
The subgenius foundation.

569
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,120
Make sure this name sticks.

570
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:25,300
Post office box 140306.

571
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,740
In Dallas and Texas.

572
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,120
And five numbers more.

573
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,080
Zip code 752 and a one and a four.

574
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,880
Don't write less numbers and don't write anymore.

575
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:39,420
Now Bob is a reaching through reverence thanks preaching on the hour of slack weekly radio show.

576
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,400
And the wired in Yeti called the internet.

577
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,580
And log all thoughts slack.

578
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,540
And that's where you should go.

579
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:46,140
Now I know I've left out many parts.

580
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,260
Very good parts.

581
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,480
But slack's a big thing.

582
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:50,640
Bigger than I can say.

583
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:55,800
I can tell you from sunup until night and next day and still not be done and have more to say.

584
00:25:57,220 --> 00:25:58,700
So I'll just say one more thing.

585
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,580
Little Yeti.

586
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:00,320
Hush.

587
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,740
I wouldn't walk.

588
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:06,020
No sir ma'am I would rush and send off that money and find me some slack.

589
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,880
And then you could write your very own fact.

590
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:10,900
Your very own fact.

591
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,060
I'm not going to talk back about getting slack back.

592
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,700
About Bob and Connie and saucers and such.

593
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,140
Better hurry there's time left.

594
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:19,580
But not very much.

595
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,620
Woo.

596
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,440
Woo.

597
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,260
Oh yes dear friends.

598
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:36,040
And what were we listening to up to this moment.

599
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,820
Well let's see.

600
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,880
There was of course some ESO radio.

601
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,380
And some more happiest.

602
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,220
Guys in the world with that song.

603
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:45,000
You can make a difference if you try try try.

604
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,320
And Life Stinks by Pinko Punko.

605
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:52,500
Now see didn't I tell you this was going to be a happy happy show.

606
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:56,500
And some thought alchemy there.

607
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:58,060
Well he's not very happy.

608
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,320
But I think he's getting to it.

609
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:06,440
And that wonderful poem there from the Columbus Devival by Dr. Dinosaur.

610
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,360
And devoted to Dr. Seuss.

611
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,880
Oh yeah we did hear some Ewing Oil in there.

612
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:17,860
That's Reverend Matthew Carey's band.

613
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:18,920
Now where was that.

614
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:19,480
I just.

615
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,160
Hey when you're getting a book dictated by demons what do you expect.

616
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:22,520


617
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,880
Mark ten at sudden speed.

618
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,180
Flying into the wind now.

619
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,460
I'm throwing at my feet.

620
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,920
Something of likeness to you now.

621
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,060
I spotted you in the sun.

622
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:46,000
I called your name from a distance.

623
00:27:47,300 --> 00:27:49,540
I knew you were the one.

624
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:52,520
I called again.

625
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:55,180
I do declare.

626
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:59,360
I can float in the air.

627
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:02,840
And with some love from above.

628
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,420
You must.

629
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,140

635
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:15,320

00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:15,320


637
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:15,320


638
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:15,320

00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,000

except the bad

681
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,880
except the bad incidentally whether you believe that evil

682
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:24,200
incidentally whether you believe that evil

683
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,140
incidentally whether you believe that evil spirits are actual personalities that is

684
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:35,040
spirits are actual personalities that is

685
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:38,020
Speak to it anyway in the name of Jesus.

686
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:43,280
Break its power and command it to loose its hold over our young people.

687
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,300
Point number six.

688
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:54,800
In the name of Jesus, set free those who have been bound by drugs.

689
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:02,220
The Lord has revealed to us that anyone who wants to be freed from bondage to drugs

690
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,780
will be set free if they do these three things.

691
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,180
Step one.

692
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:11,040
Take whatever drugs are in your possession,

693
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,020
throw them on the ground, and step on them, stamp on them, crush it under your feet.

694
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,320
God's word declares that our enemies shall be like ashes under our feet.

695
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,300
Drugs are your enemies.

696
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,860
They've been stealing your money, destroying your social relationships,

697
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:30,260
and trying to kill you in the bargain.

698
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,940
Crush the enemy.

699
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:33,200
Crush him.

700
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,420
If you don't have any drugs on hand at the moment,

701
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:42,940
simply write the name of any and all drugs you have ever used on a piece of paper

702
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:44,940
and put that under your feet.

703
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,380
And then stamp on it.

704
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:46,820
Amen.

705
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,760
Step number two.

706
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,940
Speak to the drug.

707
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:56,820
Call it by name and say cocaine, crack, speed, or whatever.

708
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:01,200
You are not going to lord it over me any longer.

709
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,320
Jesus is mine Lord.

710
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,900
In ten minutes, you'll be smoking in hell.

711
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:23,760
But at least in hell, they don't make laws against smoking.

712
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,520
Let's think about it, friends.

713
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,780
Which place is hell?

714
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,580
The place where they're gonna let you smoke, the place where they won't let you smoke?

715
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:34,680
If you ask me, this is hell. All the airports in this country, that's hell.

716
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,140
Parking lots, that's heaven.

717
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:55,720
You will receive an unmitigated shot in the eye.

718
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,100
You will receive power that goes all the way to the base of a Kundalini

719
00:33:01,100 --> 00:33:05,360
and results in an enormous outburst of sexual power.

720
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:10,820
Once you have received this dosage, you will have to calm down

721
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,620
and remain in one place under a tree or in the shade for a matter of minutes

722
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:19,300
because if you resume activity to soak in the...

723
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,960
I don't hear the music, but go, baby, go!

724
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,600
Was there some? Was there some?

725
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,280
I can see the music.

726
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,800
Did he hear what? What? What?

727
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,680
Right, right, right.

728
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:55,660
I see hi-fi sonic music doorways to a bad planet, baby.

729
00:33:55,720 --> 00:34:01,280
Let's blast off and rock it away with this groovy beat.

730
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,600
It's so... it's goo-vy, man.

731
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:09,740
It's making me feel like I'm... like I... I took... I gooed too much.

732
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:14,700
I'm... I'm gleaning and... and blarning.

733
00:34:15,240 --> 00:34:15,940
Frop patch.

734
00:34:16,020 --> 00:34:17,120
I took one of those...

735
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:21,520
No, no, you turned the frop patch up too high.

736
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,640
I put too many patches on.

737
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:25,700
Man, your... your arms...

738
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:25,700


739
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:25,700


740
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,540
Your arms are getting green and hairy.

741
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:28,360
Yeah, I kind of dig it, though.

742
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,100
I dig watching it.

743
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,760
Boy, you look really, really strange.

744
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,960
Wait, let me get the vid cam here for a minute.

745
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:34,860
No, it's all right.

746
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,420
I know when I've had enough.

747
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,080
More, Iggy, more!

748
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,020
Hey, man, you better take that thing off.

749
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,420
If you can, take it off.

750
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:42,960
Give me a bigger patch.

751
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:45,500
Yes, one that'll cover my whole face.

752
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:48,700
It'll get into my eyeballs.

753
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:49,500
Oh, Lord.

754
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,240
Little patches for right in my eye.

755
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,140
Hey, they better sit down.

756
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,360
They'll deliver the dosage.

757
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,440
The chemical, the master molecule.

758
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,680
I will obey the master molecule.

759
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,880
That thing's growing into your arm, man.

760
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,440
I can't even get it out of you now.

761
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,780
Yeah, they said they weren't gonna let me smoke at the airport.

762
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,260
Uh-huh.

763
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:08,220
Oh, yeah.

764
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:14,920
Said they were gonna check my excretions for bad smoke.

765
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,420
For church air.

766
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,200
They wanted to see if I'd been breathing any church air.

767
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,540
Well, I think we're gonna figure out a way around that.

768
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:24,420
We design these little patches.

769
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:26,940
I'm feeling fine now.

770
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:27,560
Oh, yeah.

771
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,260
So we smoke the airport.

772
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,880
Every one of them actually burns like fire.

773
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,040
We smoke the airport.

774
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:39,780
It delivers the master molecule.

775
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,080
D-O-B, they call it.

776
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:45,900
Dob.

777
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,940
There are some side effects.

778
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:53,340
Your left arm will go almost completely numb for about a week.

779
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:54,320
You can still use it.

780
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:54,400
You can still use it.

781
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,400


782
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,400


783
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,400


784
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,400


785
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:54,400


786
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,300
You just can't feel it.

787
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:59,120
And your toes will be without feeling.

788
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,440
But these are temporary effects.

789
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,120
It's not a problem.

790
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:03,760
It's doctrinal.

791
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:05,360
It's Adamic.

792
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:06,380
It's organic.

793
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,840
It has not been touched by the conspiracy.

794
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,140
It's Dobbs approved, dear friends.

795
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,540
Oh, if you've been high dogmatic earmuffs already, all this music is...

796
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,540
I'm sorry.

797
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,080
You were teaching me.

798
00:36:16,180 --> 00:36:16,440
I forget that.

799
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:19,300
It would make you believe.

800
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,340
Oh, I have no damage.

801
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:23,160
I better sit down.

802
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:25,080
That's all you need.

803
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,620
You don't need to know.

804
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:27,820
Oh, oh, my God.

805
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,620
My feet are expanding.

806
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:33,020
You only need to believe.

807
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,060
I try to believe.

808
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:36,820
I try to believe.

809
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,780
You only need to believe.

810
00:36:41,220 --> 00:36:41,960
Secret heart attack.

811
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:42,940
Please, please, please.

812
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,780
The bear is such a fake.

813
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:44,120
Please, please.

814
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:46,580
My bodys are getting bigger.

815
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,880
Oh, my God.

816
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:49,780
I don't want to look in the mirror.

817
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:50,860
Don't, don't, don't.

818
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,640
It's so easy to believe.

819
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:53,140
That's true.

820
00:36:53,160 --> 00:37:02,400
I'm telling you, Dave, all you have to do is give, you give us that $30 and we give you this little pill and you will believe.

821
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:03,640
You will believe.

822
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,640
It's like faith healing.

823
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,160
It's, it's just like faith healing.

824
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:19,740
You know, you go to the conspiracy doctor and because you believe that if it costs a lot, it must work, you pay him a lot of money and generally you get well because that's the, that's the way faith healing works.

825
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,860
And it happens to be your faith.

826
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:26,880
You believe, Dave, that if you pay for it, it must be, if they were charging money for it, it couldn't be a rip off.

827
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:28,140
Pay him a lot of money all the time.

828
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:32,280
So, you know, I mean, it had a slick cover.

829
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:34,620
It had a barcode on it.

830
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,220
Give him all your sweat.

831
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:35,940
It was shrink wrapped.

832
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,300
So, you know, it must be okay.

833
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,100
Give him all your fat.

834
00:37:39,260 --> 00:37:40,640
Underwriter Laboratories approved.

835
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,140
Give him all your blood.

836
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:50,540
Give blood, dear friends, because that's how we make the pills that do this today.

837
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:55,080
Give blood at your blood bank and make sure it goes to the home for slackless children.

838
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,060
Poor slackless.

839
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:08,960
Hey, if they're just a poor street, street bum, drunk, old junkie, retarded, perverted, but he's happy.

840
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:11,100
Listen, I'm 58 years old.

841
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:11,620
Listen.

842
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,200
My sideburns are slightly green.

843
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:16,320
I'll be damned if I ain't still a childish, beautiful street.

844
00:38:17,620 --> 00:38:18,820
Anybody's my mark to you, man.

845
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,380
I'm a member of your church.

846
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:20,960
What's up, gum?

847
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:24,020
I'm a Bonfide, Reverend, Reverend, Reverend, Los Calvo.

848
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,500
Hey, you.

849
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:26,500
Hey, buddy.

850
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:26,880
Buddy.

851
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:27,080
Wait.

852
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:27,500
Hey, man.

853
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:30,480
I need some spare change to get back to New Jersey.

854
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,440
My car is overfrenching on a bunch of things.

855
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:32,640
Hang on.

856
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,060
It's overeating and stuff, you know.

857
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,320
Like maybe like 25 cents.

858
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:37,840
Get over the bridge, man.

859
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:40,100
Hey, yeah, well, you too.

860
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,260
You know, right up yours, buddy.

861
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:42,040
You know what?

862
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,340
That's what's wrong with countries like these people like you.

863
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,400
Yeah, I'm still leading a charmed life, man.

864
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:48,800
I'm still the world's oldest.

865
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:48,800


866
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,760
Oldest street urchin, man.

867
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:50,760
I'm still beautiful.

868
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:54,960
You know, passed by the pawn shop, look in the mirror, and hey, hey, what the, what the

869
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:55,420
hell?

870
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:56,780
Man.

871
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:03,180
You too can live like Dave and bathe in a sea of slack all the time.

872
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:07,740
He is an idiot, yes, but a blissful idiot.

873
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,020
Man, I look like I just bathed in a sea of urine.

874
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,520
Man, I didn't know I was sweating so hard to get off that bus.

875
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,240
I got a little wet.

876
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:16,620
Man.

877
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,440
It's a lot of work.

878
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:18,940
I need a little bit of sleep.

879
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:18,940


880
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,680
Man, I need a lot more slack in this.

881
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,720
I need a lot more slack in this.

882
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:24,520
I don't know if I lead such a charmed life after all.

883
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:29,520
Ah, Dave sometimes falls into doubt.

884
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,560
And you see, it's when he doubts that his bad luck comes along.

885
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:39,780
You see, he's being followed now by some obvious thugs who plan to roll him and torture him.

886
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:40,020
Hey!

887
00:39:40,220 --> 00:39:43,860
But that's because he lost his trust for a minute.

888
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:45,860
I'm totally broke, I swear, bro.

889
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,320
He hasn't.

890
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,200
He's lying. He has $20 that he could have given to Bob today.

891
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:54,380
You see what happens when you don't give your $20?

892
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,860
It's cause and effect. It's simple cause and effect.

893
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,640
Take it.

894
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,500
Damn. The last $20.

895
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:02,800
Shit.

896
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,340
Friend, you're going to get that $20 stolen.

897
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,460
Might as well send it to Dobbs.

898
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:15,320
Next week, we're going to tell you to send it to the station.

899
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:24,160
Cause you cannot imagine what it is like to live in a city that doesn't have WCSB.

900
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:31,160
Where you can't hear such brilliant, brilliant monologues as Lonesome Cowboy Dave has been delivering.

901
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,120
Not to mention yours truly, of course.

902
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:38,520
And such jazzful music as chazful as of.

903
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:44,020
So, remember folks, seriously, this just between you and me,

904
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:46,120
all shtick and...

905
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,220
schmoozing aside.

906
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:49,200
Give.

907
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:49,480
Save.

908
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:49,960
Give.

909
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,020
Give.

910
00:40:51,400 --> 00:40:51,840
Give.

911
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:52,220
Give.

912
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,780
Give of yourselves.

913
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,200
Save up and...

914
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,340
and call in.

915
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:57,160
And when you call in that pledge next week,

916
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:59,060
have something to back it up.

917
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,660
Don't just call it in so you'll feel good for a little while.

918
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:02,320
Back it up.

919
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,060
We're not talking about your sex drive.

920
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,280
We're not asking you to donate your organs.

921
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:11,940
We're only asking you to donate a small amount of your religious offerings you'd normally give.

922
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:14,480
And, baby, give your cap to us.

923
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:16,240
Because we don't got a worm for us.

924
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:16,580
Pussy, pussy.

925
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:23,820
And they can also sell those cats to the medical school downstairs for torturous experimentation.

926
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:27,040
So, wouldn't you rather give the money than the cat?

927
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:27,380
Sure.

928
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:29,780
I think you would if I know you.

929
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:30,780
And I think I do.

930
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:34,860
You'll dig down deep into your pockets and support WCSB,

931
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:42,660
the coolest station that ever walked the earth on its invisible radio-tronic legs.

932
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,260
Seriously.

933
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,100
If you've...

934
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:45,260
uh...

935
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:47,920
You can't imagine.

936
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:48,460
What?

937
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:48,540
What?

938
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:48,540


939
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:48,540


940
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:48,540


941
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:51,800
In Dallas, Texas, there is nothing on the liberal bias media.

942
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,300
Except, well, Rush, G. Gordon Liddy, and Pat Robertson.

943
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,360
And Floppy Ann.

944
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,720
Remember, Floppy Ann would give Dine-Ed cuisine hints from the kitchen?

945
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:05,220
And sometimes she'd get off on them religious right-wing diatribes right in the middle of making a sandwich.

946
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:09,020
One time she cut right through the middle of veal cutlet and started screaming about...

947
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,480
Well, I don't even wanna say it on this here.

948
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,220
That was cool, though.

949
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,180
And there was a little worm.

950
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,500
Remember the little character, Mr. Wiggly Worm?

951
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:15,020
Yeah.

952
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:21,320
That the host would put the big little miniature town on his lap and Mr. Wiggly Worm would come out and talk to the kids.

953
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,380
He had a little face painted on.

954
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,740
It was really the guy's thumb.

955
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:24,400
Yeah.

956
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:26,360
Cause sometimes words are worms.

957
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,560
And they crawl right into your brain.

958
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:32,040
And they wriggle around and wriggle around and don't come out.

959
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:35,940
Unless maybe they wanna try and come out your nose, which most of them refuse to dare.

960
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:39,240
Have you given to the Corruptigating Worms Foundation?

961
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:43,460
Thousands of Americans.

962
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:46,240
If you can call Dave that, suffer.

963
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:47,600
Thousands of people.

964
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,920
If you can call them that.

965
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,300
Millions across the earth.

966
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,360
If you can call it that.

967
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,320
In this life.

968
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,180
If you can call it life.

969
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,520
They suffer from the Corruptigating Worms.

970
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,460
They're just words at first.

971
00:42:57,620 --> 00:43:01,980
Little words like Bob and subgenius and just dumb little words.

972
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:06,360
And they crawl into your brain and eat away like larvae in the middle of your skull.

973
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:13,440
And they've eaten your cerebrus corpus callosum and expanding outward until you can't even get down your own stomach.

974
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,820
And your shoes are through your doody.

975
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:20,820
Fancy schmancy sociologists call these words and concepts memes.

976
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:23,040
We prefer to call them memeys.

977
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:27,780
Memeys. Memeys. Memeys. Memeys.

978
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:31,560
Little disconnected thoughts gnawing at your brains.

979
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:33,780
Little ingo kiko. Little ingo kiko.

980
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,640
And you're fighting and you're drinking your blood and all of your work from your...

981
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:42,920
Yeah, I'm being exploited by them weird J.G. Ballard creatures from outer space, whatever they call them.

982
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:46,740
Yeah. Worms are out of balance, ish.

983
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,360
Cleveland, Wisconsin.

984
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,880
Cleveland, Wisconsin.

985
00:44:03,060 --> 00:44:04,420
Cleveland, Wisconsin.

986
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:11,220
Cleveland, Wisconsin.

987
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:18,940
Cleveland, Wisconsin.

988
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,320
Cleveland, Wisconsin.

989
00:44:30,020 --> 00:44:30,220
Yeah.

990
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,900
Blanche, I did declare it's time for you to make up your...

991
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,060
Whoops.

992
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:42,680
Blanche, no. Not me.

993
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,480
To make up your own rules. I think it's a game.

994
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:46,520
I'm sure it is.

995
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,120
I was...

996
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,240
No, uh...

997
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:49,800
Be catapulted.

998
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:50,700
Be catapulted.

999
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:53,980
Be catapulted.

1000
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,300
Uh, hey.

1001
00:45:00,980 --> 00:45:05,240
I have another announcement that I was... I wanted to make.

1002
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:07,620
And, uh, I lived...

1003
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:08,440
Ooh.

1004
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:11,200
Ten minutes, you'll be smoking in hell.

1005
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:12,900
Ten minutes, you'll be smoking in hell.

1006
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:14,580
Sometimes you'll...

1007
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:14,580


1008
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,440
Ten minutes, you'll be smoking in hell.

1009
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:21,260
Ten minutes, you'll be smoking in hell.

1010
00:45:21,620 --> 00:45:23,700
10 minutes, you'll be smoking in hell.

1011
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:24,520
10 minutes, you'LL be smoking in hell.

1012
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:25,680
10 minutes, 10 minutes, you'll be smoking in hell.

1013
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:36,180
Love, love, maybe it's not the answer, maybe it's just not the way.

1014
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:43,700
Love, love, maybe it's not the answer, maybe it's just not the way.

1015
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:50,260
Praise Ronald Reagan and his nuclear arsenal.

1016
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:58,280
He may not save our homes, but he will certainly save our souls.

1017
00:45:59,660 --> 00:46:05,960
Love, love, maybe it's not the answer, maybe it's just not the way.

1018
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:13,540
Love, love, maybe it's not the answer, maybe it's just not the way.

1019
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:19,160
Love, love, maybe it's not the answer, maybe it's just not the way.

1020
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,240
Love, love, dying for our services.

1021
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:20,240


1022
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,980
I don't think it's the answer

1023
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,640
Love, love

1024
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,700
It's probably not the answer

1025
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:27,360
Love, love

1026
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,300
I've got to find a way

1027
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,660
Saw the world through a child's eyes

1028
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:39,340
Just the other day

1029
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:44,140
Looking through these child's eyes

1030
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:46,700
I saw a better way

1031
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:50,580
I want to help all the people

1032
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:54,340
Who are bad and mean and strange

1033
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:59,060
Take their hands, shake their hands

1034
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,740
And show them a better way

1035
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,700
Love, love

1036
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,900
It just might be the answer

1037
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:08,440
Love, love

1038
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:10,660
I think it might be the answer

1039
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,160
Love, love

1040
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,500
It probably is the answer

1041
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:15,940
Love, love

1042
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,920
I think I've found a way

1043
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,820
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

1044
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,700
This song is about love.

1045
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:27,660
But not just the kind of love

1046
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:28,960
between a man and a woman

1047
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,400
or a boy and a girl

1048
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:32,300
or even a cat and a dog.

1049
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,880
We're speaking in more gentle terms.

1050
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:36,640
Love between neighbors.

1051
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,920
Love between two rival institutions

1052
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:40,120
or high schools.

1053
00:47:40,460 --> 00:47:42,380
Love between different rock bands

1054
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:44,080
and or television personalities.

1055
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:45,700
The kind of love

1056
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:47,180
that makes you wanna sing.

1057
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:48,200
And now,

1058
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,340
we'd like you all to sing along.

1059
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:53,180
Love, love

1060
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:55,400
It's definitely the answer

1061
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,720
Love is the only way

1062
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:00,640
Love, love

1063
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,840
It's definitely the answer

1064
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,180
Love is the only way

1065
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,120
Love, love

1066
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,320
It's definitely the answer

1067
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,760
Love, love

1068
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,040
It's got to be the answer

1069
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,080
Love, love

1070
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:15,680
Love, love

1071
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,800
It's definitely the answer

1072
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:22,320
Love, love, love is here to stay

1073
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:37,040
Always be careful what you drink and how you mix your drinks

1074
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:38,840
Because if you're not careful

1075
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,600
You'll throw up all of your horny with a chick food

1076
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,200
And then you won't have energy to get horny with a chick on

1077
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:49,200
Here's the moon pants song

1078
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:53,120
Mooney, mooney, moon the pants

1079
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,960
Ejaculating your moon pants

1080
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,680
That didn't come out right

1081
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:01,800
Mooney, mooney, moon the pants

1082
00:49:02,660 --> 00:49:05,140
Ejaculating your moon pants

1083
00:49:05,140 --> 00:49:06,980
What are moon pants?

1084
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:10,640
Pants like the astronauts wore to the moon

1085
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:12,580
Now it's time for the moon pants

1086
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:13,380
For a little commercial

1087
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:17,200
S-L-A-C-K, slack

1088
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,360
And this is what you need in your life

1089
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:23,780
Repeat these to yourselves and always remember it

1090
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:29,620
And I'll be taking any new members in the back of the room

1091
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,880
For your $30 check, money order

1092
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:36,160
Payable to the Subgenius Foundation

1093
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:41,040
We also now take Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Discover

1094
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:45,740
And we also, if you don't have that with you at this gathering

1095
00:49:45,740 --> 00:49:47,760
We also have a 1-800 number you can...

1096
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:52,840
I've had sex with women and I've had sex with dogs

1097
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:56,540
I've had sex with chimpanzees and I've had sex with frogs

1098
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:00,260
I've had sex with cars and I've had sex with trains

1099
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:03,940
I've had sex with people's lives and sex with people's brains

1100
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:06,580
Everything I see, I screw

1101
00:50:08,260 --> 00:50:10,180
Living a tattoo

1102
00:50:11,360 --> 00:50:12,560
I might screw you, but I'm not screwing you

1103
00:50:12,580 --> 00:50:13,700
I might screw your grandma

1104
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:18,040
Or I might screw your cold sloth

1105
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:22,380
I've had sex with hot dogs and I've had sex with soup

1106
00:50:22,380 --> 00:50:26,040
I've had sex with spinach and I've had sex with poop

1107
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,720
I've had sex with snowflakes and I've had sex with shoes

1108
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,520
One day I'll break down your door and I'll have sex with you

1109
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:37,240
One day we'll break down your door and we'll have sex with you

1110
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,840
One day we'll break down your door and we'll have sex with you

1111
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:42,560
Everything I see is sex

1112
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:42,560


1113
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:42,560


1114
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:42,560


1115
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:42,560


1116
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:47,260
See, I screw living and dead too.

1117
00:50:48,580 --> 00:50:50,660
I might screw your grandma.

1118
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,340
Or I might screw your ghost.

1119
00:50:54,460 --> 00:50:54,680
Ah!

1120
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,620
Yes, yes, yes.

1121
00:51:04,740 --> 00:51:07,000
The great pinko punko there.

1122
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:10,200
And where's my lame-ass prison band music?

1123
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:16,280
Yeah, this background music here is by Jay Powers and the Lame-Ass Prison Band, it says on here,

1124
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:19,520
at the Twin Rivers Correctional in Monroe, Washington.

1125
00:51:19,900 --> 00:51:21,760
So, where is that?

1126
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:22,360
Here it is.

1127
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:25,660
Yeah, it's funky.

1128
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,260
It's a happy prison band, folks.

1129
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:30,700
Yeah.

1130
00:51:31,780 --> 00:51:34,020
And this has been a happy show.

1131
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,660
That song Sex by Pinko Punko.

1132
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:39,120
Before that, we heard Jesus.

1133
00:51:40,260 --> 00:51:40,860
Selling.

1134
00:51:41,020 --> 00:51:45,860
We heard Joe Offrecht doing the classic Moon Pants song.

1135
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:51,120
Prior to that, Love is the Answer by the happiest guys in the world.

1136
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:51,760
And you know what?

1137
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:56,460
I've about decided that they are the most cynical guys in the world.

1138
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,100
I'm going to have to send that tape to Ninslow.

1139
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:05,020
Einstein Secret Orchestra, War on Drugs, Cleveland, Wisconsin.

1140
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,440
Oh, and Dr. Ed Strange.

1141
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,680
From that Pennsylvania subgenius show.

1142
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:13,500
I never can.

1143
00:52:13,860 --> 00:52:16,380
Prozac Free, friends.

1144
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:18,640
And they'll probably have more of that coming up.

1145
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:20,580
But first, I have to give you the post office box number.

1146
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:21,120
Yes.

1147
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:21,960
Yes.

1148
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:22,700
Get ready.

1149
00:52:23,740 --> 00:52:36,140
And just right above that post office box, 140306, in lovely Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1150
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:36,880
Yeah.

1151
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:38,360
Yeah.

1152
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:39,160
Just call.

1153
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:41,040
That P.O.

1154
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:48,940
Box, 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1155
00:52:48,980 --> 00:52:50,720
Oh, yes, babe.

1156
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:56,620
Make that a self-addressed stamped envelope or, you know, take your hate offerings.

1157
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:57,320
Okay.

1158
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:02,940
And dear friends, we now know nothing about what is next.

1159
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,560
The best kind.

1160
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:38,880
We'll be right back.

1161
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,960
They want to hear scary, angry music.

1162
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:43,900
Yeah.

1163
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:49,420
Because they like to be scared.

1164
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:54,080
Oh, if they only knew the truth, they'd be scared.

1165
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:55,700
Yeah.

1166
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:00,980
They get up every morning, go to work and or school because they say so.

1167
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,520
And never ask why.

1168
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,440
That's scary.

1169
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,360
That's the conspiracy.

1170
00:54:07,360 --> 00:54:08,360
The conspiracy.

1171
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:08,860
The conspiracy.

1172
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,120
Of the normal people.

1173
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:11,120
Yeah.

1174
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:12,540
They're out to take away your slack.

1175
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:13,540
Yeah.

1176
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,420
And see, you're just sitting there.

1177
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:17,440
You don't even know what slack is because it's been taken away from you.

1178
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:18,980
You'll probably never have it.

1179
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:20,120
You probably never had it.

1180
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:21,000
You probably never will.

1181
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:22,080
Yeah.

1182
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:25,960
Snatched from you from birth.

1183
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:32,080
And only Bob, only Bob can show you the path of least resistance back to the golden arches

1184
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:32,580
of slack.

1185
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:33,580
Yeah.

1186
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:35,560
Oh.

1187
00:54:35,660 --> 00:54:36,080
Oh.

1188
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:37,920
Just one moment of slack.

1189
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:38,160
And that's what I'm talking about.

1190
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:42,320
I'm talking about the fact that slack makes Nirvana seem like walking on burnt coals after

1191
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:48,200
you scrape up the bottom of your feet with a thousand rusty razor blades with 12 inch

1192
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,420
spikes through your nipples.

1193
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:50,220
Yeah.

1194
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,520
That's what Nirvana's like compared to slack.

1195
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,860
And guess what?

1196
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:56,100
I got my slack right here.

1197
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,820
Slack in the form of a big old rock stick.

1198
00:55:00,920 --> 00:55:01,180
Yeah.

1199
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,620
We're going to get all rocked up and play some evil music for you.

1200
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:04,480
You want evil music?

1201
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,520
We'll play evil music.

1202
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:06,080
I don't care.

1203
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:07,200
Satan's a friend of mine.

1204
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:07,900
I don't care.

1205
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:07,900


1206
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:07,900


1207
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:07,900


1208
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:07,900


1209
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:07,900


1210
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:07,900


1211
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:07,900


1212
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,580
Still gotta have a party stick.

1213
00:55:23,280 --> 00:55:23,900
Hot child.

1214
00:55:24,100 --> 00:55:24,860
Hot rod.

1215
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:26,420
Hot blood.

1216
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:28,020
Hot dog.

1217
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:41,580
Hot child, hot rod, hot blood

1218
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:46,940
Yes, star baby, yes, star baby, yes, star baby

1219
00:55:46,940 --> 00:55:48,620
Take me higher

1220
00:55:48,620 --> 00:55:53,840
Yes, star baby, yes, star baby, yes, star baby

1221
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:55,640
Take me higher

1222
00:55:55,640 --> 00:55:58,960
Fly me to a place beyond the sun

1223
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,540
Love me, yeah, rock it to the rhythm

1224
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:05,680
I want more than pretty kid improvements

1225
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,400
And cheap kisses in your little day movies

1226
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,680
She chases dreams, pieces of skies

1227
00:56:12,680 --> 00:56:15,460
She rides her road to paradise

1228
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:19,560
For hot love, hot lies, lost to lust

1229
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:23,120
Vicious fixin', vicious darlin'

1230
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:28,460
Yes, star baby, yes, star baby, yes, star baby

1231
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,020
Take me higher

1232
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:35,260
Yes, star baby, yes, star baby, yes, star baby

1233
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:35,660
Take me higher

1234
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,060
Take me higher

1235
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,420
Fly me to a place beyond the sun

1236
00:56:40,420 --> 00:56:44,020
Love me, yeah, rock it to the rhythm

1237
00:56:44,020 --> 00:56:47,460
I want more than pretty kid improvements

1238
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:50,900
And cheap kisses in your little day movies

1239
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:53,580
Stranger than strange, it's Strangeless

1240
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:57,300
A little hungry Venus in the rain

1241
00:56:57,300 --> 00:57:01,160
For hot love, hot lies, lost to lust

1242
00:57:01,160 --> 00:57:04,640
Vicious fixin', vicious darlin'

1243
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:05,660
Yes, star baby, yes, star baby, yes, star baby, yes, star baby

1244
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,700
Yes, star baby, yes, star baby, yes, star baby

1245
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:11,500
Take me higher

1246
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:16,760
Yes, star baby, yes, star baby, yes, star baby

1247
00:57:16,760 --> 00:57:17,660
Yes, star baby, yes, star baby, yes, star baby

1248
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:18,500
Take me higher

1249
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:20,520
Yes, star baby

1250
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:21,520
Take me higher

1251
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,580
Take me higher

1252
00:57:23,580 --> 00:57:25,180
Higher, higher

1253
00:57:25,180 --> 00:57:27,400
Yes, star baby

1254
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,460
Take me higher

1255
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,520
Take me higher

1256
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:32,140
Higher, higher

1257
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:32,900
Higher

1258
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:32,900


1259
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:34,040


1260
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,760
Glamour is my only weapon

1261
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,620
To kiss and drink

1262
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:42,380
Is the sweetest sky

1263
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,080
It's the ride to love

1264
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:45,320
To paradise

1265
00:57:46,060 --> 00:57:48,120
The heart of heartlines

1266
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,580
Lost and lost

1267
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:51,000
Wishes fixed

1268
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,100
And missions not set

1269
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,640
Wingstar baby

1270
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,480
Wingstar baby

1271
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:58,020
Wingstar baby

1272
00:57:58,020 --> 00:57:59,880
Take me higher

1273
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:01,580
Wingstar baby

1274
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:03,380
Wingstar baby

1275
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:04,920
Wingstar baby

1276
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:06,880
Take me higher

1277
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:10,340
She's a hungry vulture

1278
00:58:10,340 --> 00:58:11,900
Wingstar baby

1279
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:13,600
Mission starter

1280
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:17,060
She's a vicious victim

1281
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,860
Wingstar baby

1282
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:20,540
Mission starter

1283
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,880
She's a hungry vulture

1284
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,720
Wingstar baby

1285
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,220
Mission starter

1286
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:30,700
She's a vicious victim

1287
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:32,620
Wingstar baby

1288
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:34,180
Mission starter

1289
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:34,900
I'm out of here.

1290
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:34,160
I'm out of here.

1291
00:59:34,180 --> 01:00:01,060
I'm out of here.
