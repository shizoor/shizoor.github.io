1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,300
There is absolutely no other possibility.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,520
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,140
We subjected it to careful editing.

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:19,700
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

5
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,600
The subgenius hour of swag.

6
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,040
This is cassette one, track one of Our Sunday Visitor from March 20th, 1988,

7
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:37,580
which is being recorded for the Xavier Society for the Blind with the permission of the publishers.

8
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:41,040
The evolution of an idea.

9
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,680
The inception.

10
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:14,220
The history of an idea is the history of incitement.

11
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:19,740
For once an idea is born, it demands recognition and above all, belief.

12
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:22,480
Belief incites faith.

13
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:23,580
And faith is the most important thing.

14
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:23,580


15
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,100
Faith incites action.

16
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,080
Thus does a tiny flame of personal conviction become an irresistible force that can,

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:39,300
and oftentimes does, affect the lives of thousands upon thousands of people throughout the civilized world.

18
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,760
This is the true story of one man's inspired thought.

19
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,400
The anatomy of a belief that became an obsession.

20
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,220
The evolution of an idea.

21
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:53,580
And here's the story.

22
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,740
Subgenius Catechism in a Nutshell.

23
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:05,180
Slack, likened to a retarded form of grace or zen satori.

24
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:09,920
Man was born with original slack.

25
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:19,200
A slack is granted by the church's martyred traveling salesman savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

26
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,520
who was allegedly assassinated and resurrected countless times.

27
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:33,480
Subgeniuses possessing the incomprehensible slack enjoy lives of condoned hedonism.

28
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:43,360
Encouraged to explore paleo-sexuality, xenophilia, and altered consciousnesslessness,

29
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:49,820
they challenge the normal conspiracy, i.e. mundane existence.

30
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:53,140
In short, quit your day gig.

31
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:53,580
Subgenius Catechism in a Nutshell.

32
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,920
Cut the soles off your shoes and learn to play the flute.

33
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:02,780
But this isn't just rehashed hippiedom.

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,060
It's much, much weirder.

35
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,260
And it's growing.

36
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:14,860
From wild multimedia devibles featuring skull-splitting music and severed polyfoam heads catapulting from onstage

37
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:19,200
to a national radio hour of slack.

38
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,000
From Arise, the subgenius video,

39
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,560
Polygram,

40
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,900
and Bob's favorite comics, Ripoff Press,

41
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,980
to the newly released Revelation X, The Bobapacrafon, Simon & Schuster,

42
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,020
there's obviously a permanent new wrinkle in the world's worship fabric.

43
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:44,340
And the cling-free in the middle of the mess is me, Reverend Ivan Stang, dear friends,

44
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:50,220
reading from this new rave, uh, girly magazine here, uh, this article,

45
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,060
by Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

46
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:55,380
Yes, he didn't tell him that's who he was when he got the job.

47
00:03:55,560 --> 00:04:00,360
If you don't understand that, Stang starts ranting right now,

48
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,600
you're already a conspiracy slave!

49
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:08,400
No being tortured into believing in Big Brother, you went willingly!

50
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:16,120
You bent over those tight little aerobicized buns and squealed like a pig!

51
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,660
That credo,

52
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,700
separates the church from Janet Reno's hit list,

53
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,780
and the jizz-dizzy housewives who channel warriors from Atlantis.

54
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:34,240
Yet, Stang, that's me, insists the church is real religion,

55
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,020
the true one, not satire.

56
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,240
In Bob's church, with its strange spiraling logic,

57
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:46,160
Bob isn't the messiah, no, but a short-duration personal savior.

58
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,640
Bob grants slack to his church,

59
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:49,640


60
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:55,480
and the two subgeniuses, describing slack is like talking Picasso to the blind.

61
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,920
But, imagine being stoned and very lucky at once.

62
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:10,280
Subgeniuses are weirdos, mavericks who might have yeti genes.

63
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,820
Bob uncovered the normal conspiracy which robs subgeniuses of slack,

64
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:20,060
and is destroying the planet.

65
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:26,960
Subgeniuses hunger for slack, Stang says, drooling.

66
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:30,420
We sense it, recognize it for what it is.

67
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:37,120
Pink, Ken, and Barbie normals wouldn't recognize slack if it sat on their faces.

68
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,460
We're not smarter than normals, just better.

69
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:46,860
Stang stares blankly a moment, then starts ranting again,

70
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:51,720
on X day, he whispers, face contorted, grimacing gleefully,

71
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,200
Jesus is returning with a revenge armada.

72
00:05:55,400 --> 00:06:00,040
The men from Planet X are going to rotisserie gold this planet,

73
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,860
and turn the normals into a vast carpet of lard.

74
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:08,840
And we subgeniuses will be escaping in vessels of sex goddesses,

75
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:13,480
all earthly pleasures fulfilled, and watching it all on video.

76
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:21,840
If this is true, it might be wise to know who or what is a true subgenius,

77
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:26,620
especially since Jesus is Bob's golf partner.

78
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,900
But Bob's church isn't built on a rock, it's built on a shifting sandy beach of cash,

79
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,960
forked over for membership.

80
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,600
Subgeniuses look like, well, you can't judge a book by the cover,

81
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,780
so you can't tell that way.

82
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:45,740
Stang says, sweetly,

83
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:50,840
Only Bob and that $30 check to the Subgenius Foundation can make the dip.

84
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:54,240
True subgeniuses try to get the knowledge free,

85
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:59,640
but on X day the homes of the paid up will be surrounded by a force field bubble,

86
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,300
and when chainsaw tooth robo-terminators rip your flesh,

87
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,040
you'll wish you'd set aside that offering.

88
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:12,640
Stang pinches his earlobe, smiles, eyes closed,

89
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:15,260
seemingly tranced out.

90
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:21,180
Uh, here I begin drooling and muttering to myself.

91
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,800
Sacred Scribe, Stang says smugly.

92
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,140
Oh, that's pretty damn high up.

93
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:33,040
But the book is subgenius, and now, Revelation X, it took a lot out of me.

94
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,720
Bob's so elusive.

95
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,340
Stang continues mysteriously,

96
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:43,240
he's meeting VIPs all the time, he goes into trances in the oddest places,

97
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:49,360
he'll scrawl a few words of what he's experiencing on napkins, pizza crust, toilet paper,

98
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,500
and our publisher can't figure out what took so long.

99
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,820
But yet, Stang then stands, finger pointed skyward, eyes rolled back, possessed.

100
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:07,760
This is truly the Third and Last Testament, Stang shouts, trilling the R's.

101
00:08:07,940 --> 00:08:13,220
When they see Revelation X and Reverend Palmer Vreede's beauty,

102
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,900
beautiful, repugnant arch,

103
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,860
slack will drip down the pants-leg of both subgeniuses and normals alike.

104
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:22,720
Yeah, I might as well just do it all in one accent now.

105
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:28,240
Long-winded setup complete, Stang collapses like a spent erection.

106
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:35,540
Reverend Palmer Vreede's, better known as Paul Mavridis,

107
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,960
is one of the world's finest cartoonists.

108
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:42,160
Just check any history of underground comics

109
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:46,680
for his credentials, among them, work on the fabulous furry Freak Brothers.

110
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:52,760
Let's just say Reverend Vreede's is a perfect example of how Bob changes lives.

111
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:59,200
I don't give a hoot about religion, Palmer whines,

112
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,800
eyes darting about the room, paranoid scanning.

113
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,260
I found Bob in a garbage can, man.

114
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,920
Pamphlet number one, the world ends tomorrow and you may die.

115
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,520
Been doing stuff for him ever since.

116
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,580
But it's getting too weird.

117
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,380
X-Day's coming, man.

118
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,420
Believe it.

119
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:24,300
Vreede's pauses, reflecting on what Bob has done for him.

120
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,340
My penis is much bigger now, he says, distantly.

121
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:34,560
It gets bigger as your brain shrinks.

122
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:37,980
Then, silence.

123
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:48,060
Well, friends, a little bit of reading from what the conspiracy allowed

124
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:52,540
lonesome cowboy Dave and ourselves to say about ourselves.

125
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:56,620
They're on New Rave magazine.

126
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:00,360
It says here, sex, fun, rock and roll.

127
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:04,200
Church of the subgenius exposed.

128
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:10,440
And a couple of young ladies are exposed here on the cover of their special holiday issue.

129
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,600
Yes, yes, yes.

130
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:16,240
Well, now that you know what the church of the subgenius is all about,

131
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:21,880
and thanks also to Osric Tentacles running in the background here,

132
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:24,780
lovely psychedelic type band.

133
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,360
Now that you know everything you need to know about the church of the subgenius,

134
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:30,420
we may continue.

135
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:38,860
In my country, our great strength lies in our differences.

136
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:44,080
But still we must learn this if we would succeed in moving beyond tolerance

137
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,780
into the world of understanding.

138
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:52,580
This then is a fable for our time, and I would hope not necessary for all time.

139
00:10:56,700 --> 00:11:00,640
Once upon a long ago, just off the winding road to somewhere,

140
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:04,260
and nestling between the mountains of time and destiny,

141
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:07,260
lay the valley of the purple people.

142
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:11,680
From the veranda of his home on the peak of the mountain of time,

143
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,060
the old man gazed thoughtfully across the violet carpet.

144
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,460
Time, he thought, to pick a new bouquet for my table.

145
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,800
And sighing deeply and wearily with the years,

146
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:25,200
he started down the mountain and into the valley.

147
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:28,560
The violets themselves, nodding on their stems,

148
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,100
noted his coming and began to preen themselves,

149
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:36,060
for it was a privilege to be among the chosen few plucked each time for his table.

150
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,760
Soon the old man was among the purple people,

151
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:46,040
and he took unto himself a bouquet rich in violet, lavender, and all shades of purple.

152
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,440
Throughout the rest of the day, the remaining flowers drank in the sun,

153
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,560
and with the coming of dusk, they slumbered.

154
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:59,480
This was the repeated pattern as days, months, and years went by.

155
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,600
Into the secluded valley no stranger came,

156
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,480
and no wind from the outside world disturbed them.

157
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,200
But nothing is remote forever.

158
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,340
And one day a strange wind did blow across the valley,

159
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,920
bringing with it seeds from beyond the mountains.

160
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,960
And as the sun and rain nurtured the earth,

161
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,740
the seeds blossomed forth.

162
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,780
And one bright morning there were among the purple people

163
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:27,980
strangers of red, yellow, blue, gold, and white,

164
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:33,980
a myriad of colors which gave to the valley now the beauty of a rainbow.

165
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,660
But the purple people were horrified, and they were angered.

166
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,980
These multicolored strangers were unwelcome,

167
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:46,880
for they had desecrated the valley with their ugliness, their differentness.

168
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,520
They were not purple.

169
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,120
There was not even a hint of violet among them,

170
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:53,920
and therefore they were unfit to live and to grow in the valley.

171
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,500
They must be destroyed, or at least isolated.

172
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,760
Could they not be sent to some valley of their own?

173
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,920
Could they not sink their roots in red valleys, or blue valleys, or yellow valleys?

174
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,600
Or gold? Why must they contaminate us?

175
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,380
The old man on his mountain will be angered.

176
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,120
He will no longer come to pluck us for his table.

177
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:15,260
The rains will no longer make fertile our soil,

178
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,460
and the sun no longer send its healthful rays among us.

179
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:25,420
And the purple people were absolutely correct.

180
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,500
Yes, dear friends,

181
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,260
did you know the ability to openly be a subgenius is taken for granted?

182
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,940
But just a portion of a human lifespan ago,

183
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:51,900
being different was a glen or glenda type of offense,

184
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:55,560
usually punished with a scenery-chewing suicide,

185
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:00,820
with a car wreck, or with some other timely hand-of-God type thing.

186
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,900
Oh, and if God failed, they dreaded it.

187
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,960
They would drag you out of your home and beat you to death,

188
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,520
and life was good.

189
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,440
But times have changed.

190
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,740
Oh, now, not everything has changed, mind you.

191
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,880
They will still hate you for what you think,

192
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,640
what you say, and what you are.

193
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:25,660
They just can't beat your brains out out in the open as much as they used to.

194
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:31,960
Oh, but the normal pink boys have hit that snooze button one too many times.

195
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:34,180
This is their wake-up call.

196
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:35,480
Their turn is up.

197
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,520
Now, it's a celebration of weirdness.

198
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,820
Oh, we can wallow in it.

199
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:44,860
We can wag our weirdness in their faces and not die for it.

200
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:50,860
But maybe, maybe that's the problem.

201
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:55,280
Maybe I need the thrill of risk again.

202
00:14:56,020 --> 00:15:00,960
Well, I'll have fun tomorrow because I'll be an absolutely fabulous target.

203
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:05,860
If they can't draw a bead on this hell-red hair flashing in the sun,

204
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:09,720
they ought to be able to nail the flag I've made for the occasion.

205
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,360
Oh, yeah, I've been busy at the sewing machine, Seekers,

206
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:18,720
and I've created an updated version of the state flag.

207
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:25,120
And I think it looks right purty with the stars and bars replaced with a rainbow

208
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,380
and the sign of the happy Klansmen on the state seal.

209
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,540
Oh, let them fire a bullet through my version of free speech on a stick.

210
00:15:35,460 --> 00:15:40,160
Hey, the Bill of Rights sometimes protects the wrong people, doesn't it?

211
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,480
But there it is, inscribed by our founding fathers,

212
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:48,980
a bunch of white, landed males of the aristocracy.

213
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:54,060
And if the good, solid, normal citizens of Cobb County

214
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:57,860
can't respect the opinion of a bunch of fellow good old white boys,

215
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,820
well, what's this world coming to?

216
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,660
But the purple people were wrong.

217
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,780
The sun did shine, and the rains did come,

218
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:13,480
and all of the flowers of the valley grew stronger and brighter,

219
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:18,520
and the soil grew more fertile because the red flowers and the blue flowers

220
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:24,640
and the white and yellow and gold flowers brought to it the variety of richness it needed.

221
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:53,060
While it might be fair to say

222
00:16:53,060 --> 00:16:53,460
that it's now anbres

223
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:54,100
and it's made from a washed into�

224
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:54,400
and into khaki

225
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,280
pure iron

226
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,800
Is it just that Mackerel,

227
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:03,100
He is so poor at this point in the show that we might as well get all the way into it.

228
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:13,720
And I've got a recording here, let's bring that down, of Dr. Legume and his young protege,

229
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:23,200
Brother Joshua, or Yeshua, Christian baiting at the East Coast Cult Conference.

230
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:29,220
We talked about this episode in Dr. Legume's life a couple of shows back,

231
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:36,320
and this tape is not really very high quality, so I'm going to have to ask you to listen very closely

232
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,680
and let your brain filter out the hiss.

233
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:43,960
If you're like me, the hiss hardly ever makes any difference at all,

234
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,440
because you're dealing with so much, shall we say, hiss and white noise in your life.

235
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,180
In your very life.

236
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:53,540
In your very life.

237
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:00,660
That you generally just sort of, your brain does filter a lot of it out just for survival purposes.

238
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:05,200
So, do the same thing with this tape, okay?

239
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,300
And listen real close, and I think it'll be worth it to you,

240
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:21,000
as Dr. Legume baits some of the well-meaning religious people there at the East Coast Cult.

241
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:23,180
Conference.

242
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:23,620
Conference.

243
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:24,120
Thank you.

244
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:26,600
Lay it right out there on the table for all to see.

245
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,700
And come what may, you're going to...

246
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,580
That's where religion comes into the picture, okay?

247
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,580
You saw Word of Worlds where the priest walked up to the spaceship.

248
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,700
You want the whole world to see it, okay?

249
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:42,020
The faith that is exercised here is between you and the Lord.

250
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:42,920
Yeah.

251
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:43,540
Okay?

252
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,560
We don't have a religion here.

253
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,960
It's a relationship.

254
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,560
It's the holy wine of atonement.

255
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:53,100
It's the drunkenness of...

256
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,180
Confidential.

257
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:53,180


258
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:54,680
Confidential.

259
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,140
It's not back and out.

260
00:18:55,320 --> 00:18:58,260
What we do here is we drink cranberry juice.

261
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,620
But don't spread that.

262
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:01,820
There's no...

263
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:03,520
You know, it's cranapple, by the way.

264
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,960
What is it symbolic of?

265
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,060
It's symbolic of the blood filling your cup again and again.

266
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,600
So, you symbolically drink blood?

267
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,140
We drink the real thing in the Church of the Subgenius.

268
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,300
Yeah, we play hardball.

269
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Is that why you guys are so screwed up in the head?

270
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,740
We look screwed up.

271
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,420
You just told me that.

272
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:22,920
You put it out.

273
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:34,160
And it is game over by all our reflexes

274
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,300
so that you don't handle it like such a sucker,

275
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,180
theES Strand cooked your cup,

276
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:39,900
but if it wasware, should not have been a good job.

277
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:40,140
Interesting.

278
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:45,160
We're talking about the

279
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,180
terrific job you just did.

280
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,180


281
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:54,760
I never told anybody you gotta follow my rules.

282
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,480
That's a crock.

283
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:57,800
In fact, I told people not to do what I do.

284
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:00,460
Because I know who I am, and I know my own witness.

285
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,760
Why are there laws against sodomy?

286
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,340
Where's the word sodom come from?

287
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,240
Sodomy was a felony when this country was founded.

288
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,980
Right, it was founded 200 years ago.

289
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,780
And why is it called sodomy?

290
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,360
Where did they get that word sodomy from?

291
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:17,440
In life.

292
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,800
So if that's why Christians trying to inflict their rules

293
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:23,020
on everyone else, maybe somebody wants to be sodomized.

294
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,560
Well, if you did your studying of history,

295
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,360
you would know that the family-

296
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,320
Well, dear friends, I don't wanna inflict our hits

297
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:31,000
on you for too much longer.

298
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:35,820
We'll, you know, as I dig further and delve further down

299
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,880
into these many tapes, do you hear these tapes?

300
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:41,580
Can you even imagine in your wildest,

301
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,860
yeah, there's, well, there's,

302
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,300
there's a bit of it, dear friends.

303
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,660
And the next one is this one.

304
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,540
This tape is for

305
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,060
you!

306
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:58,940
Turn it up!

307
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:01,900
What you say?!

308
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,060
Where'd you get this?

309
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:35,560
We'll be right back.

310
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,820
We'll be right back.

311
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:24,380
We'll be right back.

312
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:03,420
We'll be right back.

313
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:36,460
We'll be right back.

314
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:19,440
We'll be right back.

315
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,260
We'll be right back.

316
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:54,440
We'll be right back.

317
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,320
We'll be right back.

318
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,520
We'll be right back.

319
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,400
We'll be right back.

320
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:22,500
We'll be right back.

321
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,460
We'll be right back.

322
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,320
We'll be right back.

323
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:51,660
We'll be right back.

324
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,500
We'll be right back.

325
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,700
We'll be right back.

326
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,500
We'll be right back.

327
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,520
We'll be right back.

328
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:58,100
We'll be right back.

329
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,180
We'll be right back.

330
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:09,180


331
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:12,320
We'll be right back.

332
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,840
We'll be right back.

333
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:22,520
We'll be right back.

334
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:37,320
Is there buddy purgatory where they while away their sins and spend long years atoning for each

335
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:50,800
crime? Perhaps they fly to paradise on furry little wings and play the harp to fill their

336
00:31:50,800 --> 00:32:05,340
happy time. I only know we all one day must take our final nap. We'll twitch our tails and say a

337
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:17,660
quick goodbye when we are caught forever in God's last big rabbit trap eating pellets in that hutch

338
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:20,280
beyond the sky.

339
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:46,400
This is Nenslow speaking to you from beautiful Portland, Oregon, the Rose City. Speaking to you this evening because there's, well, frankly, there's something I have to say to all of you wonderful listeners out there.

340
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:50,780
I've been hearing from a number of people

341
00:32:50,800 --> 00:33:20,780
that Reverend Ivan Stang has been sending out a form letter and I received a copy of it myself. So I have the evidence of my own eyes to go on on this for once in my life. That he's sending out a form letter telling people that the Portland revival was lousy. And you know, there's a reason why he's doing that. I'd like to share that reason with all of you today or tonight or whatever it may be.

342
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:50,420
Wherever you are listening to this in your home or your office or your car. I'd like to share with you the reason why Reverend Ivan Stang is saying that the Portland revival was lousy. The reason is it was lousy. But there's a reason for that. You see, the reason why the Portland revival was so lousy was simply this.

343
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,680
The reason why the Portland revival was so lousy was simply this.

344
00:33:51,680 --> 00:34:07,120
And this is a reason and a lesson that I think we can all take to heart. We should all think about this frequently, daily, all the time probably. We should just always think about this over and over and not think of anything else.

345
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:18,660
That a clench, listen to this now, this is important and sincere from me personally, Nazlo, a clench gets the revival it deserves.

346
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:31,340
Stunningly simple, isn't it? I'll even say it again. It's such a good thing to say. A clench gets the revival that it deserves.

347
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:49,320
Now, I've had a lot of people, dozens, even my own loving wife, Mrs. Nazlo included, come up to me afterward and say, you know, there's all these things that you could have done to make it better.

348
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:50,680
There's all of these.

349
00:34:50,800 --> 00:35:20,780
There's all of these things that you could have done to make it fulfill my personal expectations. Oh, you could have had a giant bob head with glowing eyes come down out of a flying saucer, a flying saucer that would zoom on wires down from the balcony of the theater and this giant bob head with glowing eyes could lower down. And I know a guy who's got a fog machine and this and that and the other thing. Oh, you could have attached electrical shock wires to it.

350
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:32,540
You could have attached electrical shock wires to every seat in the house or you could have had dancing skeletons or you could have done this or that. And it would all have been so much more like what I wanted it to be is what they're saying to me.

351
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:45,300
And you know what? These are the people, the very same people who sat around and said, oh, you know, there's going to be some kind of show.

352
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:50,620
And then they came and they paid.

353
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,080
They paid their money and they sat and they watched it.

354
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,100
And then.

355
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:03,300
Afterward, they sat around and talked about how it could have been better or different.

356
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:08,200
Now, I think you may notice a common thread through here.

357
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:11,160
The sat around part.

358
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:18,680
Now, we've got a lot of people who are just delighted to do the sitting around part for us.

359
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:19,860
And.

360
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:30,400
The complaining part and the part where you tell everybody how it could have been better or what they should have done.

361
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,220
All the shouldas and couldas and no wouldas.

362
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:44,000
They're just, oh, they just love to be able to say, well, this is how I thought it should have been.

363
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:46,160
And yet, you know.

364
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,400
I went to I went to one of the meetings.

365
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,040
Now, I'm guilty of this myself.

366
00:36:53,140 --> 00:37:01,160
I only went to one of the meetings because, frankly, I had put the entire proceedings into capable, capable hands.

367
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:09,860
And so I went to one of the meetings and I could see that that this was being run really well, really handled, handled beautifully.

368
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:14,540
And I saw that there were about eight people at this meeting.

369
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,180
No women, of course.

370
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,040
All guys with varying.

371
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:25,520
Weird facial hair and in physical and mental deformities.

372
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:29,820
But that's what you get with the church like this.

373
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:39,540
I went to one meeting and, you know, there was only about two people from that meeting that I even saw at the revival.

374
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:42,120
I mean, they they were willing.

375
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:50,580
These people were actually willing to attend a meeting for something that they weren't even interested in going to, which is more than the people who actually paid to go.

376
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:51,000
So there's a lot of people that are willing to go.

377
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:53,440
And they're willing to see the thing we're willing to do themselves.

378
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:58,200
So so what am I?

379
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,200
What are you saying here?

380
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,240
Ninslow is what you're probably thinking.

381
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,640
Get to the point or stop yapping.

382
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:04,480
So that's what I'll do.

383
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:20,780
The point here is that you got people who want to put on some kind of a Judy Garland, Mickey Rooney type of let's have a show and magic show and make dimes in our backyard type of thing.

384
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:20,780


385
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:20,780


386
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:20,780


387
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:20,780


388
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:20,780


389
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:20,780


390
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:20,780


391
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,560
That's really wonderful.

392
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:27,640
But you're going to get what you deserve out of it.

393
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:42,060
If you're if you listen to me, you personally, if you personally are the type of person who's just going to sit around, do the sitting around part for everybody and then tell them how it should have been better than your.

394
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,340
Listen, you're never going to get anything.

395
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:50,340
The reason why the new book is so great is because we had a number of.

396
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:54,780
Truly insane men and women devoting.

397
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:04,460
Ridiculous amounts of time and money, shocking, shocking amounts of pieces out of their lives to make it as wonderful as it is.

398
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:15,060
Just so some nut, some geek somewhere can look at it in a bookstore for five minutes and decide not to buy it.

399
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,100
So.

400
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,000
So what am I saying?

401
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,040
I'm saying that.

402
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,460
If.

403
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:20,700
If.

404
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:26,200
If you want something to happen, if you want something to be good or interesting.

405
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,660
You don't get it done by just doing the sitting around part.

406
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:42,880
There's a whole planet of people out there who are doing this sitting around part and they're doing it better than you can because they're not even griping about it.

407
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,740
They that that's their major talent.

408
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,060
The sitting around.

409
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,520
They sit around at work.

410
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:53,100
They sit in front of a screen at work typing in.

411
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,960
Some kind of computer code and they go home.

412
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:05,900
They sit around in front of a screen for five hours after work poking around the Internet looking for some kind of excuse to keep living.

413
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:15,080
And then they sit around in front of their big screen TV and watch the very latest movie release that they just saw four months ago in the theater.

414
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:19,240
But for some reason they got to see it again in the privacy of their own homes, I guess.

415
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:19,740
So they can.

416
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:26,760
Sit around and nudge each other and mock every time somebody displays any kind of sincere emotion on the screen.

417
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:36,520
Or they somehow make themselves feel superior, which is probably the only way they can ever do it when they're in the privacy of their own homes.

418
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:41,220
Because when you go out in the world, boy, you really have to actually have to be something.

419
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:44,640
Whereas if you're home in front of a TV set with a.

420
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,440
Joke of booze in your hand.

421
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:49,460
Well, then, boy, you're king, aren't you?

422
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:58,160
But what I'm what I'm trying to say here, what I'm trying to say here, friends, is is that is get off your big dove.

423
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:05,100
Either either pull the cart or stop griping about how you're not going anywhere.

424
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:14,360
I understand many of you think that it's beneath you to dirty your hands on the tow rope like that.

425
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,380
Well, you get what you pay for.

426
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,460
You're going.

427
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:27,960
If you're not going to get out there and in a hall on the rope a little bit, then you're just going to sit in one place and have nothing to do but gripe.

428
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,400
If that's how you get your thrills, well, more power to you.

429
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,400
God bless every one of you for whatever your talents are.

430
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:35,040
Many people.

431
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:47,120
Granted, many people have great talents, such as many of the wonderful people that are producing the brilliant literature and recordings of this fine church.

432
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,580
And there are other people whose major talents.

433
00:41:49,740 --> 00:41:59,420
Are criticizing and finding fault and and picking out flaws in everything that anybody else tries to do.

434
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,880
Well, that's a tough thing to do, too.

435
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,500
Lord knows I've tried.

436
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,000
I've turned my hand at that.

437
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:13,960
And boy, it's it's a hard life because you start getting a real bad attitude about everything.

438
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:19,600
You stop looking for the good in anything and you start just only seeing the bad in everything.

439
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:19,720
And you start just only seeing the bad in everything.

440
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,360
And it's difficult to do unless you keep yourself heavily doped at all times.

441
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:35,200
So what I'm what I'm trying to say is what I'm trying to say is that, you know, start pulling or shut up.

442
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,440
And then what do they do?

443
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:49,040
These useless women, you see them in the hotels, the best hotels, drinking the money, eating the money, smelling of money, horrible, fat, faded, greedy women, useless.

444
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:49,720
Pointless.

445
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:49,900
Pointless.

446
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,260
They shouldn't even be allowed to exist.

447
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,080
They give nothing and they take everything.

448
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:54,900
But they're alive.

449
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:56,040
They're human beings.

450
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:57,260
Are they, Charlie?

451
00:42:57,940 --> 00:43:01,580
Are they human or just that wheezing animals?

452
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:04,720
Do you know that the world is a foul sty?

453
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:08,080
Do you know if you put the front off houses, you'd find swine?

454
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,540
The world is a hell.

455
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:12,220
What does it matter what happens in it?

456
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,540
Oh, you will fly out.

457
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:15,580
Can't you be cool like me?

458
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,420
What the devil could compassion do?

459
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,200
Passion is of no service.

460
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,600
You impudent insolent overbearing leprechaun.

461
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:24,060
There, you sneer again.

462
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:25,360
Don't provoke me.

463
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:28,540
But you're a liar from the mildness of my temper.

464
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:29,580
You do, you dog.

465
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:32,260
You play upon the meekness of my disposition.

466
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,980
Yet take care.

467
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,460
The patience of a saint may be overcome at last.

468
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,380
Zools, don't enter the same hemisphere with me.

469
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:44,540
Don't dare to breathe the same air or use the same life with me.

470
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:47,580
But get an atmosphere on the sun of your own.

471
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,000
Ah, you might be sickened yet

472
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,000


473
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,000


474
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:12,000


475
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,200
Back when the world was young and very innocent

476
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:17,440
I think it was sixty-eight

477
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:19,060
or even sixty-nine

478
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,880
I played guitar in a band back when they used to play that rock and roll.

479
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,540
They played that rock and roll.

480
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:37,580
We used to practice almost every week until we learned a whole bunch of songs that made the proper squeak.

481
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:42,320
And we went out and played in front of people and we acted cool.

482
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:46,000
And then we all quit school.

483
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,040
We thought we'd be on TV.

484
00:44:51,460 --> 00:44:53,460
And we thought we'd get press.

485
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,960
While the newspapers wrote about how we made a mess.

486
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:04,920
Of some stupid hotel room.

487
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:08,220
Or the drugs we might use.

488
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:15,360
And how the lyrics to our songs might be child abuse.

489
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:19,200
But we don't care.

490
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:21,420
We're making lots of money.

491
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:23,060
But we don't care.

492
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:24,820
We're so much in demand.

493
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,860
But we don't care.

494
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,940
They're writing all about us.

495
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:32,560
Cause we're not just another stupid copy band.

496
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,260
A stupid copy band.

497
00:45:38,020 --> 00:45:40,360
Then a few years went by.

498
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,460
We tried and tried.

499
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,900
But we could never quite get no break.

500
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:45,260
By some executive.

501
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:45,980
We were.

502
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,800
It works for a record company.

503
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,460
Who wants to sign our stupid band.

504
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:54,040
Our stupid copy band.

505
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,280
Then we all sort of kind of went our separate ways.

506
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,460
A couple of guys got married and divorced.

507
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:07,160
And then we all kind of got some jobs we had to take.

508
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,800
So we could earn some gold.

509
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,500
Cause life is hard, you know.

510
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:15,660
Now we're 28.

511
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,540
years later

512
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,900
and we sit and we stare

513
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,480
at some stupid musicians

514
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:27,300
from our living room chair

515
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,300
taking millions of dollars

516
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,440
from their latest CD

517
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:38,780
and how we wish we could go back

518
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,040
just to play it for free

519
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,720
We can't go back

520
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,940
and play it like we used to

521
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,280
cause what we play

522
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,440
is no longer every man

523
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,160
We can't go back

524
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,320
and play it like we used to

525
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:57,400
cause no one wants to hear

526
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:58,880
our stupid copy band

527
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:02,480
our stupid copy band

528
00:47:04,460 --> 00:47:06,800
So I'm just sitting here

529
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:08,400
and kind of thinking that

530
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:10,480
with all of the crap they play

531
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,760
and call it music

532
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:12,020
I'm just sitting here

533
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:14,040
We might want to get together

534
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,760
just to have a jam

535
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:17,040
for one more time

536
00:47:18,660 --> 00:47:20,360
Like back in 69

537
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,180
But some of the guys got kids

538
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,580
and so they're kind of

539
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,980
sort of busy with their own lives

540
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,540
and working every week

541
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,680
but maybe they say

542
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,680
we'll have to get together

543
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,580
just for one more time

544
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,140
When they find the time

545
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,720
to Dr. Bizarro

546
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:04,800
to Dr. Trendler

547
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:04,800


548
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:04,800


549
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,060
Let's go

550
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:07,300
to Mr. Bizarro

551
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:07,440
and we'll find out

552
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,540
how I feel

553
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,260
listening to the investor

554
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:10,260


555
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:10,260


556
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:10,260


557
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:10,260


558
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:10,260


559
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:10,280
when I'm out there

560
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:10,960
Maverick

561
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:10,960


562
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:11,300
and he goes

563
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:11,300


564
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:16,520
and how the great Nenslo feels.

565
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,440
I've got some addresses here.

566
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:26,480
Dr. Bizarro, who did that song just then,

567
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:28,860
another stupid copy band,

568
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,180
can be reached at iBobDigital.

569
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,280
That's iBobDigital.

570
00:48:41,340 --> 00:48:45,100
At Post Office Box, yes, dear friends,

571
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:48,940
Post Office Box 3405.

572
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:54,900
3405 in beautiful Skokie, Illinois.

573
00:48:56,140 --> 00:49:00,260
That's S-K-O-K-I-E, Skokie, Illinois.

574
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,820
6-0-0-7-6.

575
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,840
iBobDigital, Box 3405.

576
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,900
6-0-0-7-6 in beautiful Skokie.

577
00:49:14,040 --> 00:49:20,560
And the lovely and yet somehow handsome

578
00:49:20,560 --> 00:49:24,260
Reverend Nenslo, well, saint, doctor,

579
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:28,200
no, nay, what, high E, no,

580
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,280
well, oh, oh, Nenslo,

581
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,860
with his long and yet,

582
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:41,400
ever so pertinent rant there.

583
00:49:43,420 --> 00:49:48,380
Yes, friends, I think you have something to learn

584
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:51,300
from Nenslo, most of you.

585
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:58,920
None of you have anything to learn from...

586
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,680
and...

587
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:05,120
I'm sorry, it's been a long evening.

588
00:50:05,620 --> 00:50:07,160
I've still got...

589
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,300
I've still got one more show to do before I can leave.

590
00:50:09,820 --> 00:50:14,140
And in the meantime, let's check back into

591
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:18,120
our good friend R. Stevie Moore,

592
00:50:18,460 --> 00:50:23,420
the legend of home taping and independent cassette distribution.

593
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:26,360
Really one of the first guys, if not,

594
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:30,760
well, no, not the first guy, but the first guy we ran into

595
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:35,540
that was doing that, and here he is doing...

596
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:37,400
that.

597
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,420
And you know, he's talking about the same damn thing.

598
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:47,780
It never stops, because you just keep stopping.

599
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,500
But that's okay.

600
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,660
You can wake up slow.

601
00:51:21,300 --> 00:51:21,620
No!

602
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:21,620


603
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:21,620


604
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:21,620


605
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:21,620


606
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:21,620


607
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:21,620


608
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:23,980
Yeah, just, I mean, why?

609
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:28,840
You could've just hidden those tapes and then...

610
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:29,000
Okay.

611
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,000


612
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:29,260
Okay, so...

613
00:51:57,980 --> 00:52:00,100
Don't wake me up

614
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:02,020
I would rather keep sleeping

615
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:04,060
Rather than look at you

616
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:06,380
Don't wake me up

617
00:52:06,380 --> 00:52:08,220
I would rather keep sleeping

618
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:10,160
Rather than talk to you

619
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:12,640
I need my hours and minutes

620
00:52:13,520 --> 00:52:15,800
This is my bed and I'm in it

621
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:18,680
I have enough problems alone

622
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,020
Just trying to avoid that morning yawn

623
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,980
Don't wake me up

624
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,760
I would rather keep sleeping

625
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,900
Rather than deal with you

626
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:31,140
Don't wake me up

627
00:52:31,140 --> 00:52:33,000
I would rather keep sleeping

628
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,200
Rather than living

629
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:36,360
I need my hours and minutes

630
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,040
Just trying to relax

631
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,300
But alarm clock people attack

632
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:43,540
I got enough duty to rest

633
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:46,760
Just trying to dream and snore the best

634
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:49,780
Don't wake me up

635
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:01,780
Horizontal hideaway

636
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:04,380
Lying down

637
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:05,960
Me lying down

638
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:08,140
My blanket above

639
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:11,360
I thank it with love

640
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,480
Don't wake me up

641
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:20,640
Don't wake me up

642
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:26,880
I need more pillow and sheet

643
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:30,820
Nine hours a night would be neat

644
00:53:30,820 --> 00:53:33,100
I have enough burden by day

645
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,080
Just trying to remember how to say

646
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:36,340
I have enough burden by day

647
00:53:36,360 --> 00:53:39,240
Don't wake me up

648
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,420
Don't wake me up

649
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:48,960
Don't wake me up

650
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:51,700
Do not disturb

651
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:55,240
Or maid make-up room early

652
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,320
Ah

653
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:01,500
Maid make-up room early

654
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,060
Do not disturb

655
00:54:04,660 --> 00:54:06,340
Or maid make-up room early

656
00:54:06,340 --> 00:54:08,220
Ah maid make-up room early

657
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,080
Ah maid make-up room early

658
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:17,300
Ah maid make-up room early

659
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:17,300


660
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:23,100
And when finally the old man stepped again onto his veranda atop the mountain of time,

661
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:27,840
his eyes were misted by the beauty which stretched before him,

662
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:32,760
and he no longer moved wearily down the mountain to pluck a bouquet for his table.

663
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,800
His step quickened, and his heart was lightened.

664
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,580
because there was now no longer the sameness of purple,

665
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:43,500
no longer the flowers that always looked alike and grew alike

666
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,460
and were of such a sameness.

667
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,420
Now there were differences,

668
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:51,560
which gave new beauty and a new strength to the valley.

669
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,780
Smiling and chattering gaily to himself,

670
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:58,100
he gently plucked a rainbow of color from the valley,

671
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:02,880
and as he left, the purple people looked at one another,

672
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:08,120
first in disbelief and finally in shame.

673
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:14,340
For they knew suddenly that in the old man's eyes they were all equal

674
00:55:14,340 --> 00:55:18,740
and that each flower, regardless of shape or size or color,

675
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,140
would find favor at his table.

676
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:26,120
And henceforth, in the shadow of the mountains of time and destiny,

677
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:29,920
it was no longer known as the valley of the purple people,

678
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,860
but as the land where brothers and sisters

679
00:55:32,860 --> 00:55:33,780
and motherhood began.

680
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:38,660
And its name was the human heart.

681
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:54,580
You're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

682

Got your pencil ready?

Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

686
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:16,120
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

687
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,060
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

688
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,700
Now I know it's not unusual

689
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:31,620
It's nothing so unique

690
00:56:31,620 --> 00:56:32,840
It's nothing so unique

691
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:32,840


692
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:32,840


693
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:32,840


694
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:32,840


695
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:36,320
There's probably hundreds of wonderful love affairs

696
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,140
That go bad in this town every week

697
00:56:40,140 --> 00:56:43,400
It's a big town, but all of them others

698
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,220
Them sad-hearted lovers

699
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:48,180
Could cry in their beer with the hay

700
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,580
It didn't concern me

701
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,420
It was none of my business

702
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:56,260
I never had nothing to say

703
00:56:57,440 --> 00:57:01,540
But suddenly, darling, the table has turned

704
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:02,820
You have left me here to die for you

705
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:03,340
My dear, my rhythm, my rhythm

706
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:03,340


707
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:03,340


708
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:03,340


709
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,320
For somebody, for somebody new

710
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:07,580
But the story's so long

711
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:13,160
For somebody, I raises their gaze

712
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:13,280
Where do you get their message?

713
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:20,660
They ain't complaining

714
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:22,720
I've got the tales bombs

715
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:23,200
I told them that they tag along

716
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,880
I got it all on me

717
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,100
I дulously

718
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,380
W Tory Had a sheik

719
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:27,380


720
00:57:27,380 --> 00:57:27,400
My life in in outer time

721
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:31,560
Goes for another check-up, I need أن

722
00:57:42,080 --> 00:57:42,140
Thank you.

723
00:58:27,780 --> 00:58:30,580
Thank you.

724
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,200
Thank you.

725
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:07,520
Thank you.

726
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:44,120
Thank you.

727
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:47,120
Thank you.

728
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:13,660
Thank you.

729
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:43,300
Ah, let me reiterate the disclaimer

730
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:47,500
that precedes each broadcast of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

731
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:52,920
Now, the opinions in here are my own opinions,

732
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:56,520
not the opinions of anyone connected with WREK Atlanta.

733
01:00:57,840 --> 01:01:00,940
See how dangerous an opinion can be?

734
01:01:01,780 --> 01:01:06,780
So form an opinion of your own and wield it like a lightsaber.

735
01:01:06,920 --> 01:01:10,160
And take it from me, they'll hate you for it.

736
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:15,060
If you'd like more information on Bob and the Church of the Subgenius,

737
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:18,320
free information, and you can't beat that,

738
01:01:19,300 --> 01:01:23,400
drop a stamped, self-addressed envelope to

739
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:24,960
Bob

740
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:27,780
