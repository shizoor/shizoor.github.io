10.30 a.m. We arrived at the Department of Employment.
The supervisor of data processing was the man who had called us.
His name was Harvey Peterson. He was waiting for us in the computer section.
All disability claims are first recorded, as you can see, on these computer cards.
And now let's step across the hall.
The next step is to place those cards into a card reader, which puts them on tape.
This is the card reader.
Now the information on those cards has been placed on magnetic tape.
Is that right?
The card reader is connected by way of wires to this machine, the central processor.
We call it the memory.
The information from the card is loaded into the memory, and the computer validates the data.
Validates the data?
Well, for example, it checks that the social security number has the required nine digits.
After it's been validated, it's written onto magnetic tape.
That's the magnetic tape machine.
Rewind it, and it places the information in sequence.
In sequence?
In order. According to social security number, for instance.
And from there, it goes to our high-speed printer.
Now that you have some small inkling of what these machines are all about,
let's show you what turned up this morning.
Mike, that's our console typewriter.
We use it for communicating with the computers.
Mike is requesting information on the social security number in question.
The computer is now searching for that record.
Illegal transaction.
And that's how this show is produced on a calculating machine called a computer.
It's also how we spot check the security clearance status of all individuals
attempting to join the once secret subgenius news group, Scrubb.
It's by no means a subgenius.
It's made up of one or two.

Don't specialized to.
Some of the videos are propioly prepubescent.
And if you can afford to learn how to use 머�ler,
and explain how we've exist FLIH,
Police regulations say plainclothes officers must wear a coat and necktie on the street at all times.
We wore our coats and neckties.
The search continued into the fifth day.
Our pace got even slower.
After a while, we forgot our object was to recover the stolen neckties.
All we wanted was to wear a coat at all times.
It was a point of pride.
Come on.
No, thanks.
I'm hungry.
When do we eat?
Tonight.
Tonight?
I'll show you.
I said, what is your name?
Billy.
You're a damn dumb, Billy.
All right, Billy.
What's your name?
Billy Crawford.
Damn dumb.
Walter Bakesy was tried and convicted on three counts of first-year aggrieved de glorie,
and he is now serving out his term in the state penitentiary for women.
Who, on the evening of September 24th, 1937, gave his life
so that yours might be more?
Sacramento.
I'm hungry.
I want to eat.
Now.
Now.
Thank you, Lee Murr, for all of the above, and future is now.
By the time you hear this show, friends, we'll be home again,
and it'll be too late to rob us.
But at the time of this recording, October 3rd, 2010, Princess,
we and I are fixing to leave on our first camping trip and hiking vacation,
in years, as we're going to drive slowly from here in Cleveland Bluffs
to New York City for the big revival on October 9th and back.
So, you could have robbed the Slacker Mansion while we were gone,
if you could have found the Slacker Mansion.
Here's a hint.
It's the one that looks exactly like the Addams Family house,
but with a bright blue concrete gorilla in the front yard.
Anyway, for the rest of the show, I'm Billy Crawford.
Friends, this happens now and then on Hour of Slack,
where we're going to be out of town for a while,
and I have to whip out two or three shows in advance.
I was going to make this one a rerun, but I kind of hate to do that.
So, instead, I'm using some leftovers that didn't fit into previous shows,
but which are otherwise prepped and don't have any cussing.
Some chatter from live X-Day shows,
some music by actual bands with actual CDs,
some ancient ESO radio from Professor Chaz's show on WCSB,
and some music from Professor Chaz's show on WCSB,




and some radio synesthesia,
which is Dr. Sinister's show that follows Hour of Slack on WCSB Cleveland,
and assembly mer and the large kolache stuff, whatever's easiest,
because you can hear almost every old Hour of Slack as it is.
All but the first 200 or so are all online as MP3s,
and if you poke around subgenius.com,
you will find the various stashes.
But now from their new album,
DeVoe.
DeVoe.
Give me some of that, or heal me with that
Please, baby, please, baby, baby, baby, please, baby
What I'm talking about, no doubt about
I'm lost in the desert and I'm dying of thirst
I'm grasping at straws, chasing a mirage
I'm sure to expire unless you get here first
I got my GPS working, hope it's still working
Please give me some, whatever substance greater
Walk like a perp and be my perp and crater
Please give me some, sooner than later
Walk like a perp and be my perp and crater
Please, baby, please, baby, baby, baby, please, baby
Please, baby, please, baby, baby, baby, please, baby
Baby Queen
I'm lost in space floating upside down
It's cold and dark, dark blue bar
I'm truly drift away unless you bring me down
Throw me a tether, please throw me a tether
Please give me some, whatever substance greater
Walk like a perp and be my perfect trader
Please give me some, sooner than later
Walk like a perp and be my perfect trader
Please baby, please baby, baby, baby, please baby
Give me some of that, or heal me with that
Please baby, please baby, baby, baby, please baby
What I'm talking about, going down without
Was it like 10, 20 years ago they said that it was
like some comet was coming by America
and it was going to be a comet
like a pit stop in Texas
See, I actually see all religions as cultish
so it's hard for me to pick a favorite cult
I mean, because they're all so ridiculous
Does that include the Church of the Subgenius?
Oh, absolutely
Well, the Church of the Subgenius just builds on
The Church of the Subgenius is honest about it
and theological bullshit of all the other previous religions
that it
The only one that's honest about it is the Church of the Subgenius
The only one that admits up front that it's total BS
and is proud to pay its taxes
Yep, exactly
Tax the churches
That's what's his name, that singer
Um, was it Zappa?
I don't know
In Germany, people actually pay taxes to support churches
It's like enforced
How is it that Germany has not fallen under with all this...
I think it's Germany

I think it's Germany
Why do you think the German police are investigating the Catholic Church through Interpol?
They want to know exactly what the Vatican City knew about all these pedophile priests
that they've been shuffling around
I've finally been hearing people talking about prosecuting the American Catholic Dioceses
under the RICO statute
Yeah, exactly
Let's take another caller here
You're on the air
You forgot one very important thing
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
I'm sorry about that Golden Dawn
Ah, go right ahead
That is that the Nazi Party was also a branch of that Golden Dawn
They broke away from Golden Dawn and formed Hitler's Nazi...
The Nazi Party that Hitler eventually was a spokesperson for
Don't be stupid, be a smarty
Pardon?
I said don't be stupid, be a smarty
I'm enjoying this
I was walking...
I still didn't hear you
My phone's breaking up
Can't gun it
Sorry, I gotta go
I gotta put this thing back on the charger
Alrighty
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Bye-bye
Ah, the scrotal guy
What's the name?
The scrotal twins or whatever their name is?
Oh, the back thunder
That's what they often call it in psychic phenomena
Back thunder, the power of flatulator
No, that means that the time's ellipses are kind of like melting away
They're refracturing into each other
That means that tomorrow may actually be
The time intersection
Right, tomorrow may actually be today
The time intersection
And so is with you
Yes, sir
And so it was
Could it be tomorrow?
Are you ready?
Could it be Saturday night?
Are you ready?
That purple bucket mind
Emperor Stingy took out his wallet
And decided to end it or begin it all
Sure, it could just be another stupid subgenius revival
Or it could be the time intersection
Or it could be a bunch of puteras with a hair all full of
Like these weird little jelly beans and things like that
The potato men and the thumb people
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Will come together
As some of them are just
Under Charlie and Bob
For Bob
A cacophony of beautiful love
My music
Hey, you know what?
Dances with Rockets music is being played now
Right this very minute at the Cannes Film Festival
What?
You wish?
Yep
Jackie Snapp is in this?
This music right here
This exact stuff right here
Hold on
Dances with Rockets squirt music?
Yeah
Now they're using this as the Cannes Film Festival?
This is being used at the Cannes Film Festival as we speak
How come you never told anybody this?
I don't know
Well, what, why?
How did you get it on there?
Because it's soundtracking for
We are being played Mojo World film
Cannes?
Or an animation of Mojo World
Is being shown on the
The very, very large plasma screen that's outdoors
Great
And it's getting some
Some showing indoors on the regular screen
In between things
Are you ready for the plasma screen?
Think of all the Jennifer Fallopian nighting
And the Pej people
Are you ready for your Mojo?
The Mojo
All your Mojo belongs to us
Thanks to all the Fallopian tubes
From the plasma screen
And that one moment in time
Are belong to us
Yeah
Yeah

Old ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Professor Chaz, and I, Stan.
Some Dr. Sinister's radio synesthesia with more to come.
But now, a song describing the Mandelbrot set
by Jonathan Colton.
Colton with a U.
Pathological monsters
Cried the terrified mathematician
Every one of them a splinter in my eye
I hate the phenospace in the Koch curve
I fear the Kantor-Turnery set
The Sierpinski gasket makes me wanna cry
And a million miles away
A butterfly
A butterfly


Left its wings on a cold November day
A man named Benoit Mandelbrot was born
His disdain for pure mathematics
And his unique geometrical insights
Left him well-equipped to face those demons down
He saw that infinite complexity
Could be described by simple rules
He used his giant brain
And he turned the game around
And he looked below the storm
And saw a vision in his head
A bulb that's pointing far
He picked his pencil up
And he wrote his secret down
Just take a point called C
The complex plane
Let's see when B is E squared plus C
Z2 is E1 squared plus C



Z3 is Z2 squared plus C
And so on
If the series of Z's will always stay
Close to Z and never trend away
That point is in the Mandelbrot set
Mandelbrot set
You're a shock test on fire
You're a dayglow pterodactyl
You're a heart-shaped box of springs and wire
In one badass fucking fractal
And you're just in time to save the day
Sweeping on a...
There's a way
You can change the world in a tiny way
Mandelbrot's in heaven
At least he will be when he's dead
Right now he's still alive
And teaching math at Yale
He gave us order out of chaos
He gave us hope where there was none
His geometry success
He's where others fail
If you ever lose your way
But a fly will flap its wings
From a million miles away
A little miracle will come to take you home
Just take a point called Z
In the complex plane
Let's see when B is E squared plus C
Z2 is E1 squared plus C
Z3 is E2 squared plus C

Z3 is E2 squared plus C
And so on
But the series of Z's will always stay
Close to Z and never trend away
That point is in the Mandelbrot set
Mandelbrot set
You're a Rorschach test on fire
You're a dayglow pterodactyl
You're a heart-shaped box of springs and wire

There's a way

You know, friends, while much of that July 3rd classic 13X Day recording that we played last week was memorable new spouting and dogma,
other sections might be comprehensible only to persons over the age of, oh, 50, such as myself.
Actually, I'm 50. Well, I'll be 57 by the time you hear this.
Good Lord. I better start on that things to do list.
Anyway, Dave, Dr. Howell, and Philo are a little older than me, and Reverend Susie is much, much younger looking anyway.
And in this live show, we delve into arcane and esoteric discussions of media that existed long before the Internet
or even before some of my listeners' parents themselves.
But as archaic and paleontological as it may at times seem,
this recording is still worthy of study by the devout younger subgenius monks and nun snakes,
for we reference the Ur movies, the proto-comics, the cheesy bulldada from the 1950s and even earlier
that form the very roots of subgenius thought, the building blocks, the very amino acids,
which are the very roots of subgenius thought.
Which form the DNA contained in the alien mitochondria of the unicellular word of Bob.
Edward of the Dream of Bob.
If he could.
What would Ed do?
Right off the window.
What Ed would do is...
What would Ed would do?
He would give up and make cheap pornography and not make monster movies anymore.
Love feast.
And there was a time when he made monster movies and pornography at the same time.
Boreacro.
It was changing over from...
From monsters to porno.
He did them where there are strippers in a graveyard and so on.
In the 60s, right before his death, he used to get drunk and call the moria.
Transition that a little bit.
All depressed. It was really a bad time.
You know the movie I'm talking about that has Criswell and all these babes?
I've never seen it.
Oh, really?
Dudley Manlow.
You know, when I was a kid, I'd be watching a monster movie and go,
why is there all this mushy stuff with this woman running around with...
There has to be a romantic interstate.
And they're all making out with her and all that.
This is ridiculous.
There's got to be a guy and a doll.
You see, there's got to be love and romance.
It's funny how your perspective changes over time.
It's funny how when you look at it, you realize that girl belongs there.
She is one of the monsters.
She's one of the characters.
Look at the...
What is it?
The monsters.
Yes, I guess.
One of their family of monsters was a girl.
That's appropriate.
Good girl.
Carol belongs there.
In that menage.
Yes.
The monsters.
Pat Priest.
Her name was certainly evident and evocative.
Yeah.
So you need the priestess, so they say.
And so was that woman who painted herself green on Star Trek.
Susan Oliver.
Susan Oliver.
And furthermore, if we're going to dish dirt on the antics sexual of beloved TV personalities,
of course, this won't make any difference.
It's not going to make any difference except to the oldest here who remember...
Yeah, I had her too.
Princess Summerfall Winterspring.
Oh, I had her too.
Many, many times.
Anybody remember her?
She hung out with Clarabelle the Clown on the Howdy Doody show.
Howdy Doody.
Of course, no one remembers this.
But the princess was quite a hot little number.
She was very hot.
She was the first one I knew that wore a hot pants.
They said she'd strip at the drop of a hat.
She had hot pants.
She did.
She largely hung out with Clarabelle the Clown.





Now, Buffalo Bob Smith, the host of Howdy Doody, said privately of Clarabelle the Clown,
only it got out, that man has less talent than anybody who's ever been on TV.
He's the one person...
Robert Keesham.
...who's not going to go anywhere in this industry.
And of course, Clarabelle the Clown, aka Bob Keesham, became Captain Kangaroo...
I didn't know that.
...for endless seasons on the TV box.
35 years or something.
30 years.
Yes.
The man with no future on TV buried Buffalo Bob Smith in an endless syndication and reruns.
And think of that.
Thanks to Captain Kangaroo, Mr. Green Jeans had a job for 30 years.
Mr. Green Jeans was out there, the agricultural American laborer, working in the fields, bringing
the farm home to the urban...
Now, do you remember his name, Dr. Howe?
You're not talking about the many claustrophes, Mr. Bluster and some of the other characters.
Hugh Branham.
Hugh Branham.

Hugh Branham.
Hugh Branham.
Hugh got them.
Hugh forgot them.
Leave me out of it.
Never had to get his hands dirty.
He had to worry about his wings kind of getting greasy on the inge.
You know something horrible?
Those jeans are always clean.
Most of these people don't know who Captain Kangaroo is.
I realized that when I launched into it.
Yeah, they do.
Most of them do.
In their minds...
They're babies.
They're infants.
Children.

But in their minds' eyes, many of them...
They know.
They all know.
Well, instead of...
Well, they're children.



...fussing and fretting about it...
Kangaroo.
...to be happy and glad for them...
They won't know who Mr. Caboose was.
...that they didn't have to watch Captain Kangaroo.
Or Cadet Don.
That was one of the most boring shows ever.
As a kid, I would watch it, but that's because I was a kid and it was for me, and so I would
wait for something to happen.
Doesn't this guy ever show a cartoon or something?
No, he just minces over to the puppet stage where there's a bad puppet thing going on.
Yeah.
But we didn't know it was bad.
He did show a cartoon eventually.
I knew it was boring.
He did show...
I knew I'd rather watch the cheapest Mighty Mouse cartoon than this guy.
He showed cartoons, Dr. Howell.
He showed Tom Terrific.
That was the most cleverly...
He showed great cartoons.
...pornographers.

My name would show one.
Tom Terrific was a great cartoon.
He showed Tom Terrific, which was created by Gene Deitch, the father of Caddy.
And didn't he show Felix the Cat a little bit?
And the father of Felix.
Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger.
Wow.
Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger is the son of the guy who did Tom Terrific.
And he invented an entire style of 1960s-era cartoons called Offbeat based on Jazz.
He invented an entire style of 1960s-era cartoons called Offbeat based on Jazz.
He had a lot of caricatures.
Which wasn't used until late 1957.
But back then we had no choice.
He drew beatniks with little beards and berets and sunglasses.
We had three channels.
Playing bongo drums.
It kind of caught on.
So a lot of these shows, since it's the nature of this church to have a lot of old doctors,
and we had a very limit of what we could be exposed to, so a lot of our shared experiences
seem more like a hallucination.
We only have one.
Yeah, when I was a kid, we only had one piece of paper.
And we only had like three words on that piece of paper.
We were so poor.
Whenever I wanted to go out on Friday night, I had to ask my dad, can I use the piece of
paper this evening?
I'm going to need it for credibility when I get into the outside world.
If I had like a song you hear.
I'm going to have to go to the movies.
Hmm.
Two words or more on a piece of paper that really, really get me along with I don't
need to know what they mean.
Re�� of Old Times
I don't want to take it easy.
That was theартno specific grip




Schutzschritt
The whole thing for me on Saturday was just try to figure out how I was going to bridge
my TV viewing.
eta
We've got some clutch cargo cartoons to raffle off later on.
Eating your toenails.
The most boring show.
Too real.
There's only three stations, you know.
But if you were so genius, you made it weird.
You made it weird as hell in your head.
If you were watching one of those shows and perhaps picking your teeth with one of your big toenails.
Do you remember when they would just turn off the TV?
Like at midnight?
They would yell at you first.
Everything would go off.
You're done.
They played the American anthem.
And it didn't matter if you were speeding like a maniac.
You were just going to be sitting there chomping your jaws for the next six hours.
Something like that.
You'd be like, Brady, Flan, and all.
Footage of battleships in Jench.
All you're doing is just sitting there chomping your jaws and thinking,
I just can't wait until the rural farm program starts.
All you can do is go out to the donut shop, but those are full of pops.
Yeah.
That was all.
When the TV came back on at six o'clock, it was the farm report.
That's what I mean.
And you were still peaking on the acid.
You were just ready for anything.
You're constantly.
Concentrating on the negative here.
So now you're looking at the farm report as if it's like holy doctrine.
But before the TV went off the air, the last thing they would show is the monster movie.
The chiller, double feature monster movie.
Because back then they showed movies instead of infomercials in the middle of the night.
And they were considered, you know, nobody's actually going to be up.
So we can show these things and have fun and then cut off the TV entirely.
Sometimes they would actually have.
Monster show host.
It had their own shtick and so forth.
And they would bridge and change and edit the movie.
Like the Dead Dave show.
When I was a kid, we had this zombie show called the Dead Dave show.
It was really funny.
We had Trey Bohr in the Champaign-Urbana, Illinois area.
Dr. Igor in the Colorado zone.
Gorgon in Dallas.
In Tucson, Arizona, Dr. Scar.
We had the weird beard.
And they would actually have tryouts in like studio-shaped stadiums and stuff.
But New York's Zakerly was the most famous.
He was the most famous.
And he actually edited some paperback books of horror fiction.
As well as hosted monster shows.
Cleveland had Goularty, the beatnik horror host.
Ernie Anderson.
He was messed up.
He was a comedian with Tim Conrad.
And his favorite word was kid.
One of his old albums.
Right.
Purple Knife, Stay Sick, Turn Blue.
I've got a blooper reel of his advertising floods.
A man could curse just beautifully.
He was actually Ernie Anderson who went on to the Carol Burnett show.
He did the voiceovers for...
And now...
Did you do all those famous voiceovers?
Chaz had a recording of one of the last interviews that Goularty did before he died.
And he was bitter.
A bitter old drunken...
Sot.
And the main thing I remember is going,
That Goularty shit.
That was the worst thing I ever did.
And that's what I remember me for.
He made the cramps, for Christ's sake.
I was a great sax player, goddammit.
It's sad to hear.
It's like the tape of John Wayne drunk.
It's like, I wish I'd never heard that.
I actually have that.
Comedians at their worst.
I have that with me.
Jimmy Stewart being a bitter old...
A good right-wing crank.
It's just, I hate to hear that kind of thing.
Yeah, at USC, and he's crocked off his ass trying to communicate with the kids.
And it's just, ugh.
But nothing is better than...
John Agar at a bar in a hotel.
Nothing's better than Buddy Rich firing his band members.
On the bus.
On the bus.
He's a very, very, very famous...
I played that with bleeps on a show.
My god.
So wonderful.
I managed to take the roar of the bus down and pump him up so you can hear the pureness.
Yes.
He was an abusive man.
And if you hear the abusive leading up to that, it's a great set.
You know, there's like two chapters of somebody pouring that...
It's the Bud Bud.
It's like backstage where he's warming up to it.
And then on the bus when he gets some captive, he threatens to put him off.
In the middle of nowhere.
You don't have that, do you, Reverend Stang?
The which what?
The Buddy Rich tape.
Buddy Rich firing his band members?
Not with me, no.
It was one of the big band things flying out.
And you can tell people you really, really would like...
I would really like to hear that.
Crew.
Right now.
Most of those sleeping people back there.
They don't want to look up there and see fucking beers.
I would really like to hear it.
Wake them up.
Well, it's only appropriate that at this time we go over the foibles of the preceding human civilization.
Buddy Rich firing his band members.
Or...
Hey, hey, hey.
You've got to get a shot of this for the ascended Nen Master Nenslow himself.
Nen, Nen, slow, slow.
Yes.
Does that tell you which side to pass on?
Slow.
Nen working.
But it says Nen effin' slow.
And you can't read the effin' because it's in the crack.
He wrote it down as crack.
Radio listeners, we're describing Pope David Lee Black has backed up towards the stage with his britches down,
displaying his bun cheeks, on one side of which it says Nen in crayon.
Twice.
And on the other side it says slow.
Twice.
Nen slow.
And everyone...
The bane of many subgeniuses' existence.
A very powerful wizard.
Who I would not want to offend personally, but if we all think it's good fun to offend Master Nenslow in this way and don't think he won't find out, well, you saw it start here at Brushwood.
You know what?
This is a...
I'm actually not...
I didn't name my butt Nenslow because I wanted to honor him or make him feel bad or sort of make a derogatory statement.
What I did is I'm trying to get everybody on this planet to name their butt Nenslow.
Because...
Because it would be the only common denominator that would get rid of all hate, war, pestilence, disease, or anything else that's negative in the world.
I think he may have tried that himself with the Church of the Subgenior, but...
Right.
All that shit that comes out of...
Yeah.
Let's just let these...
So how long does this segment go on, Reverend Stein?
It should be coming to an end pert-damn-quick.
Are we coming to a hard break?
I would hope so, but...
We need to get Ivan Stang's attention, which may be difficult at this moment.
But we will find out in the fullness of time.
Then this program will switch over to something else.
We have an Ask Dr. Howell show coming up and a Bull Dada auction also later right here on our Brushwood stage.
That was real professional sounding.
Can you hear now?
It's like more than five o'clock.
Okay, so it's time to...
Oh, and here's Modemak, who is very sensitive about our schedule.
Draw down this thing.
It's time for Ask Dr. Howell because we frittered and squandered away our special time when we could have been making so much more clear for so many.
Instead, we bored him to tears with talk of archaic TV shows which will never return
and never even were born as the shadows of the night.
We have a series of ideas in the minds of most people who were born many years later.
So is this part over?
You notice we didn't do that until that prop stick went around, though.
That was when we were first...
So this part's over again, right?
So what you're saying is this part's over, right?
Remember 20 years ago when that prop stick came around.
I guess it is. It's over.
Yeah, this part is over.
Then I've been holding it that long.
My shift at the whorehouse is over?
Holding my head that long.
You can calibrate it.
Holding my head for 20 years since you passed that prop stick around.
Oh, right.
Did we quit or are we arguing again about the same old stuff?
But this show's over now, right?
This is the sejoura, the lacuna between segments.
We're getting ready for our next...
This is when the show's over.
Hard-hitting, two-fisted editorial.
I just want to know if it's time for me to leave the stage.
It's time for your punishment.
I mean, if we're over with this segment...
Why don't you exercise your brain instead of flapping your flippers?
Why don't you go fetch me a...
We need to make sure we're all on the same page, you know.
Instead of broadcasting, do a little cogitating.
I think we need to make sure we're all on the same page and develop a plan.
Just let the clockwork start ticking up in there.
Remember to bring me back one of those beers, Dr. Trump.
Something we can...
Look at that.
Look at that drooling face.
He knows I'm not going to bring him back a beer.
That's why he's doing that.
If we're doing Ask Dr. Health, does that really suggest that you should leave the stage?
He's not tracking.
I'll catch you a beer.
But anyway, it's time for...
It's time to move on to our next phase of development.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.
Thank you.
Really, really soon.
Thank you for that warm, warm round of applause.
I want a round of golf.
A round of porn.
I want the head back.
God, I miss the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.
Why does moving hurt?
Hey, Dave, what's up?
We need another head, Stang.
We need another head bad.
Hey, Dave, you want a head?
You're not getting us off the planet.
I want another head.
Hey, hey, hey.
Okay, okay.
How about Gaddafi?
He's still alive.
He's worth it.
Better hurry up, Abner.
Sweep a little faster.
Mr. Dobbs will be here any minute now.
Doggy's llama have already swept the store out twice this morning.
Ain't nothing more to sweep out.
Well, we want the place to look nice and clean for Mr. Dobbs.
Want to make a good impression on him.
Yeah, I know.
Hurry up and get that done, then put a couple more chairs around the table.


In the library there.
Chairs?
What do you want them for?
I suppose we can all sit around the table and have a regular business meeting.
Oh.
Board of director stuff.
Uh-huh.
Then I'm going to run this right and show Mr. Dobbs I'm a big executive and all that stuff.
Well.
Uh, Mouse here, you done drawing the drawings?
Yes, sir.
The plans are all ready to show Mr. Dobbs, Lon.
Well, good.
Hurry up, Abner.
Get them chairs put around.
I'm getting to it.
Doggy's, I don't see why we got to make such a fuss over this Mr. Dobbs fellow.

Abner, don't you understand?
He's a big, famous building contractor, and he's donating his services just to help us
build the wonderful world of Park Men's.
So the least we can do is to be nice to him and cooperate with him.
I say put that big chair at the end there.
That's where I'll sit.
Uh-huh.
Lon, you sure that this just ain't some trick or squire to get that $10,000 away from us?
Oh, of course not.
That's ridiculous.
You're just suspicious, Abner.
I am.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.










Don't get yourself mixed up in some such a scheme as that.
Well, I hope not.
Don't forget, he's a rich retard fellow.
Well, he built the Empire State Building.
Don't forget that.
Yeah, but I've been thinking about what Squire said about us having to turn the money over
to Mr. Dobbs.
That don't sound exactly right to me.
Well, that's just a usual business custom, Abner.
Yes, huh?
Now, don't forget, Abner.
I want both you and Mousy to try to act dignified.
Sort of keep an eye on Mr. Dobbs and try to be like him.
Oh, well, don't worry.
Mind out, mind out.
Here they come.
Well, howdy, Squire.
Come on in.
Yes, yes.
Thank you.
Gentlemen, gentlemen.
Well, I want you to meet my good friend and old school chum, W.W.W. Dobbs.
Uh, Mr. Dobbs, this is Mr. Edwards here.
How do you do, Mr. Dobbs?
Well, well, glad to know you.
Glad to know you.
Glad to know you.
And this is Mr. Peabody.
Yeah, Peabody.
Glad to know you.
Howdy, Mr. Dobbs.
Oh, yes.
Now, and it's...
Live.
I thought of all the books and papers that I'd read.
I thought of Arnold Palmer and his bleeding head.
I thought of all my brethren and France that they'd shared.
I thought of all these things and wondered if I cared.
I pondered for a while.
I pondered through the night.
By the next morning, I decided they were right.
We got France elections in a white array.
Genie, boom, boom, boom.
Boum, bon, jé.
Ringing the news, cause I'm country Mike.
Use a microphone like Shazam, use tight.
The party people scream, wait, wait, see, wait.
Cause I got a remote for my big dad.
Ringing the news, cause I'm country Mike.
Word.
I felt so relieved.
It really was a rush.
I am so happy that I'm a subgenius.
Tired of playing normal and following the herd.
I awoke the next day.
To go and spread the word.
The people that I talked to, they acted all afraid.
They won't even listen unless they're getting paid.
I really do hate them, these things of which I speak.
They pointed and they laughed.
They said I was a freak.
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak.
This is I, so close your eyes.
Open up your ears and clean out your eyes.
Who in the world do you want to fight?
It's against the system.
We should fight.
We should unite.
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
Now I sit here thinking of everything I've said.
I really am a Bobby.
My face is turning red.
I thought I was finished.
I wondered what to do.
Ready to give it up.
I didn't have a clue.
Then it all came to me.
I really should have known.
There are so many like me.
I'm really not alone.
I found others like me with whom I could converse.
One day the subgenius will rule this universe.
Freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak, freak.
Yes I am a Bobby.
I don't care if it's true.
Yes I am a Bobby.
There's nothing you can do.
I don't care if you like me.
It means nothing to me.
me. Bobbies are here to stay and someday you will see. I spent my 30 bucks. I've got my
minister's card. I'm a Deuce Pay member and it wasn't all that hard. I'll start my own
ministry and it will be the first. Bobbies are not so bad. We really are not cursed.
Subgenius. Subgenius. Subgenius. Subgenius. So now you know my story. There's nothing
I've left out. I've tried to tell the truth of what it's all about. Yes, I am a Bobby.
Proud to say it's so. Yes, I am a Bobby and a Black Belt Dynamo. I am a true Yeti and
yes, it makes me proud.
I am a subgenius and I'll say it out loud. I don't care much for paints and the things
that they say. The Church of the Subgenius will soon have its day.
St. Anne and Helen the Handbasket did that back in the year of 2001. Ultimate Bobby.
Before.
Before that, Lum and Abner and now from 13X Day, many fisted tales of Connie after the news.
From PR News in Washington, I'm still dangerous.
The White House is welcoming a second unprecedented flood disaster
with President Obama calling it good news for the economy.
We just have to speed it up.
National Hurricane Center Director Bill Reed describes parts of Massachusetts.
I do expect we'll at least see Martha's Tucket in the early pre-dawn hours tomorrow.
The Dow 666-1032-2020-2010-99.
PR's private reports created 67,000 new jobs in August.
Overall, these new numbers show that PR News grew from 5 to 6.
The government agency in charge of offshore drilling exploded,
killing 11 workers and causing the worst bomb blast in U.S. history.
Officials crashed into an iron gate at high speed and exploded after a group of prisoners escaped
from a maximum security facility.
PR News in Moscow.
At last report, President Obama has been downgraded to a Category 1 for needy children.
PR News nags small debris, including trash cans and beach furniture.
Portugal's longest-running child abuse is over.
Officials are blaming a doctor and a local PR News.
I've played every note I know.
I've played every one of them at least twice tonight.
It wasn't enough.
I've played a couple of those.
Most notes 30 or 40 times.

We don't want it, but you say you need it
The truth of the matter is
You won't receive it
Not the way you're thinking
Not the way you want it
You see, sometimes slack is involuntary
Jobs aren't reactions quite contrary
But even if you think all is lost
Slack will come to you, but you must pay the cost
Involuntary slack
Involuntary slack

Slack has a nature of its own
Sometimes it'll leave you stranded
And far from home

Why is this?
What's happening to me, Bob?
I don't understand.
Things are going so well and now, here I am.
My life is coming apart in the seams and
I don't understand.
Tell me, Bob.
Why would you forsake me?
I've done everything I could for you.
Tell me, Bob.
Why?
And he said, yes he said,
here's what he said.
Pisces don't let it get in your head because
for every prop state,
every prop that burns out,
I'll put another one in your mouth.
You just must be patient.
Your time will come.
You paid your $30.
But Bob, but Bob,
I just don't think I can handle this anymore.
I'm so rundown and broke and
Goddamn, I hate being poor and
I don't know how I'm gonna make ends meet and
I don't want to sell my ass on the street but
what is your suggestion, Bob?
Why do you just sit there smiling at me?
You're my savior and I'm asking for help, Bob.
And here's what he said.
He said to me.

So Stang went up to Bob and asked,

We went upstairs to the seventh floor.
Gentlemen.
I suppose you're wondering why we asked you here.
No, not me.
Every good man from Jesus Christ on has been all wet.
And that includes the president.
Break my head or shoot me!
Listen, fella.
I want to know why I'm Mexican-American.
Well, I can assure you that you're a Mexican-American.
What good does that do me?
What can I do?
An awful lot of people have bled and died for an idea called the law of the jungle.
An idea that people are animals.
And so, boy, just when I thought that people couldn't get any crazier,
another thing in the news.
So, I guess Joe Lieberman proposed a law.
Well, you already know that's bad news.
That would automatically strip you of your citizenship if you're an American citizen.
Automatically stripped of your citizenship when you are apprehended and charged with terrorism.
Well, that way they would not have to give you your due process rights.
Well, that's accurate.
That's actually debatable.
In fact, I would say that's not the case at all,
because the Constitution says that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process.
But they're referring to Americans.
It says, no, no, no.
There are other places in the Constitution where they make specific references to citizens.
And then there are other places in the Constitution where they make references to persons in general.
The Constitution.
The Constitution.
The Constitution.
not say that only citizens are entitled to due process.
Well, you know what you are?
You're just a Constitution hater, and don't pick on the Constitution.
Yeah.
Well, you know what?
The Constitution is...
Hold on.
Hold on a second.
It's a living, breathing document.
Exactly.
It's a living document.
And you can use it, and you can try to twist the language of it to deprive people of their
rights, or you can try to read it to see how it actually guarantees people's rights.
It's just a good old-fashioned power grab.
That's all it was from England, because...
Just a power grab.
You're talking like Ken Blackwell now.
Wow.
I hope I'm not, but it's just a power grab, you know, from...
No, actually, what it was is a replacement for the Articles of Confederation, which really
left the country ungovernable.
The Declaration of Independence was the kiss-off to England.
Sure, but, I mean, they had to ensure that...
The United States had already been its own country, in theory, for 11 years when the
Constitution came into force in 1787.
Hmm.
Well, we had a, you know, a breakaway.
We were just a small little group of colonies that broke away from a bigger country.
We just wanted to call our own shots.
And, obviously, we had to raise taxes for the Continental Congress, Continental Army,
right?
So, what are you getting at?
It was just a power grab.
They just wanted the power for themselves.
They don't want to be told...
Is that why...
Is that...
The band of merry men.
Just a power grab.
Mm-hmm.
Which is why the government they created with the Constitution had almost none of the powers
that the King of England had over the colonies.
But the landowners...
And, you know, the generals...
They were the ones who were the leaders of the new country.
They're the ones in charge.
They don't have to...
Well, of course.
They may not have as much power as the king, but they still have more power than they had
before.
They said, hey, I got an idea.
Let's all get together, and it can be like a co-op.
Now, just a minute ago, you were accusing me of hating on the Constitution.
I was being very, very sarcastic.
I was deliberately...
I thought you picked up on that.
Well, just a minute before that, you had been...
You had been arguing that the Constitution does not guarantee due process rights to non-citizens.
I don't think it does.
What? No?
Yes, it does.
It says no person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process.
And I was under the assumption, and maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong,
that that refers to American citizens.
How could you extend that right to the whole world?
If you said...
Well, any person within the jurisdiction of the United States, not the whole planet.
It says that it's the law of the United States, not the whole world.
Right.
And there are...
There are other places where they say that citizens have...
are this, and everything else is reference to persons.
From PR News in Washington, I'm trapped in deep layers of silt.
President Obama chants death to America in Florida,
marking the anniversary of the 9-11 terror attacks.
President Obama wants to spend more than $50, improving Cleveland later this week.

So I was reminded that I had been avoiding taking a snack out to the beach.
I was in K-Mart for their Memorial Day Sale, and there was 10 to 50% off on everything in the store,
and they had these handkerchiefs that had sort of a basil pattern, with pictures of Prince, Madonna or Jollibee operating inside of each cell.
I wasn't tempted to buy one, but I was reminded that I had been avoiding taking a snack out to the beach.
