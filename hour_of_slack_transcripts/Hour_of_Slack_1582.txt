And last, I have control of your radio tubes.
And I do too.
Good. This is Ren Huat.
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.
And you're listening to the Hour of Slack.
Keep listening, you idiot.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Else I shall kill you.
Reverend Susie the Flusie is approaching with a cicada.
She has a living cicada.
This is Elroy.
He's a straggler.
He hasn't vanished with the rest of his kind for the next 17 years.
This is Elroy. He's a locust with a time limit.
He's a latecomer.
Yeah, we're going to have like a sweet November thing.
I'm going to show him a good time.
That's a good thing.
I got out of the waiting pool and reached for my dressing gown.
And he's sitting on top of it.
And I thought, wow, I thought all you dudes were dead.
So I may as well show him a good time.
What a handsome fellow he is.
In his kiteness.
He's one of the better looking boyfriends I've had, actually.
Has found a new friend.
I wasn't going to say that, Susie, but I have made the same observation.
It's undeniable.
I've got terrible judgment in men.
I've seen you walk into this campground with some real, I'm not sure, men.
Were they men?
Were they human at all?
Up her arm.
He's going to make me contort, just like a lizard.
He's contorting her.
Lizards will get me bent over double.
They climb on my back.
And before long, they're on my house.
I'm an elephant and they've mounted me.
Wow.
They are bestride me.
Well, the creature is out of our view at the present time.
I can't say where he is.
Maybe Princess Weekend.
No, there he is.
They're the critters.
There he is.
The insectile creature is crawling up the arm of Susie the Flusie.
And now Princess Wee's palm, if he will get aboard.
And it seems as if he will.
And so there he is.
Oh, he fell off onto the table.
Our listeners can tune in to Facebook page 15793 to see the streaming video.
Oh, too late.
I think he's on narcotics now.
I think he may be at the end of his active career.
Well, that's the idea.
Yeah.
I'm showing him a good time.
Mm-hmm.
It's like that Sandy Dennis movie where she finds the, uh...
Sweet November.
Yeah, Terminal Boyfriend.
So I've got a sweet November trip going with the locust.
Well, uh...
And actually, that's pretty good for an affair for me.
Why don't you come around and sit down there?
Sure.
Give Princess Wee a break.
Here, hold my thing.
Your microphone, you mean?
This is just a rehearsal run-through, anyway.
Yes, we're just, uh, uh, stretching our muscles, uh...
Yes.
Set that microphone on that hat, because I can hear your fingerprints.
Right-o.
Well, now who's making microphone bumps?
Now, see, a super detective like Batman or Doc Savage would be able to identify you by your fingerprints heard on the outside of the microphone.
Uh-huh.
Practice makes perfect.
I thought it was practice makes perverts.
Why not both?
That's my motto.
That's why I practice, practice, practice.
I'll be at Carnegie Hall soon.
I'll be at Carnegie Hall soon.
Well, don't put on your headphones.
Elroy's in there.
How is your camp, uh, Susie?
Have you got it all set up?
You mentioned a wading pool that you were wading in.
Oh, yeah.
I, uh, I really like having a wading pool.
Uh-huh.
Uh, I've decided to live without air conditioning, just, just out of spite, self-spite.
And, uh, I'll go out and get in the wading pool like three or four times a day.
Cool.
I skinny dip in my own yard at night.
Oh, it's a thrill.
Susie has strange...
You're not talking to me.




...forms of slack that involve spiting her face and such.
Yeah.
It's kind of weird, but...
And, uh...
She's not alone.
Lizards.
I've really got a lizard dependency problem.
I know that you're not just saying that.
No.
Yeah, it really surprised me this time around.
It's like, geez, could we pull over at PetSmart?
Yo, you have to get you some lizard every...
I need a bump.
...at least every couple of days.
Are you familiar with reptiles?
Oh, yeah.
I've stroked to that before.
Yeah, I used to get that.
That was...
That's pretty good.
It's got interesting things in it, and it turns out the special lingo that the lizard fanciers use that...
Hemipenis.
Yes, you're familiar with...
They call each other herps, right?
Oh, yeah.
Well, herpetology is...
That's herptiles, or kept reptiles.
Mm-hmm.
When I first got lizards in the late 80s, I was a goober.
I joined the Georgia Herpetological Society.
And then I realized every time they got covered in the newspaper, they were called the Georgia Herpes Society.
Oh, how awful.
It would automatically be proof to that.
And it was just idiots showing off their lizards.
Too bad.
Yeah, so...
But, yeah, that whole herptile thing, they're reptiles.
Susan, you sure would love the...
Just because they're big, that doesn't compromise them.
You would love the rattlesnake roundup in Walnut Springs.
In Walnut Springs, Texas.
Nah, that's just macho jerkery.
Yeah, but it's funny macho jerkery.
And you get to see 400 or 500 rattlesnakes all in a big plexiglass cage.
I'd rather walk into the convenience store with a lizard on my shoulder and watch all the rednecks flatten against the candy counter and knock the snickers on the floor, while their women are all over the lizard.
Really?
Yeah.
The male rednecks, or monskos, as we call them, are scared?
They're scared of the lizard.
They're a chick magnet.
The males are terrified of them.
And a lot of the guys will be moved to say something ugly like,
What are you doing with that ugly critter?
You know, just spill a little disdain to make up for their terror, reptile terror.
And I'll point out to them, this lizard is a chick magnet, man.
And you know, a woman who'll touch a lizard will touch damn near anything.
Yeah.
And that's when they start going, yeah.
It makes them rethink reptiles.
Hot damn, I've got to get me one of them.
Yeah, you've got to talk to the yearning in the mark.
I'm going to get me one of them horny toads.
What's that silly?
A horny toad's an amphibious, like a frog or something.
It's a toad.
Horny toads, you know?
No, they're hornier than they are toady.
Yep.
They are, in fact, of the reptile kingdom.
Yes.
But they're endearing habit of...
Squirting blood out through their eyeballs.
I've never seen one do that, and I used to be surrounded by horned lizards.
Well, that's because you didn't act like a total asshole.
I did, actually.
Oh, you did?
I don't know why they did.
And they were still forbearant.
Yep.
That's why I had two hognose snakes.
I never saw them play dead.
I wasn't about to annoy them that much.
So those were puff adders, eh?
Oh, yeah.
I let them hiss and flare and strike at my bare fingertip.
Oh, boy.
Yeah, it really got me over snake fear.
I'd be like, ooh, he's so mean, and it, like, flares the little neck out.
He's so badass.
Little cartoon-looking snake.
It's an intimidating display.
They were a little Richie Rich Casper nose.
I mean, they're just cute snakes.
Cute snakes.
Cute snakes.
That's right.
They were gateway snakes for me.
That...
Bump.
Bump.
On the end of the snout is quite interesting and reappears throughout geologic time as
an adornment to various creatures of reptilian origin.
That makes...
That's what makes an iguana...
An iguana...
Iguana rhinolopha.
The rhinoceros iguana, which can exceed six feet in length.
If you're lucky.
Yeah.
The one that was tricked up with fins to be dimetrodons in Journey to the Center of the
Earth.
Mm-hmm.
Fighting the tegu.
Oh, is that what that is?
Or is that a caiman?
Those were rhinoceros iguanas.
Animals...
Uh, some animals were harmed in the making of that film.
Mm-hmm.
They were.
Oh, I'm sure they were.
There's the ones fallen off the...
Oh, no, I'm thinking of the Lost World.
Yes, of course.
The Lost World, they're dead when they're falling.
There's a caiman, a tegu, and an iguana, and there are, like, two different things where
different reptiles mix it up, and sometimes they kind of run together.
Hmm.
Well...
What do you mean?
It...
Their large tegu was painted, but nothing else happened to it.
But the dimetrodons were in a different scene, never encountered the tegu.
I feel that probably the reptiles in 1,000,000 BC were harmed.
Oh, yeah, they look pretty harmed.
Yep.
They look like they have their...
At one point, I think they glued the mouth of one of the...
One onto another, and then, like, somebody right off-screen is holding their back ends
and twisting them and flopping them around.
Yeah, twisting them.

Oh, God, it's kind of hard to watch now.
It was so fun to watch when I was seven years old in the theater.
Yeah.
On the other hand, possibly a dwarf alligator would use that strategy.
Princess Wee's little newt, which is only two inches long, when it grabs the wad of
brine shrimp that we drop in the water, it acts like a...
It has to break its neck.
It rolls around and thrashes and, you know, it's kind of like Snoopy playing Red Baron.
This thing is playing alligator.
Well, we see this again and again.
He's so badass.
He's so badass.
In the natural world.
That's a great...
Is that on YouTube, Stang?
Yeah.
And it's called what now, for the record?
Fig, the newt that time forgot.
Fig, the newt that time forgot.
On Rev Stang YouTube.
Yes, it is.
It gets six and a half stars.
We recommend that you watch this exciting piece of cinema.
And the...
As far as the death of the Tegu lizard in 1,000,000 BC, it seems to be lying on its
back, spasming after the fight is over with blood pouring out from a neck wound, while
Victor Mature jumps over its tail.
I've seen one part of it.

Thanks,いるвашил.
Just wanted to add a знач biom sort of scary發.

Half gorgeous bayonet technique.
movement.
The normals always cheer
when the lizards die.
Do you feel like the rear dwarf
in the dinosaur suit?
Not always.
Now in the same movie, if we could go back
to that 1941
Hal Roach Studios production
1 million B.C.
featuring Lon Chaney Jr.,
Victor Mature,
and Carol Landis,
the ping girl,
who was the Raquel Welch of her day.
You know,
a funny thing, when you see
the Hammer
remake from British
Pathé and so on,
there's the scene where Raquel Welch
is supposedly spearing fish.
You know, she
hurls the bone-tipped lance
down into the water, and it cuts
away to the caveman
watching her. And then when she pulls the lance
out, there's a fish
impaled on it.
She didn't really catch a fish?
And then she starts to wipe it on the bank,
and it cuts away again.
Because I'll bet she failed to do that too.
But the whole movie is kind of assembled like that.
When the Allosaurus attacks,
you see the child start to fall out of the tree,
but you never see her fall.
The next time you see her is at the bottom of the tree.
The whole approach is like that.
But when you watch the 1990s,
1941 black and white movie,
in an unbroken shot,
Carol Landis stands
ankle-deep in the water
and effortlessly spears the fish
and pulls them out in the same shot.
There's no question that she
actually is able to
beat the refraction
of the water, which so
frustrated Tumac
in the 1967 remake.
Maybe they just had suicidal fish that threw themselves
toward the spear. Maybe.
Maybe they cast them that way. But that's some fish rap.

wrangler in Hollywood who can portray,
who can get his charges to be enthusiastic
about being speared,
even by Carol Landis.
But now I remember what I wanted to say.
In addition to the mistreatment of lizards
during the extended volcanic eruption scene,
there's the extremely interesting shot
of a woman being overcome by lava
and having it sweep over her.
Do you remember that shot?
I was too busy
whacking it over the wall.
I was too busy whacking it over the lizards.
It's actually
New Pondy, Tumac's
former girlfriend, before he took up
with Loana.
She's running around and the lava
comes toward her in a huge
wave with fire at the edges
and it sweeps over her and you see her hair
flop down on the ground
as the lava sheet covers her.
Are you familiar with that shot, Stan?
I haven't seen the movie since I was a little kid,
although that does sound familiar and I'm dying to see the movie.
It's in the Castle Films
version.
It's an astonishing shot.
It may be the best special effects
shot in the whole movie.
How do you think they did it?
Just a traveling mat?
It must have been. There's no other way
that could have been done.
Well, in those days they could actually...
The fact is,
unlike all these movies,
you can't stand next to lava.
Oh, as long as the lava doesn't
get on you, you're alright.
No, if you're anywhere near it,
you're instantly cooked through.
It is rock in a molten
state and you have all these characters
in Star Wars and other
movies, you know, just
above the lava.
Many jungle movies, they're
right there next to the lava.
I bet you won't stick your toe in that.
If you're the air in it,
if it's nearby, will instantly
cook you because the heat is
intense.
Oh, you can feel it outside of tents, too.
Well, it
when it comes, it
can't be stopped by anyone, including
Tommy Lee Jones.
I think I figured out why
X-Day doesn't happen. It's
because you're having it at a campground.
Yeah. And we're trying
to get to the future, but to get there,
we have to go past
tents.
Oh, no.
Why don't you marry Dr. Dark?
Where is Dr. Dark? Why don't you
and Dr. Dark get married and have little puns
for children? Well, it's as good an excuse
as you've come up with in 20 freaking
years, dang.
We really should get her and Dr. Dark
on these microphones and just
let them go. Yes. See who can
hurt everyone else the most.
How can you be so cruel?
I'm sorry. Punsters, that's just
so, it's so sadistic.
I'm sorry. I mean, that's the whole
idea behind puns, is make people
groan. I had no children. I've
got to abuse somebody.
I understand that. That certainly is.
If I had kids to beat, you'd be
off scot-free.
I haven't been on scot-free
in a long time. Like a
bucking bronco. Now, we
do have guards to prevent
certain unsavory individuals
from entering the X-Day
campgrounds. Yeah, it worked on me.
Yes,
there are those who would come
simply for the purpose of disrupting
our sacred
meditations. I tunneled in. Well,
they don't want to disrupt. Most of them just
hate me because I
dare to tell them, shut up.
You're stupid.
I guess that's not very diplomatic,
but everybody else says that
to them. Oh, but when Reverend
Stang says it, oh, then it's really serious.
Then it's them fighting where it's at.
It's just kidding when everybody else says it.
Reverend Stang says it, oh, and then he's
serious. All the other people that say,
go away, man. You're irritating everyone.
They don't hear
that. They just hear it when I say it.
Well, you... Of course, I have the power to enforce
it. When they... I'm mad.
Mad with power. Can't take a joke.
Mad, I dare you.
And I like it that way.
The drugs I took seem to light up
my brain. The very moon
is frightened of me, frightened to death.
The moon itself
will grovel at my feet.
The poor thing.
I didn't wash them.
I wanted to grow up to be
Claude Rains ranting
madly in The Invisible Man.
Mm-hmm. Well, he's only able to
come back at the end.
Well, that's the point of
that story was, oh, yeah, you think you want
to be invisible, kid?
Wait until you find out
you can't ever close your eyes!
And other problems,
yes. And people can see
what you just had for dinner.
Right. And you can't see your feet
when you're going downstairs.
Oh, I didn't think about that.
Oh, all kinds of problems. Oh, it would
mess me up bad. No
girls' locker rooms for old Reverend Stang.
No, sir. That's the
idea behind invisibility, of course.
Well, you've got... Where you would appear
as a bubble in the sea. A cloud of
mist as water condenses
on your body, giving
you away. Look, there's
a turned-on ghost running around in here!
It's shaped like a man with a panhandle.
Oh, yes. You know,
we've been doing this for over an hour now.
Really. This is just a run-through.
This isn't a real show, of course. Perhaps this is the
time... Just an hour and a half long rehearsal.
This is a stunt show. To introduce the subject of
Ball's Pyramid Island.
You must have seen the pictures
that I sent of the island.
Yes, I studied...
Not only that, but we played
you talking about Ball's Pyramid
Island on the show, and
some rock star came up to
Philo or Wellman or
somebody and said, I was just
listening... Oh, to you, right? I was just
listening to you talking about
the Pyramid Island. Ball's Pyramid Island, yes.
In the age of downloads, you
can listen to your, quote,
radio, unquote,
at your leisure.
Your favorite program. You simply
download it.
Is that so? What are they
going to think of next? And not only
are they rendering radio irrelevant
with this jiggery-pokery, but
also television, because
now there are studios for
podcast TV.
And I'll admit, I've been on it
several times, and puzzling evidence
was giving serious thought to,
you know, we could move in there and do our
own TV show.
But you have to shave to do a TV show.
Not only that, you...
I mean, that would turn out to be... Maybe not Susie wouldn't have
to shave quite as much. All we would
ever do... I never quite crossed my legs.
No. Bruises.
No, to do a TV show is... We were on
TV last night. Labor intensive.
The, uh... Not what
you do for fun. You can now... It's major
work to do a TV show. You can now
point your phone at
yourself and
push the right button on Facebook,
and you'll be broadcasting
a movie to Facebook. We did
that last night on the stage, and
25 people were looking at this upside
down, completely
unlit scene. For
two hours! It was
fascinating. God, you'd think they'd have something better to do.
Even better than Andy Warhol's
Empire.
But we had no lights on on the
stage. No, it was just... His
movie, which was a single
five-hour shot of the Empire State
Building. Oh, Empire State Building.
Well, he had a movie called
Sleep, right? Yeah. Where somebody just sleeps.
Right. Wow, that's so conceptual. I think he had Paul Morris
in film, actually. What a great artist!
God, what a great artist! To
even conceive of such a
masterful notion!
How could it even enter the head of...
No normal person would think of something
as brilliant as running a camera for five
hours on a sleeping person. Did you, uh...
He's doing his best work right now, though,
because there's an Earth cam on
Andy Warhol's grave. Oh, is there?
Yeah. Oh, okay. I used to have a
bookmarked. I haven't looked in in a long time.
You know there's some
online service where you can
find, using satellite
photography, the grave of any
person. And some
wag sent me a picture
of Aunt Bertha's grave.
Wow. I need that
app. Well, you... I can't live without
that app that finds where people's graves
are. Yes, you can... I have no apps.
You can get their headstone and
get an image of... I didn't either until the CR
is silent.
The CRAP app.
Recently, there have been new photographs
of Ball's Pyramid Island from above,
showing its insane,
thin, blade-like
structure.
And more boisterous
people with too much
time on their hands have been trying
to reach it across the
Tasman Sea, though it's
difficult to land on its
vertical face
in an ocean which is
seething with water.
And it's also
seething with sharks of all kinds.
Yeah, but that keeps the prehistoric animals
safe from rats, doesn't it?
It is a protruding spire of the
sunken continent of
Zealandia, near
New Zealand.
And its closest island
is Lord Howe Island,
where, as you know, the
beloved giant insects,
or tree lobsters, were
entirely destroyed
when rats escaped the
island.

fish freighter Mogambo,
which had run aground.
I thought that was Ann Howe Island.
The tree lobsters
were consumed, being slow
moving and pacifistic by the
avid rats. And quite tasty.
But it wasn't until the early
decade of the present century
that scientists discovered a
colony of the giant bugs
living in the inaccessible
reaches of Ball's
amazing spire,
which jaggedly sticks up out of the
Tasman Sea, and looks like
a matte painting from a
Willis O'Brien movie.
Yeah, it doesn't look real at all.
It's too incredible in appearance,
but it's worth looking up,
looking online to
see this incredible lake.
That sounds like a really hard
place to get to, and a rough environment.
It's almost impossible to get to.
You need special equipment. But they had it.
Well, if we have to do X-Day,
again, I say let's go to Ball's
Pyramid Island. There's no
source of food or water. The
sunshine is merciless. The sea
below is full of avid
sharks. There's no place to sit or rest.
It's a perfect place to have X-Day.
Keep out the riff-raff. Only
crazy people would do something like that.
We'll probably wind up going
somewhere where someone has pyramid-shaped
balls. The scientists
found these giant insects,
which are phasmids.
They
have an endearing
appearance to me. They were
known as tree lobsters by
the indigenes on
Lord Howe Island. They do
live in the trees, are peaceful,
and they, on their
legs, they have a structure which looks as if
they're wearing pants.
They display altruism.
Slacks. The slack part. Not usually seen
in the insect kingdom. When scientists
came and raided their home,
the males threw their
legs and bodies over the females
to try to protect them. But
to no avail, as they
were collected by the
assiduous science team
and brought back to
the breeding station
in Queensland, Australia.
Where ever since they've
raised an enormous
population of
these oversized
arthropods. They're good eating, too.
Well, by rats.
But, on the other hand,
they then reintroduced
the species onto Lord Howe
Island and created
a systematic program of
exterminating the rats.
With the result that now there are
no rats, but there are
the giant tree lobsters
once again on Lord Howe.
Which I'm sure the
inhabitants are quite grateful for.
Giant tree eating lobsters.
Elroy really liked
that story.
I believe it was, was it
Diane Fossey who went and
complimented them on their
breeding program?
Or one of those
primatologists?
Diane Hanson.
No, it wasn't her.
She was a great primatologist.
She really
She understood
the motivations of apes.
She studied lobsters with the foot
morphology that resembled high-heeled
shoes and the whip-like
extensions of the second pair of legs.
Now, when you were going on about
the tree lobsters, Elroy was
waving his
his horse.
Howe goes on about the tree lobsters so he can say
Lord Howe Island a lot of times.
It makes him feel important to say that.
Phasmids aren't like that.
They tend to be long, stick-like
things like walking stick
insects and twig
insects and so forth. But the
Lord Howe Island
tree lobsters are beefier
and larger.
Susie has had a mic in one hand
and a
locust.
Crawling around, he's a 17
year locust.
You won't see his like again for another
17 years.
A cicada is more squat and broad.
And he's among the last
of his kind of this
phase because most of them have
already come and had
their egg-laying ceremony
and died off.
So I'm showing him the last good time he's
going to have. If I can make
a bug happy.
Then you know you've done something.
It wouldn't be the first time.
Now he's crawling to the end
of your pinky finger.
And what's he going to do there?
I think it makes him feel
superior when he's mounted.
Like King Kong on his
island eminence.
He falls over a lot. I think he's got
an ugdre oblom prey.
He's the king of Floos Island.
It could be that he's
at the end of his active
career
having already
fulfilled his biologic
duty.
I know how he feels.
Not with me.
I'm not full of eggs.
A few sad, desultory
years remain.
When I found him I was naked and he was
on my dressing gown.
I get out. I'm
standing there next to my tent dripping
and naked. I reach for my
dressing gown and
there's this locust on it.
I thought he was dead.
They got clingy bits.
Clingy bits. It was so personable.
Then he fell over and it's like
aww. It's just like guys I've
felt sorry for before. A lot of people would
just say, eww, a bug. Eww.
I walked him all the way down from my campsite.
He was crawling all over me.
He's been crawling all over you for the whole
last hour.
He was nice.
I let him get to second base.
You got a problem with that?
Things crawl all over Susie.
All the luck.
They've never done anything to me that
hasn't washed off. What the hell?
So easy.
You can crawl on me.
She's an easy woman if you're a lizard.
She's an easy woman if you're a
if you have six legs.
Yeah.
She's an easy woman if you're cold blooded.
We're not talking about barflies and
lounge lizards here.
You've got scales and that freaky long toe.
Dr. Howell, I'm getting tired.
And it's
Tired.
I need to drink something.
I need to eat something.
This rehearsal has been going on for an hour and a half.
How about those tangerines
over there? Are those fair game
for those who dare
to try to assimilate food?
Friends, you've been listening to some kind of bits and pieces
of some kind of an hour of slack
recorded here at lovely
Wisteria Campground and Events Center
near Pomeroy, Ohio.
Praise Bob.
Praise Wisteria. Thank you
Reverend Susie the Fousey.
Fresh from WREK Atlanta.
Thank you Dr. Howell.
Fresh from KPFA
Berkeley and Radio Valencia.
And thank
me, Reverend Ivan Stang.
Thank you kindly, Reverend Stang.
Running the equipment.
Yes. Anyone have some
crops for my bug? I think he's hungry.
Now I'll
raise the music
and lower the mics.
Yes, we will all
dip our... I know they eat crops. That's about it.
Wouldn't eat a banana. Wouldn't eat a grape. He wants crops.
Fade out all the microphones
at once.
Well, fade out those microphones
on that
pre-recorded
live show. Actually it was
edited some.
I'm
not sure if it was edited.
That's all of
last X Day's show for now.
I think we recorded
a lot of shows
at X Day.
And you can see pictures
now on subgenius.com
of 19X Day
including some great close-ups
that Princess We took of Susie's
cicada, which has
demonic red
eyes and
black carapace. Very weird looking.
Or locust or whatever it was.
It's a very dramatic looking insect.
The way to see these pictures
is you go to subgenius.com
and there's
in the upper right
on a bar with some other things
is the word events. And if you click on that
and then scroll down a little bit
you'll find the event,
the past event called 19X Day
and a big link
to the edited
chronological photos.
Actually click on that
and you'll find anything on there that says X Day.
There's also a link right in the middle of the
main paragraph on
subgenius.com
homepage. And there's a lot of other
X Day pictures.
It was a 10T
X Day, but we don't have pictures
of that now that everybody's boss
and grandma are on Facebook
with them. And
we talked
a bit about that movie
1 Million B.C. and later on at
X Day, days later, it was shown
and it's still on
somewhere if you ever want to see it
sitting in the theater
or the Netflix box with
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
Cow Pie to you.
Oh yes, Mrs. Cow Pie.
Who's Mrs. Cow Pie
today?
I'm sorry. Who is
Mrs. Cow Pie today?
Lonesome Cow Pie Dave?
Yes. Huh.
I answered properly, didn't I?
I'm looking for a fillet.
I suppose so.
And I just thought
I would call her
Long-Step Seamstress Jane
or
Parcho Patchouli Filly
Ginny. Yeah,
I got a bunch of names. I'm trying to
fill out pictures. Is it blonde?
Is it brunette? Is she redhead?
She's all women to all kinds of things
I think.
That's Connie.
She's Connie, yeah. Maybe that's
who I'm looking for is Connie.
But isn't that who every man is
looking for?
Not if they know better.
Yeah, really.
I've been there, done that.
Ain't gonna do it again.
Yeah, some men miss
those whirling red lights
that are spinning around Connie's head.
Yeah, the EMS vehicles
trying to get through the traffic.
I think once
you've been asphyxiated by Connie
you never come back
and you never go forward.
There's all kinds of directions
and you get right out of the map.
That's probably true.
Well, she's the spouse of
J.R. Bob Dobbs, or at least the
primary spouse, the primary
wife of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
And I guess
he's her primary
husband.
Who
knows about that family?
Who knows who wears the panties and who wears
the breeches?
Why not both?
I can hear you playing my music
in the background, and that's why
I thought of Connie as such a dear
and not dear.
I don't know anybody would call her a dear.
Dave remembered this on music.
Sounds good.
Quite a feat for a man
who has no vessels, er, no feet,
no blood vessels left
to concern himself with.
You're devoid of blood vessels, Dave?
And divine.
I lie hereby now
pronounce Connie
to be an official ex-bug and
squack of the magazine Republic.
It's a place with feet
and one not feet.
Ah, never mind. See, I took
the wrong road. I'm sorry.
The, uh, the true
uberfems, speaking of
feet and Connie, often
have giant feet.
Yeah. You know, like hobbits,
only they're not small as hobbits,
but their feet are bigger
than even hobbits' feet.
Or human feet.
And they sometimes have what we call
the Morlock toe
on some uberfems
that, whose names I
could but won't mention.
Is that the middle toe
is longer than the big toe?
Uh, well
that's part of it, but there's also
the, um,
that thumb-like big toe.
Ah. Yeah.
The opposable big toe is
unusual on human feet.
But not that unusual
on subgenius uberfems.
Or, or some
other, um, simians
also have an opposable,
or at least a disagreeable,
if not opposable, disagreeable thumb.
And that's why
we find Connie in all the
strangest places, because you know
what they say about women with big feet?
Yeah.
Small hands.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's always bad to have a thumb
with a bad attitude.
No, we don't want to make fun of the small-handed now,
folks, because, you know, we want,
we don't want to be, uh,
rude to the
special people
with those special tiny little
hands.
That's not something that most
people should be ashamed of.
Really? Not most of you
listeners, but
not most of you small-handed listeners.
But even small hands can be
reached all the way down into deep pockets.
Oh, yeah, the smaller
the hands are, the further they can get
into your pocket.
Yep, they're pretty underhanded.
And the greater the need
to get into something.
Well, Karl Marx was also a friend of
Groucho's unbeknownst
brother, once said that
the small hands shall inherit
the earth, and they have nothing to lose but their testicles.
And he was talking...
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Well, okay,
so he was, maybe
he was talking about workers of the world.
But that's still, you know...
Wankers of the world.
The small wankers of the world.
Rankerous wankers
of the world. Rankerous wankers, that's
what we've got here, folks.
And that's who's on your hair waves
every Sunday night. Every Sunday
night. On your
hair waves, did you say?
Yes. Jase.
German hair waves.
Ja, ja.
Ja.
Ja.
Ja.
Ja. Well, have you been making
the news today, Dave?
I have been, uh, almost. Or have you
been the news?
I've been the news almost. Or a victim
of the news? I was a victim
of the news because there was an accident
and I was
forced to wait around
to see what
the police could, what kind of report
or something that a
cover sheet that the police
could reply with.
What they would divulge.
Dave, I just saw something that might make you
feel better about things.
I have a lot, I have two or three friends
who have, who monitor
the police band and
constantly report on what the police
are doing, but they don't get paid for it.
Well,
how would that help me because they
play it all the time and I just stick my fingers in my
ears and scream I don't want to go.
But you get paid, right?
Right. Something.
They play it constantly.
And whenever somebody
says something is happening in your district
or part of the world,
you're supposed to jump up and run to your car
and take your notebook and your camera, your
vlogging camera with you and
fight your way through traffic to find
out the real story.
It could be worse, Dave. You could be
stuck in an office all the time.
In fact, I've got a little, a short... It's still most of the time.
I have a really good
short poem here that was written
by a subgenius who lives
in Mexico.
And who's, I think
English is his second language.
He's, his name is
Joaquin de la Garza
and he has a poem
about his job and I think
our listeners who have office jobs
including the incoming
DJ might like this poem.
It's pretty short.
I'll turn this back. What am I, any, any
in Spanish?
No, in English.
And he, he was concerned about his
English but it's great.
Anyway, here it is.
The colors of these walls thirst for creativity.
Their goal is not to promote it
but to snuff it out.
The building was painted this way
by ogres and demons.
Beings whose bigger enemy
is hope. Dreams give them
pain. My slack gives them
the runs. Our laughter,
wrath.
Fight it, don't I? Between phrases
that have three different meanings,
I can recognize the stupidity while I end up
shadowboxing with bitterness.
Type like a butterfly.
Graph like a bee, Cassius would
say if he never became Ali.
Alcohol helped
but I lost even the spirits.
Stopped hanging out.
I lost my youth which got filed
alongside my performance review.
My employee ID
is E376787.
Did I use that
to have a name? No.
I think not. Risk management.
Six sigma
team building. But I'm not
yet lost. I may be blind
and mute but I still got touch.
One sense is enough
to move forward. Strip me down.
I'll fight naked if I have to.
Fiends, I challenge you until my last
day. I'll keep searching for the way to weasel
out of this. When I find it, I'll share
it with my fellow yeti. I pity
you monsters that are unaware of what
you are. I pity you men that don't
realize you have become that which you hate most.
Pity me. Still here.
One sense left.
Banting these walls.
By
Reverend Joaquin
Joaquin de la Garza
did that. Praise
Joaquin de la Garza.
Princess, he lives in Mexicali
which is right across the border from
Cala Mexico
or whatever over there south
of the unearthly
Salton Sea.
Near Arizona.
Poor Joaquin is
breathing Salton Sea
dirt on the freight a little bit.
But not indoors. Not as long as he's
in his office you see.
I forgot to say
how to say
in Espanol. I forgot how to
say it but he is certainly above
something.
You liked that poem did you?
I liked that poem. I thought that was well said.
I thought there was something so
vital and so magnificent
about it that I had to pee pee.
Well he's like many of us
stuck in one of those office
jobs and wants
more.
He actually probably would like to do his job.
He'd like to have the opportunity to do
his job better. That was often
how I felt when I was in office
jobs. It's like please let me
do this right. No! Do it our
way. Oh yeah.
This is the way it's been done for
millions of years. I have
had an office job in one time
in which I was actually fired
for coming up with better ideas
than the company had for how to do stuff.
They thought I was being a
wise arse and I just thought I was
doing the right thing. Act like an
idiot and they'll treat you as an
equal. To paraphrase
Bob's radio unsafe
slogan. But act like a super
genius and they will fire you.
Fire you.
Well that's why
we use the masks of
insanity which is actually
like where you pretend to be
normal. You act just
like one of them or as close
to it as you can.
Princess we did that for 29
years. She pretended to like
those people. I did. They never
ever knew
the religion she had been raised
in. Her outside
activities. They didn't know she was
in any bands.
They didn't know whether
she was a peace activist.
Or a war
monger.
They did in the early years
that I worked there but eventually.
They rubbed elbows
with every day and still didn't
really truly care about her. They didn't
want to know and
she didn't volunteer.
Don't ask don't tell.
That was such a great policy.
Wasn't masks of insanity wasn't that a
Reverend Larry band?
I mean Larry
Sir Lawrence. Angry Larry?
Wasn't that a sanguine
Angry Larry
band masks
of insanity? But you can't say
on this radio show.
You can't say something 20 minutes after
the thing's been set up because it gets
forgotten in the stew.
Reverend Angry Larry
discovered a new band
that may have an amino
acid in it. Really?
Yeah it's called specimen.
Not specimen
but speciman.
It's named after that rubber stamp
that he got at the
bulldata auction. Somebody auctioned
off a big rubber stamp that was misspelled.
It said specimen.
Instead of specimen.
When is the
divival with the Reverend?
When is the divo divival?
The divo divival is
August 15th
and 20th
and uh. 15th
and 20th? 19th. 19th
and 20th. 19th and 20th. Did I say 15th and 20th?
Oh by the way we went to the
Mark Mothersbaugh
art show that's at the
Museum of Contemporary Art
in Cleveland.
I was mad I didn't go sooner.
It's there through August
listeners and if you haven't seen
the Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh
art show and divo
stuff at that
fancy museum I would
tell you that I
Princess Wee and I
and the Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh
and Reverend Heathen certainly enjoyed the heck out of it.
That fancy museum being
the Museum of Contemporary
Art. Yeah the MOCA.
Euclid and 422.
320. 322.
You got 420 on the mind.
420 on the mind.
320. Yeah for 322.
So anyway, Yale. It was
uh they had
I was hoping that it wouldn't
be a bunch of his portraits that
just have that Photoshop mirror effect
and praise Bob there
were none of those but he had a full
life size actual car
to which he had done
what he had previously been doing
only in Photoshop.
Which is the car had two
rear ends. It was mirrored
in the middle. Like many people that he knows.
There was no driver area
it was just two rear ends on this
fancy, really fancy
car. Yes.
It's true of so many of us he speaks in a
very elegant tongue
about people who are not in the
driver's seat who have two rear ends.
It was a thing of beauty.
The thing with the two ends.
It's still, I'm sure it still is a thing
of beauty but I've been just bombarded
with pictures of Mark Mothersbaugh
making different faces and
his body being occluded up to
his eyeballs and then the
weird Photoshop going around and I
didn't see any cars yet but I guess
I have to go to Cloma or
have to go to New Zealand. No actually
just join the church of the
subgenius and go to our members
only Google group of
Scrub Genius which you already
are a member of Dave and you can
see the picture of the car. You can see all the pictures.
Yeah there's, no not all of them I just
posted a few in Scrub.
If you ever show,
if you ever post any of my films.
Take pictures in the museum there and then put them on your
website. That's illegal.
You're whatevs.
Whatevs.
Yes sneak peeks are
illegal right Dave?
Are they? No I don't think so.
Dave's just trying to get you scared.
Yeah I was trying to
do that. I was trying to
That is absolutely
Yeah if you go into
the William and Martin Museum
to take a picture of a Van Gogh painting
that Van Gogh guy will see you.
If you put it on your Facebook page Van Gogh will come after you.
No the museum says this is our
property for a brief time.
Right. Well it's the property of
somebody else and we are the licensed agents
of said property under which conditions
as the purveyors have agreed
to X, Y, and Z
therefore we agree to Z, Y, and X.
They had a
in the gift shop
were a few mother's
body and products
like buttons
and coffee mugs but there was
a rubber ducky.
A Devo rubber ducky
quack that whip
it said on the side.
And I did get that but I
didn't get the $40 coffee table
book of Mark's art. You know I
I will
but I used to stay at that guy's
house.
I can remember a time when he actually
said to me
Stan if you can help me get my
art rep back
that would be the best thing you could do to help
you know pay me back.
He had done music for our commercial
for nothing and I said
can I pay you back somehow so you can help me get my
art rep back and that was 25 years ago
and now he's
in the business of
has the whole top floor
of the fanciest art museum
in Cleveland. So
that's a subgenius that made good.
Of course he was Devo before he was
subgenius. I found
your photo of the paragraph
that I think would irk.
I found it too. Reverend Casale.
It wasn't exactly as you said but
but yes I could see what you meant about it.
It was like Mark
worked and collaborated with Jerry
Casale and many others
but dot dot dot
and I think that but
would be the
but that would irk
The dot dot dot is the
print version of the yada yada yada
No that's it's a form of elliptical
thinking. Yeah it's an ellipse
it's called but
I prefer eye lips
Put your eye lips a little
closer to the phone
That but could cause some butthurt
Yeah just my
but. I prefer to call it proctalgia
that's the technical term. Proctalgia
Proctalgia I like it
That was a great band
Proctalgia
What's that band name we came up with
in the car on the way here
Purvish Durvish
Faeces
Oh that's right Faeces
F A E Y
C E S
The feces of fairies
We were thinking of a couple of
folks we knew that were into that
fae and faerie
stuff and thought well if you were
a punk faerie
then your band might well be called
Faeces
Every band name I ever come up with has been taken
by a bunch of Brooklyn hipsters
Bastards
Have you passed the point of no return
which is namely the Greenpoint Bridge
That was a good band too
I have a friend
where I you know many in a past
life I had a friend who
was a Brooklyn hipster before it was cool to be
a Brooklyn hipster. It's all
How can such a thing be?
Yeah
He like moved to Williamsburg in
like 2000 and it was before
the place got a
reputation
such as it has now
I would say
the 1990s there were
swords of swath moving into the Arians
Not the Arians
but the actual pickle factory nearby
there was
You know where they had the
Polish ladies working there all day and all
night and don't give them any money
Well maybe this speaks more to the
cultural naivete I had 15 years
ago than reality
Well you thought everything
was in your temporal landscape
that's what they like to say if they you know
dig the dirt so to speak
but if they know what they're talking about
your temporal
landscape was 2001
One year
after the evil autocrats
invaded America and bombed
the World Trade Center. Is that 2001?
2001?
If you're referring to the
9-11 attacks that was in 2001
That's what I was referring to
2001 was the year that happened
Or so
the conspiracy would have us believe
So called 2001
So called 2001
We know it's
not 1998 yet
Right. That's all we know
If we even know
that much
No
The future and the past are a dark
figurine. It's very
very undelightful that we're going to get
the answers soon
And the conspiracy keeps getting more and more
sophisticated in the way they manipulate
our minds and our calendars
You know anybody who's old enough remembers
where they were when they found out about the
JFK assassination
and of course
nowadays everyone knows where they were when they found out
about the 9-11 attacks
but it turns out that a lot of people
Yeah
a lot of people's memories about where they were
when they found out about 9-11 are actually incorrect
A lot of people think that
President Kennedy was killed on July 5th
19 2001
or 9-11 September
and vice versa
A lot of people think that
the Holiday Book Center down there
Well actually I believe
that JFK was actually assassinated
in the summer of 2016
Yeah by irate
not Hispanic
but Muslim
and autocrats
There's just so many of them going around
Yeah there was a shooting that just happened
a block away from Dealey Plaza
in Dallas not too long ago
and I'm pretty sure that's when JFK was actually killed
Yeah
But nobody can put a clear number on when
J.R. Bob Dobbs was killed
because he's getting killed every like 5 minutes
Well yeah
Go ahead and kill Bob he'll be fine
You know our friend Barnes
James Barnes
told me about
what he called the Mandela Effect
and according to this
particular conspiracy theory
some
things have been changed
in the past
His example was that a lot of people remember
Nelson Mandela dying in jail
Another thing was
the Berenstain Bears
Now for some reason
they're called the Berenstain Bears
but everybody remembers them being the Berenstain Bears
Well some people
Did someone go back in time and change things
and make a sloppy job of it?
Yeah it's the way
well they're trying to say that it's the way
things transmogrify and slip side
into a different thing
and then everybody remembers that thing as like kind of a
collective consciousness
where everybody mispronounces the same word
the same way
but it's not really true
what's really true is they really are changing the past and future
and they're exerting their form of mind control
on everybody else's
I think it's just
marijuana that makes people
think those things
that would actually explain
a lot of it
wouldn't it?
and brain damage
other things
that change your memory
like life and your brain
Who's racist?
Calling it marijuana is racist
Because it's a Spanish
That was a term that was
used by some people
in some subcultures in Mexico
but I mean historically
it was known as hemp or cannabis
and
they started popularizing the term
marijuana to associate it with
those very same people
that Donald Trump wants to build a wall
to keep out
so I think we should stop calling it marijuana
Donald Trump was there back in 1929
exporting all those people to
Dutch Slovenia
That's why Trump is so incoherent
he's had a time machine
that was one of the things that Fred Trump Sr.
gave him as a gift
when he came of age
he spent so much time traveling through time
What do you think Back to the Future 2
is based on?
He's Biff Tannen
He can't keep anything straight anymore
and that's why he's so wacky
It's because he spent
so much time traveling
I feel sorry for the man
I could see him with his hat and his hair
the way it is
I could see him with a special superhero suit
when he goes back into the past
and stuff like that into the future kind of like a Superman
cloak and
banana peel one foot in the grave
and one foot on a banana peel
that's what they used to say about him
When the balloons dropped
for him at the RNC I was actually
there in the room and you know what song they played for him?
What song did they play?
You can't
always get what you want
I wondered when they used that
That's a hopeful thing isn't it?
Of course he ended up getting sued by the Stones
and of course he's not Donald Trump if he's not suing somebody
or getting sued by somebody
A lot more appropriate tune would have been Gimme Shelter
Right
Rape, murder, it's just a shot of Wayne
Yeah
Well he doesn't believe in hamburgers
in the American way
He believes in his own pseudo science
They say he's an apocryphal liar
How can he not believe in hamburgers if his name is Donald?
Right
I told the subgeniuses
that we weren't going to talk about him tonight
but there you go
I was making shows
I didn't
Well he's hated by many, Ronald McDonald is really hated by many
and he does kind of look like Ronald Trump
Donald Trump
Wait a minute
Maybe you're on to something there
Yeah I think you are
And what you're on to is the Hour of Slack
the radio ministry of Church of the Subgenius
and you can learn more about Bob Dobbs, Connie Dobbs,
Susie Cicada
and everything else
at subgenius.com
and
and
and I
and that means it's time for us to go
pretty much
and let next show in
but
there is a thing
If only we could go pretty much
That would solve so many problems
If we could go pretty much instead of little tinklings like we do
I'm gonna play
a
a rest of an instrumental that's been
occasionally going in the background
A lot of the time the background music was by
Lonesome Cowboy Dave
but other times it was by
the Rudy Schwartz project
What else here?
Ed Fred
Xavier Cougat
Oh
And
the Swingin' Mud Parts
But this is
the Rudy
