1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,640
I am seeking information about Bob. Let us see what is on the radio.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,920
You're listening to PR News.

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:14,960
No, I don't think I can accept that program.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,060
Nor that one.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,180
The Self-Demons Power of Swat Team!

6
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,520
The Self-Demons Power of Swat Team!

7
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,580
It's called blindin'.

8
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,060
Shinin', it's blindin', it's ridin'

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,240
My eyes outlaid again with my crazy jaguar friends

10
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:49,640
And I can't even pretend it'd be okay for me to spend more time

11
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,400
Time, hey anybody here got the time?

12
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:57,000
My head is floating like a bone

13
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:57,160
And I'm just a little bit scared

14
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,600
Feels like it's coming off my shoulders

15
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:08,420
So I just love when my day starts like this

16
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,740
Useless and clueless, I do this each time

17
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:16,760
Just when you think it might start to sink

18
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:19,960
And it's gone in a blink and I'm back to the brink again

19
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,200
Again

20
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,880
Hey anybody here see my friends?

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,160
My head is floating like a bone

22
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,760
And I can't even pretend it'd be okay for me to spend more time

23
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:29,760


24
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:29,760


25
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:30,100
And I'm just a little bit scared

26
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,760
Feels like it's coming off my shoulders

27
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:38,420
So I just love when my day starts like this

28
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,440
I just love when my day starts like this

29
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,640
Don't know where I'm goin'

30
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:49,400
Don't know how I got here

31
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,400
Don't even know where I am

32
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:54,340
Seriously

33
00:01:56,760 --> 00:02:00,960
Seriously, can somebody tell me how to get back to fifteen?

34
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:06,320
I don't recall too much of last night

35
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:08,760
Left my car on the east side

36
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,120
How I got here was some guy

37
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:13,920
Really all I know

38
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,700
Southernville down a bridge

39
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,040
A bridge, some big green tumbleweed

40
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,720
A bridge, wasted

41
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,120
Yeah, face it

42
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,160
I spaced it

43
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,080
It's fine

44
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,820
What do I do now?

45
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,780
I'll somehow get downtown

46
00:02:29,780 --> 00:02:31,040
Freak out anyone around

47
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,860
Cause I gotta feed the clown inside

48
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:34,160
Inside

49
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,720
Hey anybody here give me a ride

50
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,260
My head is floating like a boulder

51
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:45,520
Feels like it's coming off my shoulders

52
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,980
I wonder just how many disasters

53
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,240
Between now and the Sweetie Raptor

54
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,720
My head is floating like a boulder

55
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,600
I just love when my day starts like this

56
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:10,280
Are you plagued by bad luck?

57
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,240
Is some smiling little imp knocking the last bite of candy bar onto the floor?

58
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:19,740
Yeah, I'm not!

59
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,380
Or drying up your ink when you're trying to take down a message?

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,320
Maybe you're stalked by some larger hellspawn

61
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:31,460
Who causes your doors to automatically lock

62
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:33,820
While you scrape ice off your car

63
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,640
Or causes your mortgage to come out of your bank account

64
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,860
At the exact moment that your car payment, your insurance, and utilities do

65
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:46,960
You know, on the day right before your paycheck

66
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,880
Perhaps you're being tailed by a really large fucker

67
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:57,160
Who physically disables some part of you that used to work just fine

68
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,740
Or maybe he offs a family member

69
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,400
Or maybe he burns down your house

70
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:10,620
Or maybe your problem is a more insidious and creeping depression

71
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:16,340
Maybe it's just some formless phantom clinging on your back

72
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:19,280
And with every moment of embarrassment

73
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,240
Every feeling of failure or despair

74
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,320
Every wrong word or bungled gesture

75
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,680
Every time you feel ignored, isolated, or alienated

76
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,780
He just grows larger and larger until he can barely be carried

77
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:39,240
You, my friend, have bad brain

78
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,100
That niggling, fretting waste of energy

79
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,680
That keeps your brain spinning in a centrifuge of negativity

80
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,260
Until you think it's going to just splatter against the walls of your skull

81
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:56,080
That dragging heavy weight of futility

82
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,680
And frustration that just pulls you ever lower

83
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:07,880
The constant, insurmountable, intolerable, ever-growing heap of problems

84
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,080
Of setbacks and failures

85
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,520
What are you going to do about this?

86
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,080
I wonder

87
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,740
Will you allow yourself to be chained inexorably to your bad brain?

88
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,780
Will you mope and sleep and lament your luck?

89
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,680
Moving yourself from one day to the next listless, lifeless, and lost?

90
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,760
Friends, when that bull of bad brain comes at you

91
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:40,080
You don't grab it by the horns

92
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:40,900
Oh no

93
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,260
You don't plant yourself

94
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,300
Against a wall

95
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,140
To push against what you already know is an immovable juggernaut

96
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,500
The bad brain can't be bargained with

97
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,260
Or made to leave by sheer force of will

98
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:59,780
When that bull of bad brain comes tear-assing through your mind

99
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,520
You climb aboard

100
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,540
And you ride that fucker into the ground!

101
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,800
You withstand the bucking and tossing

102
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:11,200
You grit your teeth

103
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,520
And you dig your heels

104
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,620
Sure, you're bound to get thrown a few times

105
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:20,300
You get the holy hell kicked out of you by this beast

106
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,640
But you're going to get back on

107
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,660
Not because you want to

108
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,980
And not even because you have to

109
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,300
But because you are a subgenius

110
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,920
And you're too goddamn stupid to know when to quit!

111
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:35,260
No!

112
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:43,080
Because you're too stubborn to let those yokels in the audience have the last laugh!

113
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,320
Because you're too proud to wait and be saved by some rodeo clown

114
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,840
So you hang on for dear life

115
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,100
And you wait!

116
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:01,220
We know that the only form of time control that we have available to us is...

117
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:02,640
Patience

118
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,900
So you wait

119
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:10,640
You wait for that bull to become exhausted

120
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:14,900
You wait until it's worn itself out

121
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,000
And when it collapses

122
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,280
Unable to take you for a ride any further

123
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,780
You get up

124
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,980
And you wait!

125
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,820
For the next fucker who wants to try to take you down

126
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,200
The next past due bill

127
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,200
The next car breakdown

128
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,240
The next hard time

129
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,220
Because if you're not riding the bull

130
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,100
You're sitting in the stands

131
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,620
And that's the end of the story!

132
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,200
That's only fun for so long

133
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,380
Let's face it

134
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:47,720
Life is boring without a challenge

135
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:52,640
Life is boring with the same day in, day out

136
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,600
The predictable routine

137
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:00,040
So when that bad brain comes roaring at you

138
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,780
Remember

139
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,620
You're a subgenius

140
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,140
You're not going to quit

141
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:09,860
You're going to put on one hell of a show!

142
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,600
Or just fucking kill me!

143
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:15,140
Yes!

144
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,500
Praise Bob!

145
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,640
Praise Bob!

146
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,640
God and God!

147
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,080
Hallelujah!

148
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:40,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

149
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,760
shooting shall outlined

150
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,740
But right now

151
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,600
They got stuck in a

152
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,060
will never decay.

153
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:14,560
Look away, look away, from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

154
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:24,140
Look away, look away, from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

155
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,440
The responsibility's getting heavy to bear

156
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,000
when you're blind, walked through life so severe.

157
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,760
There's a hypnotic man who is beckoning from

158
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,480
where there's this body that always there.

159
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,580
Look away, look away, from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

160
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:10,680
Look away, look away, from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

161
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:19,920
Look away, look away, from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

162
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,420
Look away, look away, from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

163
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:44,800
If your conflict with normals brings struggles and strides,

164
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:48,020
then onward your end brings them too.

165
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,980
Fail away from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

166
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:57,500
That's a waiting in the town for you.

167
00:10:58,340 --> 00:11:00,000
Look away, look away, from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:03,480
The same hypnotic for the generous like me,

169
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:03,580


170
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,700
look away, look away, look away, for you'll buy it back.

171
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,540
But that's not all ya'll say,

172
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,120
look away, look away, from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

173
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,900
Look away, look away for you'll Grimm's here to back.

174
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:25,860
And from the pigs to the billowing pipe,

175
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:33,560
look away, look away, from the pigs to the billowing pipe.

176
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,120
blowing by.

177
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,420
Well, I was going to read the rest of

178
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,280
the good Reverend Rogers

179
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,020
rant.

180
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:52,080
Some notes on an inconvenient

181
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,700
universe. This would be

182
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:55,560
part two.

183
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,060
I had to kind of burp a bit there.

184
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:04,640
Clear things out.

185
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,120
You can do it!

186
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,280
Is this like a Slim Jam

187
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,820
or something?

188
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,560
Sure.

189
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,840
We'll see.

190
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,820
What's the matter, Bunky?

191
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:23,160
You say things aren't what they

192
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,100
used to be. That the

193
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,940
future has made you uncomfortable.

194
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:29,340
That things would be

195
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,640
much better if the

196
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,900
gays weren't quite so

197
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,820
gay about

198
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:36,940
things. And maybe if the blacks

199
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,980
and the women would

200
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,820
go back to being quiet about

201
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,800
what and who they are.

202
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,940
That a black president

203
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,820
was okay the one time,

204
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,000
but re-electing him has made it

205
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,720
look normal. Now you worry?

206
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,880
Well, fuck you,

207
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,020
Bunky. You'd be more comfortable

208
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,940
if roughly 54%

209
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,920
of the population was less

210
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,000
comfortable.

211
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,500
How nice. How

212
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,960
very fucking

213
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:06,640
nice. All it would require

214
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,600
to make you the main

215
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,620
character is for

216
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,560
all of those people, almost

217
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,340
200 million human beings,

218
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,540
sit down and shut up about

219
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,660
how they've been treated and continue to be treated

220
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:20,440
on account of brown skin

221
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,820
and or female genitalia,

222
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,580
homosexuality,

223
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,640
transgender issues,

224
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,720
whatever.

225
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,480
But has it occurred to you

226
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
even once that none of you are going to be able to do that?

227
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:32,480


228
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:32,480


229
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,760
None of those people give a fuck about your feelings

230
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:37,000
on the subject any more than you give a rat's

231
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,580
ass about their feelings.

232
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:41,080
Do you not suppose it irritates

233
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,100
them when you open your face

234
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:45,300
and weird rationalizations

235
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,920
as to why they're inferior

236
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,000
and should shut up and vote for their

237
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,060
own oppression? It irritates

238
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,880
me, and I'm as white

239
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,180
bread as you are.

240
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,900
It irritates me

241
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,720
because it's dumb, and you

242
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,800
are a dumb shit, and it really

243
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,340
wouldn't make the world a better place.

244
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:04,220
If you'd shut up, or even

245
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,240
maybe accidentally crash into a gas

246
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,840
truck on the way home from work tonight.

247
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:10,140
Because what all

248
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:12,180
your whining really says

249
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,180
is, I'm afraid to

250
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,100
compete for jobs or mating

251
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,120
chances with that many

252
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,840
people. And

253
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,960
I may be a

254
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:24,180
po-bucker swine, but at least I'm not

255
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:25,560
on the bottom of the heap.

256
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:28,540
But you are, aren't

257
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,220
you? Yes,

258
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:32,040
you're viewed by the vast majority

259
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,020
of the population as a

260
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,840
useless throwback.

261
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,260
Too ugly in spirit

262
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,400
to associate with, and too dumb

263
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,360
to hire. Your day

264
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,080
has been over for

265
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,660
50 years.

266
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,260
You will soon live under a

267
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:50,280
bridge, and your children

268
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,420
will drink filthy water

269
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,440
for the rest of their

270
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,920
lives. Because

271
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,640
you were too lazy

272
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,400
and too cowardly

273
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,060
to stand up on your hind legs

274
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,020
and act like a human being. And

275
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:05,840
the world will not

276
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,100
miss you, nor will

277
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:08,520
I.

278
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:11,000
That was the end of part two.

279
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,100
Nenslo,

280
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,380
eat your heart out.

281
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,100
I'll go ahead and do

282
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,700
part three.

283
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,140
A lot of people think

284
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,180
America is addicted to

285
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:28,160
McDonald's, or TV,

286
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,200
or porn. And

287
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,140
we may very well be, but America's

288
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,020
number one addiction,

289
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,360
the 500-pound monkey on our

290
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:37,700
backs, is

291
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,780
punishment.

292
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,480
We love

293
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,080
punishment. We love

294
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,500
to see no good shits

295
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,040
get theirs, even

296
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:48,960
especially

297
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:51,640
if we do or at one time did

298
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,020
the very same thing we're

299
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,020
hollering about.

300
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,180
This ranges from the public to the

301
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,780
personal. Publicly speaking,

302
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,880
we have 5% of the world's

303
00:16:02,340 --> 00:16:04,620
population and 25% of the world's

304
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,360
incarcerated population.

305
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,620
I think he's talking about the

306
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:08,960
USA.

307
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,660
We lock kids up, as recently

308
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,660
happened in Alabama, for 26

309
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,340
years for a pound of pot.

310
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,900
Given that kid is 19, he'll be

311
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,440
middle-aged when or if he gets

312
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,420
out. His whole life is gone for

313
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,720
a pound of pot.

314
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,460
A large minority of the

315
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,340
population believes that this is

316
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,000
reasonable.

317
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:36,380
We arrest six year olds on

318
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:39,380
felony charges for acting out in

319
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:42,220
class. Then Facebook and Twitter

320
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:43,580
and all the other social media

321
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,580
sites fill up with outrage that

322
00:16:45,580 --> 00:16:46,760
would be appropriate if the

323
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,020
people expressing that outrage

324
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,920
hadn't spent their entire lives

325
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,460
voting for asshats who promised

326
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:55,140
to, quote, get tough on crime,

327
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:57,240
unquote, in a system that is

328
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,460
already very tough on anything

329
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:01,700
even remotely resembling a crime.

330
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,140
Hell,

331
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:03,420
they ran out of crimes.

332
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:05,740
Now they're after six year olds.

333
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,300
This is what you screamed for,

334
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,860
America.

335
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,440
This is what you demanded.

336
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:14,080
Why are you complaining now?

337
00:17:15,940 --> 00:17:17,520
In the private sector, we punish

338
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,060
people by firing them, not just

339
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,760
for things like non-performance

340
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,440
or being drunk on the job, but

341
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:26,460
also for posting things we don't

342
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,860
like on social media or for

343
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:31,440
having the wrong friends and or

344
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,040
police.

345
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:32,480
We punish people by not

346
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,380
having political beliefs or

347
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:36,620
expecting a living wage.

348
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,040
Hell, we even punish our own

349
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,540
friends and family, and not

350
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,420
always by obvious physical abuse,

351
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,500
but also by withholding attention

352
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,500
or affection to show them what.

353
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,760
By deciding that they need to

354
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,560
feel your disdain for a while so

355
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,740
they won't do whatever it was

356
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:59,080
they did to give you the urge to

357
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,340
punish them, then we wake up one

358
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,120
day, won't want to do it again.

359
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:02,120


360
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,500
We wonder where everyone went

361
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,120
and why we're so alone.

362
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,800
It's not a mystery where they

363
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,300
went, really.

364
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,880
They're in jail.

365
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,780
Or under a bridge eating from

366
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,620
garbage cans.

367
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,440
Or they got sick of our emotional

368
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,420
manipulation and just, you know,

369
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:18,980
went away.

370
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,920
But we console ourselves that

371
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,360
they deserve the punishment they

372
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,460
got because they were no good

373
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:27,900
shits anyway and we are an island.

374
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,940
We are better off without their

375
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:30,420
company.

376
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:34,400
And that, friends, is how you get

377
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,760
the utterly psychotic society that

378
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,780
frightens and depresses you so much.

379
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:52,560
I don't know if I got slack from

380
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:53,960
that, good Reverend Roger.

381
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,080
I thought I'd be doing this Church

382
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:59,020
of the Genius thing, good Reverend

383
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,960
Roger, I thought I was going to

384
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,400
get slapped for that, Reverend

385
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,400


386
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,400


387
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,400


388
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,400


389
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,760
Roger, but I'm glad I was able

390
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,540
to get that one out.

391
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,360
I wonder what good Reverend Roger

392
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,640
really sounds like.

393
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:17,200
It could be that he's a, you know,

394
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,440
would be a really good stage actor

395
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,600
or he might be a mush mouth, you

396
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,560
know, scared stage fright.

397
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,700
You should have seen me the first

398
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,380
five years of my life.

399
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,380


400
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,380


401
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,380


402
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,380


403
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,380


404
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,380


405
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,380


406
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,380


407
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,380


408
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,380


409
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:30,380


410
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,860
Preaching in Bucknaked's backyard.

411
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,740
Everybody give good Reverend Roger

412
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,880
who is not here a round of applause.

413
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:01,860
I don't clap my hands,

414
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,920
I don't believe in the earth.

415
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:08,680
Culture is on the ground.

416
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,420
But I don't pay for it,

417
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,440
I don't owe anyone.

418
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,640
I'm just letting the

419
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:18,340
thieves of the world run.

420
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,760
But the good people don't

421
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:22,920
give me a round of applause.

422
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,060
There's another one,

423
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:26,520
a heart of gold.

424
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,360
No, the good people don't

425
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,220
give me a round of applause.

426
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:35,940
I don't like that in a heart of gold

427
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,980
you lie about me.

428
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,880
Except when people

429
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,080
know how to believe.

430
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,800
Now for those of you out there

431
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,260
that don't actually speak French,

432
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,500
this song is called

433
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,700
La Mauvaise Reputation,

434
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,500
which means Bad Reputation.

435
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,300
It was written by a phenomenal

436
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:59,040
musician called George Brassens.

437
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,180
And basically,

438
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,180
I fell in love with this song

439
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:04,100
because it's the ultimate alienation.

440
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:07,120
It's a song about a man

441
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,340
who likes to go his way,

442
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,600
but the people in the village,

443
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,660
they don't like it

444
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,960
when you go your way.

445
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,940
So he feels that they're all

446
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,460
singling him out.

447
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,940
And when they don't like

448
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:17,480
what he's done,

449
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,300
they point their fingers at him,

450
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,400
except for the ones without hands.

451
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,220
And when they don't like

452
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:23,680
what he's done,

453
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,660
they talk about it,

454
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,940
except for the people without tongues.

455
00:21:27,540 --> 00:21:29,120
When he sees a couple of

456
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,980
apple chasers

457
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:32,780
running away from a man

458
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,180
he stole an apple from,

459
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:36,280
he trips the man chasing them.

460
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,680
Because what does he care

461
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,040
if somebody wants to steal

462
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:39,860
a couple apples?

463
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,140
Pas besoin d'être Jérémie

464
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,120
Pour rediviner le sort

465
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,740
qui m'est promis

466
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:54,620
S'il trouve une corde à leur cul

467
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:58,120
Il en peut la passer au cou.

468
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:02,200
Ça ne fait pas tant de tort

469
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,560
à personne.

470
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,980
On se fait voir les chemins

471
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,480
qui ne m'aiment pas.

472
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:11,400
Ah, mais les braves,

473
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:12,860
j'en n'aime pas que

474
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,340
l'on suive une autre route.

475
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:22,360
Les braves, j'en n'aime pas que

476
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,480
l'on suive une autre route.

477
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,100
Si je m'en viens de voir

478
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,080
pendu

479
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:32,660
Sauf les erreurs

480
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,400
Mien entendu.

481
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,740
Have you ever noticed

482
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,660
that you owe

483
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,180
the conspiracy

484
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,660
a big vote of thank you

485
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:54,520
as well as a big vote of fuck you

486
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:56,500
but mostly the thank you.

487
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,500
If it wasn't for the conspiracy

488
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:03,740
filling your minds with crap

489
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,840
filling the airwaves

490
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,780
with cautionary tales

491
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:10,580
of child damaging

492
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,580
horseshit on the learning channel

493
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:16,500
If it wasn't for constant

494
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:20,940
reminders of how you're not

495
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,140
going to be any good at anything

496
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,580
unless you're a celebrity

497
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:29,020
what would we have to rail against?

498
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,840
What would be our calling other than Bob?

499
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,960
How many of us would even know

500
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,120
if Bob was out there looking for us

501
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:40,480
if we didn't rebel against the bullshit?

502
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:46,220
There has to be something for us to

503
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,820
take offense to

504
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,560
in order for us to know who we are.

505
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,560
We all should be able to

506
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:54,560


507
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:54,560


508
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:54,560


509
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:54,560


510
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:57,180
Because we are defined by our adversaries.

511
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,380
Like any good hero.

512
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:00,140
Of any good story.

513
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,680
Batman is shit.

514
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:05,560
If there are no villains to fight.

515
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,540
What is he?

516
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,360
He's a freak who wears a suit.

517
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:12,160
But give him a Joker to fight against.

518
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:14,140
It suddenly becomes interesting.

519
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:17,660
Is that genius?

520
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:19,240
It's not genius.

521
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:19,980
It's only interesting.

522
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:21,860
When we're.

523
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:25,580
Fighting the conspiracy.

524
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:26,700
And the conspiracy.

525
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,340
Thought like we did.

526
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,060
We would be the conspiracy.

527
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,460
And we'd have to hate ourselves.

528
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,740
Which we do far too often anyway.

529
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,340
But.

530
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,400
Not for the right reasons.

531
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,540
We sit there and we hate ourselves.

532
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:45,900
Because the conspiracy tells us we should.

533
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:47,560
Once in a while.

534
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,080
We believe them.

535
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,620
But usually they're just bullshit.

536
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,460
See the conspiracy.

537
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:55,540
Lies to you.

538
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,220
Daily.

539
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,300
They hit you over the head.

540
00:24:58,840 --> 00:24:59,740
Every hour.

541
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,140
Of every day.

542
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,400
To tell you you're not good enough.

543
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,900
You're not smart enough.

544
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,240
You're not pretty enough.

545
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,500
You're not going to get that promotion at work.

546
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,100
You're not going to finish school.

547
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,300
You're just going to be.

548
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:15,360
One more cog in the machine.

549
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,740
But you know what the subgenius's job is?

550
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,460
To put a fucking wrench in that machine.

551
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,440
The subgenius is the wrench.

552
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:24,080
That destroys.

553
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,600
The machine.

554
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:27,820
Or at least fucks it up for a little while.

555
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,220
Until a mechanic can come out.

556
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,540
And figure out why it's not working right.

557
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,180
The conspiracy can only work.

558
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,660
If the people.

559
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:42,100
Who aren't in the conspiracy.

560
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,340
Who are being downtrodden by the conspiracy.

561
00:25:47,020 --> 00:25:47,580
Choose.

562
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,880
To remain.

563
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,900
In their subservient position.

564
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,980
Of being fucked by the conspiracy.

565
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,320
And most people do.

566
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:56,400
Most people don't even question it.

567
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:59,620
But you question it.

568
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,260
And you question it.

569
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,700
Or else you wouldn't be here right now.

570
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,060
You'd be sitting at home.

571
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:07,140
Watching American Idol.

572
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,180
Jerking off.

573
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,300
Drinking beer.

574
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:10,420
And eating potato chips.

575
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:11,740
Getting fat and stupid.

576
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,160
Like every other fucking cow.

577
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,840
Sitting on the couch of America.

578
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,980
But you're not there.

579
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:21,240
You're not waiting to watch fireworks go off.

580
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,960
And some stupid.

581
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:23,920
Televised.

582
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,860
Fourth of July.

583
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:25,580
Bullshit.

584
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,360
Flag waving.

585
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:26,980
Raw.

586
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,420
Raw.

587
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:27,760
Raw.

588
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:28,440
America.

589
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:29,120
Fucking pro.

590
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:32,860
Program on television.

591
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,400
You chose to be here on the Fourth of July.

592
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,300
You know why you're here on the Fourth of July?

593
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,380
Because this is your independence day.

594
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,760
Not American independence.

595
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,740
Your own independence.

596
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:49,560
From.

597
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,200
This world.

598
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,440
From this culture.

599
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:56,040
Which is poisoned and rotten to the fucking core!

600
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,160
This apple.

601
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,660
Has no good seeds in it.

602
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:08,420
Boys and girls.

603
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,540
Ladies and gentlemen.

604
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:13,220
It has borne the seed of rotten fruit.

605
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,040
But that's what the subgenius is different.

606
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,720
You see we don't grow from that tree.

607
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,600
We don't fall like the rest of them apples.

608
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,600
We find ourselves on the ground with those other apples, but we're not apples.

609
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,780
We're not from that apple tree.

610
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:36,000
I don't know what the hell tree we're from, but it ain't a fucking apple tree.

611
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,000
It ain't.

612
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,180
I guess we're an orange tree.

613
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:43,080
An orange you glad you found Bob.

614
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,660
Praise Bob.

615
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,060
And you wonder why that goes out of tune.

616
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,740
Harmonica players blow.

617
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,520
Uh-huh.

618
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:32,900
We found a sweet haven of sunshine at last.

619
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,380
The exists are biting above.

620
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,300
They'll scoop us with tentacles luridly cast.

621
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,060
And smoothly they'll sell us some love.

622
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,040
The dead.

623
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,200
The best is all.

624
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,740
I'll live evermore.

625
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,180
What slackness, what rupture is not.

626
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:58,120
The danger will pass.

627
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:01,880
We're rescued at last.

628
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,240
The end days are here by and by.

629
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:12,500
He sees us endangered and sends out his men to pilot our ping bait and so.

630
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,500
The imps have teased.

631
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,500
He says we will repell the

632
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:17,500


633
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:17,500


634
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:17,500


635
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:17,720
It's start to figure it out.

636
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:23,240
But when we look ahead.

637
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,240


638
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:23,240


639
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:26,620
At the end of thesecurity.

640
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:28,120
Oh Autoboo!

641
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,740
Equestrian

642
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:29,740


643
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:29,740


644
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:29,820
There is who

645
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,040
I

646
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,040
am

647
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,040


648
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,040


649
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,040


650
00:29:31,040 --> 00:29:31,160
am

651
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:31,160


652
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,260
am

653
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:32,800
r

654
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:32,820
r

655
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,960
r

656
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:37,720
world

657
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:37,720


658
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,300
black

659
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,300


660
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:39,620
I

661
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:39,880
did

662
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,020
by and by.

663
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:45,640
We're discovered

664
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:45,640


665
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:45,640


666
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:45,640


667
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:45,640


668
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:45,640


669
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:45,640


670
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:45,640


671
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:45,640


672
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:45,640


673
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:01,420
Scrantz, Jalkin, Trollme, through life and in death

674
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,660
Unbob all my money, all speddened

675
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:08,840
All praising each hour of my last fleeting breath

676
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:11,780
Repent and slack off to the end

677
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:19,000
The tempest is o'er, not safe evermore

678
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,900
When darkness but rupture is nigh

679
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,800
Yet pain through his past

680
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,460
We're rescued at last

681
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,600
The end is our nearby and by

682
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:41,540
The tempest is o'er, not safe evermore

683
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:45,020
When darkness but rupture is nigh

684
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:48,660
Yet pain through his past

685
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,080
We're rescued at last

686
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:55,560
The end is our nearby and by

687
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:09,180
Uh, yes, dear friends.

688
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:11,760
It's not from this earth.

689
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:12,760
Is it?

690
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:14,300
Uh, no.

691
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:16,860
It's from the Twilight Zone.

692
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,300
And from, uh, 17X Day.

693
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,260
That was the Mutant Mountain Boys, Dave.

694
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:26,800
Who also sang, uh, the billowing pipe earlier.

695
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:33,880
But the, uh, the rant just before that was Reverend Manx Darkpaw.

696
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:39,380
The French song was Fat Man D of Pittsburgh.

697
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:44,520
The squeaky rant was Baby Bear, Reverend Baby Bear.

698
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,520
And Andrew the Impaled started the show.

699
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,780
And Dave will destroy this show.

700
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,300
Ha ha.

701
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,180
Man.

702
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:52,660
Oh, ha ha.

703
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,280
Well, I was so proud of you.

704
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,380
You look pretty well put.

705
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,080
You know, it was basically the last part where you, you know,

706
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,720
the way you said, uh, whatever the hell you said.

707
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:06,040
And I just want to, I want to offer my sincerest thanks

708
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,500
to all those people who make me.

709
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,400
Thank you.

710
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:08,700
Thank you.

711
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:09,360
Thank you.

712
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,360


713
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,360


714
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,360


715
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,360


716
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,360


717
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,360


718
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,360


719
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,360


720
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,360


721
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,360


722
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,360


723
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,360


724
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,360


725
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:09,360


726
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,540
Thank you.

727
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:13,540
Of the, uh, what the hell is it?

728
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:17,600
You, um, the, the people's choice of the people's choice,

729
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,260
I think something like that.

730
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:19,780
Wasn't it?

731
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:23,080
No, it was the, it had something to do with Eucalyptus T

732
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:28,180
or Euclidean logic or thinking or.

733
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,220
Well, in that case, we're all lost.

734
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,280
Yes.

735
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:35,080
I thought you were going to say we're all lost.

736
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,060
No, no.

737
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,360
Lost is different from lost.

738
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,360


739
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:39,580
I'm screwed.

740
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,720
I think.

741
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:41,780
Yeah.

742
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:42,440
Yes.

743
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,540
It's not quite screwed.

744
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:44,520
It's just lost.

745
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:50,060
Well, it curls my eyebrows and it's pushing my teeth out real far.

746
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,520
So, you know,

747
00:32:53,320 --> 00:33:02,780
Well, Dave, are you still, are you still walking funny?

748
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,120
Yeah.

749
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,720
I'm walking funnier than ever and more normal than ever.

750
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:08,140
It's it bedevils me.

751
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,960
Yeah.

752
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,340
But, you know, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not walking funny.

753
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:09,340


754
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:12,660
I don't know why you find that incidental or coincidentally curious.

755
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:21,940
Well, the last time we saw you in the flesh, we actually saw you walking funny as you walked away into the sunset.

756
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,280
You walked even funnier and funnier.

757
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:29,980
The more we looked, you were doing like a Charlie Chaplin and then all kinds of funny walks.

758
00:33:29,980 --> 00:33:32,840
Princess, I'm afraid that wasn't an act.

759
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:33,300
Oh.

760
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:46,220
Well, doing the Ministry of Silly Walks routine, Monty Python, kind of makes it, you know, doing some exaggerated, like when you said Charlie Chaplin, some exaggerated motions like that.

761
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:53,540
Or doing Wobble Knees or Uncle Grandpa or the Toyotor or any of those characters, you know, Popeye.

762
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,460
Oh, man, the list is really, really long.

763
00:33:56,560 --> 00:34:03,060
And if you use the same guidelines that you've been given by the Church of the Subdue,

764
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:03,280
you're going to be a little bit more of a character.

765
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,280
I assume.

766
00:34:05,500 --> 00:34:06,200
I don't know.

767
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:11,620
Yeah, but a funny walk isn't funny anymore if that's the only way you can walk, is it?

768
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,600
Or is it?

769
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,120
I don't know.

770
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,060
No, no.

771
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:20,340
What I meant was if I do one of them funny walks, one of them silly walks, it makes it go away.

772
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,300
The actual.

773
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:24,080
Oh, the actual cripple.

774
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,020
I know what you mean.

775
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,080
Yeah, yeah.

776
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,520
Do you exaggerate emotion?

777
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,480
You have these problems also?

778
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:33,100
Well, I just assume that that's why you talk the way.

779
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:33,760
That's why you do also.

780
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:38,340
The funny talk and the funny walk.

781
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:49,400
The funny talk and the funny walk kind of cover the not-so-funny reality underlying the problem.

782
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,940
Unfortunately, that's true.

783
00:34:53,040 --> 00:35:01,740
But I thought there would be brighter, more extravagant things to poke tonight than the draggled body of an old fuzzy pig

784
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,860
that's been barbecued.

785
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:03,580
That's been barbecued too long.

786
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,120
Well, you know, some people probably would say,

787
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:10,880
well, I want more excitement in the hour of slack and in my own life.

788
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:16,700
But you see, I'm not sure that excitement is all it's cracked up to be.

789
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:18,440
I'm not either.

790
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:24,500
Almost every time I had a real exciting time, it was also a real terrifying and inconvenient time.

791
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:25,280
Yes.

792
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:26,480
Yes.

793
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:29,840
The yogis claim this is true.

794
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,640
They claim that, you know, aversion and traction.

795
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,760
Being the only force, major forces in the universe tend to cancel each other out.

796
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:44,420
And that the wise, you know, the sages say that it all pretty much sucks.

797
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:49,320
Well, that's why I get excited, you know, or something like that, I guess.

798
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:56,520
In the last few years, I feel like I've been seeking out something closer to boredom than excitement.

799
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,380
Yeah.

800
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,180
I put my music in the background.

801
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:02,440
That wasn't very exciting.

802
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:08,020
Oh, suddenly everything's more exciting with this old Twilight Zone music in the background.

803
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:08,400
Yes.

804
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:09,940
The third character.

805
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:11,740
The background music.

806
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:19,080
The ploy used by most con artists and secret delivery men to get their point across when there's no plot.

807
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,860
No theme.

808
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:20,840
The Twilight Zone.

809
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,580
Ain't no burping or barbecue pigging allowed, man.

810
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,540
What?

811
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:35,700
I was just thinking about the last time I had, well, last time I had anything.

812
00:36:36,220 --> 00:36:37,160
You know what I mean?

813
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:39,560
Metaphysically speaking, I think it's so deep.

814
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:44,980
What about like a bathroom session, if you had one of those in a while?

815
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,680
Because that could account for a lot.

816
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:47,900
Bathroom sessions?

817
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:48,500
Yeah.

818
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:52,120
If it was the last time you went to the bathroom, maybe that's what's missing from your life.

819
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,800
Is that possible?

820
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,360
Just this.

821
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:02,500
A few brief moments ago, before calling the show, I relieved myself.

822
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:03,840
How about you?

823
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:05,360
Pics or it didn't happen.

824
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,060
JPEGs or it didn't happen.

825
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:15,560
Always chastising our poor dear Dave for taking things to the bathroom and then you go bringing it up.

826
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:16,940
Tsk, tsk.

827
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:23,480
Well, actually, why do you think we play a half hour of canned material at the first half of the show?

828
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,980
So I can go to the bathroom.

829
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:26,640
Okay.

830
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:36,660
I know some subgenius shows, they put on half an hour of canned recordings so that they can go out on the porch and smoke pot.

831
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:37,760
No.

832
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,280
Let's just say it plainly.

833
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:39,540
No.

834
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,340
Some subgenius radio shows, that's what they do.

835
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:42,880
Oh, come on.

836
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,820
What do you think they mean when they say rock it away?

837
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,400
You don't do that anymore.

838
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,780
Let's go rock it away.

839
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:47,560
Jeez.

840
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,040
Duh.

841
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:51,820
So, like I say, I can't.

842
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,880
It's an industry that's now collapsed into itself.

843
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,520
Well, I don't see what, you know, you're taking, going to the bathroom.

844
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,080
I mean, going to the bathroom regularly is a good thing.

845
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:02,420
If regularly means going every five seconds.

846
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,440
Yeah, exactly.

847
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:10,360
But it's, it has somehow replaced going out to the porch to smoke pot every five seconds.

848
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,420
At least during these radio shows.

849
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,200
Back in the day, it was different, of course.

850
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,760
Heck, back in the day, we'd smoke pot right on the air.

851
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,680
But of course, you know, now we have lungs.

852
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:26,640
They've made us wear lungs inside of our bodies and we can't do any of that stuff.

853
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:26,860
Just think about it.

854
00:38:26,860 --> 00:38:28,020
Not to mention the cameras.

855
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,180
The ashtrays we used to have in the studio.

856
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:33,620
Right in the studio, not in the lounge, but right next to all that delicate equipment.

857
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:34,060
Yeah.

858
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:35,300
There were ashtrays.

859
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:36,040
Right.

860
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,260
And coffee cup holders.

861
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:42,000
Because you do this gig and you're going to go smoke a bunch of cigarettes and drink a lot of coffee.

862
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:45,080
So you're all loquacious and lugubrious and stuff like that there.

863
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:45,780
There's not.

864
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:46,740
Meanwhile, the people in the.

865
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,080
Huh?

866
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:47,700
Nobody.

867
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,300
There's no, there's no ashtrays around here.

868
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,800
There's not even a coffee machine.

869
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:53,860
No.

870
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,740
I have to drink all my coffee before the show.

871
00:38:56,740 --> 00:38:59,440
So does that maybe explain the first half hour now?

872
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:02,180
Do I have to go dribble and leak?

873
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,740
There's no flexible devices allowed in that place either anymore now, thanks to you.

874
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:11,060
Well, I'll admit we got kind of carried away that one time with the devices.

875
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,920
That was on Chaz's show, though.

876
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:13,720
That was a long time ago.

877
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:14,620
You were just too close to the window.

878
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:15,080
That's all.

879
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,880
You thought you were God.

880
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:18,320
Or Dobbs.

881
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:20,600
And perhaps, no, you weren't.

882
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:21,880
Well, it wasn't that.

883
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,840
I thought that if I was near.

884
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:23,680
You weren't a God or something.

885
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,720
If I was near the window, I thought nobody would be able to see me.

886
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:26,720


887
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:26,720


888
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,960
I could smell the sex devices that we were using in the station.

889
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,200
Sex devices?

890
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,020
Yeah.

891
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,900
What kind of radio show is this?

892
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,620
That was over seven years ago.

893
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,580
So it doesn't matter.

894
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:40,720
The spirit of discernment has run out, or whatever you call it.

895
00:39:40,820 --> 00:39:41,480
Goodness gracious.

896
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:46,380
The law of atonement, or the seven-year itch it's over with.

897
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,660
So we can admit that we did it, and nobody can throw us in jail.

898
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:53,700
But we can't admit that we do it anymore, because we can't do it anymore.

899
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:56,460
Because they've made us wear these lungs inside.

900
00:39:58,280 --> 00:39:59,580
Why am I laughing?

901
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,540
It's the most horrible thing I've ever heard in my life.

902
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:06,280
You're talking about the degenerative decay of your multiple bodily tissues,

903
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:12,720
including not only our puritan bodily excretions.

904
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:16,240
That's why they put defluoridation in the water.

905
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:16,980
Right.

906
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,760
You're saying mal-create, miscreate, and stuff.

907
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:22,160
You're coming up with, man.

908
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:25,620
Well, that marijuana stuff is bad for your lungs.

909
00:40:25,620 --> 00:40:27,020
It's bad for your brain.

910
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:35,680
It's bad for the bathtub, the sink, your pets, your car, and your soul.

911
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,060
Now, that's different from frop.

912
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:44,880
Subgenius is, of course, smoke, habifrop, zippulops, meriphase, alumina, lupina.

913
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:45,960
It's completely different.

914
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,060
What keeps happening to my background music?

915
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,260
Oh, it keeps ending.

916
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:51,440
It just fades away.

917
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:53,240
It's fading down, man.

918
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:54,700
It fades.

919
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:55,360
It just fades.

920
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:55,600
It just fades.

921
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:55,600


922
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:55,600


923
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,160
It just fades.

924
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:58,240
It just fades.

925
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:58,320
It just fades.

926
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:03,320
You know, that's why we're all smelling so bad lately.

927
00:41:03,940 --> 00:41:05,560
What, because the music ended?

928
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:07,540
It has nothing to do with Bob Dobbs.

929
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:10,580
He's a slackmeister, a B-slackmeister, sure.

930
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:11,920
Sure enough.

931
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:13,900
Sure.

932
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,400
Sure he is, man.

933
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,000
He's the abattoir of slack.

934
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,320
An abattoir has two Ts.

935
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:22,940
Abattoir.

936
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:24,840
There isn't even a word abattoir.

937
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:25,600
There's abattoir.

938
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,500
What's abattoir?

939
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:26,540
What's abattoir?

940
00:41:26,540 --> 00:41:27,240
No, abattoir.

941
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,560
An abattoir is like a slaughterhouse.

942
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,600
Yes, it's the place where blood goes when it's being drained from a slaughterhouse animal.

943
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:35,320
Yeah.

944
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:41,280
And also, they used to drain humans to do experiments on them in the early days of embalming.

945
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:48,300
Yeah, and so Dobbs is the abattoir of slack and the saint of sales and all that.

946
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:48,960
Right, right.

947
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:54,960
So you get a reward after you slash your wrist and put your glimmy in a frying pan or something

948
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:55,520
like that.

949
00:41:55,720 --> 00:41:57,960
Well, but it's more of a slack abattoir.

950
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:05,000
You know, it sounds pretty, you know, denominational to me if you understand my lack of cryptography.

951
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:20,660
Well, the abattoir of Dobbs is where the slack runs out of his products and gathers in this

952
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:21,660
sort of a basin.

953
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,940
They throw the bones of the slack into the...

954
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,320
What do you call the place where they keep the bones?

955
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:28,560
The...

956
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:30,380
Estuary.

957
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,780
Yeah, I...

958
00:42:31,780 --> 00:42:34,460
No, that's a river...

959
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:35,160
A tributary.

960
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,040
Yeah, yeah, a tributary.

961
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:41,060
No, I shouldn't have...

962
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,380
Transsexual factory.

963
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:42,900
Osteo...

964
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:44,320
Universal...

965
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,640
I don't know.

966
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:52,100
I think that frop we smoked earlier today was almost as harmful as the marijuana that

967
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:53,200
we were referring to.

968
00:42:53,340 --> 00:42:54,920
I have no idea what you're...

969
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:55,880
That's why.

970
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:56,740
That's what I mean.

971
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:57,800
That's what I'm saying.

972
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:04,260
It was either really, really good frop or really bad frop, but that's why none of us understand

973
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:07,020
or can remember any of these words.

974
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,600
Well, sometimes words were not meant to be remembered.

975
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:19,080
They're meant to be experienced as an emotional discharge of Bob's food nostril mucuses, which

976
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,320
are delicious and delightful in every, every way you want to make one.

977
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,900
Well, I put a little bit of...

978
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,320
I put a little bit of yellow rice and some beans on top of that.

979
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,940
Now you're talking some trash talk.

980
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,580
Are you talking about that mucus soup?

981
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:36,100
Maybe like a little ragu bolognese, you know, like kind of a meat sauce with a...

982
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:36,880
I'm sorry.

983
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:38,780
You're talking about the...

984
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:39,920
I like the meat sauce part.

985
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:40,820
The Dobbs mucus.

986
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,080
Let's go back to the meat sauce.

987
00:43:42,300 --> 00:43:42,940
Mucus soup.

988
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,060
Let's stay away from anything mucus.

989
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:48,260
What do you think was in that soup that made it so good?

990
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,200
That big pot of soup I made yesterday?

991
00:43:51,080 --> 00:43:51,960
Not mucus.

992
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:53,360
The Dobbs runoff.

993
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,140
You know, when he leaves the room, there's always that...

994
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,720
Well, I will not be eating any more of your foods.

995
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,420
Just so you know, Reverend Stang, I'm done.

996
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,760
You'll have to eat your own foods now.

997
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,780
Well, that means you're going to have to go back to cooking for me.

998
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,880
Because when I'm cooking for you, I'm using...

999
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,140
You know how to cook canned chili.

1000
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:18,580
And you expect gourmet whey every night when you come home from staying at home.

1001
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:19,240
Yeah.

1002
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:19,780
I believe it.

1003
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:20,340
Yeah, I do.

1004
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:24,660
And she's supposed to be wearing one of them French...

1005
00:44:24,920 --> 00:44:26,780
Made uniforms and all that stuff like that.

1006
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:27,720
I remember all the stuff.

1007
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,020
She won't do that anymore.

1008
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,620
The feminists got to her.

1009
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:34,680
Now she doesn't wear anything when she's cooking.

1010
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:36,220
Just an apron.

1011
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:40,380
And there's a little cloud over your head.

1012
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:43,080
It's not a bad or a good cloud.

1013
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:44,020
It's just a cloud.

1014
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:47,720
It's a formation of ice crystals and pure water.

1015
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:54,040
Clowns are made of ice crystals and pure water?

1016
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:54,600
I don't know.

1017
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,260
I don't know.

1018
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:56,260


1019
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:59,120
I learned a word for the fear of clowns.

1020
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,520
But I then lost it.

1021
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,040
It's like chlorophobia or something like that.

1022
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:03,700
Yeah.

1023
00:45:04,220 --> 00:45:05,800
And it is real.

1024
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:09,420
It's a common fear, the fear of clowns.

1025
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:17,020
Well, I just saw a poster of a clown that was appearing at an event that really...

1026
00:45:17,020 --> 00:45:20,920
You know, I poo-poo all of that stuff about clowns.

1027
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:22,780
I thought that was so nice.

1028
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,320
You know, their lack of humor and their...

1029
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:28,980
Their feelings of terror that they instill in some people.

1030
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:34,220
And yet, at the same time, this guy was trying to make me depressed, man.

1031
00:45:35,440 --> 00:45:36,400
Same with him.

1032
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,940
What, a clown was trying to make you depressed?

1033
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,800
You're lucky he wasn't trying to kill you.

1034
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:42,460
I don't know what kind of laughs he could get.

1035
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:47,620
He looked like his father beat him up a real lot when he was maybe a little boy or something like that.

1036
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:48,840
Clowns are the saddest.

1037
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:50,100
And then drank and stuff like that.

1038
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:52,760
They're the saddest people in the whole world, clowns.

1039
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,280
Oh, man.

1040
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:53,660
It was serious.

1041
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,500
That's why they're so fiendish.

1042
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:58,520
I'm not going to let myself laugh about who I am.

1043
00:45:59,000 --> 00:45:59,680
I refuse.

1044
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,540
I would not go in there.

1045
00:46:02,780 --> 00:46:03,820
Something like that.

1046
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:04,540
I don't know.

1047
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:09,640
The fear of clowns has existed much, much longer than insane clown posse.

1048
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:10,960
Well...

1049
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:11,640
More than what?

1050
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:16,500
I have a fear of being a clown.

1051
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,640
I'm not afraid of other people who are clowns.

1052
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:21,520
I'm afraid of...

1053
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:22,680
I have...

1054
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,140
Oh, yeah.

1055
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:23,600
I have been...

1056
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:23,640
Oh, yeah.

1057
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:24,520
I have been being a clownophobia.

1058
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,260
Oh, yeah.

1059
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,360
I was traumatized by...

1060
00:46:28,360 --> 00:46:28,920
Really?

1061
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:29,340
Really?

1062
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:31,840
You think your job can be bad, Dave?

1063
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,100
You were abused, right?

1064
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,540
You were abused by a circus clown.

1065
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:42,660
At one point, the only job I could get was as a mime delivering balloons to parties and dying people.

1066
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:47,020
Yeah, I was Snoopy one time in front of a mall that was opening.

1067
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:47,500
Really?

1068
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,580
Yeah.

1069
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:52,040
Well, the sad thing about me running around as a mime...

1070
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:52,780
Yeah.

1071
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:53,520
I had to wear this.

1072
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:54,940
I had to wear this white face makeup, right?

1073
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:55,780
Like mimes do.

1074
00:46:56,260 --> 00:47:00,860
I was instructed not to ever speak on my deliveries.

1075
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,080
And I wore a little tuxedo and stuff.

1076
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:08,980
But one afternoon, I and my balloons got into an elevator and the doors closed.

1077
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:15,860
And I turned around and there was a mom holding her little kid who instantly went into terrible hysterics.

1078
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:21,800
This kid was so panic stricken at the hideous white faced man that it...

1079
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,300
And I...

1080
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,460
And it was in an elevator.

1081
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:24,880
And we couldn't get out.

1082
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,220
I couldn't just open the door.

1083
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,060
Oh, sorry, ma'am.

1084
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:28,060
And leave.

1085
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:30,980
You know, we had to wait until the door opened.

1086
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:37,080
So I was forced to sit in here scaring this child to death, dressed as a clown.

1087
00:47:37,540 --> 00:47:44,880
Later that day, my car broke down outside the Salvation Army in Dallas, Texas on that hot, sunny day.

1088
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:53,440
And I had to get out of my car, go into the Salvation Army, holding my balloons and call the office and the tow truck.

1089
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:54,240
And so forth.

1090
00:47:54,980 --> 00:48:01,340
And as I left, all these homeless people, by lining the hallways, were going,

1091
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,140
Can I have a balloon?

1092
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:05,520
Just one balloon?

1093
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:06,460
You're a clown.

1094
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:09,720
Won't you give me just one balloon?

1095
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:18,720
But you know, somebody had paid 50 bucks to have an idiot deliver 10 balloons to the dying lady in the hospital up the hill.

1096
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:18,980
Oh, man.

1097
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:23,420
And sure enough, I had to trudge up the hill to the hospital.

1098
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:23,420


1099
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:23,420


1100
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:26,240
To get rid of the balloons and finish my job.

1101
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:31,500
And there was another homeless man camped in a box near the road.

1102
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:37,420
And he didn't like this white-faced person walking by his homeless encampment.

1103
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:40,920
And he came out and yelled incoherently at me.

1104
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:46,940
And since I was a mime, all I could do was turn around and yell silently at him.

1105
00:48:47,580 --> 00:48:51,400
And that scared him back into his cardboard box.

1106
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:52,360
Right.

1107
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:53,400
That was my...

1108
00:48:53,420 --> 00:48:54,720
That was my life as a clown.

1109
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:59,080
And by the way, it paid minimum wage.

1110
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:00,800
It was about two bucks an hour.

1111
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,380
And it was a rip-off job.

1112
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:06,740
Because one of those jobs where you have to drive your own car and pay for the gas and repairs.

1113
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,340
And you only get 15 bucks a delivery.

1114
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,140
And you only get one delivery a day.

1115
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,100
Yeah.

1116
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,080
So it's a sucker job.

1117
00:49:15,340 --> 00:49:21,060
Well, Stang, you know, according to common neocon logic,

1118
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:34,260
had you the acrimony and the fastidious testicles to endeavor yourself to working 24 hours a day without resting at any point in time during that 24 hours,

1119
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:38,520
you could be as rich as, name a billionaire.

1120
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,640
Lunch and Cowboy Day.

1121
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,140
Ha ha.

1122
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:43,980
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1123
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:45,120
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1124
00:49:47,020 --> 00:49:48,100
I don't...

1125
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,520
I think I might be some kind of political lunatic lately.

1126
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,140
You might be in a political lunatic?

1127
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:57,280
What?

1128
00:49:57,480 --> 00:50:02,500
Not the asylum itself, but kind of like the scabbard of inequity, if you might.

1129
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:03,400
If you're, you know...

1130
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:04,280
The scabbard of inequity?

1131
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:08,960
Metaphorically implying some kind of, you know, some kind of...

1132
00:50:08,960 --> 00:50:10,780
No, I don't know.

1133
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,940
No, I feel like that, you know, we're like, remember...

1134
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:16,080
What's his name?

1135
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:17,860
McNee or...

1136
00:50:17,860 --> 00:50:17,980
No.

1137
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:21,060
What's his name in Prisoner?

1138
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:22,980
Patrick McGee.

1139
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:23,920
Prisoner number seven?

1140
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:24,540
Yeah.

1141
00:50:24,620 --> 00:50:25,080
Yeah, number seven.

1142
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:26,140
I am number...

1143
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:29,200
Who is number one?

1144
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,980
You are number six.

1145
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,260
I'm not a number.

1146
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:34,280
I'm a Freeman.

1147
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:36,580
A Fremen.

1148
00:50:36,780 --> 00:50:37,340
Fremen.

1149
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:41,420
You're a human being and you live on donuts, you know?

1150
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,200
No, I'm a Fremen and I live on Dune, the desert planet.

1151
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,080
I'm a Mentat Fremen.

1152
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,340
I'm a Fremen Jedi Vulcan.

1153
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:53,140
You may call me...

1154
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:55,920
You may call me Mr. Smarty Pants.

1155
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,600
Smarty Pants?

1156
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:04,260
I will call you Monsieur Smarty Pants just to further the stupidity of your Smarty Pants.

1157
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:05,940
What do you think about that then?

1158
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:06,960
Sometimes.

1159
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:08,020
Eh?

1160
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,240
Oh, he's a Frenchman now.

1161
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:10,820
I see.

1162
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:12,800
A wee-wee.

1163
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:14,200
A wee-wee, Monsieur.

1164
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:15,920
Don't poo-poo his wee-wee.

1165
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:16,820
I won't poo-poo his wee-wee.

1166
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:17,140
Right.

1167
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,200
Yeah, Mr. Smarty Diapers or something.

1168
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,420
Do you have any grey poo-poo?

1169
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:28,980
Boy, this show sometimes just dives right off the edge into the garbage can.

1170
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:29,180
Sometimes?

1171
00:51:29,180 --> 00:51:29,820
Not all the time.

1172
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:31,600
It was good the first half.

1173
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,360
Remember all the canned stuff recorded at 17X Day?

1174
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:38,680
All those people with their carefully written out rants and stuff?

1175
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,340
As if we weren't reading a script right now.

1176
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:42,760
Right.

1177
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:43,660
Really?

1178
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:46,800
Well, I lost two pages in the process and I had to read the script.

1179
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:48,900
I had to write the script and stuff upside down thanks to my machine.

1180
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,400
Who can tell the difference, though?

1181
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,420
That's the marvelous thing about the sub-genius radio ministry.

1182
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:55,860
Hour of Slur.

1183
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,800
That's the Rudy Schwartz project in the background.

1184
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,480
They're projecting.

1185
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:10,540
I thought I was behind there somewhere.

1186
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:12,040
Yep.

1187
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:13,080
Yep.

1188
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,780
I'm no Rudy Schwartz for one reason.

1189
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:16,780


1190
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:16,780


1191
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:17,240
What he was?

1192
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:20,020
I know Rudy Schwartz back then.

1193
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:20,800
I know him.

1194
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,760
I appreciate his work very much.

1195
00:52:22,860 --> 00:52:27,360
I hate to sound so normal and maudlin and human and, you know.

1196
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,620
Jethro Tull was a member of his band.

1197
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:34,460
Rudy Schwartz and his guitar player, Jethro Tull, used to jam a lot.

1198
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:36,420
He had a guitar player named Jethro Tull?

1199
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,620
Well, Rudy Schwartz is like Jethro Tull.

1200
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:45,980
It's the name of the band, and there's not really a person involved by that name.

1201
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:48,520
A lot of people probably didn't know that.

1202
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:54,180
No, after 25,000 years, I did not know that Rudy was not a real duty.

1203
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,300
No, Rudy is like Ivan Stang or Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1204
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,460
Or Princess Weed.

1205
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:00,760
Yeah, they're just made-up characters.

1206
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,360
Part of the aggregate spew.

1207
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:08,160
They're just weird characters created by J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1208
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:13,980
Bob Dobbs, J.R. Bob Dobbs created these characters.

1209
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,140
And, uh...

1210
00:53:15,980 --> 00:53:19,180
I understand Marvel just settled out of court

1211
00:53:19,180 --> 00:53:24,280
so they can finally do the subgenius movie without ever paying any of the creators.

1212
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:25,460
Really?

1213
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:31,100
Actually, I read that Marvel just settled with the Jack Kirby estate

1214
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:33,240
after all these decades.

1215
00:53:34,460 --> 00:53:38,500
Jack Kirby was the guy who actually created half of those superhero characters

1216
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,760
that are making billions for Disney now.

1217
00:53:42,380 --> 00:53:45,740
So you can imagine the Jack Kirby estate.

1218
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,640
The Jack Kirby estate would want a tiny cut.

1219
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,280
They don't want to end up like the estate of the guys who created Superman.

1220
00:53:54,380 --> 00:53:56,460
Or Bob Kane or Jim Yard.

1221
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:01,400
Well, even worse than Jimi Hendrix's bandmates.

1222
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:03,760
Who didn't get anything.

1223
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:05,500
Yeah.

1224
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:12,400
Oh, speaking of bands, Dave, do you remember a musician named Tom Lehrer?

1225
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,640
Yes, of course.

1226
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,960
Of course.

1227
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:19,300
Eric's probably played Tom Lehrer records, right?

1228
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:25,980
Yes, he was a satirical aardvark for the left-wing superiorities.

1229
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,360
Well, he was a Harvard math professor who also...

1230
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:30,560
Oh, I thought...

1231
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:35,140
...had a gig on the side doing satire original songs.

1232
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:39,900
Long before Eric Idle and Monty Python and those guys were doing their funny songs,

1233
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:41,700
Tom Lehrer was doing funny songs.

1234
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,680
And the reason I mention this...

1235
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,520
...is because...

1236
00:54:45,520 --> 00:54:50,020
Because there was a Tom Lehrer song performed at 17X Day.

1237
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,820
Did you do it in the first half hour?

1238
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:57,900
No, I'm going to play it in the last five minutes, which are coming up in about one minute.

1239
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,240
And that's why I mentioned that.

1240
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:08,160
Reverend Andrew the Impaled suddenly launched into the song Masochism Tango.

1241
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,680
He wasn't on his own.

1242
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:10,760
I was thinking of it.

1243
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:16,720
He was not on his own cognizance or his own keyboard.

1244
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:17,640
That's what it is.

1245
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:19,540
He had to borrow somebody else's keyboard.

1246
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,340
So it's kind of sounds strangely broken and funny.

1247
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:26,140
But I'm going to play that in about one minute.

1248
00:55:27,460 --> 00:55:31,360
Hasn't our time together flown ever so quickly?

1249
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,400
It always does.

1250
00:55:35,160 --> 00:55:37,960
Well, now, sometimes it crawls interminably.

1251
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,620
And I keep looking at my watch going, oh, my God, it's owing.

1252
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:42,380
Only 30 seconds have passed.

1253
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:43,840
That seemed like three hours.

1254
00:55:44,620 --> 00:55:46,940
When is this god awful show going to be over?

1255
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,900
That's what the listeners are all saying right now.

1256
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,140
No, they're not.

1257
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,100
Yeah, especially if you're the wrong monastery.

1258
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:57,400
You know, who can tell it's going to show up at your doorstep?

1259
00:56:01,600 --> 00:56:03,880
Well, Dave, you know what show this is.

1260
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:06,280
The Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1261
00:56:06,540 --> 00:56:07,720
And you know what number it is.

1262
00:56:07,780 --> 00:56:10,280
Number 1485.

1263
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:11,740
Whoa.

1264
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:13,860
We're coming up on 1500.

1265
00:56:15,740 --> 00:56:17,200
Boy, that's prestigious.

1266
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:20,180
That's grandiose and humorless.

1267
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:24,660
It's get a life is what it is.

1268
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,500
I can't.

1269
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:28,160
How many weeks?

1270
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:34,980
One thousand four hundred and eighty five of subgenius.com,

1271
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:37,700
which is where you can find out about all the stuff.

1272
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,580
It's a proud.

1273
00:56:38,840 --> 00:56:40,200
Buy that by 52.

1274
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,900
And it's 300 weeks.

1275
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:46,940
Or no, 300 days of pure show.

1276
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,800
Of 300 days, a whole year.

1277
00:56:49,980 --> 00:56:53,600
There's crazy people out there who just listen to one show after another.

1278
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:54,520
Oh, man.

1279
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:56,460
That's all they can do.

1280
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:58,540
They were like real devoted listeners out there.

1281
00:56:58,540 --> 00:56:59,880
What we've done to their brains.

1282
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:03,560
The ones I feel sorry for are the ones in Germany.

1283
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,860
In Germany?

1284
00:57:06,040 --> 00:57:07,640
Yeah, because they can't stop listening.

1285
00:57:08,380 --> 00:57:09,860
Anyway, I'm going to go ahead.

1286
00:57:09,860 --> 00:57:10,720
And play this.

1287
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:12,180
That's kind of our team.

1288
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:12,500
Yeah.

1289
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:17,860
I'll leave you on, Dave, so that you can hear the masochism tango.

1290
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:19,240
Yeah.

1291
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:22,400
As performed by the great Andrew the Impaled.

1292
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:29,680
I ache for the touch of your lips, dear.

1293
00:57:30,040 --> 00:57:33,860
But much more for the touch of your whips, dear.

1294
00:57:34,480 --> 00:57:38,160
You can raise welts like nobody else.

1295
00:57:38,180 --> 00:57:39,840
As we dance to the melody.

1296
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:39,840


1297
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:40,820
Masochism tango.

1298
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:44,760
May our love be a flame, not an ember.

1299
00:57:45,140 --> 00:57:48,420
Say it's me that you want to dismember.

1300
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,180
Blacken my eyes.

1301
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,740
Set fire to my tie.

1302
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,560
As we dance to the masochism tango.

1303
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:56,980
Bash in my brain.

1304
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,440
And make me scream in pain.

1305
00:57:58,780 --> 00:57:59,860
And kill me once again.

1306
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:01,740
And say we'll never part.

1307
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:03,460
You know too well.

1308
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:05,060
I'm underneath your spell.

1309
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:08,420
So darling, if you smell something burning, it's my heart.

1310
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:09,840
Your heart's burning.

1311
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:09,840


1312
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:09,840


1313
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:09,840


1314
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:09,840


1315
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:09,840


1316
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:09,840


1317
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:09,840


1318
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:09,840


1319
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:11,660
It's hot as stone or mahogany.

1320
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,200
That's why I'm in such exquisite agony.

1321
00:58:15,980 --> 00:58:18,000
My soul is a fire.

1322
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:19,480
It's aflame with desire.

1323
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,000
Which is why I perspire when we tango.

1324
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:25,700
You caught my nose.

1325
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:28,960
In your left castanet.

1326
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:29,600
Love.

1327
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,140
I can feel the pain yet.

1328
00:58:32,380 --> 00:58:33,020
Love.

1329
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:35,460
Every time I hear drums.

1330
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,680
And I envy the rose.

1331
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:42,140
That you held in your teeth.

1332
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:43,040
Love.

1333
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:45,180
With the thorns underneath.

1334
00:58:45,820 --> 00:58:46,420
Love.

1335
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:48,900
Sticking into your gums.

1336
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:54,860
Your eyes cast a spell that bewitches.

1337
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,960
The last time I needed twenty stitches.

1338
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:00,740
To sew up the gash.

1339
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,200
You made with your lash.

1340
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,660
As we dance to the masochism tango.

1341
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:06,100
Bash in my brain.

1342
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:07,520
And make me scream in pain.

1343
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,940
And kill me once again.

1344
00:59:09,100 --> 00:59:09,820
And say we'll never part.

1345
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:10,500
You will never part.

1346
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:12,400
You know too well.

1347
00:59:12,620 --> 00:59:14,420
You're underneath my spell.

1348
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,920
So darling if you smell something burning.

1349
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,720
It's my heart.

1350
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,460
And take your cigarette from its holder.

1351
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:22,620
See I know I'm in the right place.

1352
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,460
And burn your initials in my shoulder.

1353
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:28,040
Fracture my spine.

1354
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,880
And swear that you're mine.

1355
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:34,820
As we dance to the masochism tango.

1356
00:59:36,420 --> 00:59:37,020
Alright.

1357
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:42,180
Andrew the Impaled.

1358
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:45,020
And now Six Fisted Tales of Connie.

1359
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,560
I will.

1360
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,280
I am.

1361
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:11,040
I have been.

1362
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:13,800
Subgenius.

1363
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:15,980
I will.

1364
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,760
I am.

1365
01:00:19,940 --> 01:00:21,340
I have been.

1366
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:23,020
Subgenius.

1367
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,460
I will.

1368
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:29,140
I am.

1369
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,000
I have been.

1370
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:34,820
Subgenius.

1371
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,320
I will have.

1372
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,840
I have had.

1373
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:42,800
I do have.

1374
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:45,060
Slack.

1375
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:47,760
I will.

1376
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:50,600
I am.

1377
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:53,240
I have.

1378
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:56,440
Fought the conspiracy.

1379
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:58,640
I will.

1380
01:01:00,020 --> 01:01:01,300
I have.

1381
01:01:02,820 --> 01:01:04,140
I am.

1382
01:01:04,140 --> 01:01:04,420
I am.

1383
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,080
Fighting today.

1384
01:01:08,220 --> 01:01:09,320
I will.

1385
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,080
I have.

1386
01:01:13,540 --> 01:01:14,420
I have.

1387
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:14,780
I am.

1388
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:16,940
I am.

1389
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:17,660
Subgenius.

1390
01:01:18,900 --> 01:01:20,160
You are.

1391
01:01:22,140 --> 01:01:23,100
You have been.

1392
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:25,740
You will be.

1393
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:27,400
I can't do it.

1394
01:01:28,140 --> 01:01:28,380
Subgenius.

1395
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:28,860
Yeah!

1396
01:01:29,740 --> 01:01:30,580
Yeah!

1397
01:01:32,140 --> 01:01:32,800
Hey Sun T.

1398
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,660
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1399
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,180
Good idea Dobbs.

1400
01:01:37,180 --> 01:01:38,340
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1401
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:41,160
Sire, there is no more money.

1402
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:43,600
We gotta get some money.

1403
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:47,840
That dirty purgish harkaback flattin' wharton fill a bucket burton.

1404
01:01:48,140 --> 01:01:50,220
Purkaluma burton duckin' buster night.

1405
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:50,460
Oh!

1406
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:51,200
Beep.

1407
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:52,100
Beep.

1408
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,340
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show.

1409
01:01:55,460 --> 01:02:01,620
And we're even more glad that some listeners have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1410
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,480
Not just this show.

1411
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:06,700
but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1412
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:13,780
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1413
01:02:13,900 --> 01:02:21,240
you should go to subgenius.com front page or especially the radio page or the catalog store pages

1414
01:02:21,240 --> 01:02:24,620
and help out financially as best you can.

1415
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:28,980
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty

1416
01:02:28,980 --> 01:02:32,640
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1417
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,540
But some of you still have jobs.

1418
01:02:36,140 --> 01:02:42,460
Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1419
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:44,820
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1420
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:53,640
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1421
01:02:54,360 --> 01:02:59,500
We also take checks and money orders to subgeniusfoundation.

1422
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:01,240
P.O. Box.

1423
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:02,620
1-8-0.

1424
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,000
1-8-1.

1425
01:03:03,040 --> 01:03:04,900
4-1-7.

1426
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:07,920
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1427
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:11,540
4-4-1-1-8.

1428
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:16,840
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1429
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:32,860
Get lucky!

1430
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:33,920
If

1431
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:34,900
a

1432
01:03:34,900 --> 01:03:35,000
September

1433
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,000


1434
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:35,120
of

1435
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:35,120


1436
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:35,120


1437
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:35,120


1438
01:03:35,120 --> 01:03:37,640
Follow us on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram and find out where you're going to watch a weekly show.

1439
01:03:38,560 --> 01:03:39,300
Callup.com and sit outside and catch guys.

1440
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,400
This is anicaenedallana.com.

1441
01:03:42,420 --> 01:03:43,680
westlake.com or smileay.com.

1442
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:56,400
It's a comedy, because when you blowjobs meet up with houses.
