1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:09,820
Ladies and gentlemen, education holds America's future, perhaps your future.

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,080
The subgenius power of smoke.

3
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,740
Work, work.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,200
First to give you premium quality.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:19,920
A felony.

6
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:23,180
And first to give you scientific facts in support of smoking.

7
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:23,940
A felony.

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,220
Do it today.

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,000
From PR News in Washington, I'm deported immediately with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

10
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:39,320
Meanwhile, leaders from European Union countries are meeting in Texas along the Mexican border.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,760
Free our children.

12
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:48,340
Meanwhile, the government doubled in size overnight and now covers at least 1,500 acres around the country.

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,400
Meanwhile, Trump tweeted.

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,620
Free our children.

15
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,940
A growing number of right-wing EU governments.

16
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,580
Are demanding no PR news.

17
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:01,360
Last month, several activists were arrested and accused of undermining PR news.

18
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,440
They're also demanding PR news in Washington.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:19,060
A man with a third eye and glasses meets a cyclops with glasses.

20
00:01:21,260 --> 00:01:25,200
Near-sighted perception meets thought.

21
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,520
Firesighted aggression.

22
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:37,820
The cyclops is six times taller than the man and fat from eating all the men before him.

23
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,580
With each huge swing, the cyclops misses.

24
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:54,360
Like trying to swat a gnat, the air darting the target just out of reach and back again and again.

25
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:10,980
The man, too busy artfully dodging, is unable to access the third eye and too weak to throw anything heavy or damaging enough to defeat the overgrown, bloated ogre.

26
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:21,120
The giant adjusts his glasses and tries to focus on his elusive adversary.

27
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,420
Always in motion.

28
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:31,340
The man pushes the glasses up his nose and pauses.

29
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,720
Just long enough for the boot to descend upon him.

30
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:47,100
The cyclops shoes, newly purchased and not yet broken in, still had plenty of tread.

31
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:54,080
The man easily and luckily fit between the treads.

32
00:02:55,400 --> 00:03:02,040
Unfortunately, the custom Christian Dior glasses did not survive.

33
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:12,100
Now with blurred distance vision, the man searches for options.

34
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,080
The cyclops sits with him.

35
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,400
The man is a quaking thud and examines his shoe for human goo.

36
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:33,260
From the cornfield that he's scurried to, the man begins sharpening a long wooden stick.

37
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:44,380
The cyclops, finding no mush for snacking, licks his lips and hears scraping.

38
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:47,060
Smells deadly.

39
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,220
The man is a little bit of a beginner.

40
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:53,000
He wipes mist from his glasses.

41
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:56,180
The hunt is on.

42
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:06,860
The giant heads towards the cornfield, the source of the sound.

43
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:13,400
Nostrils flaring an alert as he sniffs and searches for his prey.

44
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:23,160
The man carves faster, frantically, as confrontation draws ever near.

45
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:36,280
Suddenly, a careless crashing through the cornfield is heard, accompanied by mis-length.

46
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,380
Another human male, blond and bronze, is seen.

47
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:43,380


48
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:43,380


49
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:43,380


50
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:43,380


51
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:43,380


52
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:46,540
It makes presence of science which, on the contrary, is not evergy.

53
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,300
A man, a natural Hungarian, SUV tale reads the following story.

54
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,520
It raises his eyes for an those that will Professor

55
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:55,820
Cur needed to be drunk .

56
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:02,600
The results are very snakes-ish, on ice again.

57
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:02,760


58
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:06,440
C NATO tranquility

59
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:13,360
The stranger reminds the giant to keep his voice down, as being so large, the cycle

60
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,360


61
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,360


62
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,360


63
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:13,360


64
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:23,020
can be quite ear-shattering for the lesser beings. They continue conversing

65
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:29,500
and reminiscing about lost weekends, lovers, farming, business, bozos, and

66
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:39,480
limetix disease. Then they both notice the annoying sound of scraping and turn

67
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:47,860
to look. The man, completely mesmerized by what he was witnessing, had continued

68
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:52,380
whittling his stick until it is no longer than the knife he was carving

69
00:05:52,380 --> 00:06:02,840
with. The stranger shakes his head, turns back to side-clops, and queries where

70
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:05,260
this man fits into the story.

71
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:23,220
It is revealed that the dispute is over land. The cyclops takes too much, and the man would

72
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:34,060
like some. Beyond the fact that man meat is mighty tasty, it turns out that the only other

73
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:39,120
thing the man has to offer is that he happens to be a master butcher.

74
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:50,160
The man is then taken to the brewer. A deal is struck. The cyclops, being a tinkerer,

75
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:59,700
fashions a seal-tight handle to attach to every keg the man makes, and drinks a giant

76
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:09,460
mug of beer every night. In return, the man was free to frolic in the bar, and the man

77
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:09,460


78
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:09,600
was given a

79
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:22,900
free drink.

80
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:36,940
After three consecutive batches of mediocre keg beer, the giant pulls the man aside.

81
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,440
The man is then taken to the brewer. A deal is struck. The cyclops, being a tinkerer, fashions a seal-tight handle to attach to every keg the man makes, and drinks a giant mug of beer every night.

82
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,580
After three consecutive batches of mediocre keg beer, the man is returned to the brewer.

83
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,720
Given the size difference, both were effectively able to use the same lenses.

84
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:56,500
Then the cyclops broke his glasses in half, as he only needed one and offered the other

85
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:04,820
half to the man who is eternally thankful, as he did not wish to die from a bogus batch

86
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,460
of beer.

87
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,140
Life continued well and good.

88
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:24,860
One day, the man was looking through the glass and saw a reflection.

89
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:31,880
A warped, graying old man was blinking back at him.

90
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:37,860
He was all of 43 yet looked 74.

91
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,180
He dove into his latest brew, the best batch yet,

92
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:51,160
and let the foam in the bubbles in the alcohol consume him.

93
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:57,660
The cyclops reached for his nightcap and,

94
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:02,080
in the bed, bath, and beyond, by to get one free candlelight,

95
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,960
he looked before he drank.

96
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,420
Like a human-sized dragon,

97
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,700
he drank with a gnat in it.

98
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:16,500
He poured it down, the carbonation tickling the roof of his mouth,

99
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,420
and licked his lips.

100
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:25,020
Protein, he said.

101
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:37,900
Oh, yes, dear friends, Cyclops vs. Man by Sheridan.

102
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:43,580
Friends, I got a couple of CDs from this thing, of all places,

103
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,500
Cleveland, calling itself Sheridan,

104
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,380
and I think we'll be hearing more of his or its short stories,

105
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:57,100
every single one of which has to obey certain odd and special rules.

106
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,920
They're all one famous character versus another matching famous character,

107
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:09,300
and one must be nearsighted and one must be farsighted.

108
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,300
He also has a CD of shorter bits, which we'll be gradually hearing.

109
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:23,080
You know, friends, doing this church and radio outreach introduces us to the most interesting people.

110
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:30,640
And thanks to Lemur for the titles and news and short upcoming upchucks.

111
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:37,520
This is our Slack number 1792, not a rerun,

112
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,420
although I found...

113
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:45,380
I found in my best of ESO collections some old swamp radio clips from WCSB Cleveland

114
00:10:45,380 --> 00:10:52,840
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave and host Chaz Smith that I think remain most pertinent.

115
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:57,260
This particular upcoming clip from December 2002,

116
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,260
maybe, maybe, I'm not sure,

117
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:08,040
maybe recorded the night after the great Chaz Smith learned that he might be dying of AIDS.

118
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,840
Not that he told anyone about that ever.

119
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:17,140
He died five years later of a lot of complications.

120
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,800
It was on his death certificate.

121
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,860
So tragic because he wouldn't let anyone know.

122
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,500
I have reason to suspect, though, looking back,

123
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:32,660
that this was the week he got the diagnosis.

124
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,820
Okay.

125
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:37,860
Okay.

126
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,420
I don't know what happens now.

127
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,840
I don't know what anything is anymore.

128
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:46,060
Well, one thing is for sure.

129
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:49,860
The heretics of science have taken over the top berth.

130
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,980
Not the after birth.

131
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,660
Not the slow birth.

132
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,860
But the top berth.

133
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,260
I don't even know what that means.

134
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:03,700
Well, it means that guys like Milton Drumplay and Exocentrius Squink...

135
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,580
I don't know who they are.

136
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,080
Well, they fondled.

137
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,000
Let's say they fondled quantum mechanics.

138
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,580
Until it couldn't come anymore.

139
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,020
I don't even really know what that is.

140
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,480
What quantum medicine is?

141
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:13,940
Yeah.

142
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,940
Well, you used to always preach to me.

143
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:16,920
Now you don't remember?

144
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,100
Because I can't sure as hell remember.

145
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:19,860
No.

146
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,180
What is quantum physics?

147
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,240
It's that everything is discrete.

148
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,220
It has a bunch of these discrete particles all going their own way.

149
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:27,020
I don't believe any of it.

150
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,200
Held together by a soggy old man or something.

151
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,800
You don't believe in science anymore?

152
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,080
Oh, yeah.

153
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,360
Sure.

154
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,780
Oh, jeez.

155
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,780
You sound so blasé about it, though.

156
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:39,420
I mean, that's just something that people...

157
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:40,080
People come up with.

158
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,080
Stuff's already there anyway.

159
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,440
So whether it's true or not is irrelevant because it is.

160
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:45,980
Yeah, right.

161
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,720
It is.

162
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,720
It is what it is and it ain't what it ain't.

163
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:55,460
Well, you sound like a cultural hegemonist who believes that only your own ideas are...

164
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:56,060
What's the point?

165
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,380
Now you sound like a nihilist.

166
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,060
Like, what's the point of understanding it?

167
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,320
Now you sound like a transmutational geneticistic.

168
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:04,860
Oh, Christ, man.

169
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,960
You got all the diseases.

170
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,900
Oh, Chaz, you got the malaise.

171
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,420
There's no point.

172
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,820
There's no point to trying to understand anything.

173
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:14,700
Well, I can agree with you in a marginal way.

174
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,940
You know, like the same kind of thing that you use to cook your food in.

175
00:13:21,080 --> 00:13:28,680
The same items you use to create information in your doorway or your computer and stuff.

176
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:36,240
The same things that make you up as molecules are drifting in and out of you right now and you don't want them to stay put.

177
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,820
You don't care.

178
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,780
They're going to do it.

179
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,900
If they want to do whatever, it doesn't matter what I want.

180
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:44,360
Yeah, molecules do have a mind of their own.

181
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,820
It's a miracle they even hang out together long enough for you to get a pair of eyebrows sometimes.

182
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:51,540
You know what I mean?

183
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,480
Yeah.

184
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:01,420
The universe is billions and billions and billions of light years across.

185
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,000
Yeah, we're kind of small.

186
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,700
In fact, we're miniscule when you say it that way.

187
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,700
We're hardly...

188
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:08,980
We're there.

189
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:13,280
We're like a particle in a puff of smoke.

190
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:21,600
So, well, when we were playing in the Puffer Dome, don't you think like some massive godlike people were looking down from strange craft?

191
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,840
Do you think like...

192
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:28,260
Well, you said once that little super tiny, tiny little aliens were watching us.

193
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:29,340
That was the acid.

194
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:30,780
Oh, man.

195
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,560
Everything I built my life's beliefs on.

196
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,660
Oh, jeez.

197
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:37,700
Man.

198
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:38,960
I don't know.

199
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,180
Now I'm going to get the malaise.

200
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,200
It's a kind of a...

201
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,280
This is the only thing I know.

202
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,560
He's listening to Janice again, Stang.

203
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,020
Huh?

204
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,600
He's listening to Janice and he's all depressed about his molecules again.

205
00:14:58,880 --> 00:14:59,080
Janice? Oh.

206
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,580
Oh, I thought it was Janice Jerkler because she was going...

207
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,720
Oh, my God, it's a man.

208
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,260
No!

209
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:05,320
It's Robert Plant?

210
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:05,900
Oh!

211
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,800
Yeah!

212
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:07,540
Yeah!

213
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,140
Oh, man!

214
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,040
Oh!

215
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:14,440
Sands!

216
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,920
I've been loving you!

217
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,020
Man.

218
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:23,780
I've been loving you for too long.

219
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:25,600
That's a nihilistic song, Chaz.

220
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:32,080
That's a song of a guy whose molecules were drifting slowly back and forth without their dog collars on.

221
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,420
Doesn't matter what the molecules do.

222
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:37,700
See what he's saying, Stang?

223
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,140
He's like...

224
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:38,940
He's goofed up.

225
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,700
Something's wrong with him.

226
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,780
I think the pith carrier and all the little screws on the bottom are all offside.

227
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,640
There's nothing wrong with me.

228
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,880
You sure you didn't...

229
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,580
Oh, he's finally seeing clearly.

230
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:50,020
This is the way it really is, then?

231
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:53,460
He's lost faith in religion and science.

232
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,020
How about agriculture?

233
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:56,060
No.

234
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,520
No, I understand how it is, you know.

235
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:04,680
After a while, you just have to face facts and just get used to it, you know.

236
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,100
That's all.

237
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,820
No man is an island, Rob.

238
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,360
He's a rock of a hard place.

239
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:13,640
I think you might get Minerva's curse if you ever stared the facts straight in the face

240
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:16,240
and you turned to stone like a gorgon or the gnorgon.

241
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,060
Chaz is a man of stone.

242
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,260
I know he's quite...

243
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:23,280
He is a rock, a hard rock.

244
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,920
And I was a man of water, but the water has turned to stone.

245
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,600
Now you're just a stoner man, and you've always been a stoner man.

246
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,760
The rock is not as hard as you think.

247
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:34,520
It's more...

248
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,740
I don't know.

249
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,660
It's like when your...

250
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:37,600
When your water has transformed.

251
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,120
When your glass...

252
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,540
When your plans ooze out of your neck or someplace.

253
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,340
They have to be put back.

254
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,480
Into a solid.

255
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,620
Well, sometimes it just becomes a vapor.

256
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,820
It was then.

257
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,880
Plus, that blind date with Medusa didn't help.

258
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,700
If only it had been...

259
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,780
If only he had been blind for the blind date with Medusa.

260
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,020
Well, then he would have been Homer's buddy there.

261
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,820
What's his name?

262
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,600
With the one...

263
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,820
Oh, the guy with the wine.

264
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,220
Hey, Homer's buddy.

265
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,520
The Sodclops.

266
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,140
Yes.

267
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,060
Since we're into Greek myths.

268
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,320
Yeah.

269
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:09,580
Not Woe or something.

270
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:09,860
No.

271
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,000
Mythology, I guess.

272
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,520
No, we're in the Vale of Woe.

273
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,960
Well, not really Woe.

274
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,500
Of resignation.

275
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:19,660
Well, Woe spelled W-H-O-H.

276
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,420
You know?

277
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:21,880
The Valley...

278
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,100
Whoa!

279
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:24,200
No, not again.

280
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:26,180
Whoa.

281
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,180
It's a valley that's hard to climb out, especially if you don't have the right shoes.

282
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:31,860
You know what I'm saying?

283
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,880
The right foot gear can get us out of here.

284
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,540
Well, if you've got a ball and chain.

285
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,000
It's not holding you down.

286
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,880
It's pretty hard to climb out of there.

287
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:42,780
What have you got?

288
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,580
One of them Orange County jail uniforms and you've got your handcuff to your foot.

289
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,540
That's better than a ball and chain, isn't it?

290
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:53,600
Well, and you know when somebody's all depressed and...

291
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,660
Or facing facts, as the case may be, depending.

292
00:17:56,980 --> 00:17:57,480
Wait a minute.

293
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,940
What's the problem with just digging into some blues and getting in touch with where it's coming from for real?

294
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:05,140
Oh, I was just going from what you said earlier.

295
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,320
Yeah, I'm just digging in.

296
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:07,040
I'm just getting it.

297
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,340
I'm getting in touch with the roots, man.

298
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,320
He didn't say he was bitter, Stan.

299
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:13,940
He just said he was afraid for his molecules, like many people are nowadays.

300
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,160
I'm not afraid for my molecules.

301
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,980
What the hell can I do about my molecules?

302
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,400
He's not afraid for them.

303
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,440
He's letting them do their own thing.

304
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,660
Well, it doesn't matter what I care about my molecules.

305
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,340
What do my molecules care about me?

306
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,260
Well, I think your follicles care.

307
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,840
And I think probably your dendrites are deeply concerned.

308
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,300
The DNA molecule drives everything that we do.

309
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,920
And we are powerless to...

310
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:37,500
Stop it.

311
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,980
It will do anything to keep itself replicating.

312
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:43,200
Have you heard of the new DNA they found?

313
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,420
It completely replicates human DNA, but it's like a bacterium.

314
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,460
Hello?

315
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,200
Hello.

316
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,800
Hello.

317
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:57,060
Your forehead is leaking strange blue fluids.

318
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,120
Hello?

319
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:58,720
Hello.

320
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,640
But the sound, his forehead's making kind of a cool buzz.

321
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,120
Well, I think that's the cabinet it was built into.

322
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:04,600
Hello?

323
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,460
He won't speak.

324
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:06,740
Hello?

325
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:06,880
He just...

326
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:06,920
Hello?

327
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:07,660
He keeps vibrating.

328
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:08,400
Hello?

329
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,040
Hello?

330
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:10,620
Hello?

331
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:10,680
Hello?

332
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:11,520
Are you a monster there?

333
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,160
I can make it worse if I turn my radio on.

334
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,180
Whoa.

335
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,440
Oh, man.

336
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,440
Don't take that pill.

337
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:24,740
Greetings, Reverend Funny Name.

338
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,040
Good to hear from you.

339
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:32,760
I hope you don't mind if I make my reply in part during my afternoon constitutional.

340
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,680
Congratulations.

341
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:36,400
Congratulations.

342
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:43,020
And well done for buying a gift membership to the Church of the Subgenius for your friend.

343
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,020
Glad to hear it.

344
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,240
Welcome.

345
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:50,300
And your good taste will pay off come X day.

346
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:57,220
Your friend asked you, and you asked me, for some advice for a new subgenius.

347
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,400
And I can reply readily in two parts.

348
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,200
First, be miserable.

349
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:09,680
Be as miserable as you know how to be.

350
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:13,680
Study miserable people and do what they do.

351
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:20,300
And if you know people who are not at the moment miserable, avoid them and definitely

352
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,040
don't do what they do.

353
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:25,960
If you are miserable, be more miserable.

354
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:30,580
That is my first piece of advice for a new subgenius.

355
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,680
My second bit of advice for a new subgenius is don't only.

356
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:37,020
Be miserable.

357
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:46,100
And the reason is we already have a member in long standing who is miserable all the time.

358
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,880
And your friend is not that member.

359
00:20:52,480 --> 00:21:00,820
No, the role of constantly miserable subgenius has been filled and skillfully so.

360
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,940
Therefore, that role is occupied.

361
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:14,360
A new niche must be discovered for your friend and for yourself and for me and for all of us.

362
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:20,160
We must find a way to not be only miserable all the time.

363
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:29,400
And so that second piece of advice in sum total is be miserable sometimes.

364
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,000
And other times find some other way to be.

365
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,340
Perhaps filled with rage.

366
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,340
Perhaps in love.

367
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,820
Perhaps indifferent.

368
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,700
Happy sometimes.

369
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,980
Bored sometimes.

370
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:47,280
Asleep sometimes.

371
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:54,320
Enjoying the company of friends or taking an afternoon constitutional.

372
00:21:55,140 --> 00:22:01,940
Many paths are available to self-same members of the church of the subgenius.

373
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,680
I thank you.

374
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,800
Thank you.

375
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,460
Let there be slack.

376
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:14,520
Thank you, Uncle Dr. Onan Canabite.

377
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:18,360
So uplifting from such an unexpected angle.

378
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,640
Subgeniuses, have you checked out Dobbs.town on the internet?

379
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:31,780
It's a newish and non-Facebook forum that's being used by some of the best subgeniuses.

380
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:34,760
The hundred million new ones that I don't know.

381
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:41,140
But now, Sheridan muses with Lemurian in-betweens.

382
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:49,740
In my time, I filled out a lot of job applications.

383
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,840
One thing that puzzles me is not when they ask for your present address.

384
00:22:56,120 --> 00:23:00,000
It's the next line where they ask for your permanent address.

385
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:03,920
Permanent is so final and unrealistic.

386
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,740
It's unrealistic.

387
00:23:04,760 --> 00:23:05,560
It's not even in any economy.

388
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:07,580
There's dwelling options.

389
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,940
There are landlords and evictions.

390
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,260
Buildings have burned down.

391
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:15,880
Entire cities washed down the drain of too bad.

392
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,800
Sorry for your loss.

393
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,040
Here's money.

394
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:27,200
But really, how would your parents feel if at age 16 you ink their house in as your permanent address?

395
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,020
So I finally snapped.

396
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:32,480
Today, I put down the only logical answer.

397
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,400
Technology be damned.

398
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,900
Today, under permanent address, I wrote, Earth.

399
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:49,860
I will ask Jesus to help me to keep my heart from sin.

400
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:58,580
After reflecting his goodness and all we shine for him.

401
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,760
A sunbeam, a sunbeam.

402
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:04,220
A sunbeam.

403
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,960
Life is a designed thing.

404
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,080
Jesus wants me for a sunbeam.

405
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,480
A sunbeam, a sunbeam.

406
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:16,020
I'll be a sunbeam for him.

407
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:28,700
It would be cool if your name was certain and then you could honestly say I am certain and get away with it.

408
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,160
Or someone can say, are you certain?

409
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:37,980
and you can say it depends who's asking but if your name was certain could

410
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:47,500
anyone be positive that you're not worried about being mistaken freeze

411
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,440
everybody clap your hands

412
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:54,360
come on y'all

413
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:05,180
how low can you go from pr news in washington i'm bobby b bobby c the sababa in south carolina

414
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:12,840
this is pr the u.s military has been seriously injured in a car crash and in las vegas

415
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,020
president trump addresses nevada's pr news

416
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:16,600
you

417
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:23,640
we're going to talk to you about the most urgent thing that is on our mind

418
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:30,640
and what we suspect is the most urgent thing on the minds of those who will connect with us

419
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,180
we'll title this tape

420
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:42,640
now the reason this is such an interesting tape is well but what's this tape this is

421
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,520
such a doomsday statement tape and that's absurd

422
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:45,780
this

423
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:46,040
this

424
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:54,160
Well, now, we're on the end of the absurd doomsday.

425
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:57,720
What's this? What's all this? What's all this?

426
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,100
Well, we suspect that that's pretty major.

427
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:09,300
Well, we speak of human ways only because we suspect this is the end of human ignorance.

428
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,960
Of how we would speak of human behavior.

429
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:24,760
Well, we speak of this world just on the tail end of that window, if I can speak of it that way.

430
00:26:44,500 --> 00:27:12,920
Of how we would speak of human behavior.

431
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:39,880
Octopus salad and pink cocaine

432
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,240
Hamburger's pudding and black champagne

433
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,280
Temperature rises and the walls melt away

434
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,120
Floating green iron and milky gray

435
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,700
Well, okay, I had a nasty twist

436
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,880
For ten thousand days

437
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,720
I've been wrapping my

438
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:45,260
Head around a tangled maze

439
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:47,420
It's raining holy hell

440
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:49,700
Down on my big old brain

441
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:51,700
And there's too many numbers

442
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,100
To keep track of the names

443
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,100
And it's mildly mercury

444
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,340
And retrograde

445
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,520
Cause I've been yapping all day

446
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,760
But ain't got much to say

447
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,880
La la la la la la la

448
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,640
We gon' play it

449
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:09,660
Just tell me which moniker

450
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,500
Make the ring it plays

451
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:12,020
Wow

452
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,020
Which moniker

453
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,860
Make the ring it plays

454
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,420
Which moniker

455
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,800
Make the ring it plays

456
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:23,600
Yeah

457
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:24,620
Yeah

458
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,860
Yeah

459
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,320
Yeah

460
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:29,840
Yeah

461
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,700
Yeah

462
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:31,760
Yeah

463
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,960
Yeah

464
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:33,180
Yeah

465
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:33,680
Yeah

466
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:33,680


467
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,500
Yeah

468
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:46,780
Yeah

469
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:46,780


470
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,060
They seek

471
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:47,820
the gift

472
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:48,420
of better

473
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:48,980
living

474
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:49,940
the gift

475
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:51,060
of better

476
00:29:51,060 --> 00:29:51,620
living

477
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:55,840
They seek

478
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,420
the gift

479
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,160
of better

480
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:57,800
living

481
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,460
They seek

482
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:58,860
the gift

483
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:58,860


484
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:58,860


485
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:58,860


486
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,260
the gift

487
00:29:59,260 --> 00:29:59,780
of better

488
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,360
living

489
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:00,980
They see

490
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:00,980


491
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:01,560
a spot

492
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,000


493
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,000


494
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:03,660
I'll never

495
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:08,660
Thank you.

496
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,280
Thank you.

497
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:17,980
Thank you.

498
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,140
Thank you.

499
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,620
Thank you.

500
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,640
Maybe there wouldn't be so much strife.

501
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:42,320
Anyway, here's another short story from Sheridan of Cleveland.

502
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:52,540
Barbie doesn't need anything.

503
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:59,620
If her dad doesn't show up in good enough time to change the light bulb in her penthouse apartment,

504
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,040
she'll settle for a special one-third scale,

505
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,040
Nordstrom-scented candle.

506
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:10,340
Beyond that, she's happy,

507
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:14,420
dancing around naked in her cutaway half-house,

508
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,280
trying on clothes.

509
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:23,100
Near-sighted Barbie can only see the glow

510
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:26,720
from the windows of the high-rise apartment across the street.

511
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:32,940
She is sweetly oblivious to the numerous telescopes

512
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,000
trained and aimed at her room.

513
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,620
One farsighted admirer can only see clearly

514
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:46,700
with the help of the telescope's lens.

515
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,160
Focused on our girl,

516
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,860
this view is the best to be found

517
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,360
and surely he must, must

518
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,260
meet this beautiful, flawless,

519
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,320
lustful thing.

520
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:09,200
He watches

521
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,480
as she pulls out her brush before the mirror.

522
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:17,500
One,

523
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:19,020
ten,

524
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:21,000
fifty,

525
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,360
ninety-nine,

526
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:32,060
one hundred strokes across those beautiful locks of golden synthetic strands.

527
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:39,320
She stands after one last hair flip

528
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,620
and turns out the light for bed.

529
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:47,220
In that fleeting glimpse before the darkness,

530
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:50,800
he sees that she is perfectly clean-shaven.

531
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,880
A gnat lands on the lens of this harbor freight telescope,

532
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,460
free flashlight with any purchase,

533
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,880
and he kills it with one puff.

534
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:03,020
He is so

535
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,660
tough of his bad breath.

536
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:13,160
He tries to time her daily morning departure.

537
00:35:14,940 --> 00:35:19,920
It is as inconsistent as his own slacker schedule.

538
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,920
Without using the lens,

539
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:29,040
he cannot read which uptown RTA stacker buck

540
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:30,720
picks her up.

541
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:35,060
Where does she go?

542
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:39,280
Probably shopping for more accessories,

543
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,380
he would have to guess.

544
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,120
One day,

545
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,800
he sidles up to the curb

546
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,120
and engages her in his bright red convertible,

547
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,060
top down,

548
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,020
top not included in the package,

549
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,640
all other accessories,

550
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,720
including steering wheel,

551
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,840
sold separate.

552
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:08,520
She looks down her impossibly perfect chiseled pointed nose. I mean really,

553
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:16,780
have you ever seen a nose like that anywhere? People, it just can't be done. But that Jackson

554
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:27,840
fella sure did try and look how that turned out. She looks at him long and hard, almost as if she

555
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:38,440
could see right through his plastic shell. You think I'm a hooker, honey? She yells, loud enough

556
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:46,300
that it catches the attention of the police officer standing nearby. Nose for you, bitch.

557
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:57,600
I just dressed like one. Tires squeal as he speeds away and he wonders if it was the gas stench.

From topping off at the last fill up. Barbie casually wanders off and searches for her next

559
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:13,080
fix from someone not so shallow.

560
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:35,820
It's just a false report from Chris. They still control you, however you are, what you think,

561
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,880
and how you dress. It's all the same, it's just a demonstration.

562
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:52,900
Disinformation. You live in a brain punch, so why'd you leave me in big news? It's all the same,

563
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:55,420
just the things that they change to take you.

564
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,880
Scrubbed in and staged for your entertainment.

565
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:10,080
It's disinformation. It's a long time with a student guy radiating bodily knowledge.

566
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:16,720
Revolving stories of human interest. Utilizing priestly carnage.

567
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,360
So what if no one's wrong? He won't take the fall for disinformation.

568
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,440
Oh, you bastards.

569
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:33,920
Peter Jennings. Dan the Off-Grounder. I hate you all. I wish you'd all just shut up.

570
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:36,780
Get off my TV. I hate you.

571
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:42,440
Ahhhhhh. Disinformation.

572
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:02,880
Ahhhh.

573
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:13,980
The Song Disinformation, from the mystery band called THUNC, exclamation.

574
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:17,700
I hope there's not more than one cuss word in all those.

575
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:23,680

00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:56,240
here until lightning strikes nearby and suddenly there's monkeys swinging from trees as soon as the

592
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:01,480
lightning clears the smoke clears all there is the force of zeus as the lightning bearer stretching

593
00:41:01,480 --> 00:41:07,080
each one of those monkeys down and then as soon as the rain dries up the trees die away like within

594
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:12,980
two hours so the monkeys don't have as many trees to swing around him and they have to jump down to

595
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,040
the ground and run from one group of trees to the other go out and play in the dry rain and they

596
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,680
found that you know after a while they're going to have to run from one group of trees to the other

597
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:25,160
they stood up they could run faster if they stood up not on all fours and right about that time

598
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:34,400
their heads started getting bigger and i am lonely and i shall create me man from the mud of the earth

599
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:43,080
and he shall slay all these nearly evolved other primates and so god rose up the first completely

600
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:48,460
created unevolved homo sapiens and now for a limited time

601
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,880
and you can own in your very own home this unlimited

602
00:41:51,880 --> 00:42:00,860
and that's exactly 2714 years ago that happened

603
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:06,980
and then god placed all the fossils and many varieties of homo sapiens

604
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:13,660
of the of the scientists and the geologists yes that is what is the

605
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:17,860
crux of everything in reality is if you're out in the african

606
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:18,460
desert

607
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:25,140
somewhere and you find a skull it was planted there by god just a few thousand years ago so

608
00:42:25,140 --> 00:42:31,360
you could lick it is right next to where lucy was walking around you go down a few feet deeper than

609
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:35,820
lucy even and there's another one you know it could be billions of years yeah well they were

610
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:41,400
cavemen dinosaurs running around back then the great daily came and smashed a lot of them

611
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:47,920
yeah but no noah managed but you see the dinosaurs were too big and that's why they didn't survive

612
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,000
and theiedzio kill Fightin

613
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:53,840
oxyr

614
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:54,640
discussed a

615
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:54,640


616
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,900

617
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:56,680
changing the

618
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:59,860
knowledge or

619
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,700
remaining оргaniata

620
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,780
Why did they bury their dead ceremoniously?

621
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,480
Like Neanderthals buried their dead ceremoniously.

622
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:24,700
They were Satanists.

623
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:25,220
Yes.

624
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:29,020
They were burying them to the wrong god.

625
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,400
Yes, the neutral primates are all Satanists.

626
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:33,000
So they were also lost in the great flood.

627
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:35,240
But many of them had not learned the correct prayers.

628
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:39,080
So as their prayers are uttered throughout the woods and picked up thousands of years from the sound of the Dutch missions.

629
00:43:39,080 --> 00:43:43,540
The Grand Canyon was cut 2,303 years ago.

630
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,440
The Grand Canyon was cut down?

631
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:46,820
That's right.

632
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:48,140
De-neuded? Deforested?

633
00:43:48,660 --> 00:43:51,860
Actually, what was it? 4,600?

634
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:56,420
Oh, you mean what it's created through the gland.

635
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,160
4,000 years ago.

636
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,860
The mighty girdle of the Colorado which spans...

637
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:03,520
Now that's taught in some schools.

638
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,280
And in some it's just loose.

639
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:07,100
Some's taught.

640
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:12,040
Well, how come there's no mention of the Americas in the Bible?

641
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,260
It's a touchy-feely thing, Chaz.

642
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,200
We don't want to...

643
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:15,420
Well, okay.

644
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:16,480
Oh, that's the true...

645
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,140
That's where the true Israel migrated to, don't you see?

646
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:21,940
Have you not read your Identity Christianity textbook?

647
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:26,200
Yes, their pancreas were swollen, making the long voyage across the Atlantic much easier.

648
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:29,960
...into the Northland where was Gog and Magog.

649
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,680
But see, this is actually...

650
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:34,000
If you see the true interpretation of the...

651
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,740
And they had the stinky mark of Odom upon their faces.

652
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:41,180
...clubhouse, you would see that this actually means the British Isles.

653
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:41,820
There he is.

654
00:44:41,840 --> 00:44:42,240
Ah.

655
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:45,200
The picture of Der Fuhrer, he's so cute.

656
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,920
The ones masquerading as God's chosen people are, of course, merely the Khazar, Asiatic,

657
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,640
yeti-like humanoids.

658
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:02,340
That's actually kind of part of the teaching of some Identity Christianity things,

659
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:06,420
which is such a silly superstition compared to Identity subgenius.

660
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,760
They have...

661
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:08,980
Where we know that the...

662
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:10,320
We can speak seriously.

663
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,020
...truly chosen ones...

664
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:13,460
Those people of who you speak...

665
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:14,820
...are those who have sent their...

666
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,860
...thirty dollars to J.R.R.

667
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:21,780
...regurgitated a religion, a substantially sick religion,

668
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:26,860
which existed in the 1840s based on white supremacy and other forms of insanity,

669
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,500
and also filtered through their Lucifer-like Nazism and so forth.

670
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:32,920
But these...

671
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:36,220
Oh, actually, everybody ripped off the Zoroastrians.

672
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:40,660
Oh, you can go to any old bookstore and there's some crack who says that...

673
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:44,240
The true Israelites are guys who look just like me,

674
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,720
and who like bland food and can't dance.

675
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,740
That's the substance of their religion, that God was one of them.

676
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:52,760
Gots mitans!

677
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:54,860
Remember that old phrase, got mitans?

678
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,000
All I know is that they're right.

679
00:45:58,100 --> 00:46:01,020
We are in some deep doopoo.

680
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:01,720
Deep.

681
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:02,340
Deep.

682
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:05,740
We are in some deep Dobbs hairdo, my friends.

683
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,540
If the Southern Baptists, if the Identity Christians are right.

684
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:14,220
Or, for that matter, friends, if anyone...

685
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,600
If the rival cult is right.

686
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:17,500
Most of us are doomed.

687
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,660
But if the Church of the Subgenius is right,

688
00:46:21,500 --> 00:46:23,460
most of you are doomed.

689
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,840
And most of us are...

690
00:46:27,620 --> 00:46:27,700
Saved.

691
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:28,420
Saved.

692
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:29,240
Saved.

693
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,780
Utopia after utopia for a thousand lifetimes.

694
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,820
To come.

695
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:39,440
And...

696
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,060
Come again.

697
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:42,640
Come.

698
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:43,880
Come.

699
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:44,220
Come.

700
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:44,220


701
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:44,220


702
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:44,220


703
00:46:44,920 --> 00:46:45,440
Come.

704
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:45,880
Come.

705
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,020
Come on to Bob.

706
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:46,860
Come on to Bob.

707
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:47,520
And come on.

708
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:51,560
Oh, Lord, you'll be loving it all on the way to paradise.

709
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,680
Just as you are.

710
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:54,720
Step on up.

711
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:55,960
Step on up.

712
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:57,660
Make me step on up.

713
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:01,160
Stand on my foot so I get the hell up and walk on over there on the clock.

714
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:03,420
And Bob said unto the masses,

715
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:04,700
Step right up.

716
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:07,500
I looked into the way a running dog...

717
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:08,440
For here.

718
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,200
Gaze unto this so awesome...

719
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:13,780
For a bed by your neck.

720
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:14,220
For a bed by your neck.

721
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:14,220


722
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:14,220


723
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:14,220


724
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:14,220


725
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:14,220


726
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:22,200
For a hair Bowler.

727
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:24,340
For a theater Lullabies.

728
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:24,920
For a quad ride.

729
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:24,960
But to get out of bed face to face.

730
00:47:25,020 --> 00:47:27,100
I was holding on.

731
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,740
I don't think there's any way because I can't get on that horse.

732
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:30,180
I bit all my fingers and Hoo.

733
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:30,900
I don't think I'm gonna get off but keep on going.

734
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:32,060
He didn't, didn't he?

735
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:34,320
No.

736
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:35,340
Taken.

737
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:35,340


738
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:36,860
And you didn't seem very comfortable.

739
00:47:36,860 --> 00:47:36,900
I think I saw this coming.

740
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:40,740
Think thatibone came some day...

741
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,680
He didn't.

742
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,260
But I knew this would be.

743
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:42,500
Knew I heard.

744
00:47:42,500 --> 00:47:45,360
And I said, Larry, what's going on there?

745
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:47,080
You want me to do it like Scabby?

746
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:47,500
Yeah.

747
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,220
And what did he say, brother?

748
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:50,180
What's going on there?

749
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,300
Jesus, come here.

750
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:53,600
And what did Jesus say to you now?

751
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:56,620
There's only one set of footprints here and here.

752
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:01,240
And one of the worst times of my life, there was only one set of footprints.

753
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:07,020
And the liar said, well, son, that's when I abandoned you.

754
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,160
Couldn't take your misery.

755
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:12,100
You're a pathetic loser at those times.

756
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:13,480
I couldn't stand looking at you.

757
00:48:13,540 --> 00:48:17,080
Thank you for that wonderful interpretation of the usual retreat.

758
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,460
I realize it's good to be a loser.

759
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,200
It's good to be an idiot.

760
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,820
It's better to be an idiot.

761
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:25,840
Then you don't know what's wrong with you.

762
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:27,980
You are forgiven, my son.

763
00:48:28,060 --> 00:48:32,660
I thought you were going to end that with, well, Scabby, that's when I was humping you on the neck.

764
00:48:32,860 --> 00:48:36,540
God so loved the idiot and the drunkard that he protected him in Harvard.

765
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:37,520
That would have been much better.

766
00:48:37,580 --> 00:48:38,760
I should have gave it to you.

767
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:40,020
Jumped on your back and humped you.

768
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:41,840
The hardworking house.

769
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:46,180
His mom was instead taken by the angels.

770
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,140
Mom, I mean, Dad, come on down.

771
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,960
Your clam cakes, they're alive.

772
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:58,560
For God loves drunks and protects them and lets hardworking moms fall by the wayside in his great vengeance.

773
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:58,960
What is that?

774
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,200
Chaz?

775
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:01,520
Chaz?

776
00:49:01,600 --> 00:49:02,800
Could you help me?

777
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,840
I think Rogers died.

778
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:07,780
And he was.

779
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:09,700
And he was died.

780
00:49:10,780 --> 00:49:11,580
He's gone.

781
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,000
He's gone.

782
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:22,300
The stark fist of removal is real, my friends, and it hovers over each and every one of us.

783
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,600
And that's when you tied your shoe boots today.

784
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:27,640
For the very last time.

785
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:28,860
You can untie them tonight.

786
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,960
Will the Undertaker be untying them shoes tonight, friend?

787
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:33,640
Are you ready?

788
00:49:33,700 --> 00:49:41,960
Have you made peace with your god or goddess or thing or totem pole, whatever it may be?

789
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:47,300
I'm afraid that Jolly Roger is really flying the skull and crossbones this sad afternoon.

790
00:49:48,960 --> 00:50:04,500
You're a guardian angel or you're a guardian demon or you're a little guardian alien gray or you're lucky rabbit's foot or you're winning lottery number or you're special anti-baldness formula.

791
00:50:05,020 --> 00:50:08,520
That inorganic penis licker, that's one demerit.

792
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,160
Your ear candling equipment.

793
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:12,920
Your auto jack.

794
00:50:13,620 --> 00:50:14,300
Your...

795
00:50:14,300 --> 00:50:18,500
The frozen peace pipe and eye remover, that's two demerits.

796
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:18,880
Your hobby.

797
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:21,400
Your addiction.

798
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,200
Your crutch.

799
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:27,820
Your elation upon riding into the little train tube, that's 60 merits.

800
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:28,720
Face it.

801
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,620
You're hooked.

802
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,100
Kick that crutch away, my friend.

803
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:38,940
Become yourself the crutch of Bob Dobbs.

804
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:40,660
Let Bob lean on you.

805
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:41,340
I see the light.

806
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,080
And you...

807
00:50:42,080 --> 00:50:42,080


808
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:42,900
I'll walk again.

809
00:50:43,180 --> 00:50:44,440
Kick that crutch away.

810
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:45,120
I'll walk.

811
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,120
I'll walk.

812
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:48,680
And I'll let Bob limp on you.

813
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,340
But I never could walk.

814
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:55,420
Throw yourself into that pipe and light yourself up.

815
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,020
Yes, friends, light yourself up.

816
00:50:58,020 --> 00:50:59,360
Light down his lung tubes.

817
00:51:00,580 --> 00:51:05,360
Not that naked woman on the hill, Chris, screaming incoherently, driving a Porsche.

818
00:51:06,340 --> 00:51:09,720
No, not that cheesy cab driver with the Iranian accent.

819
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:11,520
All of you, yes?

820
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,660
All of you.

821
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,660
There is a cause for disturbance.

822
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:23,840
Each and every one of you is entreated to become one with a new type of human being.

823
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,560
A new species of mankind.

824
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:31,320
A big blue onion in the sea.

825
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,560
An overman.

826
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:37,600
An uberwoman.

827
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,100
The frozen ovary woman.

828
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:41,220
A great woman.

829
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:41,900
Seven dinars.

830
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:47,320
Hairy and muscular uberwoman.

831
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:51,740
The lightning zapped chimpanzee.

832
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,040
It's 25 minutes.

833
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:53,320
You're dying.

834
00:51:56,780 --> 00:52:00,980
We rejoin the evolution of mankind back on the savannahs.

835
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:06,420
Three more lightning boats have zapped five more families of small monkey-like semi-human beings.

836
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,860
They've just returned from a bowling alley and Grandpa's taken a nap.

837
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:12,880
But things aren't going to be much better.

838
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:17,320
I am your descendant.

839
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,020
And I your descendator.

840
00:52:21,620 --> 00:52:24,460
Listen to us very carefully, if you can listen at all.

841
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,600
We know that your ears are bludgeoned and mangled.

842
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:34,300
Your atoms have come from millions and billions of years ago from inside in the sun before our sun.

843
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:36,500
This is not a good prognosis.

844
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:40,980
So just relax, and we'll try and clean the sphagnum from your ear.

845
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:41,200
And we'll try and clean the sphagnum from your ear.

846
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:45,200
Keep those atoms in one place for God's sake.

847
00:52:46,220 --> 00:52:46,820
Stay in one place for God's sake.

848
00:52:46,820 --> 00:52:49,920
Those atoms are yours now, but they won't be forever.

849
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:50,400
No.

850
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:58,500
They're going to be in some other burning hydrogen sun, in some other alternate – further beyond the universal mind.

851
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:02,240
One day there will be a last, perfect day on Earth.

852
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:05,660
And then the sun will start to shrink.

853
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,440
And they'll rip off, and come back from all you old cripple of Earth.

854
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:15,820
Expand out, consuming Mercury, Venus, and Earth inside of itself.

855
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:21,840
Eventually, after that, the sun will slowly use up the...

856
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,240
The hydrogen's gone.

857
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:24,920
Now it's just the helium burning.

858
00:53:24,920 --> 00:53:32,660
As the sun's uterus slowly contracts into this sphagmatic form here shown at the top of the Colosseum,

859
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:37,580
you notice Randy and Tina are still having fun with their used condoms.

860
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:42,000
And then just a little orb of black schmuck gets in space.

861
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:43,000
Black toy.

862
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:48,660
Of course, if the sun was a lot bigger, it would turn into a black hole, though.

863
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:52,220
Hey, man, you don't know where I could get some of that...

864
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:53,860
Neutron matter?

865
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,940
Black dwarf neutron matter.

866
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:57,640
Oh, yeah, man. You want neutron matter?

867
00:53:57,640 --> 00:54:00,320
A teaspoon full of it would weigh as much as a mountain.

868
00:54:00,520 --> 00:54:02,600
Let's sing this song. Should we sing this song?

869
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,700
It weighs as much as 19 Earths.

870
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:07,120
Come on, guys. Let's sing this song.

871
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,560
An atom of it would weigh as much as a mountain.

872
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:12,640
A teaspoon of neutron matter makes the medicine go down.

873
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,120
Come on, let's sing it now.

874
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:18,880
A teaspoon of neutron matter makes the medicine go down.

875
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:42,640
A teaspoon of neutron matter makes the medicine go down.

876
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:42,640


877
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,700
I'd like to take another shower this year,

878
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:47,020
but my friend, in his wisdom,

879
00:54:47,660 --> 00:54:48,860
knowing I'm an alcoholic,

880
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,220
bought me a new shower curtain

881
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:55,340
that looks like a close-up of a frosty cold beer.

882
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,600
I will finish my beer,

883
00:54:58,260 --> 00:54:59,380
rinse the glass,

884
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:01,580
head towards the shower,

885
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:03,660
and suddenly be parched,

886
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:05,640
and I will drink another beer,

887
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:07,100
wash the glasses,

888
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,160
approach the shower,

889
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:11,160
become dry and raspy,

890
00:55:11,860 --> 00:55:12,640
down another beer,

891
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:14,300
hose the glass,

892
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:16,620
stand before the shower,

893
00:55:17,500 --> 00:55:17,720
thirsty,

894
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,680
suck a few more beers in,

895
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,420
rinse and repeat.

896
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:26,400
Currently, my glass is cleaner than I am,

897
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:29,740
and I forgot why I'm standing in the bathroom,

898
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:31,900
so I just take a piss

899
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:33,580
and have another beer.

900
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:42,540
Thank you, ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland,

901
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,180
and then Sheridan, also from Cleveland.

902
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:49,920
Heck, I guess I was from Cleveland for almost 20 years,

903
00:55:49,980 --> 00:55:51,560
and I still kind of am,

904
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,440
even though it's now.

905
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:58,180

Subgenius.com.

908
00:56:08,180 --> 00:56:11,700
Our books are actually much better than our shows,

909
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:12,760
but then, you know,

910
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,400
this isn't the only Subgenius show,

911
00:56:15,540 --> 00:56:17,040
and not even the oldest.

912
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:21,760
See subgenius.com radio pull-down

913
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:25,160
for all necessary details.

914
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:26,580
Thank you for listening,

915
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,160
and thank you, Bob,

916
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:31,680
for not killing us all yet,

917
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,400
just on a whim.

918
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:06,260
Subgenius.com.

919
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,340
Pokes me in the eye with love.

920
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:12,460
Think about it.

921
00:57:19,460 --> 00:57:21,660
Who is the last guy to say to you

922
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:23,440
these words?

923
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,100
Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.

924
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:27,920
Who?

925
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,600
I say,

926
00:57:33,260 --> 00:57:35,620
don't trade Bob for eagle stamps.

927
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:38,940
Bob.

928
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:41,280
Pokes me in the eye with love.

929
00:57:48,540 --> 00:57:49,100
Bob.

930
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:51,800
Pokes me in the eye with love.

931
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,400
Take a rubber chicken to lunch.

932
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:05,240
Fake your orgasms.

933
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,620
Two in a row.

934
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,280
I say,

935
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,880
the ultra-bizarre

936
00:58:19,660 --> 00:58:21,660
is a belch of the mind.

937
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:27,000
Upchuck daily.

938
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:32,600
Bob.

939
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:35,800
Pokes me in the eye with love.

940
00:58:38,700 --> 00:58:40,220
The moonies are groovy,

941
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,000
but Bob is Bob.

942
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,600
Bob.

943
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,720
Pokes me in the eye with love.

944
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:59,100
Eat your spinach, baby.

945
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:01,940
Eat your spinach, baby.

946
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:04,440
Eat your spinach, baby.

947
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:07,480
Bob.

948
00:59:07,660 --> 00:59:09,100
Pokes me in the eye with love.

949
00:59:11,960 --> 00:59:14,080
Take a rubber chicken to lunch

950
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,680
Fake your orgasms

951
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,980
Two in a row

952
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,260
The moonies are groovy

953
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,300
But Bob

954
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,380
Is Bob

955
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:32,460
Bob pokes me in the eye with his

956
00:59:32,460 --> 00:59:37,460
Eat your spinach, baby

957
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:40,020
Eat your spinach, baby

958
00:59:40,020 --> 00:59:43,120
Eat your spinach, baby
