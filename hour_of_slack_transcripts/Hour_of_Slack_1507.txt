Bob's Bob.
Bob!
What's the trouble, Bob?
It's Bob.
That's Bob over there.
He's dead.
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.
Bob, I'm sorry.
Bob says it's the last one for him.
He didn't say that.
Bob said we had to get in.
He didn't say that.
Bob said, why don't you ask Bob that?
To his face.
We must know what we want.
We must want what we need.
And what we need is duty now for the future.
Duty now for the future, dear friends.
And the future is here.
Princess Wee and I walked in to Charleston's show ending,
and I suddenly realized that they had
completely replaced the mixing board,
the whole system that the DJ operates,
had been completely replaced.
I guess I missed a memo.
Praise Bob!
It's the most futuristic thing.
The chairs are spinning around.
The whole studio revolves around this.
It's on top of a giant spire,
a kind of tower like they have in Seattle and Dallas.
And they've changed everything.
It's the most Jetsons-looking thing I've ever seen.
And all I could think was,
it's a darn good thing that we were planning
to just play a pre-recorded show tonight.
You know in that movie 2001,
that black monolith thing,
that big black square domino-looking thing
that appears in front of the ape men,
and then on the moon,
and then at the end going,
ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
Well, I have one of those in my tummy today.
So I'm going to take a break and rest up
and play this pre-recorded episode of somebody else's show.
It was their idea, too.
Last week, I was interviewed for this podcast
called Project Archivist,
which you can find at projectarchivist.com.
And since it wasn't a subgenius show,
I actually explained the church of the subgenius.
And Bob Dobbs and everything else that's super important.
And so it's completely different from the normal hour of Slack.
In this one, I'm talking the whole time
and without Lonesome Cowboy Dave or Princess Wee.
And also, I'm on the phone, so the sound is a bit rough.
It's not caused by your speakers or this station.
Anyway, we'll play some Lemurian collagerie first,
and then we'll play some Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
It's going to be 48 minutes of the Project Archivist show.
Price Bob.
You love TV. You love TV.
From top athletes that call in sick
with a sore knee, shoulder, wrist, foot, or elbow.
That's how you stay on top. That's how you become a champion.
My feet ache every day.
Spreading cancer cells.
You love TV.
Were you able to perceive the truth?
Please.
No way. We made it up.
You love TV.
From PR News in Washington,
I'm going to continue carving trees and damaging buildings.
Meanwhile, Pakistani officials say the U.S.
captured trees in Afghanistan last year.
The BBC reports the U.S. is returning trees to Pakistan.
The American said today that the U.S. had first Afghanistan and Pakistan
killed by the Afghanistan army on the Pakistan border last year.
Then Afghanistan and Afghanistan came into the hands of the U.S.
drone strike, receiving humane treatment.
Typhoon Hagupet is across the Philippines.
Typhoon Hagupet woke up with relief.
Hagupet continues to make powerful winds and intense rain,
landslides and wet floods.
The typhoon is expected to make PR News in Manila.
Russia is praising French President Vladimir Putin.
PR's report reports.
Russia has been increasingly close to being canceled.
Moscow denies PR News.
This is.
PR.
PR News.
Ish.
The U.S. military has sent six trees to Uruguay
to continue treating Ebola patients.
Memorial ceremonies are being held
commemorating Japan's attack on PR News in Washington.
Hey, uh, Fry, do we have any pot?
No, we don't.
Marijuana is illegal.
What about nitrous, man?
Shut up, Er.
Fry, man, we're full of religion now.
Everyone, please, bow your heads and pretend to be serious.
Do it or I'll bow.
I'll bow for ya.
You have deeply offended us and our God, and our God is a God of vengeance and horror.
And action!
Our God is an Indian that turns into a wolf.
Man, that's a wolfin', man.
Well, the wolfin' will come for you with his razor.
Whether you drive a shiny new 1952 model or a pre-war jalopy,
remember that death is the biggest killer on the highways.
This year, 500 lives can be saved and 15,000 killed,
and 500,000 injured.
It'll be curtains for you.
When people say you're bright, they mean you've been used drugs.
They mean you've changed their brain.
They mean you've wasted your brain.
For information, call 6666.
Hey, everybody, welcome back.
This is an unusual episode.
And on this show, we have never shied away from covering religion, spirituality, all those kinds of things.
My personal favorite thing about this show is that it's a lot of fun.
And my personal belief on religion is I don't really care what a person believes in
as long as you're not hurting anybody else or imposing your beliefs onto somebody else.
How does the joke go?
Religion is kind of like having a penis.
It's fine until you start waving around in front of people or something like that.
Is that how?
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what it is.
Yeah.
So what we've decided to do on this show is we've decided to put together a show based on alternative religions.
Everybody that you're going to hear on this show,
for lack of a better term, is quote unquote in on the joke.
And it went through various forms because we were going to –
I almost interviewed a group of people that were into Odinism
and that actually believed in Odin, Thor and all those things.
But again, those people actually were into what they were believing.
And a lot of them also turned out to be white supremacists.
Fortunately, they didn't –
Yeah, that was awkward.
So fortunately, they didn't get back in touch with us.
They didn't get back in touch with me.
Then I thought about contacting the Raelians.
But again, you have a situation where as strange and as kooky as those people can be,
they actually believe in what they're talking about like hardcore.
So from there, the scope narrowed down and narrowed down and narrowed down to the point where on this episode,
we have Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius, which I call subgeni,
which he very quickly corrects me in the interview.
We also talked to Reverend Gary from the Church of the Later Day Dude.
Then we talked to Fred or Isla of Coincidence Control Network fame
who has managed to set up a religion based on Batman.
But we will get to that.
Batman.
So the first interview we do is with Reverend Ivan Stang, great guy.
This has probably been one of the most difficult interviews that I think we've had.

Despite my best efforts to keep this on track and keep it as a hard, serious interview,
it just, well, you'll see.
But it's funny.
I mean, it's been a little while since we've done a show where we've let our hair down and just had a good laugh and had a good time.
We're about due for that.
If you're a new listener to the show and you've caught all of our recent episodes, they've been fairly serious.
Yes, we've cracked jokes and things like that.
But every once in a while here, we like to let our hair down.
And just have a good time.
The odd part is neither myself nor Lobo really have any hair.
Hey, I shave mine.
I am balding and shave mine off and Lobo just shaves his off.
So this is going to be the show where we just sit back and have a good time and have a good laugh.
So we're going to move on with our first interview, which is going to be with Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Subgenius.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
All right.
With us tonight, we are graced with the fine presence of Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius.
Welcome to Project Archivist, Reverend Stang.
Say that again?
I said welcome to Project Archivist, Reverend Stang.
Oh, oh, oh, right.
I thought you were asking me to.
To project something and archive it.
No, that's not it.
Right.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Everything's fine.
What are we doing right now?
Recording.
Everything's going fine.
No trouble.
Everything is, yep, we're, with the blessings of Bob, we are now into the, we're sending this out into the ether for people to hear.
So where do we begin?
You are the, one of the ringmasters of the Church of the Subgeni, of which I am a big fan.
Well, no, no.
Actually, you have that wrong.
I'm not, I'm sorry, you guys.
You, you got, you got a hold of the shopping room clerk, the mail boy.
I'm the janitor.
Okay.
And the clerk.
Seriously.
I mean, I'm, I'm the guy that does the dirty work for you.
And it's the Church of the Subgenius.
Yes.
Subgeni is plural of subgenius, although we just as often say subgenius.
Well, is there a lower form of subgenius than subgenius?
Well, the ultimate subgenius is J.R.
Bob Dobbs, our guru, the, the saint of sales, the slack master.
He's both our leader and our logo, you might say.
I wish our listeners could see a picture of Bob and maybe that will, to some people that explains everything.
They see Bob's face.
He's a smiling, bored, cleaver looking guy with a pipe.
You feel like you've seen him a million times and you have because he's, he used to model for ads.
And magazines back in the old days, the square guy with the pipe with an insane grin.
And in some cases people go, well, that's their God.
Praise Bob.
I'm behind him all the way.
And other people go, well, that's just crazy.
He's just some guy.
Why, why would they believe a religion?
Because it's printed in a book.
Absolutely.
Good question.
Oh yes.
Yes.
You're preaching to the choir here.
Feel free to go right ahead.
Yeah.
So we're, um, so I'm, I'm, uh, I am the person that answers the phone here most of the time, but, uh, uh, it's the church of subgenius has been around for a long time.
Back in the late seventies, uh, my friend, Dr.
Philo Drummond and I kind of, well, basically we were in Dallas, Texas and the Bible belt in the eighties and they were telling us we were all going to go to heaven.

So what chance did we have?
I mean, what choice did we have, but to start our own religion?
Uh, what would, then we found out that Bob had already started the perfect religion.
And so we ended up working for him, although he seems to be kind of an absent guru.
Well, aren't all of the great ones.
We haven't seen him in quite a long time.
Although my office is covered with pictures of his face and products with pictures of his face.
Because, uh, I don't know.
I mean, this is where this is a, uh, uh, church, uh, not only that's out to save your soul, but to save us a whole lot of your money or so that we can give it to Bob.
Of course, you know, he needs it.
Absolutely.
But that's, you know, that's how these things work.
We borrowed from, we borrowed from the greatest religions from Jimmy Swagger and the televangelists to the, the major, the major, the major, the major, the major.
The, the, uh, the great, the great recent, the, the Scientologist, and of course the more established things like woke Anus and Oh Dan ism, Christianity, Hinduism, so forth.
Mm.
You know, we, we pick and it's kind of like going through your, your dad's paperbacks, you know, you're looking for the good parts.
I was thinking of porn collection myself, but go ahead.
Yeah, well that's what I, that's the kind of paperbacks.
Yeah.
Special drawer that we found.
The, the, the really good parts.
of all these ancient religions
and with Bob's directions
kind of stitched them together
into sort of a Frankenstein's monster
composed of parts of dead religions.
Then needless to say,
you know, when you,
we all know what happens
when you create a monster,
it always kind of turns against its creator
and hilarity ensues.
So for 35 years,
we've been slaves to J.R. Bob Dobbs
at this point.
I doubt if we have much choice,
but we wouldn't have it any other way.
Yes.
Well, let me ask you, if I may,
tell us the story of J.R. Bob Dobbs.
I mean, I am aware that he is
the world's greatest salesman,
but it is to my understanding and knowledge
that he had contact with extraterrestrials as well.
Is that correct?
Yeah, that didn't start
until he was well-established
in his sales career,
which was uncannily lucky.
And let's just say the aliens noticed
there was this vortex in the luck plane.
There was something happening
on this little planet
that was not normal at all.
And let's go back in time
about 40 billion years.
And there's this alien,
space monster that goes by the name Jehovah
and various other names.
Jehovah One,
he's just another alien space monster,
but he's meddled with Earth history
for a long time.
And we've seen the dreadful results
all over the planet.
But Jehovah One,
a single Bob out in the 50s
and fed him a bunch of visions
of the end of the world,
of course,
very dramatic predictions.
As one does, yes.
The world would end on July 5th, 1998,
when the men from Planet X
would come down from space
and rescue the dues-paying subgeniuses
who would then be given
giant planet-sized spaceships
and anything they ever wanted,
such as revenge on anyone
who ever picked on them.
I'm more interested in collecting things
like the Grand Canyon
than getting revenge
on my fifth-grade teacher,
although she's on
the list.
But the problem, of course,
with prophecy is,
you know,
you stand around
and wait for the saucers
on July 5th, 1998,
and by golly,
they don't show up.
So you do it again in 99.
And we actually do this.
Every year,
there's subgeniuses
all over the world outside,
so they don't bump their heads
on the ceiling
when they're ruptured up.
They stand around outside
at 7 a.m.,
this ungodly hour,
and the day after,
you know,
with a hangover on July 5th,
waiting for the aliens.
And because,
you know, sure,
we're disappointed each year,
but are we going to let
the Jehovah's Witnesses
out-cook us?
I ask you,
and the answer is nay.
Nay.
So we,
it's actually really,
and some of us gather
in a big campground every year.
It's been in southern Ohio
this decade.
And we deliberately
choose,


we choose a clothing optional
kind of hippie pagan campground.
Not that we're pagans
or all hippies or anything,
but we enjoy...
Well, pagan implies godlessness.
We can throw a party
just as well as the pagans
and hippies can,
and we use some of the same equipment,
including nudity,
although it's usually
just the wrong people
that are getting baptized,
doing the naked baptism.
So we basically,
after 35 years,
the Church of the Subgenius
has actually grown
to be bigger
than quite a few cults
that have gotten a lot more news,
were much bigger than Jonestown.
If we committed all suicide
all at once,
we would way outnumber them,
and certainly Heaven's Gate.
Those guys were such amateurs.
Boy, did I get a lot of worried.
You know,
Subgenius has got a lot of worried
phone calls from people
the morning of the week.



They're like,
the Heaven's Gate suicide.
It's like, what?
Flying saucer believers?
And they killed themselves?
They get on board?
Oh, no, that sounds like
subgeniuses to me.
And none of those people
were even marked.
I have a question I'd like to ask you
real quick.
If I may cut you off
for just a second.
One of our listeners
has asked me to ask you,
did Bob Dobbs actually
sell the Earth to the Exus?
And if so,
how much money did Bob
make from that sale?
Or is that just a vicious...
Well, yeah,
it's a yes and no.
Yes and no.
The deal is closed.
Obviously,
it isn't 1998 yet.
They've lied to us
about calendars and time.
We're not even sure
what planet this is,
much less which year.
Obviously,
because if Bob said
the aliens would be here in 1998,
it obviously isn't 1998 yet.
But the deal is closed.
We have faith in Bob,
the FIB, we call it.
We all hold up the FIB.
And he...
It's not a deal





in money.
The aliens don't care
about human notes
of exchange, currency.
They collect what we might call
anguish and pain or soul.
To an alien,
the extracted soul of a human
removed from a subgenius
by Bob and kept in containers
that happen to be
in my basement right now.
Those are what the aliens...
That's like a kind of a drug
for the aliens.
They'll huff,
they'll puff,

they'll puff these
like bath salts.
If you ever wonder
what happened to the dinosaurs,
something like this occurred
back then
at the end of the Cretaceous.
So we're hoping it works out
a little bit more controlled
this time.
Of course, we've got Bob
to help broker the deal.
Of course, we need
as many subgenius ministers
as we possibly can.
We're trying to make sure
the world ends correctly
so that the...
deserving, the pinks,
what we...
You know, any religion,
it's us versus them.
We refer to all the unsaved
as the humans,
the pink boys,
the mediocritans,
the Barbies and Kins,
the Gloriffs.
We have as many nasty names
for us as they do for us.
No, wait.
As many nasty names for them
as they do for us.
We also have nasty names for us.
Yes.
And it's really fun
to watch the Bobbies
talk about who else is a Bobby.
So that's bad.
That's like being a Mooney.
See, you're too into Bob.
And so it's amusing
to sit in our high thrones
in the hierarchy
and watch the Bobbies
call each other Bobby.
So you do have a separation
within your church
is what you're saying then?
Or is this common?
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
Yeah, there's...
We don't have a list.
We don't have a list.
We don't have a list
of who is in the hierarchy,
but you can kind of tell
who's not.
It's mostly nepotistic
and based on seniority.
Philo was the first
of Bob's called ministers,
and I was the second one.
Of course, I was the sucker
who did most of the work.
That's fine, though.
Philo gets invited
to the good parties.
Yeah.
At the Playboy Mansion,
stuff like that.
Yeah, but that place
isn't that great anymore,
so you're not missing much there,
I would assume.
Oh, I didn't even know.
Anyway,
back in the 80s,
strangely enough,
the people used to draw
underground comics like Zap,
including some of the well-known ones
like Robert Crumb
and Gilbert Shelton.
Robert Williams,
and especially Paul Mavridis
and Jay Kinney
got interested in the church,
and they felt
that we were right about Bob,
and Bob was the answer.
Well, maybe not the answer,
but neither is anything else.
Yes.
So we had a really nice boost,
seriously,
in the world of publishing
because of having
a lot of people










among the underground cartoonists.
They really helped give us
a boot up,
and we managed to get it out in 1983,
which, strangely enough,
that first book is still in print.
The Book of the Subgenius,
it's an e-book,
although I don't recommend the e-book.
The layout isn't anything like the real book.
And we did several other books since then,
and there's three current
subgenius radio shows
on radio,
and we did a lot of them.



Radio stations.
I mean,
college,
mostly college
and independent stations.
My show,
The Hour of Slack,
is on
the Cleveland State University station.
But I've been on for 30 years.
Yeah, it's also available
for podcasts.
And with...
It actually gets to be
a bit of a chore
every single week
after 30 years.
We're on episode number
1,506, I think.
Holy crap.
And, yeah,
not many of those
have been reruns.
It's...
There must...
And we try to use
material that's only by
subgeniuses.
We might use
old monster movie music
in the background
when we're ranting
or spouting
or whatever,
or preaching.
But most of the time,
my show is original.
There's another show,
Reverend Susie the Fluesy
does Bob Slack
on FunHeads.
Out of WREK
at Georgia Tech
in Atlanta.
And she's been on
for 25 years.
And her show is mostly
collage of found audio
and the best of bad music.
Then there's the
Puzzling Evidence show
at KPFA Berkeley,
which is one of the oldest
underground stations,
although it is a broadcast,
big broadcast station.
And they've been doing it
since 1982.
And it's...
It's just pure freeform
improv madness,
the Puzzling Evidence show.
So we've done everything
that doesn't make money.
We've never had a TV show
or a movie
or a really commercial show.
You do have a role-playing game
out there.
Yeah, we...
Steve Jackson Games
and us
did an extension
for his Illuminati
New World Order game.
Back in the 95.
And that was a lot of...
That was a lot of fun.
That was a project
that I didn't write
but helped to illustrate.
Normally, it's the other way around.
I can't draw.
But I did learn how to use...
I did learn how to use
Bryson Poser
for a while there.
All right.
Well...
Oh, God.
Let me ask you this.
Let's say that I am
a lost degenerate soul
who is without slack,
which we will get to
in a minute.
What would reasons
would there be for me
to come and join
the Church of the Subgenius?
Well, right off the bat,
there wouldn't be
any good reason
because by definition,
this is an organization
for non-joiners.
So, it's like a club
for non-conformists.
So, obviously,
you would never want
to be a member of a club
that would have you
as a member.
Some people get the wrong idea
and think it has something
to do with being a genius.
No, just the opposite.
We're saying that intelligence
has been mystified.
We're talking about
common sense,
sense of humor,
and dollars and cents.
But the main thing
that you could actually
get out of it
in real life
would be
some swinging new friends,
including ones
of possibly
the desired sex.
So...
I'll be the first to admit
that for a long time
in the 80s,
the church looked like
kind of a sausage fest.
Like,
like,
like a Devo concert
or a Dwar concert.
But,
if you go to a Devo concert now
or comic book conventions,
it used to be all guys.
The comic book conventions.
You go to a comic convention
or a game convention now,
it's wonderful girl watching,
if nothing else.
Yes.
The same thing happened
with the church of the subgenius.
You know,
it's like,
build it and they will come.
We started acting like
it was a sex cult.
And,
although most of us
old timers who started it
are too square
to pick up on it,
the younger generation
used it for just that.
And,
we've had,
I keep,
I've lost count
of how many people
that I've personally married.
I mean,
to each other,
not me marrying them.
But,
I was,
I was the minister
on lots of,
you know,
legitimate weddings
and they had kids.
Some of them had divorces
and then married other,
you know,
divorced geniuses.
We,
we've matched up
quite a few subgeniuses
with pagans.
But,
you know,
they're,
they're,
they're from different
religious backgrounds
in that the pagans
have one.
But,
we,
they do,
like I say,
the pagans know how to party.
And,
and I,
I actually am involved
in some of the big
pagan festivals too.
I make fun of them,
but the cool pagans
love that.
You know,
they have a sense of humor
and they love to piss off
the fundamentalist pagans.
And,
believe me,
they're,
those people are like
Baptists or Methodists
or,
you know,
Muslims,
Islamics,
radicals,
you know.
Is there fundamentalist
subgeniuses as well though?
Yeah,
but we,
they don't last very long
because everybody else
ends up,
sooner or later
they realize
everybody's laughing at me.
Wait a minute.
You mean,
I'm what they're making fun of?
Yes.
The believer.
You have to believe
in,
in Bob
and not believe in him
at the same time.
It's,
it's this constant
tension
and dichotomy
where you're,
you know,
you may have Bob
tattooed on your arm,
but at the same time
you feel compelled
to like
throw a picture
of him down
and just
pee on it
now and then.
So,
sometimes we do that.
We pee,
we'll pee on Bob's head,
you know,
to prove that we're not
fanatics.
You said,
you laugh like this
is a joke,
but I'm talking about
things that happen
in real life.
It's funny
because it's true.
There was,
I swear to God,
at one of our stage shows
this homeless woman
got up on stage
and just
pulled down her drawers
and started peeing
on the poster of Bob.
I later found out
somebody had paid her
to do that.
But,
that was a proud moment.
Yeah.
We've had some
real freakish.
We don't do a lot
of live shows.

the,
the,
we even tried to tour
with Glar
at their invitation,
but even that
fan group
is not ready
for spoken word.
No matter
how much porno
you have projected
behind the creature.
We were always
very multimedia.
Okay.
We've tried to,
it was back
in the old days
we projected films.
I'm going to ask you
to explain
the unexplainable
and I'm going to ask you
to explain
the process of Slack.
What is Slack?
How do you get Slack?
Is Slack a byproduct
of Bob?
And what can Slack
do for you,
me,
and everybody?
Well,
everyone is actually
born with original Slack.
But,
the conspiracy
of the normal people
starts taking it
away from you
from the get-go.
You know,
they tell you,
they tell you
what you can eat
and drink
and what you can think
basically.
And,
from the time
you're a little kid,
they won't let you
let a baby
eat thumbtacks.
There may be reasons
why babies
shouldn't eat thumbtacks,
but that's one example.
You know,
they start,
you know,
hemming you in
and telling you
what you can and can't do.
And,
eventually,
it becomes,
people get to where
they think it's
perfectly normal
to work
at an unrewarding job
just to
pay for the,
right,
to be alive
and have a shelter.
And,
I mean,
let's face it,
that is the way it is.
And,
we can't promise you
a free air-conditioned
cardboard box
under a bridge.
You have to,
you have to do
that kind of thing yourself.
All we try to do
is remind people
that maybe
slack is not
to be found
in that raise
that's always
around the corner
or that boyfriend
or girlfriend
that you wish
you had
or if only
you could,
you know,
become a master
of that one video game
and you have slack.
It's never,
well,
actually,
that might be.
Yeah,
that's an excellent
example of slack.
That might actually
be a legitimate
path to slack.
I can't wait
to get back
to Monster Hunter 4
as soon as we're
finished with this.
But,
we,
it's,
you know,
for some people,
slack is just doing
whatever oddball
little thing
they sort of,
wanted to be doing.
You know,
it might be a hobby
like bird collecting
or hopefully
it's not serial killing.
But,
hey,
you know.
So,
so really,
we're just a pep talk
or kind of a reminder
that although slack
and money are related,
they're not the same thing.
And although slack
and sex are related,
they're not the same thing.
Bob is slack.
Bob is sex.
Bob is money.
Mm-hmm.
That's all you really need
is just,
you know,
really,
you could forego
the books
and the $35
ordainment
and,
you know,
all of that.
You could
and just simply
swipe a picture
of Bob somewhere
and stare at that thing
for the rest of your life
and find true slack.
That hasn't worked
for me.
Yeah,
I would rather have
the sex
and the money
and the women
and all that.
I must be
loving this.
Oh, right.
The picture of Bob
can be on the wall
and you could,
you know,
whatever.
Yeah.
Uh,
so,
yeah,
the important thing
is we don't promise
you a damn thing
except some really
nice reading material
um,
and
the opportunity
to meet
some interesting people.
And by interesting,
sometimes
you,
you wish,
sometimes
that the other
subgenius
is that one person
put on this planet
to piss you off.
But most of them
aren't.
Um,
and, uh,
uh,
it's,
you know,
you don't want to go to Mensa.
Everybody there thinks
they're smart.
Well,
you won't find that
at church of the subgenius
because they don't even agree
what smart means.
Hmm.
You know,
you might get some help.
You might,
you might hear some really
dirty jokes.
I can promise,
I can,
I can promise that.
Nice.
So,
you know,
it's, um,
each person gets slack
in their own way.
Mm-hmm.
What Bob does
is he helps you pull
the wool over your own eyes,
so that you can relax
in the safety
of your own delusions.
And he,
and he also brings you,
not,
instead of forgiveness,
he brings excuses.
Um,
you know,
you don't,
he's not requiring you
to act smart.
In fact,
as Bob said,
if you act,
and this is,
really holds true
in most jobs,
if you act like a dumb shit,
they will treat you
as an equal.
Mm-hmm.
And,
think about it.
It's called
talking over.
It's really true.
And we,
and do you really
have to feel like
you're brilliant
and smart
and,
you know,
understand integral calculus
in order to know
how the universe works?
Why should you know
how the universe works?
You know,
we're just trying
to surf the luck plane.
Mm-hmm.
That's,
to,
to,
to follow the path
of least resistance.
So,
do you have the most
flack
for the least effort?
And,
if you can,
you know,
live off on the dole
or just gob on life,
as we say,
then great.
Most of us really
can't do that
and end up having
to deal with the man
one way or another.
And that's where
the hour of slack comes in.
Yes.
When you,
if you can drive home
from work listening
to the hour of slack,
or no doubt your show,
uh,
or any of the subgenius shows,
you'll,
you're a little less likely
to have the kind of road rage
that puts you in pressure.
I'll tell you,
the subgenius hour of slack,
you know,
that I listen to
through podcast form
is what gets me through
my work week.
Um,
you know,
uh,
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Bob and slack have done
tremendous things for me.
Yes,
I am a big advocate
of Bob myself.
Um,
so I'm aware you just got back
from a big long trip
and everything.
I do listen,
you know,
faithfully every week
to the stream of consciousness
that is the subgenius hour
of slack.
So,
I'm here to,
uh,
uh,
since,
since,
uh,
I know I haven't worked
for anyone except
the church of the subgenius
for several years now.
And my wife retired
from a government job.
So,
uh,
we are,
are able to travel
around a lot during,
uh,
and of course live in Cleveland.
We choose to travel around
during the winter.
We go south,
we go to California.
In fact,
we,
we explored the Salton Sea
this last,
uh,
January.
You can buy really cheap
land there.
It'd be a great place
for a cult compound.
Absolutely.
Uh,
except,
except for the fact
that the whole area
smells like rotting toxic fish
and it's 120 degrees
in the summer.
But hey,
you know,
if you have faith in Bob.
But it's a dry heat.
It's really a dry heat.
Yeah,
we'll,
we'll put him to work
on a little farm down there
or something.
Nice.
Now for a moment,
let's consider an entirely
different type of case.
The case of Bob,
one which shows
how ambitious men
can get ahead
under our American system
of free enterprise.
When Bob graduated
from high school,
Bob was surprised to learn
that this Bob society
had created a special type
of life
for people of his type.
Right, Bob?
Well,
life never was a burden.
In the first place,
Bob's flexible.
Bob can expand
or contract.
Now,
Bob is a man






who has gone far.
Why not profit
by Bob's example?
Send the postcard care
of this station
to the Bob society.
Until last week,
the Bob society
of the United Bobs.
We've had you on here
for a while.
It sounds great.
I'm an ex-Jehovah's Witness.
I'm on board.
Yeah.
Yeah,
see,
yeah,
Lobo here is an ex-Jehovah's Witness.
So,
um,
Wow.
Well,
then,
you've probably heard
some fairly intense preaching,
I would hope.
Well,
I guess they're not,
they're not real big
on show business,
are they?
The Jehovah's Witnesses,
you know,
I'll tell you what,
they have the best artwork
of anybody.
I have been more inspired
by the artwork
in Watchtower
and,
um,
what's that other one?
Awake.
Yeah,
those two,
those two,
we were really inspired
by those.
Philodramon and I
would look at those,
we'd find them free
in laundromats,
and we'd look at each other
and went,
you know,
we could print up
something like this,
but it's a little,
a little cheaper
and we have to use clip art
because we don't have
the great painters
that the Jehovah's Witnesses did.
But,
uh,
we thought we could leave
this stuff in laundromats
and that was actually
how it started.
The problem was,
it turned out that printing
was more than we expected.
My wife at the time
got really mad
when she saw
the $60 printing bill
for a hundred pamphlets
and said,
you have to send these
to publishers,
you can't just
give these away.
And we did
and the publishers
all threw them away,
but,
at the underground
comic book places,
the artists
fished them out
of the trash.
And we were saved.
We almost went out
of business in,
in the,
in,
well,
yeah,
in a way,
we were financially saved
because somebody
noticed our work
and,
and we got a publisher.
Then we almost went
out of business
until the internet
came around in the 90s
and that really
saved our asses.
You know,
it was,
uh,
we needed
a new way
to reach out
and there it was.
How,
how far,
are you,
are you global?
I mean,
are there,
are there subgeniuses
all over the world?


Yeah,
if you,
if you look at,
uh,
subgenius.com
under the events,
uh,
you'll see that there's,
uh,
been regular,
uh,
tours and
revivals in,
uh,
Europe and,
um,
well,
all over Europe,
mostly England
and Germany
and Amst,
the Holland.
We,
we really enjoy Amsterdam.
I would imagine.
That's one of our favorite
places to,
well,
they,
they don't need to be preached to
about Slack.
But,
um,
we just like to go there.
But,
uh,
and,
uh,
there's a lot of them in Austr,
there's a,
there's a whole,
in the English speaking world,
there's subgeniuses all over.
I'm talking about thousands of them,
not a few dozen
or a few hundred.
I'm talking about thousands.
I would say over the years,
I mean,
it's been 30,
35 years.
We get at least,
at the very least,
we get two,
a membership or two a day.
And some years it's more like six or seven a day.
So you do the math.
It's been like 40,
50,000 people
who,
who bought the actual membership.
I don't mean that bought,
we sold a hundred thousand,
the,
the book of the subgenius
and the other books have sold over a hundred thousand copies
over a long period of time.

So it's,
there's no way this stuff could ever be bestseller material.
That would,
I mean,
it's,
it's anti bestseller material.
It's the antidote
to everybody else's placebo.
So,
you know,
we don't,
we've never really expected anything big time.
We would love to,
I have a movie screenplay
and we'd love to do a,
a movie sometime,
but,
crowdfunded.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well,
I've been starting to think about that.
What we would more likely do would be to crowdfund
a radio play album,
sort of like the Fireside Theater used to do.
That would be awesome.
That was the inspiration.
That was,
that was our original inspiration was Fireside Theater,
really,
for a whole,
for the radio subgeniuses anyway.
You could do that through podcast form now with no problem.
You could do that.
Cracked Prairie Home Companion.
Yeah, exactly.
You could do that now through home,
through,
through podcasting format now.
It's,
that would be somewhat easy.
Well,
right.
But the,
the important thing is the slack.
Yes.
So,
I,
I really personally didn't get into this to be the clerk of the church,
but,
but I do end up doing that a lot of the time.
And I'm not really that ambitious of a clerk.
And we're,
we're starting to put some of our stuff on and camp.
And actually charge for it.
For the,
the radio stuff has always basically been for free.
We sell CDs and stuff,
but nobody buys CDs anymore.
And we,
we sell downloadable things.
And of course the hour slack is just free,
but we ask for donations and believe it or not,
we get some.
What,
what we lack in sales,
we've made up foreign donations in the last few years,
I think just because we've been around for so long.
There's,
there's people that kind of really have gotten to where they appreciate us
being there.
They'd hate to see us disappear because in certain,
you know,
to,
to some people were,
were like the last little remnant of really anti-commercial,
whatever,
whatever we're doing,
uh,
preaching.
It's not,
we want,
we want money.
It's not that we,
we,
we don't want money.
It's that we don't want to work for it.
Yeah.
We don't want it to be a job.
You know,
as long as we can do this stuff at college stations in the dead of night,
we have all this great equipment.
We can do what we wanted to do and nobody cares.
You know,
we're not beholden to any advertisers.
We just can't cost.
Well,
that's what the internet version is for.
I put the customers back in for the internet version.
So,
so really it's,
we've had a lot of freedom of,
uh,
of fun.
I mean,
we,
we've had to do this around working around our day jobs,
most of us.
Uh,
but you might say it beats working.
I don't know.
Well,
several of my friends are art bums like me.
Uh,
they,
they do just enough for freelance work of different kinds or they make just enough off of some kind of sub-genius royalty or another that they,
they can live in a nice,
uh,
hovel and not have to shave.
Can one,
you know,
shave or go to work?
Can one become ordained in the sub-genius to become a sub-genius minister?
Well,
yeah,
that's the whole idea.

you,
you pay a fee that's 35 bucks and we ordain you as a sub-genius minister and there's no law that says you aren't a minister.
You,
you can perform legal weddings.
You may have to,
um,
provide a little bit of paperwork,
but we help with that.
We also encourage people to join the Universal Life Church,
which is a sort of a tax protest church that's quite legitimate.
They were formed because their founder,
Bishop Henley,
thought,
why should people,
why should religions be tax exempt?
Why should my taxes subsidize somebody's ridiculous,
made up magic time of sky story?
So I'm just going to make my own religion and say I'm tax exempt.
So they do the tax exempt thing,
which is tricky.
Uh,
we don't do that.
We can ordain you and you can do weddings,
but,
uh,
but don't try to claim tax exempt unless you work through somebody a little bit more,
uh,
soberly established like the Universal Life Church.
I'll tell you,
man,
if,
if,
if our weddings are not legitimate,
then a hell of a lot of people have wasted money on expensive divorces.
Our weddings are cheap,
but the divorce is not.
Yeah,
you know what?
They're worth it.
Exactly.
Well,
you know,
yeah,
the lawyers are the ones that make the good money on that.
So if God,
if we could,
you know,
if we could sell divorces,
that would be the big money.
See,
I guess what we need is the law office of the subgenius,
not the church.
I'm sure you could establish that.
Well,
let me ask you this then.
If I pay the $35 and I become ordained,
does this buy me any form of salvation?
Does this buy me a ticket on the magical spaceship off of the planet on the day that X day actually comes?
Well,
in fact,
we have an offer that no other religion makes.
Oh,
okay.
Eternal salvation,
eternal salvation or triple your money back.
So if you end up at the gates of hell,
for eternity,
we will pay you back $110.
Oh my God.
It's so much fucking way.
The problem is the,
the eternity issue.
That's the problem.
You know,
you have to prove it was for eternity.
So it may take a while before your check comes through.
But,
but yeah,
you know,
I,
I mean,
I tell you what,
if you do end up at the gates of hell,
cause you joined the church,
then I guess you deserve that.
But,
but,







Buy or beware.
We haven't heard it.
Yeah.
We haven't heard any reports back.
I was going to say,
if you had to honor that guarantee thus far or,
you know.
X money that?
Yeah.
No,
no,
you know,
lots of jokers,
uh,
try to claim it,
but that's the,
you know,
there's that eternal.
That's not even in small print.
That's the first word of the guarantee,
the colonel salvation or triple your money back.
of salvation. You could buy your way out of hell for specific amounts
of time for a certain indulgence, you know.
You'd give a certain amount of money to the church and it would save you
some time in hell, but I always thought that was kind of a rip-off because hell
by definition is pretty much eternal and what you're
buying is just a drop in the bucket. Might as well give it away to the
poor, frankly. Well, what is Bob's version of heaven? Is there a
Bobtopia? Well, think of most
people's version of hell.
It's kind of like the reverse order. The Christian heaven is the subgenius
hell. It would be so boring to us.
Whereas the subgenius, you kind of have to go to the regular hell
to be ready to appreciate how great the subgenius heaven
is because it's just unimaginable. First off, you get
to live forever.
X day comes, assuming you can make it till X day.
You get to live as long as you want. Then when you choose to die,
you still get the eternal salvation.
So, you know, it's a win-win situation no matter
what. You'd be crazy not to spend
the $35. Absolutely.
For all we know, the Baptists are right and hell is real, so it doesn't hurt to
repent on your deathbed either.
At the last minute, you know, just go, okay, Jesus, I believe in you.
Muhammad, you too. Jehovah, all you guys. Krishna, Rama,
Odin, I'm all for y'all, all of you.
I'm ready for my virgins.
We're not going to tell you what to do. We'll just tell you how to think.
That's all.
That's all.
Reverend Stang, we've had you on here.
We've had you on here for 45 minutes. I was originally only intending to have you on here
for about 20 or so. I didn't want to take up all this time.
We always do that.
Well, this was worth the $35.
Hey, guess what? I'm not really Ivan Stang. I'm really
Ed Holmes from the Church of the Last Laugh.
Oh, yeah.
I'm going to put a link up to the Church of the Subgenius in our
show notes when this show goes up.
We also have some beautiful pictures of Bob up there.
If anybody wants to join your fine organization,
they would go to subgenius.com, I would assume. That's the website?
That's it. Subgenius.com. Everything you know is right in the first words at the top of the page.
The important thing is that the word subgenius does not have an O in it,
although .com does.
In fact, there are two Os in .com, depending on
how you do it.
The property is with the word.
Yes, correct.
Easily able to be found on the Googles, which has two Os in it.
Thank you very much for coming on here.
We very much appreciate it.
I can't thank you enough. It's been a pleasure and an honor to speak with you.
Next time when I call, I hope to actually talk to the real
Reverend Ivan Stang and not the janitor.
For being a janitor, you've done a fantastic job of
filling us in on pretty much nothing.
For that, I am truly grateful.
I've listened to Reverend Stang for years.
I can imitate almost all of his famous sermons.
You sound almost exactly like the guy.
I would wager to venture that you probably actually are
Reverend Ivan Stang posing as a janitor,
which is fine.
We all have our fetishes.
I was the first Bobby.
I was the first Bobby.
I'll do anything Bob says.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Thank you very much.
It's been a pleasure talking to you.
Six to an even.
Over and out.
Thank you.
Six o'clock, Bob.
Time to wake up.
Come on, Bob.
Come on, Bob.

Come on, Bob.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.


No.
Bob.




So that was Reverend Ivan Stang.
Uh,
again,
you can go to,
or was it,
or was it the janitor?
Oh, God.
Listen, people,
if you,
I'm going to warn everybody here.
If you go out and download the subgenius hour of slack,
of which I myself am a subscriber to,
um,
that show,
uh,
can be difficult to listen to.
It is a one hour LSD mushroom stream of consciousness trip.
Some of their episodes are really funny.
Some of their episodes,
I'm not sure what they are.
What's funny about that interview is I kept,
I only wanted to have him.
I wanted to have him on for like 30 minutes or so,
maybe 20 minutes.
Come on,
tell us what the church is all about.
And he just kept going.
And I just,
you know,
we talked about it.
I've,
you know,
we decided not to edit that show.
So what you heard was the actual interview word for word.
Cause I kept trying to let him go or I'd go to say something and stag just,
you know,
he evangelizes.
He's out there doing what he does.
He's a preacher and he puts far more work into what he does than he should for the amount of slack that he wants to acquire.
Oh,
but he was in a mess.
He had a battle scene coming up in the movie deeper than what she had planned.
It came up and I wasn't gonna not do it from my part.
I was gonna do whatever it was she asked me to do,




you can't let blood toombő you see,





Come,
I just have topai our lin 들.
It's pretty much ever since we played her in my first movie.
so I can help her rest himself.

But still maybe something that you should consider when taking part in it.
