1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,220
Oh, God. What is that?

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:03,840
And if you're looking for a copy of Fair Use, I'm selling it.

3
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,500
But I can't tell you the price, and I can't tell you what's interesting.

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,800
That's a snippy.

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:09,240
All right, here's Doug.

6
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,920
That's a little snippy, that little small background.

7
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,960
Now let's get back to the real show.

8
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,440
Yeah, this is actually, now we're at the puzzling edge of the over-the-network how.

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:19,920
I'm Jane of Hyperclates, here with a special edition of the

10
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:23,840
Subgenius Hour of Slack slash Jane of Hyperclates show.

11
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:32,280
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

12
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,700
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

13
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,280
The Subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,580
is specially designed only to be played on radio station

15
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:51,220
and only in the city of

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:53,120
the Subgenius.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,920
So now what are we?

18
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:57,260
We are the over-the-puzzling edge.

19
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,220
We're puzzling over the, no, it's in there.

20
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,860
This is about Electra, a performance art piece by Sabrina.

21
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,640
It's puzzling over the evidence edge.

22
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,840
Superior mutants, repent.

23
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:10,200
Quit your job.

24
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:10,960
Slack off.

25
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,980
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

26
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:17,060
Had about enough of have a nice day.

27
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,300
Tired of all the touchy-feely cosmic sweetness and light crap?

28
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,360
Every time you go to work,

29
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,020
do you feel that a horrible joke is being played upon you?

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,940
Hate everyone else?

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,060
Are you driven in short to the very brink of sanity

32
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:33,540
by the false reality of a crumbling society?

33
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,460
Are you abnormal?

34
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,280
Then you're probably better than most people.

35
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,680
Tune in to the Subgenius Hour of Slack

36
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,240
Friday morning between midnight and 3 a.m.

37
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:46,180
on KBF 88.3.

38
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:48,140
Hosted by Jane of Hyperclates.

39
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,580
This show right here is Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

40
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:56,580
And I'm your polymorphously indeterminate Master of Ceremonies

41
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:00,540
and Pastor for this Sunday morning of religious observances

42
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,360
and related Bobfoolery,

43
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:05,040
Reverend Dr. Nolan Void.

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,060
This is a religious show after all.

45
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:13,060
And in fact, I have even had a very much sort of a religious experience myself just recently,

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,440
which I will share with you at incredible length and greater detail

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,600
than you can probably stand.

48
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,300
But that's the nature of this religion, my friends.

49
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,160
You get to...

50
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,940
ranting and venting about all those cool things that Bob does to you.

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,760
And, well, time just gets to fly.

52
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:35,980
ESO radio is now on the air.

53
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,100
Broadcasting live on the air from high atop the Fender Road's Tower of Power,

54
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:46,140
overlooking the eerie banks of the Cuyahoga.

55
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:52,560
My name is Chaz, and I'll be your pilot on this flight as we fly for you, Swamp.

56
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:53,840
Radio.

57
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,660
Featuring Lonesome Cowboy Dave and the Brain Rock Radio Theater.

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:05,120
Special appearances by the Reverend Ivan Stang.

59
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,960
Ultra-twisted talk radio from the late-night dregs and archives.

60
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:14,180
And the professional orchestra and residents down in the ESO Swamp.

61
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,700
Einstein Secret Orchestra.

62
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:23,340
Everything you hear is recorded live on the air at WSB.

63
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:32,340
So sit down and spell, take your clothes off, and spend a night in the Swamp.

64
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,140
Yes, dear friend.

65
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,160
Slush.

66
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,800
What?

67
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,300
Funny thing about slush is that it never goes away.

68
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,840
Well, dear friends, we have a show of shows.

69
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:53,200
Yes, there are so many shows that are related to the subgenius.

70
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,080
One true show.

71
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,560
Of course, all those fine people are...

72
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,440
Well, they're just fine people, but you know, there's only one.

73
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,640
Ah, hour of slack, my friends.

74
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,860
Only one, and it's probably a damn good thing.

75
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:13,140
Of course, this one is often composed of the work of so many.

76
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,360
So many good and bad, truly bad, bad subgeniuses.

77
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,180
And, well, let's start things off with a...

78
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:23,260
Not so much a...

79
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,880
Not so much a sermon here.

80
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,580
This is a...

81
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:26,700
But it's a food for thought, certainly.

82
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:36,240
This is from a cheesy sci-fi paperback book by Paul Anderson called Brainwave.

83
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,300
And it's about what happens when the planet goes out...

84
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:46,460
Earth comes out from under some cloud that it turns out we've been all along.

85
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:52,900
And the intelligence of all creatures on the planet triples and quadruples.

86
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,480
And so forth.

87
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,720
And suddenly, all the humans are geniuses.

88
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,300
And all the dogs and cats can read books.

89
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:03,160
And it causes terrible, terrible...

90
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,160
You can well imagine, I mean, if you think about it,

91
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:10,500
if suddenly all the pinks and normals became as unto...

92
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,980
Even a subgenius, not even a genius.

93
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:17,420
It would spell the end of civilization as we know it, certainly.

94
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:20,540
You know, who would put up with all the stupid crap?

95
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,460
But anyway, these two scientists...

96
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:25,120
Who have now become geniuses are talking about it.

97
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,020
And the man says,

98
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,280
I don't really understand it.

99
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:30,820
Human relationships were never my long suit.

100
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,380
And even now, I can't quite...

101
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:39,940
Well, why should this sudden upsurge in intelligence throw so many back to the animal stage?

102
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,080
Why can't they see?

103
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:48,140
And Helga draws hard on her cigarette and says they don't want to see.

104
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,460
Quite apart from those who've gone insane.

105
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,280
And they're an...

106
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:52,880
Important factor.

107
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:57,300
There remains the necessity of not only having something to think with,

108
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,680
but something to think about.

109
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,820
You've taken millions, hundreds of millions of people

110
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,520
who've never had an original thought in their lives

111
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,820
and suddenly thrown their brains into high gear.

112
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,640
They start thinking, but what basis have they got?

113
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:17,900
They still retain the old superstitions, prejudices, hates and fears and greeds.

114
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,960
And most of their new mental energy goes to elaborate rationalization.

115
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,420
They have to be able to understand the meaning of the old superstitions.

116
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:23,420


117
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:23,420


118
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:23,420


119
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,560
Then someone like this third Bob comes along

120
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,840
and offers an anodyne to frighten and confuse people.

121
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:35,060
And he tells them it's alright to throw off the terrible burden of thought

122
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:38,320
and forget themselves in an emotional orgy.

123
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,700
It won't last, Pete, but the transition is tough.

124
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,400
And Pete says,

125
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:49,960
Huh, yeah, I had to get an IQ of 500 or so, whatever that means,

126
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,640
to appreciate how...

127
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:54,540
mental brains count for after all.

128
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:57,120
Nice thought.

129
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:02,920
Nice thought indeed, friends.

130
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,560
And thus this is called the Church of the Subgenius,

131
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:13,340
for who wants to bear the burden of total awareness?

132
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:19,200
Who, I ask you, wishes to carry that great load

133
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:22,240
of knowing just what the hell is really,

134
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,640
going on for Bob does.

135
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,660
But Bob's luckier than us, friends.

136
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,820
Bob ain't got a brain in his head.

137
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,420
He knows what's going on.

138
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,240
But he don't care.

139
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,120
He don't care.

140
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,560
Oh, yes, you know.

141
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,720
But friends, friends,

142
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,800
the pieces are coming together for a one-world government.

143
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:47,460
Praise Bob.

144
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,620
We now know the dread story

145
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,440
behind the...

146
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:56,100
And the rise of Bill Soft-On-Kitty-Porn Clinton's

147
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,600
clique to the American throne.

148
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:02,240
It was through the diabolical backroom machinations

149
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,860
of Bob Dobbs,

150
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:06,160
author of Suicide,

151
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:07,260
sculptor of Doubt,

152
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:08,260
twister of Chaos.

153
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,400
Thou art but an insignificant insect.

154
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,500
Let me speak to the manager.

155
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,460
Said Bob Dobbs.

156
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,920
I do not know, friends,

157
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:21,220
when the KGB microchip implant

158
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,420
is set to detonate

159
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:25,260
but I must assume

160
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,780
that my time is short.

161
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,160
That the Lord has reserved

162
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,980
a special seat by his side

163
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,580
in his celestial office.

164
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,680
Upon successful resolution of my mission,

165
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,660
I shall be called home to glory.

166
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,580
Bob Dobbs has financial and political connections

167
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,260
with Saddam Hussein, with Gaddafi,

168
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,480
with North Korea, and the PLO, and the Vatican.

169
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,960
He gleefully vomits forth

170
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,600
mockery and blasphemy

171
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,420
against all of us.

172
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,320
He is a man of the American gods.

173
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,280
Reagan has Alzheimer's?

174
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,040
How can they tell?

175
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,060
He quips.

176
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:02,400
Bob wields the power to cloud men's minds,

177
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,220
to seize the eyeballs and flip them inside out.

178
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,700
Mutilation.

179
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:10,860
Informs that man is meat.

180
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:14,640
He appears in an occult puff of smoke

181
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,160
at TV script writers' meetings, saying,

182
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:21,380
Oh, here's some good cuss words for you to use.

183
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,400
Oh, yes, ma'am.

184
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:23,420
Master Bob, they intone,

185
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,440
like all non-Christian media minions,

186
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,540
they have fallen to his total zombie brain plot.

187
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,620
Cuss words for the destruction

188
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,920
of our precious schoolchildren

189
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,160
and the corruption of our national moral fiber.

190
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:38,460
And before Bob leaves,

191
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,420
he distributes boxes of condoms.

192
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,420
Here, pass these out in schoolyards

193
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,300
to our nation's kindergartners.

194
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,840
I can sense it, my friends.

195
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:51,420
I can feel his evil eye moving now

196
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,480
through the ether.

197
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,120
He listens to me through the radio, searching.

198
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:57,160
He knows of my total obedience,

199
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,080
that I have vowed to die gloriously

200
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,100
and drag as many heathen to their dark master

201
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,440
as the Lord shall permit me.

202
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,100
He is probing obscenely.

203
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,640
He is tormenting me now.

204
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,660
He is tormenting me now.

205
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:07,940
Oh!

206
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,940
Save me.

207
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,180
Listener, save me.

208
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:12,840
I...

209
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:17,920
I've discovered blood stains on my bathroom ceiling.

210
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,640
I'm concerned.

211
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,540
I'm concerned lest he kidnap my children.

212
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:28,420
I'm given this sudden fits of shouting

213
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,900
in prayerful, tearful, aching,

214
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,120
abject submissiveness.

215
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,840
This is Reverend Ivan Stang.

216
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:44,060
Thank you.

217
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,680
Not that I can ensure their survival.

218
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:16,280
He has ça.

219
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:16,660


220
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:17,040
Now, now.

221
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,040


222
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:17,640
dead is all,

223
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,920
We still don't want to believe them.

224
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,960
They're still a threat.

225
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,020
We still want to plan for either a bitch, a bitch, or a psycho.

226
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:28,760
Women run their own power, whether it's sexual or whether it's material.

227
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,800
We still don't want to believe them.

228
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,860
They're still a threat.

229
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,940
We still want to plan for either a bitch, a bitch, or a psycho.

230
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:55,740
We still want to plan for either a bitch, a bitch, or a psycho.

231
00:11:56,740 --> 00:12:15,060


232
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:57,280
Thank you.

233
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:27,920
Thank you.

234
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,200
We still want a man who's no bitch, a bitch, or a psycho.

235
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,040
Whether he's a murderer or a murderer,

236
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,940
whether it's sexual or whether it's material,

237
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:02,040
we still don't want a man who's no bitch, a bitch, or a psycho.

238
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:23,100
We still want a man who's no bitch, a bitch, or a psycho.

239
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:15,620
We still want a man who's no bitch, a bitch, or a psycho.

240
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:18,320
Witch, a bitch, or a psycho.

241
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,020
Witch, a bitch, or a psycho.

242
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,740
Witch, a bitch, or a psycho.

243
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,460
Witch, a bitch, or a psycho.

244
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,400
She's a witch.

245
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:31,900
Witch, a bitch, or a psycho.

246
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,660
Witch, a bitch, or a psycho.

247
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,400
Witch, a bitch, or a psycho.

248
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,080
Witch, a bitch, or a psycho.

249
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,780
Witch, a bitch, or a psycho.

250
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:43,520
Witch, a bitch, or a psycho.

251
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:45,540
Witch, a bitch, or a psycho.

252
00:14:53,140 --> 00:15:00,920
A witch, a bitch, or a psycho, dear friends, that's the only kind of chicks I like to hang out with.

253
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:01,820
Pardon my language.

254
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:08,060
That was Women of Sodom, dear friends, from their CD called Boots.

255
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,140
And, boy, they look like a bad bunch of girls.

256
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,900
Real, real bad girls.

257
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:17,740
Let me see if I can find some sort of an address or phone number for information on them.

258
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:21,220
Yeah, here's a phone number for Women of Sodom.

259
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,200
Pussy Kitty Records.

260
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:32,300
Area code 617-437-1292.

261
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:38,660
Women of Sodom, 617-437-1292.

262
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,800
And they are in Boston.

263
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:42,880
Yes, Boston.

264
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,160
The seat of some pretty sick stuff.

265
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:53,540
And we love that pretty, pretty, pretty and sick, sick, sick stuff.

266
00:15:54,060 --> 00:16:00,900
Here's some more from an obscure band called Head and Leg Productions.

267
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,240
Actually, they're also from Boston, it looks like.

268
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:09,980
From a CD that's distributed by Sealand, which most of us know as actually Negative Land.

269
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:12,200
This is one of the bands that...

270
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,440
Negative Land likes.

271
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:19,300
And I think you'll, you'll too like this song called Fat Lady.

272
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:39,860
Hey, Fat Lady, how about a tune?

273
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,940
The time has come.

274
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,920
Everywhere is doom.

275
00:16:44,460 --> 00:16:48,120
Hey, Fat Lady, sing us a song.

276
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,080
Nothing can be done.

277
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,080
Everything is wrong.

278
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:08,720
Hey, Fat Lady, hey, Fat Lady, hey, Fat Lady, hey, Fat Lady, hey, Fat Lady, hey, Fat Lady, hey, Fat Lady, sing!

279
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:32,580
Hey, Fat Lady, I can't wait.

280
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,500
Don't be long, don't be late.

281
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,720
When you sing, everything will cease.

282
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:44,820
No more news, no more peace.

283
00:17:48,760 --> 00:18:01,700
Hey, Fat Lady, hey, Fat Lady, hey, Fat Lady, hey, Fat Lady, hey, Fat Lady, hey, Fat Lady, hey, Fat Lady, sing!

284
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:10,560
Hey, Fat Lady!

285
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:10,700
SING!!!!

316
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:11,200
before me. If therefore thou shalt not prostrate thyself, and kiss my end of all things, and

317
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:16,960
perform the salute, and make witness for my prophets, which are less than wise yet wiser

318
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:22,520
than thee, I shall come upon thee prematurely, and thou shalt receive an divine immaculation,

319
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:29,900
which is like unto heaven and unto hell. And I will draw thee from the skies with a

320
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:39,640
scream of thunder, and will shout, and thou shalt never dine eyes from the glory of my

321
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:49,080
light as it passeth above me. For I will come on thee as a leaf, and thou shalt not

322
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:58,700
know what hour I shall come upon thee, except that thou didst my prophets who are poor,

323
00:22:58,840 --> 00:22:59,880
and I will draw thee from the skies with a scream of thunder, and thou shalt never

324
00:22:59,880 --> 00:22:59,880


325
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:11,860
dine eyes from the glory of my light as it passeth above me. For I will draw thee from

326
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:14,560
the skies with a scream of thunder, and thou shalt never dine eyes from the glory of my

327
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:22,120
light as it passeth above me. For I will draw thee from the skies with a scream of thunder,

328
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:27,960
and deploy one another in the flash of my wrath.

329
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:32,340
And I will cast you to the fire where God's greatest

330
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:38,260
saints and saints of the past have died.

331
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,480
Saints and saints of the past have died.

332
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,740
Saints and saints of the past have died.

333
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:22,100
Saints and saints of the past have died.

334
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,880
Ah, yes, dear friends.

335
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:30,120
The mystery of God's words.

336
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,000
Well, in this case, the words of Jehovah One,

337
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,160
the alien space god from the pre-scriptures

338
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:42,060
spoken by our vast computer here.

339
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:44,080
Mule Skinner, we call it.

340
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,860
And that music in the background is Temple Beat,

341
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,900
which is a CD we got from...

342
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,160
I guess an Italian band, Submission Records.

343
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:59,260
And, well, it's an Italian address,

344
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:02,320
and I don't see a whole lot of point in giving it to you.

345
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:06,920
But, yes, Temple Beat is...

346
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,200
And we'll be digging more into Temple Beat.

347
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:15,760
They're kind of like a throbbing gristle, sort of, or something.

348
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:16,120


349
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:20,780
The god exists in his estate.

350
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,880
More ivory afoot.

351
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,940
A giant foot.

352
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,880
A giant foot.

353
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,280
Yes, I've heard that before, that God is a giant foot.

354
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,140
In fact, an athlete's foot.

355
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,160
The foot of a powerful, muscular being.

356
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:37,160
And this foot, this great foot of Jehovah One,

357
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,740
is said to have an Achilles heel.

358
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:42,940
A little patch wherein he may be wounded.

359
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:51,040
You will kindly have the goodness to admit that you are...

360
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,100
There was an editorial...

361
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,940
An editorial in today's San Francisco Chronicle

362
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,940
complaining about the death of God.

363
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:02,440
Guests Jehovah One, whose huge bloated body floats in space,

364
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:08,060
kept from decay by the eternal processes of cold and stasis.

365
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:09,720
...

366
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,120
...

367
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:17,180
...

368
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:17,200
...

369
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,200


370
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,200


371
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,200


372
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:17,200


373
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:19,400
...

374
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:19,840
So sad.

375
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,140
So fresh.

376
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,580
The days that are no more.

377
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:27,860
You know, they call this the puzzling evidence show and...

378
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,700
One might wonder, why doesn't one ever hear puzzling evidence in this show?

379
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,220
I mean, if it's his show and so forth...

380
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,080
Why?

381
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:37,820
Why not?

382
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,680
I wonder, I wonder.

383
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,120
Yes.

384
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:45,740
And so, let's consider.

385
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,120
Since...

386
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,660
I seem to be the only one here.

387
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,600
The world of millions and millions of years ago.

388
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,060
The warm swamps of the secondary era.

389
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,860
I always return there.

390
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,940
Last night I had a dilly of a dream of being hunted by dinosaurs.

391
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:03,580
You might think that happens to me all the time.

392
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
Well, it's actually very rare.

393
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,620
Well, the earth cooled, the sea covered it.

394
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,220
It was a hundred million years ago that life came to the great sea.

395
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,920
And the fishes bred within it.

396
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,960
They were the oldest people, the fish.

397
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,860
Their children climbed out of it and stood upon the bosky shores.

398
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,980
And they were the amphibia.

399
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,400
The hoppy toads and frogs.

400
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:30,120
Our friends, the newts.

401
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,980
The third people who sprang from them were the reptiles.

402
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:39,600
Think of those old faces of the world upon which the reptiles moved in the slime.

403
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,420
And of the millions of years.

404
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,600
Why, the birds which you see every day are their descendants.

405
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,240
They were their parents.

406
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,340
But can persist to live along with them.

407
00:27:48,780 --> 00:27:52,020
Yes, when they were born there were no birds or people.

408
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:53,760
No birds or men.

409
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,240
No monkeys or reindeer or elephants or any such animals.

410
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,300
Only the amphibia and the reptiles and the fishes and the Mesozoic world.

411
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:05,720
That's history.

412
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,460
Is there going to be like a test on this?

413
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,540
Yes, but it'll be open book.

414
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,680
There is something strange about the will of the sea.

415
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,300
It is bound up with the history of my family.

416
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:23,520
Now, did you ever hear the story of Homo sapiens armatus Georgios Sanctus?

417
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,700
His name was Will.

418
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:28,340
Well, that's the scientific name.

419
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,220
Now, pay attention.

420
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:39,520
Once very long ago, there were two families called Atlantosaurus imanus and Ceratosaurus nasicornis.

421
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,980
Atlantosaurus was 115 feet long.

422
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,940
He had not many brains.

423
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:50,120
Although I did hear that once he had something like an extra brain at the other end of him to take care of his tail.

424
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,120
And he lived by browsing on the trees.

425
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,280
He was timid, ruminant and harmless.

426
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:00,300
Except to the tree frogs which he accidentally munched up among the boughs.

427
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:04,200
He lived very long and thought all the time.

428
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:11,300
So that although he did not think very well, he had generally thought a good deal by the end of his long life.

429
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:13,940
So far as I can remember.

430
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,420
Yes, it took a long time to grow one of those babies.

431
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:23,540
He had solved the problem of being a giant without breaking on account of his own weighty height of 20 feet by having his bones hollow.

432
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,780
The birds do that too, you know, for other reasons.

433
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,420
However, perhaps I am muddling him up with another of the dinosauria.

434
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,280
Ceratosaurus nasicornis was quite small.

435
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:34,860
He was only 17 feet long.

436
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,340
But he had teeth.

437
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:39,400
Great crushing and tearing teeth.

438
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:43,800
Which fitted into each other so badly that he leaped always with his slaughterous mouth.

439
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,060
Half open in a grin of terror.

440
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,480
He leaped like a kangaroo.

441
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:50,920
A death-dealing kangaroo.

442
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:54,200
And he generally leaped upon poor old Atlantosaurus imanus.

443
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,780
Yes, indeed.

444
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,260
He had a horn upon his nose like a rhinoceros.

445
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:02,840
With which he could rip an opening in that big and trundling old body.

446
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:07,520
And his clashing teeth could meet in the flesh as in ripe fruit.

447
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:11,740
And tear it out in mouthfuls by the action of his muscular neck.

448
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:12,960
We'll be right back.

449
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:14,640
We're back.

450
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:17,820
What, my friend, could be more terrible?

451
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,880
What is more terrible, he leaped in packs, if you can imagine that.

452
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,660
If you'd like to make a call, please hang up and try again.

453
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,080
Oh, no, I'm fine where I am.

454
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,000
You're operated.

455
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,280
Ceratosaurus nasicornis was at war with Atlantosaurus imanus.

456
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,880
In that strange war which the spirit of the waters will.

457
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,180
The war of competition and evolution.

458
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,680
Which makes the trees fight upward for the sun on the Amazon.

459
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:44,380
And in the course of which for the boon of life.

460
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:50,720
Many of reptilian cousins have been content to sacrifice the benefits of limbs and teeth and eyesight.

461
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,920
Ceratosaurus was savage and aggressive.

462
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,280
Atlantosaurus timid and old.

463
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:02,880
Their combat lasted for as many centuries as will be needed by homo sapiens also in which to destroy himself.

464
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:07,140
At the end of that time, it was the defender who triumphed.

465
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:10,520
The ferocious kangaroo had dealt death on every side.

466
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:14,360
Had decimated his adversaries and fed upon their carcasses.

467
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,580
But carcasses cannot continue their species.

468
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:22,240
And in the end, the kangaroos had consumed the very flesh on which they lived.

469
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:24,800
Too remorseless for the spirit of the waters.

470
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:28,560
Too bloodthirsty for the hierarchy of progressive victims.

471
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:32,680
The last Ceratosaurus roamed the thick-leaved jungles.

472
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,420
In a vain search for the food which could satisfy his grinning, gnashing jaws.

473
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,760
Then died.

474
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,300
And slept with his fathers.

475
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,460
Yeah.

476
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,400
The last Atlantosaurus thrust her forty-foot neck out of the jungle in which she had been hiding.

477
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,300
And surveyed the emaciated corpse of her starved persecutor.

478
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:59,760
She had preserved her life, as the sensible wood pigeon does, by specializing in escape.

479
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:07,220
She had learned to flee, to hide, to stand still, to control her scent, to conceal herself in waters.

480
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,740
By humility and courage.

481
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,920
She had survived her enemy who had slain her own husband.

482
00:32:12,120 --> 00:32:15,420
And now she carried the children of the latter inside her.

483
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:17,460
The last of the victorious race.

484
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,620
They would be born in a few years.

485
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:22,440
Those things had a long gestation period.

486
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:25,880
Meanwhile, Homo sapiens had come.

487
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,220
He also had suffered from the terror of the kangaroo.

488
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:37,900
In order to protect himself from its rapine and ravishment, he had developed a subclass called H. sapiens armatus.

489
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:41,380
A class which was concealed in metal scales and carried a lance.

490
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:44,640
By means of which it defended itself against the dinosauria.

491
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:51,640
This subclass of so-called knights had perfected an order called H. sapiens armatus georgios sanctus.

492
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:56,160
Which was sufficiently unobservant to classify all the dinosaurs together as its enemies.

493
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:01,180
Atlantosaurus thrust out her neck and fought with triumph of her unborn children.

494
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,000
She had never killed in her life.

495
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:05,660
And these, the future, would perpetuate a vegetarian race.

496
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,700
She heard the clank of Homo sapiens armatus georgios sanctus.

497
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,960
And turned the comely reptile head towards him in her kindly curiosity.

498
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,180
Alright, we have four.

499
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:27,180
He killed her of course.

500
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:32,860
She was a reptile of the reptilian race.

501
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,360
This one is Blue and this is Homo head and his son upstream.

502
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,680
Lee newspapers are talking about their quest for kan impairments.

503
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:44,540
Even though Homo hentai has another name, he remained anonymous of this cult.

504
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:51,440
A� Sh 일본 du N dips worth.

505
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,240
The transformation of Bastos Sonata was carried out by Basco d'Arus and by his father Martin factor akin Bảo.

506
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,620
Now the classic film was filmed in 20th century Europe on 1 November.

507
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:10,020
because puzzling evidence is always there and playing the tapes.

508
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:16,080
The tapes, yes, and the dinosaurs, oh, what?

509
00:34:16,700 --> 00:34:21,300
Well, you know, I'm sorry if you're not interested in biological speculation,

510
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,240
but to me, you know, like Einstein,

511
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:29,380
my religion is not so much the pursuit of the unknowable,

512
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:32,660
because there are some things man was not meant to know,

513
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:35,660
but rather the pursuit of the knowable.

514
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,100
There is so much left to know, and, my friend, there is also,

515
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:44,640
let us never forget, so much left to destroy.

516
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,880
Ah, yes, so much to destroy, so little time for our church,

517
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,340
for this human race, which, like the Atlantosaurus,

518
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:59,140
shall eventually sink beneath the waves,

519
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:02,480
crushed by its own weight, hollowed,

520
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:03,620
bones or not.

521
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,660
And how are we to destroy the world

522
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:12,040
when we must spend all of our time seemingly trying to repair

523
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:16,900
our broken equipment and our mangled software

524
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:21,980
and our mysterious ailments?

525
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:28,340
The stubborn beast flesh keeps creeping back,

526
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,280
inevitably, inevitably.

527
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,640
They go back to the...

528
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:32,640


529
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,040
The beast.

530
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,780
All of them, all of us?

531
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,940
Yes, I can even feel the relentless tug upon my own soul.

532
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:44,900
The tug backwards, back to the mud,

533
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:47,920
to the wallowing in the filth and the...

534
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,180
Well, actually, that doesn't sound like a bad idea.

535
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,660
Um...

536
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,400
Heck, let's go to the swamp, dear friends.

537
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,240
Now that the stage has been duly set by the

538
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:07,100
good Doctor Howlowe, now that his hand that makes

539
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,880
has prepared our brains of pain,

540
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:16,240
we shall go back, back into the swamp.

541
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,220
Slush.

542
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,380
Funny thing about slush is that it never goes away.

543
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,620
It seeps right down into your moccasins or cowboy boots

544
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,060
until they're stained a dirty gray.

545
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,980
Playroom was slushy that January night.

546
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:32,720
As usual.

547
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:34,420
Sleety and slushy.

548
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:37,640
The sleet had poured in off Lakey Ridiculous that night

549
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,860
like some monstrous anti-Santa Ana wind,

550
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,560
and the slurdy slurry was everywhere.

551
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,580
It's the kind of night when cars stalled

552
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,520
and RTA buses drove right by you.

553
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,700
The kind of night most guys spend at home

554
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,020
with the warmth of some old scotch and a young chick.

555
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,320
Or a fuzzy sock.

556
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:55,320
That is, unless they were looking for a private dick.

557
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,500
Hello, you're on the air with Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

558
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,600
Oh, I'm the counter-dog.

559
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,840
I'm gonna eat that screwing milk.

560
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,140
I'm gonna eat that screwing milk.

561
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:03,560
I'm gonna eat that screwing milk.

562
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:04,680
You are underbred trash.

563
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:06,060
I'm telling you right now.

564
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,280
And you need a stimulant.

565
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:08,800
And I just shot right into your buttocks.

566
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,060
Time to be letting her in a small room.

567
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,060
You know what they said about the Barnstormers?

568
00:37:12,460 --> 00:37:14,980
They said when the Barnstormers came to the town,

569
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,700
they come to the saloon and sit down.

570
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,220
They'd open up their hands and begin to pray

571
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,560
because the Lord had saved them.

572
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,320
For one look.

573
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,020
The Barnstormers said...

574
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:23,900
Barnstormers.

575
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,220
Don.

576
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:25,820
God.

577
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,000
Don.

578
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:27,880
God.

579
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:29,120
Don God.

580
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:30,140
Don God.

581
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:30,840
Did it.

582
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,740
Get it.

583
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:31,820
Get it.

584
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:31,820


585
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:31,820


586
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:31,820


587
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:31,820


588
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:31,820


589
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:32,280
Been there.

590
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,280
Done god did it.

591
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:33,720
Been there.

592
00:37:33,840 --> 00:37:34,660
Been done god.

593
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,640
That did god thing.

594
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,520
Done god didit.

595
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,660
Done god didit cette.

596
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:40,560
C'est Eyes.

597
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,840
Hey.

598
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:17,160
As now, as before, they glide in their silver panties across the universe.

599
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:21,760
The children of the giant brain.

600
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:27,140
Oh, don't get nearby when there is sexual, sex, sex, sexual juice.

601
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:33,260
They're the people of the giant brain and they've got their own plans.

602
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,620
Hey, check that big brain, baby.

603
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,380
Got mine expanded last week.

604
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,860
Oh, man, I got a spandex hat for that kind of thing.

605
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:52,660
It goes on and on and on.

606
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:57,660
Oh, yeah.

607
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,560
Oh, yeah.

608
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,820
You get iodine.

609
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,000
One, three, one.

610
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:27,780
131

611
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,680
131

612
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:29,680
cesium

613
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,820
159

614
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,600
it's got my thyroid

615
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,180
on the run

616
00:39:33,180 --> 00:39:33,720
on the run

617
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:34,600
on the run

618
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,280
it goes like this

619
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,340
I died

620
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:56,840
131

621
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,360
has got my thyroid

622
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,220
on the run

623
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,360
and the cesium

624
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:01,700
185

625
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,660
is making it real

626
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:03,240
real hard

627
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,140
just to stay alive

628
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:16,540
well I said Chernobyl

629
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:17,700
was so long ago

630
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,600
nothing to worry about

631
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,080
and now I hear in the news

632
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:22,960
these dumb guys

633
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,200
in the Department of Energy

634
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,200
and the Defense Department

635
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:25,940
are going to start

636
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:26,720
building

637
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,840
a bunch of Chernobyl's

638
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,080
across the United States

639
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,900
and then I hear in the news

640
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:31,480
that Chernobyl

641
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,480
is not really over

642
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:32,720
no

643
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:33,980
all these people

644
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:34,720
are dying

645
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:36,380
it's all the pollution

646
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,500
is getting into the water

647
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,160
it's getting into

648
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:38,940
the aquifers

649
00:40:38,940 --> 00:40:40,740
and everything

650
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,840
below the surface

651
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:42,620
is all one thing

652
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,280
so if I can see

653
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:43,820
the distance

654
00:40:43,820 --> 00:40:44,620
between Kiev

655
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:45,000
and Kiev

656
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,740
I know that

657
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,720
we're getting in tune

658
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,120
you like hearing

659
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:50,240
you know

660
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,320
and then I started thinking

661
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,080
how come my mood

662
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:53,920
is getting so

663
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:55,680
dirty

664
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:55,680


665
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:55,680


666
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,380
it's the iodine

667
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:01,060
or 131

668
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,060
has gotten my thyroid

669
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,240
on the run

670
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,320
and the krypton

671
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,880
or 85

672
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,900
is making it hard

673
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,140
just to stay alive

674
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,860
but the iodine

675
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,420
or 131

676
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:15,080
the iodine

677
00:41:15,080 --> 00:41:16,640
or 121

678
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,280
you know no run

679
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,620
through the metal veins

680
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,940
you know more

681
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,560
of everything

682
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:22,440
than words

683
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,300
power powers

684
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:25,260
and the power

685
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:25,660
is in your hands

686
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,380
Shake the bony head and shake it through

687
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:38,200
Barbarian, a 248

688
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:41,320
This baby's sterile, I can't procreate

689
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,400
Amphetonium, a 207

690
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:47,580
So long folks, I'll see you in heaven

691
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:50,640
But the iodine, a 131

692
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,740
The iodine, a 131

693
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:56,760
No more running through the metal lanes

694
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,440
No harm ever in the mud

695
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:02,960
Shake the bony hand of the poison man

696
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,560
Shake the bony head and shake it through

697
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,480
So there's over 2 million known pollutants

698
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,900
That can cause cancer, pancreatitis

699
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:21,540
Fadulis, gingivitis

700
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,780
Bad breath

701
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:23,720
Acid

702
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:30,860
And the iodine, a 131

703
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:34,040
Has got my thyroid on the run

704
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,860
And the krypton, a 85

705
00:42:36,860 --> 00:42:40,000
He's making it hard just to stay alive

706
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:43,300
But the iodine, a 131

707
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,400
The iodine, a 131

708
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:49,380
No more running through the metal lanes

709
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:52,080
No harm ever in the mud

710
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,720
Shake the bony head and shake it through

711
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:53,720


712
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:53,720


713
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,200
Shake the bony head and shake it through

714
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:01,820
No more running through the metal lanes

715
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:04,460
No harm ever in the mud

716
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,420
Shake the bony head and shake it through

717
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,800
Shake the bony hand and shake it through

718
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,980
Shake it, shake it

719
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:17,660
Shake it

720
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:19,080
If I'm in the hurt

721
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,340
If it's in my head

722
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:22,680
I'm pumpkin to your hurt

723
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,620
If I'm fine, or if it's me to hurt

724
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,180
Yes, yes, yes.

725
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,620
I just heard that for the first time just now myself, friends.

726
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:41,020
That was a classic piece of ESO radio.

727
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,040
Einstein Secret Orchestra there.

728
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:51,560
The good Chaz Smith and the bad, bad, bad, lonesome cowboy Dave.

729
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,500
And here's an address.

730
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:53,920
This is a new address.

731
00:43:54,100 --> 00:44:01,860
Einstein Secret Radio, ESO Radio Orchestra still offers tapes, but they've moved.

732
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:03,600
They used to have a P.O. box.

733
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:07,860
And I want to give you a new address for ESO radio.

734
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,380
Got that pencil ready.

735
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:12,600
3226.

736
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:20,480
That's 3226 West 99th Street.

737
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:22,480
West 99th.

738
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:24,000
99th Street.

739
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:27,260
Cleveland, Ohio.

740
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:29,760
44102.

741
00:44:29,820 --> 00:44:33,480
That's 3226 West 99th Street, Cleveland, Ohio.

742
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:37,500
44102.

743
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,760
Don't you hate it when people leave a phone number on your answering machine?

744
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,300
They go, this is Reverend Ivan Stang.

745
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:49,340
And I wanted to have you.

746
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:52,240
I've got a very, very serious.

747
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,960
Serious problem.

748
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,200
And it's very important that we talk immediately.

749
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,460
My number is...

750
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:04,260
Thank you.

751
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,060
Thank you.

752
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:07,400
Oh, friends.

753
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,560
I've got to admit something to you right now off the top of my head.

754
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:17,380
I'm having trouble remembering what I've done or said on this show.

755
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:18,800
What tapes I've played.

756
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:20,200
There's been...

757
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,120
This is number 543.

758
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:25,560
We don't do it on a weekly basis anymore.

759
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,360
We do it catch as catch can.

760
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,340
And it's hard.

761
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,680
My hard drive is fragmented.

762
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:34,820
There's not much...

763
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:37,160
Well, there's really no ROM at all left.

764
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,860
And the RAM is taken up by useless programs.

765
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:46,300
And half the files have corrupted creation dates and modification dates.

766
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:50,580
It's a serious problem, you know, for some of us.

767
00:45:50,620 --> 00:45:52,440
I mean, I'm not asking for...

768
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,760
Pity or mercy or anything.

769
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:54,100
But...

770
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:54,780
But...

771
00:45:54,780 --> 00:45:55,320
But...

772
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:55,920
But...

773
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,680
But...

774
00:45:56,680 --> 00:45:57,020
But...

775
00:45:58,000 --> 00:45:58,660
But...

776
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:58,800
But...

777
00:45:59,620 --> 00:45:59,780
No.

778
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:03,120
Everything's but this and but that.

779
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:07,760
Now, you secular elitists make me vomit with your butt butts.

780
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:13,020
Now, back where I come from, a butt butt was known as back talk, buddy.

781
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:19,600
In the heartland of God's country, butt butts are known as disobedience.

782
00:46:21,340 --> 00:46:22,060
Pull this.

783
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,040
Volume down.

784
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,780
It gets me kind of ticked off.

785
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:25,740
Don't you see?

786
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:29,880
A preacher can get to where he's had enough.

787
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:31,000
Where's my background music?

788
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,540
Damn it.

789
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,360
I don't know.

790
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:44,860
Man, when I was a kid, if I was dumb enough to give Papa any back talk,

791
00:46:44,940 --> 00:46:47,620
he'd up and whoop me upside the head with that whiskey bottle of his.

792
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,540
But he did it out of love, friends.

793
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,480
Because he wanted me brought up right.

794
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:51,480


795
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:52,340
Pure.

796
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,700
In the sight of Bob Dobbs.

797
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:58,260
But Bob cannot endure back talk, for he is a jealous God.

798
00:46:58,580 --> 00:47:01,240
And the penalty for disobedience is death.

799
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,080
Uh, Prescriptures 118.

800
00:47:03,080 --> 00:47:06,420
Yes, Pappy wanted sanity and life for me,

801
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:10,500
so I endured the lessons of his whiskey bottle of infinite mercy.

802
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:15,760
And later, when Bob spoke to me and commanded me to spread throughout the world

803
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:21,460
this message of mercy and wisdom that the heathen might too know the mind of Bob.

804
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:21,840
The Bob?

805
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:24,880
The, the, the, that he yearns to kill them.

806
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:26,700
That Bob's eyes are inflamed.

807
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:28,880
His blood is a surge.

808
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,140
Red in tooth and claw.

809
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,620
A mighty seizure in his brain.

810
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,380
His wonderful, empty, empty brain.

811
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:40,880
And yet, and yet, Bob stayeth his hand in mercy.

812
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:42,540
It is all too much.

813
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:49,440
It giveth him migraines and ulcers and lung achage.

814
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:50,980
And his suffering.

815
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,500
His suffering enrages me.

816
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,260
And I should kill you now.

817
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:56,040
I should kill you now.

818
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:59,760
To obliterate your smart mouth back talk and your doubt.

819
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:06,220
And convince you of Bob's total mercy and ultimate purpos.

820
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:13,820
I shall quote from a young subgenius who just learned that her mother had almost had her aborted.

821
00:48:13,820 --> 00:48:20,960
Just as Bob was almost aborted, uh, by his, by Jane Dobbs, bless her.

822
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:20,960


823
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,660
Sweet name.

824
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,860
Took a tornado to yank him out.

825
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:31,000
At the age of three days gestation.

826
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,340
He was just a cluster of cells.

827
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:33,640
But he lived anyway, friends.

828
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:38,220
Yes, Bob was an abortion mutilation victim.

829
00:48:38,420 --> 00:48:39,480
And yet he lived on.

830
00:48:40,900 --> 00:48:44,080
Now if that abortion had been successful, would we have slack now?

831
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:44,360
Nay.

832
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:49,040
And that's why we are against abortion in this church.

833
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:50,960
We're against abortion of subgenius.

834
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:52,080
Fee-tie.

835
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,160
Uh, normal.

836
00:48:54,240 --> 00:49:01,560
Hell, uh, you know, as far as we're concerned, you can abort a damn pink boy up to the age of fifty-five.

837
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,400
Sixty-five.

838
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:03,080
Something like that.

839
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:05,180
I forget exactly what it says in pre-scriptures.

840
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:14,720
But you know, friends, this young subgenius, uh, had almost been aborted like Bob.

841
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:20,040
And, uh, and you know, friends, I advise you to have tissues nearby.

842
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:24,320
Because when I, I mean, use some Kleenexes to rub your eyes.

843
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:31,240
Because this spiritual witness is going to wring tears from even the hardest, nihilist, elitist heart.

844
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:40,560
And you're going to rush right out and enlist in the glorious street war of the church of the subgenius to rescue those helpless, innocent, tiny babies.

845
00:49:40,640 --> 00:49:42,040
The unborn subgeniuses.

846
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:47,980
And you shall embrace these poor, precious, tender babes.

847
00:49:47,980 --> 00:49:51,080
And tear them from the liberal butchers.

848
00:49:53,260 --> 00:49:58,580
So you, radio listener, you listening by radio now, grip the hand of your neighbor for strength.

849
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:01,140
If you don't have, if you're sitting alone listening to this.

850
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,180
If you're housebound.

851
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,320
If you're alone, then grip yourself.

852
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,380
And you know what I mean when I say that.

853
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:11,340
Grip yourself where you'll feel the strength.

854
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:15,640
As you hear this wrenching testimony.

855
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:16,780
Uh.

856
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:22,460
This subgenius young girl came to me and said, Reverend Stang, if I had been aborted.

857
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:26,760
I wouldn't even like be here, you know.

858
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,760
I wouldn't be talking right now.

859
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:32,420
I couldn't even like hear you.

860
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,600
And you couldn't hear me.

861
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,040
Because I wouldn't even be here.

862
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:35,840
I wouldn't be here.

863
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:38,040
I wouldn't be here.

864
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,960
I wouldn't be here.

865
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,100
I wouldn't be here.

866
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:45,240
I wouldn't be here.

867
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:48,160
Ex-Len.

868
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:48,420
I wouldn't be here.

869
00:50:48,640 --> 00:50:49,080
I wouldn't be here.

870
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:49,080


871
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:49,080


872
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:49,820
Oh, friends.

873
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,120
But you can be here.

874
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:52,720
You can be here now.

875
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:54,020
Or you can be there later.

876
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:54,860
You can be with Bob.

877
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:55,460
He don't care.

878
00:50:56,400 --> 00:50:59,380
As long as he's got your hate.

879
00:50:59,540 --> 00:51:00,740
Your hate offering.

880
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:07,400
And friends, you can find out just what the minimum hate offering is if you just write

881
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,980
for free information, friends.

882
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:11,180
Just, that's all we're asking you to do.

883
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:13,100
Write for free information.

884
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,760
And I'm going to give you that number to write to, Reverend Stang.

885
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:16,760


886
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:16,760


887
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,360
that number of Bob Dobbs, that man that loves you so,

888
00:51:19,480 --> 00:51:21,540
that man that hates you and loves you.

889
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:26,400
You can't imagine the range of emotion that Bob feels

890
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,300
because he has no range of thought, none at all.

891
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:32,280
It's pure emotion. It's pure love and pure hate.

892
00:51:32,480 --> 00:51:34,200
And you can write to Bob, friends.

893
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,820
Write for that free information booklet from Bob.

894
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,200
Just write Bob on that envelope at postofficebox.

895
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,280
And you can save trouble. Just write P.O. Box.

896
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:49,120
Box 140306.

897
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,460
That's right, friends.

898
00:51:52,740 --> 00:51:56,040
Box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

899
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,680
That's right, Dallas, Texas.

900
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:59,240
You can tell by the way I'm talking.

901
00:51:59,300 --> 00:52:00,860
I'm talking God's language, friends.

902
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:03,940
It's God's city, Dallas, Texas.

903
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:07,700
At 75214.

904
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,440
Oh, God, it feels so good to say that zip code.

905
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:13,720
7521.

906
00:52:14,280 --> 00:52:18,440
My God, my Dobbs, my needy.

907
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:22,260
For, you know, I ain't gonna lie to you.

908
00:52:22,340 --> 00:52:25,720
For every Bob particle that's flung your way

909
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:31,080
by that multi-billion dollar particle accelerator weapon up in the sky

910
00:52:31,080 --> 00:52:36,900
that the conspiracy brain-wrought Frankenstein slavery control eyeball is sending at you.

911
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:43,100
For every Bob particle, there's gonna be a particle of the other.

912
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:44,780
Yeah.

913
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:49,880
But, you know, that's where half the fun comes in, if you know what I mean.

914
00:52:50,180 --> 00:52:53,000
Like they say, you know, you can't really go to heaven

915
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:57,940
unless you first puke into the porcelain-rimmed bowl of hell.

916
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:03,440
And lest I go to hell, I will reveal that

917
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:08,980
actually quite a bit of the ranting that I was doing tonight

918
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:13,720
was mutilated off the top of my head off of a piece of paper

919
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:14,260
I was writing.

920
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:17,780
That was sent out by the Anti-Sex League

921
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:20,800
or Mini-True 2.

922
00:53:21,360 --> 00:53:23,740
And I really don't even know who they are,

923
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:28,340
but we do get some interesting rants in the mail from folks,

924
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:29,380
and that was one of them.

925
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:33,800
Lord, Lord, Lord love a duck

926
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,340
and Lord love Bob Dobbs

927
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:37,640
and Lord love you

928
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,900
and Lord love me, my friend.

929
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,340
It's Lord, especially Lord.

930
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,260
I want you to love me.

931
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:44,460
I want you to love me.

932
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,860
Because I'm a selfish bastard, that's why.

933
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,300
Because I'm a subgenius.

934
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,960
Yes, I'm a subgenius, and a subgenius is a selfish bastard.

935
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:57,700
Because you've got to have slack first, my friend,

936
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,960
before you can get slack for somebody else.

937
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:04,020
Once you've got slack, well then, it's self-reproducing.

938
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:10,360
You know, it just, it will continue to, to, to, to fester in you

939
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,460
like a, like the pus from a store.

940
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,460
Your slack.

941
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:14,980
Runneth over.

942
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,280
Once you get you some.

943
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:18,440
You know, once you get you some of it,

944
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,820
then, hey, what can I say?

945
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,060
You got it.

946
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:23,400
I found it.

947
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:26,040
Bob sold it.

948
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:26,860
I smoked it.

949
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:27,800
That settles it.

950
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,440
Praise Bob.

951
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:32,400
And, uh, were we in a fancy radio studio?

952
00:54:32,540 --> 00:54:34,900
I could probably do a much better transition than that,

953
00:54:34,940 --> 00:54:37,560
but let's hear briefly what, uh,

954
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:40,320
oracular message we may glean

955
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:43,520
from, uh, the legal documents guy.

956
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:43,980
Thank you.

957
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:44,500
I'll explain.

958
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,140
On takes.

959
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,060
I have more legal notices in the newspaper

960
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:52,740
about my rights for mid-spirits and oxygen.

961
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,400
So I'm all the way back to the 60s

962
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,420
with a metal case cop from the 60s to the 80s

963
00:54:58,420 --> 00:54:59,480
and some pigeon police

964
00:54:59,480 --> 00:55:02,260
and new miserable experience

965
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:07,260
and twisted sister, uh, twisted sister,

966
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:09,280
no message, miserable silver.

967
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:14,020
And it goes with, uh, zero and a slack.

968
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:15,780
And I'm registered zero.

969
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,480
I'm allowed outside the estimate of the average person.

970
00:55:18,560 --> 00:55:21,760
And my silver, I'm entitled to a picture of Earth or more

971
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:25,440
with my silver or my seven, scientific seven or silver.

972
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,080
Then, then I've got a story in the paper.

973
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,480
Keep this metal case's hands out of my face.

974
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:36,240
I'm missing my girlfriend and or my brother's right for rest

975
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:40,460
at a tight percentage of two.

976
00:55:40,580 --> 00:55:42,680
My girlfriends knocked me out.

977
00:55:42,940 --> 00:55:44,120
My girlfriend knocked.

978
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:47,220
Me out or my nurses go ahead and search me to go.

979
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,240
I've got my, I'm the guy with the legal notice in the paper.

980
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,560
And so I've got the arrest warrant for the metal case

981
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:56,600
with my desk for the radio station

982
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:59,680
and the metal case I was scheduled for extravaganza

983
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,860
and fruitopia from the miserable experience

984
00:56:01,860 --> 00:56:05,440
and a punk from the band, the miserable experience.

985
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,300
Now I've got a story about keep this guy's hand out of my face.

986
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:10,500
I got a guy.

987
00:56:10,520 --> 00:56:13,420
I was entitled to beta increasements in my oxygen

988
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:14,240
or my silver.

989
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,380
After I got used to my limit in the sixties.

990
00:56:16,860 --> 00:56:19,700
And I have a group of one for my girlfriend,

991
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:21,620
one for my nurse, one for my brother,

992
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:24,700
a beta increasement, zero percentage.

993
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:25,800
And there's a story.

994
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:29,120
I got a broken jaw underneath from a restaurant manager,

995
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:32,020
a couple of cops that used a doctor's emergency,

996
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:34,780
knock a guy out and hit him in the chin the same time.

997
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,560
And I have a picture of hit me in the chin over and over again,

998
00:56:37,600 --> 00:56:40,440
hit me with a zero percentage beta increasement.

999
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,940
Um, then I have a couple, I was on a journeyman's.

1000
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:44,160
Walk.

1001
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,540
These guys are dangerous and allowed to knock these guys out.

1002
00:56:47,600 --> 00:56:48,660
When I come into a place,

1003
00:56:48,720 --> 00:56:48,880
right?

1004
00:56:50,740 --> 00:56:53,360
The sir, the man with the legal notice in the newspaper,

1005
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:54,480
I've got a couple more.

1006
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,860
So I've got move away from the coffee pot.

1007
00:56:56,980 --> 00:56:58,740
So under the price of silver continuously,

1008
00:56:59,340 --> 00:57:01,020
I have the metal case cap.

1009
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,680
We call him Saturday night live.

1010
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:05,740
Um, and he keeps getting caught at the,

1011
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:06,540
but he's entitled.

1012
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,280
He's so old.

1013
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:09,060
He's entitled to the price of silver.

1014
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,220
I know how old he is,

1015
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:13,220
but serve at new miserable experiences and move away Saturday.

1016
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:13,820
And I'm long.

1017
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:14,660
Line of cops.

1018
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:17,340
It won't stop all the way to the judge's nephew of Euclid.

1019
00:57:18,740 --> 00:57:20,220
Then I got a story.

1020
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,780
I got problems with my with cops in Euclid.

1021
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:24,920
I'm entitled to my city overlap,

1023
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:31,400
And I got cops all the way to shard and with my city

1024
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,320
overlaps,

1025
00:57:32,320 --> 00:57:34,040
uh, my addresses,

1026
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:36,200
uh, in the newspaper,

1027
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,140
I got trouble with the cops over here in Euclid.

1028
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,380
They won't back off.

1029
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,560
I got Polenski award 11.

1030
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:42,560
I'm moving in Europe,

1031
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,300
full time,

1032
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:43,520
Hamburg,

1033
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:45,000
national re Maxwell house.

1034
00:57:45,080 --> 00:57:46,120
Price of silver idiot.

1035
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:48,360
Uh, uh,

1036
00:57:48,380 --> 00:57:50,200
random house prices.

1037
00:57:50,300 --> 00:57:56,080
So sunbathing in the backyard don't mean that we're chicks and it doesn't matter even if they are weird chicks.

1038
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:56,560
And I said,

1039
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,520
but they're burnouts.

1040
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:58,200
And she said,

1041
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:00,140
it doesn't matter if they're burnouts.

1042
00:58:03,620 --> 00:58:09,880
Here's an imitation of me picking somebody up off the ground against her wishes.

1043
00:58:11,420 --> 00:58:11,860
Oh,

1044
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:14,420
someone in

1045
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,280
and no,

1046
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:19,180
the little in the someone in.

1047
00:58:20,020 --> 00:58:20,200
Actually,

1048
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:23,320
that's a tribute to be picking somebody up off the ground.

1049
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:25,480
Someone in

1050
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:39,320
and not the little in the someone in and not delete the needs someone in and not delete the needs someone in.

1051
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:42,180
I'm singing someone in the Delaney's.

1052
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:42,860
There was this girl.

1053
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:45,980
Whose last name was Delaney that,

1054
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,420
um,

1055
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:52,740
I grew up with her brother from first grade to about sixth grade.

1056
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:53,880
And,

1057
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:54,100
uh,

1058
00:58:55,100 --> 00:59:03,520
I always had this thing where I wanted to just pick his youngest sister up off the ground against her wishes just to make her miserable.

1059
00:59:04,860 --> 00:59:05,460
Yes,

1060
00:59:06,700 --> 00:59:07,400
it is Joe,

1061
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:10,200
the voice of Joe and before Joe,

1062
00:59:11,240 --> 00:59:12,560
the legal notice guy,

1063
00:59:12,560 --> 00:59:14,340
or legal documents guy,

1064
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:23,680
depending on how you put that friends and you can call toll free to order to order free information.

1065
00:59:24,020 --> 00:59:29,760
1-888-669-2323.

1066
00:59:32,380 --> 00:59:34,580
888-669-2323.

1067
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:42,220
The quiet before the storm or after the storm quiet in between.

1068
00:59:42,280 --> 00:59:42,540
The quiet before the storm or after the storm quiet in between.

1069
00:59:42,540 --> 00:59:43,300
The storms,

1070
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:48,180
even that quiet must eventually go silent.
