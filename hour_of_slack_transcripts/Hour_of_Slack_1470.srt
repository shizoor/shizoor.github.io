1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,920
Neighbor, how long has it been since you've had a great big heaping steaming pipe bowl full of unreconstituted slack?

2
00:00:12,680 --> 00:00:13,960
I thought so.

3
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:18,980
Better pull out your bob glands, folks, and start tuning in.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:22,760
There's great days a-coming for the church and those who believe.

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:27,820
Yes, the train to Dobstown will soon be pulling in your station.

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:29,440
Don't be left behind.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,020
Don't be afraid.

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,600
Come to Bob.

9
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:34,140
He will give you slack.

10
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,720
Bob, get Carrington up here.

11
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:38,460
Doctor!

12
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,760
We're almost 50 miles out, Doctor.

13
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,680
With your compass deviation, how are you navigating, Captain?

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,200
That peak ahead is practically our slack.

15
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:54,520
And the only reason you don't understand our music is that you don't like it.

16
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,540
You are not a human, you have a human face.

17
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:04,540


18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,520
You are a human of God.

19
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:08,520


20
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:08,520


21
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:08,940
You are not human.

22
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,660
You are a human of God.

23
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:14,140
Ladies and gentlemen, high look, all three down this way.

24
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,880
I'm going to bring out the world's most tattooed man.

25
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,160
I'm going to bring out the giants, the midgets.

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,820
I'm going to bring out JoJo, the dog-faced boy.

27
00:01:25,060 --> 00:01:28,320
He neither walks nor talks but creeps and crawls.

28
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:29,920
We capture...

29
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:37,580
this boy over in the heart of Madagascar. Wild, ferocious, beast-like human. We keep him in a

30
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:44,640
cage in here. He eats raw meat. You're going to meet these people out here all free. Now, please,

31
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,020
ladies and gentlemen, move in a little nearer. I'm going to bring out one of the girls,

32
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:58,160
one of the dancing girls. We brought her over from Hawaii. Do you know where Hawaii is? Way

33
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:04,740
out in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, where those heathens dance with those grass skirts,

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,420
and those skirts sway in the breeze like the palm trees on that island out in the middle of the

35
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:19,220
ocean. Well, if you don't move in, you can't see that diamond she's got mounted in her big toenail.

36
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:26,180
You want to see it? Well, move in a little nearer. Look right there. Keep your shoe on now, Gloria,

37
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:27,280
for just a minute.

38
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:32,840
I'll have her take the shoe off and show you the diamond in her toenail. But first, I want to tell

39
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:40,360
you, do you see this big line of paintings all the way down here to my right? This line of

40
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:48,020
paintings all the way down to my left. Everything you see pictured and painted out here, you're

41
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:56,720
going to see inside. One ticket takes you all the way through. The price of admission, 25 cents for

42
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,800
you grown folks.

43
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:04,420
Ten cents for the children. And if you got little bitty ones, pick them up in your arms, carry them on in.

44
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:11,800
Tote them in as guests to the house. There goes the music. They are dancing in there now. Do you hear that?

45
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:16,420
They are dancing right now. That's the way we did that one.

46
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:36,780
Now, I'm gonna end this with a uh I have to end it with this because I'll probably be out of breath,

47
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:42,560
and maybe even dead by the time I finish. You know those that Westboro Baptist church,

48
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:48,660
those crazy Christians that hate everybody? God hates fads. God hates America. God hates

49
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:55,640
servicemen, you know. Those protester people. Well, we've got there's fundamentalist subgeniuses,

50
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:58,140
and there's we hate them as much as we hate the non- propositions, right

51
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,140


52
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:58,140


53
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,960
much as the other Christians probably hate

54
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,940
those Westboro Baptist Church but the

55
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,000
brother Freddie of the

56
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,800
Restoros Baptist Church

57
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,720
though he may be insane

58
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,160
can write a hell of a rant

59
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:11,240
as follows.

60
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,940
Unto the tongue of the

61
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,120
faithful comes

62
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,160
the word of God.

63
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,960
Those with eyes to

64
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,040
see best close

65
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:22,900
their eyes.

66
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,780
The pipe is

67
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,640
the green.

68
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,840
The pipe

69
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,440
is

70
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:32,320
the green.

71
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,880
His mighty

72
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,180
teeth shall split

73
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,900
and shatter the

74
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,220
uncovered. His burning

75
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,640
gaze will purify

76
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,900
the sullied

77
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,900
in fire.

78
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:48,820
Oh Bob

79
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,920
let not thy wrath fall

80
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,480
upon thy faithless.

81
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,440
We paid, we paid,

82
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,580
we paid.

83
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,860
And we will pay again

84
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:01,060
to know what we think.

85
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,260
My mind

86
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,620
is open Bob.

87
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:07,020
I have pulled your wool

88
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:09,040
like George Takai

89
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,840
over mine own

90
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,140
eyes. Fill

91
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,200
me with your slack. Send me

92
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,180
to my saucer that I might

93
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,160
dwell between the

94
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,480
thighs of my personal

95
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,800
sex goddesses.

96
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:24,980
You may substitute

97
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,400
gods if you fancy.

98
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,360
Crush me into a fine

99
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,160
powder and cut me into

100
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,300
the ounce for thy third

101
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,180
nostril to snort

102
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:37,340
into eternity where I will

103
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,400
dwell within thee

104
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,820
till the pinks shall

105
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,300
go no more a-pinkin'

106
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,080
till the slack

107
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,240
dries up and the

108
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,940
shit goes down

109
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:51,420
and we leave the huddled

110
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:53,400
pinks far below

111
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,380
on the burning ground.

112
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,800
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

113
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,700
Praise Bob! Praise Starwood!

114
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,200
Praise Wisteria! And praise

115
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,760
all the subgeniuses and

116
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:07,080
weirdos and everybody else.

117
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,340
What the hell? Except for

118
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,060
that one asshole.

119
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,260
See you in the tea room.

120
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,580
I mean the sales table.

121
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,100
We presented two-headed

122
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,880
babies. Babies that were

123
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,360
born to live.

124
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,360


125
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:25,360


126
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,200
We didn't say they were

127
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,340
alive. We said that they

128
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:31,440
were born to live. For how

129
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:32,920
long we didn't tell them.

130
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:35,480
These babies were really

131
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,300
made of rubber.

132
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,800
And the exhibit was

133
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,660
placed so that the nurse

134
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,800
in her uniform was visible.

135
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,200
A cradle was visible.

136
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,160
The nurse would rock it.

137
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,860
And you could hear playing

138
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,320
on a record the crying

139
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,100
and wailing of this pitiful

140
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,340
baby with two heads. And the

141
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:55,900
baby would cry.

142
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,180
This is called Chameleon.

143
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,660
It's about a guy that likes

144
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,380
a girl and so he wants to

145
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,520
become everything that she

146
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,080
would like. So he has to

147
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,140
learn exactly what she

148
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,160
would like. It's called

149
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,760
Chameleon. Most people know

150
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,880
it as the Google you song.

151
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,540
Alright.

152
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,700
You blew into the room.

153
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,060
You filled up my eyes.

154
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,560
They grew to double their size.

155
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,320
Jaw dropped, I was

156
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,320


157
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,320


158
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,320


159
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,320


160
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:25,320


161
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,340
popping. Such a confident girl

162
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,760
like no other I've seen.

163
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,260
Your stride is flirty and mean.

164
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,640
Hip-hoppin'. You're so good

165
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,200
looking. I gotta make you mine.

166
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,080
My breath you took it. My soul

167
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,820
you set afire. I gotta know

168
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:46,080
just what you're into. Best

169
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,480
that you like most and where

170
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,300
you've been to. One thing I can

171
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:53,340
do. I'm gonna Google you. I'm

172
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,300
gonna Google you. I'm gonna Google you.

173
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,960
Time to pay your tab. You

174
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,460
breeze up to the bar. I see the

175
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,000
name on your card. Photographic.

176
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,520
I type it in, un-hit go to see

177
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:05,740
where your name is found. Looks

178
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,960
like there's one in this town.

179
00:08:07,100 --> 00:08:10,440
Fantastic. I got your number.

180
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:15,260
I know where you buy shoes. I

181
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:18,600
bet you wonder. Where do I get

182
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,460
my news? It's all there. Your

183
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,180
banking statements. Basically

184
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,880
does your hair. Your trip to the

185
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,220
game. It's always something

186
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:25,300
special. I'm gonna Google you.

187
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,900
When I Google you. When I Google

188
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,800
you. I'm gonna Google you.

189
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,900
You'd be surprised to know just

190
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:42,320
what you can find about a person

191
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,540
if you have enough time. A little

192
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:47,120
number unlocks a lot. And I found

193
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,180
it. Hooray I found it. Now that I

194
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,620
know just what you want in a man.

195
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,980
I go and remake myself as best as

196
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:55,300
I can. I'm gonna Google you. I'm

197
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,300


198
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,300


199
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,300


200
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:55,400
gonna Google you. I'm gonna Google

201
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:55,400


202
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:55,400


203
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:55,400


204
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:55,400


205
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,280
I'll be complete. So when we meet

206
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,000
you can't resist me. Bet you can't

207
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,360
resist me. Change my wardrobe and

208
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,880
my music. Don't like goatees I can

209
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,180
lose it. Learn to play the blues

210
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,740
if I have time. Fill my iPod up

211
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,140
with Lenny Kravitz. Get my hair

212
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,580
done up like Brad Pitt. Never gonna

213
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:17,600
quit until you're mine. I'm reading

214
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,520
all that I can. I soak up all that

215
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:20,920
I read. I'll become all that

216
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,440
you need. Chameleon. Why don't

217
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,860
you take a chance? Come on, give

218
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,280
me an opening. Get me a

219
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:25,280


220
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,840
I'll be your perfect guy, one in a million.

221
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,600
You got no secrets.

222
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:33,800
At least none you need to hide from me.

223
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,140
I don't believe it.

224
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,380
Your mother lives right down the street.

225
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,420
I can't wait to get to know you.

226
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:46,160
Hope you take the baits and things I want to show you.

227
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:50,320
Up in my computer room, by the light of the cathode ray tube.

228
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,600
And I bet that you'll be flattered too to know I googled you.

229
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,300
Oh, oh, oh.

230
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:02,520
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

231
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:02,720
Oh.

232
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:04,820
Oh.

233
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:22,600
Medicine shows of today are just the same as the medicine shows

234
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:25,200
of 50 or 60 years ago.

235
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,120
When I was a little fella.

236
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,260
They make these beautiful promises.

237
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,200
They guarantee if it isn't satisfactory, your money back.

238
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,980
What do you mean by your money back?

239
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:38,000
If it isn't satisfactory.

240
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:41,560
Well, the doctors did the same thing in the old pitch

241
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,880
that they did on the old medicine show wagons.

242
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:46,280
They carried along entertainment.

243
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,140
Today, television carries entertainment.

244
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,680
They want to bring their sponsor into your home.

245
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,040
So they go out and they hire beautiful,

246
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,640
wonderful singers, wonderful dancers,

247
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,300
big production numbers.

248
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:01,040
They get Frank Sinatra, Perry Como,

249
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,000
Toothpaste.

250
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,440
Look who they get.

251
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,340
Bob Hope.

252
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:06,960
And what are they selling?

253
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,000
Toothpaste.

254
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,920
Same old pitch.

255
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,520
Have you ever heard of Hollywood?

256
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:14,180
Luxe Theater?

257
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,980
Luxe Soap.

258
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,580
It's the same old thing as the whale oil soap,

259
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,120
but it's done in a bigger and better way.

260
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,160
Before, we had little country stores on the corner.

261
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,480
That sold cheese and crackers.

262
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:30,360
Today, we have big shopping centers with supermarkets.

263
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,820
They're dressed up, more modern,

264
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,860
and that's the way that the sales pitch is made today.

265
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,280
Everything is show business.

266
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,800
You go into a cafeteria, that's show business.

267
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,620
You go in with the intention of buying a cup of coffee,

268
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,840
and before you can reach the coffee,

269
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,300
you walk past, you see a salad,

270
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,980
or a beautiful dessert, or a piece of pie.

271
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,700
So you end up with a sandwich, a piece of pie, a salad,

272
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,320
before you get to your coffee.

273
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,600
You've been sold.

274
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,500
And that's what it is.

275
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:02,260
It's the good hard sell in a soft way.

276
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,560
And television today does that same thing.

277
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:06,460
I do it.

278
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:11,120
I do it every day that I work over at Ringling Brothers Barnum & Bailey Circus.

279
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:15,040
People come down there, and the least thing that's on their mind

280
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,100
is meeting a giant and buying a ring from him.

281
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,700
But before they leave, if they've got a kid,

282
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:24,520
I assure you, 90% of them have got that ring and carrying it.

283
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,620
Or the same thing with a midget.

284
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,520
It's a matter of selling and how things are sold, the products.

285
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,180
It's all show business.

286
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,640
You go into a clothing store.

287
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,800
Your wife goes into a dress shop.

288
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,220
She goes in with the intention of buying a dress today

289
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,120
that she's seen advertised for $2.98.

290
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,360
When she gets in, they haven't got her size.

291
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:49,440
So she ends up with a dress for $9.98.

292
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,460
But she went in with the intention of getting a $2.98 dress.

293
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,680
She came out,

294
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:57,300
with the large family economy size.

295
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,620
Just a little more money, and she got a better buy.

296
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:05,040
Hello, friends, and welcome.

297
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,260
The sermon tonight is entitled,

298
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:13,200
Why Women Are Not Equal.

299
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,400
You heard me right.

300
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:19,160
Why women are not equal and why they shouldn't be.

301
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:23,260
Yes, dear friends, it's time for every man to stand up

302
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,640
and state the obvious.

303
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,740
Women are not equals.

304
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,560
They never have been.

305
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:32,220
They are our superiors.

306
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:35,580
And though some of them may be too stupid to know it,

307
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,680
they're better than we are.

308
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,960
Now that we hold that truth to be self-evident,

309
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,500
the more sinister question remains.

310
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:45,700
How did the conspiracy ever convince women otherwise?

311
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,660
We know why the conspiracy did it.

312
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,300
The answer to that one is obvious.

313
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,240
The conspiracy wanted more work slated.

314
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:53,600
The more work slated, the more slaves.

315
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,640
Throughout history, women have avoided the more painful tasks,

316
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,580
left normally to the lower beast of burdens, like men.

317
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,820
While the man had to go out and hunt saber-toothed tiger

318
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,600
and mammoth elephant, women stayed at home in the cave

319
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,420
and raised the kids.

320
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:10,080
While man was sent out to fight wars and kill or be killed,

321
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:13,220
women stayed at home and cried about how pointless war really is.

322
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:16,880
While man went out to work and earned a few conspiracy dollars,

323
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,360
women stayed at home and decorated the track house.

324
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,820
Oh, sure, it wasn't the vacation to end all vacations.

325
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:25,280
But it was certainly better than what we got now.

326
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,340
Look what happened.

327
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,440
Now they have to work, whether they want to or not.

328
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:33,940
It takes both husband and wife to turn the conspiracy treadmill nowadays.

329
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,260
And do they get paid twice as much for their efforts?

330
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,540
Hell no! Not in real dollars.

331
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,180
They may get two salaries, but it's just enough to get on by,

332
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,680
just like it was in the past with only one member of the household working.

333
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,420
But why act surprised?

334
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:53,120
Do you really think the conspiracy was going to deliver on a promise of a better life?

335
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,760
Ha! That'll be the day.

336
00:14:54,940 --> 00:14:57,620
Let's face it, they'd been snickered.

337
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,340
They traded their children-rearing and housekeeping duties for a career.

338
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,220
And children-rearing and housekeeping duties.

339
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:07,440
And on top of that, now they're being sent off to die in war.

340
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:10,240
And don't let the absence of a draft fool you.

341
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,640
When it comes on back, believe you me, it's going to include women, too.

342
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:18,100
The only thing the conspiracy likes to kill more than men is women and children.

343
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:22,040
And as soon as they develop an efficient way to breed children in test tubes,

344
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,900
they're going to send them off to war also.

345
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:27,100
So once again, we're left with that nagging question.

346
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,420
How did they trick women into falling for it?

347
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,480
Well, I'm glad you asked.

348
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:38,760
Because the conspiracy used several of its most tried-and-true methods of media manipulation to pull it off.

349
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:41,000
First, they disguised themselves as women.

350
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:46,140
Any subgenius knows that the most rabid of feminists are really men in drag.

351
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:47,740
Just look at them. It's obvious.

352
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,120
The conspiracy is a master of disguise.

353
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,020
But there's something about the beauty of it.

354
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,840
The beauty of the female form that even the vast resources of the conspiracy just can't seem to master.

355
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,920
Secondly, the conspiracy used reverse psychology.

356
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:05,540
It tricked women into thinking that men enjoyed working day in and day out.

357
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,960
And that women are missing out on something like Tom Sawyer.

358
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:14,980
They pretended they weren't going to allow women to work unless they really fought hard to earn the right.

359
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,680
And by golly, it worked!

360
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,680
With a multi-million dollar media manipulation campaign,

361
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:25,440
the slave owners were able to convince the overseers that the slaves had a better job than they did.

362
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,200
Just look at all the fun those slaves are having.

363
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,580
Boy, oh girl, don't you wish you could work from sunup to sundown?

364
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,340
Yes, sirree. Those slaves have all the fun.

365
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,240
And we'll never let you have any unless you demand it.

366
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:45,020
And sure enough, the overseers threw down their catwhips and started working right alongside the slaves.

367
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:48,200
The conspiracy got two slaves for the price of one.

368
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,060
Now isn't that just like the conspiracy?

369
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:53,300
Mess up your life and make you grateful at the same time?

370
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,720
Can you believe it?

371
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,700
Most women actually want to be equal to men.

372
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:01,480
The lowest form of life. And they want equality with it.

373
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,760
They couldn't settle for second worst.

374
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,900
They had to demand dead last.

375
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:10,640
And in so doing proved what many male chauvinists have suspected for years.

376
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,560
Some women are as stupid as men.

377
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,360
Well, you found out the hard way, didn't you?

378
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,080
There is something worse than purgatory.

379
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:22,600
It's called conspiracy hell.

380
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:25,180
And now you know what it feels like.

381
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,980
So do us a favor, will you?

382
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:30,200
Stop complaining. Don't just sit there.

383
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,980
Get off your duff and help us get out of here!

384
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,720
Here endeth the word of our priest Bob. Amen.

385
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:45,420
In the olden days, they would have a hideous monstrosity.

386
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:53,260
Some fellow that unfortunately had had smallpox and his face was pit marked, was bald headed.

387
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:59,100
And they would put a hideous make up on him and this boy would become Jojo the Dog Face Boy.

388
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:05,200
Have you seen this strange, unusual boy from the island of Madagascar?

389
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:10,420
He neither walks nor talks but creeps and crawls like an animal in the jungle.

390
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:14,840
This young man does not eat his food the same as you and I.

391
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:17,140
He likes to eat raw meat.

392
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,760
He's in that den, that pit in there with wild, wriggling, slimy snakes.

393
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:27,040
He's alive. Have you seen him, Jojo the Dog Face Boy?

394
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,880
One ticket takes you all the way through.

395
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,360
And we would have in those days what we called a grunt.

396
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,860
Do you know what a grunt is on the front of one of those shows?

397
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:44,620
It is similar to a tom-tom with a string and you would take a little piece of cloth with rosin on it and pull it.

398
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:48,180
You'd get a . That's him in there now.

399
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,520
And we'd have this grunt going and they'd say,

400
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,820
That's Jojo the Dog Face Boy. Have you seen him?

401
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,840
You don't do those things today.

402
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,540
You will pay for your centipedes.

403
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:00,660
He didn't order that.

404
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,240
Get out and stop that grunt.

405
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:18,800
That's a grunt.

406
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:25,480
The grunt is there.

407
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,940
How is this thing going?

408
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,680
He's in that den.

409
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:28,680


410
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,300
He's alive. Have you seen him?

411
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,000
You don't do those things today.

412
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,000


413
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,000


414
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:31,000


415
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:35,080
You'd get a little piece of cloth with rosin on it and pull it.

416
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,320
We will hurl the centipedes at you.

417
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:23,380
We will hurl the centipedes at you.

418
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,020
And your centipedes are ready, sir.

419
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:35,680
That was the Amino Acids, who will be performing at X Day Festival, 17X Day, which starts very soon.

420
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:43,420
And, yeah, Monday week, in fact, the world starts to end.

421
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,320
The song.

422
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,220
We heard the Google You song.

423
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:54,820
I mean, Chameleon was by St. Andrew the Impaled, who I believe is also going to be performing at 17X Day.

424
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,000
Friday and Saturday, I believe.

425
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,860
Most of the main bands.

426
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:08,820
And the preacher we heard, well, the preacher talking about women's was Papa Joe Mama, the great father Joe Mama.

427
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:12,180
That tape is probably 15 years old almost.

428
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,040
And our special.

429
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,060
Guest thing tonight.

430
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:22,400
I got this wonderful CD of a tape.

431
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:28,780
The guy talking about carnival stuff was Nate Eagle.

432
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:34,640
Nate Eagle, the carny talker who worked from the 1930s to the 60s.

433
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:42,160
And in 1958, a producer named John Simon recorded Nate Eagle.

434
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,380
They never did do an album.

435
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,180
I don't know the name of it exactly.

436
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:51,160
But in 1970, one of the Fireside Theater got a copy of this thing.

437
00:21:51,380 --> 00:22:08,400
And then in 2014, our friend Reverend Taylor Jessen, who is kind of a Fireside Theater archivist, got his mitts on it and copied it and sent it to us and probably others.

438
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:10,520
I've been puzzling evidence to play with some of that.

439
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:13,000
Right this second.

440
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,480
So.

441
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:19,520
So, yes, that was a wonderful Nate Eagle.

442
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,500
There'll be more of that next week.

443
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:23,980
Praise Taylor Jessen.

444
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:27,100
Oh, and it looks like someone's trying to call in.

445
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:27,840
Who could that be?

446
00:22:27,980 --> 00:22:29,380
Who could that be calling in?

447
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:29,980
Yeah, I'd imagine who that might be.

448
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,460
Hello?

449
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,440
Oh, hello?

450
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:35,480
Is this the great God Horace Nervous?

451
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,140
Close enough.

452
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,060
Can you?

453
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,160
Something like that.

454
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,360
I hear the sound of a distant.

455
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,880
Horn that makes me think somebody.

456
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,260
Never mind.

457
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,540
That's burning, man.

458
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:54,080
You can hear they got their sound system turning up really loud.

459
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:55,640
You can hear it all the way over here.

460
00:22:55,860 --> 00:23:05,320
Well, the horn that I'm hearing right now is louder than the actual horn that's on the television set across the street.

461
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,820
Well, that's an air raid horn.

462
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,280
I think you're hearing this time.

463
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:11,320
The ear aid.

464
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,760
I don't need one of those yet.

465
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,600
Oh, my God.

466
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,560
The air raid.

467
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:20,000
I think we all need the ear aid so that we can hear the air raid siren.

468
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,260
Really?

469
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:26,100
They're supposed to be loud enough to break glass and pummel stone.

470
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:30,960
Meanwhile, during the hailstorm, some of the panes in glass in my house were broke.

471
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:32,680
No.

472
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,100
Yes.

473
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:35,260
No.

474
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:35,960
Yes.

475
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:37,960
God is punishing you, Dave.

476
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,360
I know.

477
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,460
I tried so hard.

478
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:43,460
I put weird little funny things on the door and everything, so he keep going.

479
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:43,800
But he.

480
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,280
He's like, oh, you're not going to be able to hear me.

481
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,280
I'm like, is it the Lord or you think maybe it's some Elvis impersonator I used to know.

482
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:54,300
You actually got damage from an act of God.

483
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:55,140
Hail.

484
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,300
They said you were going to.

485
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:58,480
They said it was going to hail.

486
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,060
They said the whole country is going to hail.

487
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:07,000
Did you experience any hail damage like some other people were?

488
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:11,500
Some other people I know said that they counted 32 dings in their cars.

489
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,800
I don't think we.

490
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:22,600
I don't think we got any of that because we're protected by the charms and hexes on the funny things on our door, which are all Dobbs approved, you see.

491
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,840
And we have that.

492
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,600
Yes, we have that.

493
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,860
That protects one's house.

494
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:29,320
That.

495
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:30,960
That?

496
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:32,140
Yes, we have that.

497
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:32,760
I have that.

498
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:34,620
Do you have children?

499
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:37,900
I have a small colony.

500
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,980
I'm raising.

501
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,200
We are from Brazil.

502
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:41,580
We are doctors.

503
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:42,060
On the border?

504
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,280
Do you have that?

505
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:44,120
I have that.

506
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,420
I have that.

507
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:45,620
I have that.

508
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:45,620


509
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:45,620


510
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:45,620


511
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:45,620


512
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:45,620


513
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:45,620


514
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,760
That protects my house.

515
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,640
That.

516
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,120
It's that.

517
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:59,820
The original that is a school picture of Dr. G. Gordon Gordon during the time when he was pretending to be a school teacher.

518
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,520
And he looks kind of.

519
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:04,780
He looks kind of ticked off like I hurry up and get this over with.

520
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,620
By the way, that was G. Gordon Gordon at the very top of the show talking about the.

521
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,300
When was the last time you had a big old steaming pipe bowl of God's town?

522
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:15,980
So, uh.

523
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:18,780
Well, it is delicious when you think about it.

524
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:28,560
And that is a reminder to young and old alike to dip down deep where it doesn't count and come up strong for dogs down by buying plenty of it.

525
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:30,940
If it's possible to buy out there and stay out there.

526
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,440
I know.

527
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:35,520
I look forward to tucking into a bowl of dogs.

528
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,320
I'm trying to learn how to do that.

529
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:37,920
But anytime.

530
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:39,160
I even stay.

531
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:39,760
Yeah.

532
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,460
I even stay.

533
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,100
Yeah.

534
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,280
As long as I'm coming.

535
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:42,640
Yeah.

536
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:42,880


537
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:43,060
Yeah.

538
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:43,280
Yeah.

539
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:43,480
Yeah.

540
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:43,840
Yeah.

541
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:44,160
Yeah.

542
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:44,220
Yeah.

543
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,580
Yeah.

544
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:44,580


545
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:44,580


546
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:44,580


547
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:44,580


548
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:44,580


549
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:44,580


550
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:44,580


551
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:44,580


552
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:44,580


553
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:44,580


554
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:44,580


555
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:44,580


556
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,040
It's really hard on your jaw.

557
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,060
Yeah.

558
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:47,240
Yeah.

559
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:47,420
Yeah.

560
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:47,560
Yeah.

561
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:47,680
Yeah.

562
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:48,860
Oh, yeah, it is.

563
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,160
It's like.

564
00:25:49,420 --> 00:25:52,500
It's like a Mexican standoff or something with your epiglottis.

565
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,900
And that's.

566
00:25:53,980 --> 00:25:55,700
That's why I think that.

567
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,800
Well, never mind.

568
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:59,320
I don't want to change the subject.

569
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:05,260
I'm going to change the subject to the same subject of this show next week.

570
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,960
Now, at WCSB next week, Dr.

571
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:13,880
Howell will be here for all three hours of Sunday.

572
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:14,580
Which will be.

573
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,380
One of the greatest extemporaneizers in the life throughout the United in the world.

574
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,380
Right.

575
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:25,600
And we would love to jam you guys head to head now.

576
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:32,120
But but the Internet listeners won't be hearing that show next week.

577
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:37,820
They're going to hear a rerun of an old show that we did back in 2003.

578
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:43,960
The hour of sight number 828 or ESO radio number.

579
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,300
And it was during the war, the same war that's still going on.

580
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:55,240
And aside from the name of the president, everything is almost exactly the same.

581
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,240
It was the princess.

582
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,220
We and I were listening to it to make sure it was OK.

583
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,640
And I might as well have been done yesterday.

584
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,880
It's a terrible shame.

585
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:07,120
Yes, I've been thinking about the same thing.

586
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,820
I've been thinking about perpetual war.

587
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,600
And what a wonderful, wonderful way it is to raise kids.

588
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,420
Just think of it.

589
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:22,080
Many of them now may reach the age of their majority or something like that at a time when there's always been a war in Iraq.

590
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:22,900
And that's it.

591
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:36,800
Well, and the funny thing on this show from 2003, we remark upon the fact that we're still talking about Saddam Hussein and we're still talking about Bush.

592
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:42,900
But it's years later from the other Bush that we used to and Saddam Hussein that we talked about.

593
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,500
It's because it was the Kuwait war.

594
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,140
Before that.

595
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:46,460
Oh, my God.

596
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:46,820
Of course.

597
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,000
How could I forget?

598
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:48,520
Right.

599
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,580
So, you know, there's like been this continuity.

600
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:53,780
Now, that corpse was even.

601
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:55,860
Yeah.

602
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,540
Afghanistan was going on then, too.

603
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,080
But that wasn't the Star War, as George Lucas might call it.

604
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:02,980
Yeah.

605
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:05,760
This war has got all kinds of a cult going.

606
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:07,000
Only now J.J.

607
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:10,600
Panther is directing the new Star Wars movie and Star Trek.

608
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:11,860
They're going to mash them together.

609
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,920
And it'll be like Luke Skywalker.

610
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,220
Versus Captain Kirk.

611
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,080
Darth Vader versus Spock.

612
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,260
With a script by Alistair Crowley's grandson.

613
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:25,320
How do you know that?

614
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:26,420
That was supposed to be secret.

615
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,600
Well, all the secrets shall be known.

616
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:32,940
Beops.

617
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,460
Psyops.

618
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,540
Everywhere we look.

619
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:39,680
I've got a story to tell you about that.

620
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,980
Go ahead and finish what you were saying.

621
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,720
Well, I kind of ran into a cliff there.

622
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,500
Because I had.

623
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,200
Three cool things I was thinking about saying.

624
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:47,200
And I forgot all of them.

625
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:54,940
So I quit in favor of the next round of exponentially gathered fuel.

626
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,860
Well, it's about Psyops.

627
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,480
And it's a true story.

628
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:01,960
Princess, we and I were.

629
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:03,400
Went out for.

630
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:06,060
Started to go out for a walk a couple of days ago.

631
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:11,540
And we noticed that our street had a caravan of cars on it.

632
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,060
Going slowly to the end.

633
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,200
All in one direction.

634
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:14,460
Going.

635
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:15,260
To the end of the street.

636
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,020
And turning left.

637
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,880
And all of them.

638
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,240
And then I noticed that.

639
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:24,800
Three cars in a row went by that were all the same model of Mazda.

640
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,500
They were different colors.

641
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,600
And I thought.

642
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,800
That's it.

643
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,460
It's FBI, CIA, NSA.

644
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,200
Obama minions.

645
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,040
Spying on us.

646
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,380
And we went walking down the street.

647
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,020
In the same direction.

648
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:39,760
And I realized.

649
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,280
Well, yeah.

650
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,420
They just slowly drive past us.

651
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:42,880
And record.

652
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,720
Record snippets of our conversation.

653
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,960
And then they concatenate all of those.

654
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,900
So that Obama can hear.

655
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:50,980
Listen to us.

656
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,400
And find out how much we know.

657
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,600
Yeah, he does it personally too.

658
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,320
He sits up in the Oval Office.

659
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,760
Oh, but that wasn't how it started.

660
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:00,860
That was just.

661
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:01,740
That was just.

662
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:04,060
And I'm only getting started here, Dave.

663
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,080
In the paranoia.

664
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:05,900
I'm listening, man.

665
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:06,260
I'm listening.

666
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,980
The day before that.

667
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,080
What prompted all this.

668
00:30:10,300 --> 00:30:10,880
Was that.

669
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:12,080
I.

670
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:16,220
I tattled on the scrub genius news group.

671
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,140
That the day before.

672
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,820
We'd noticed the Google Earth cars.

673
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:23,620
Driving past us.

674
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,020
Slowly on our block.

675
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:26,840
And then down on our other block.

676
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:29,360
With their octagonal camera.

677
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:30,660
Mounted.

678
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:32,440
Yeah, this radial.

679
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:32,980
Four or five feet above the.

680
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:34,800
Eight eyed camera display.

681
00:30:35,100 --> 00:30:35,340
Yes.

682
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,360
They were Obama's spy cars.

683
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,640
That they say he.

684
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,220
You know, he took over Google.

685
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,840
Google's trying to take over the Earth.

686
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:43,480
Obama took over Google.

687
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,040
And used them to spy on us.

688
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,320
Okay.

689
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,640
And I reported that to the subgeniuses.

690
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:47,980
Well, that.

691
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:51,040
Really ticked off Obama.

692
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:52,300
And.

693
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,320
And on top of that.

694
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,980
Our friend, Mr.

695
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,600
Sister.

696
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,560
Who's not an Obama fan.

697
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,440
Somehow had gotten hold of a.

698
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:07,020
A photograph of Obama eating his nightly puppy.

699
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,480
That he eats every night.

700
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:10,400
Yeah.

701
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:10,960
It was a kind of.

702
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,180
Yeah.

703
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:11,820
Somebody put a.

704
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:11,960
Fun.

705
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,180
Funny.

706
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,180
A caption on it.

707
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,300
That said the media loves Obama so much.

708
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:16,320
That if he ate a puppy.

709
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:17,420
They'd report it as.

710
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:18,280
He's saving.

711
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,600
Yeah.

712
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,880
The cats of the world.

713
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:20,820
Well, anyway.

714
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:21,740
So.

715
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:22,800
So we.

716
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,220
We.

717
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:23,740
Had.

718
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:24,880
Tattled on.

719
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,740
The Obama Google connection.

720
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,380
Spying on us personally.

721
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,500
And Mr.

722
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,920
Sister had revealed this classified photograph.

723
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:34,260
That he wasn't supposed to have.

724
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,760
Actually, some bus boy took it.

725
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,260
And.

726
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,280
So.

727
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,840
We come out of our house.

728
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,720
And here's this caravan of spy cars.

729
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,880
And we thought.

730
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:43,580
How did they.

731
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:44,760
What are they?

732
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:46,120
They must have made an excuse.

733
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,480
Like blocking off the end of the road up there.

734
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,660
So they'd come down our street.

735
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:50,800
And that would cover.

736
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,900
Make a cover for the spy cars that were spying on us.

737
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,420
Since we'd already broken the Google code.

738
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,000
Right.

739
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,460
So.

740
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,200
We.

741
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,680
Head around the corner up to.

742
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:00,500
We started worrying.

743
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:00,840
Hey.

744
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:01,980
Maybe they're after Mr.

745
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:02,680
Sister too.

746
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,100
Because he posted that photograph.

747
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:05,060
And sure enough.

748
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,540
They had his house.

749
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:07,660
Ringed with.

750
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:08,620
With cop cars.

751
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,060
Cleveland Bluff police cars.

752
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:11,500
Sure.

753
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:11,700
They were.

754
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:11,700


755
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:11,700


756
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:11,700


757
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:11,700


758
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:11,700


759
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,000
They were everywhere.

760
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:14,020
Now they had a prop bicycle.

761
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,020
And a staged accident.

762
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:21,580
And the story was that an idiot had run a light on his bicycle.

763
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,580
Not looking anywhere.

764
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,120
And these poe buggers hit him.

765
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:29,660
And we even saw the poe bucker girl walking around trying to get her keys back from the

766
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:29,880
car.

767
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:30,580
Cops.

768
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:31,500
And so forth.

769
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,380
But meanwhile.

770
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:33,300
Then we.

771
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:34,240
We were really worried.

772
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,920
We tried to call Mr. Sister's house.

773
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:37,700
Worrying that the feds were after him.

774
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,380
And spying on us.

775
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,340
He wasn't there.

776
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:41,700
He didn't answer the phone.

777
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:41,700


778
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,740
the phone. So we later found out that they had timed this to happen when he was gone. Yes. So

779
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:53,760
that they could, you know, cordon off his house, go in there, copy all of his hard drives, plant

780
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,660
bugs everywhere. And of course they already planned bugs in our house disguised as bugs.

781
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:07,240
You know, they look like ants. Right. But we know what's going on. So, and then I got, okay,

782
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:13,900
I thought Google trucks, fake accidents. What next? Drones. And sure enough, I looked up

783
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:22,200
out my window and they look like birds, but come on. I know a bro. I've been around

784
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:28,620
a long time and I, I know a robot. I, yeah, yeah, yeah. You know, a robot bird. When I see

785
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:33,880
there's just something off about the bird. You can just tell it's a robot bird. It's not a real

786
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:36,820
bird. And you Dave,

787
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:41,840
probably are being surveilled as well behind the veil.

788
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:48,660
Well, I was just going to add to that because you did, that did bring out one of the things I

789
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:53,860
wanted to say, but then I suppressed it because this is real. Unlike much of your story, this

790
00:33:53,860 --> 00:34:01,240
one guy got really mad and informed me that Obama does not own Google. That's a capitalism thing.

791
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:06,680
And he got really mad. I said, well, actually I was sort of making fun. And he goes,

792
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,120
you know what? I'm not doing that. I'm not, I'm not doing that. And I said, well, I'm not doing

793
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:07,220
that. I'm not doing that. And he goes, well, actually, I was sort of making fun. And he goes, you

794
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:14,460
You shouldn't say things like that about the president because the, you know, the evildoers are already bad mouthing him enough.

795
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:17,120
What a humorless jerk.

796
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:23,400
So, well, he raged with Reverend Craig, we call him.

797
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,700
Go ahead.

798
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:28,680
Did you actually see any of this stuff that you, you know, this.

799
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,960
I've got photographs.

800
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:37,180
You look at Scrub Genius and there's pictures of the intersection with the cops there and the fake bike accident.

801
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:37,780
Yes.

802
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,220
And there's a cop.

803
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,500
Dr. Legume was there working for the cops.

804
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:44,180
We fully documented the entire.

805
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,500
Remember the cop we saw?

806
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:47,400
It looked like Legume, only he didn't have the tattoos.

807
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:47,900
Yes.

808
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:48,320
Guess what?

809
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,480
Those tattoos were done with a marker.

810
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:51,500
He can remove.

811
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:53,540
He puts those on, takes them off every day.

812
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:54,100
I see.

813
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,320
That was Legume working for the cops.

814
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,940
So even, you know, the conspiracy goes deep.

815
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:05,420
And the cops, of course, are working for Obama minions and Obama minions working for Obama.

816
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,220
And Obama is working for the Illuminati.

817
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,720
And the Illuminati is working for the conspiracy.

818
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:18,020
And the conspiracy is working for Jehovah One, the alien space god from corporate sin galaxy, as everyone knows.

819
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,220
Which makes it one hell of a lot more sensitive.

820
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:23,220
Stop snoring, sleeper.

821
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,600
Think of it now.

822
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,980
Think of it now as a relapse, a form of cultural relapse.

823
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,180
That's what the church always deals with.

824
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,580
However, I did want to interject the one thing I saw.

825
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,980
A military vehicle.

826
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,920
Like one of those Humvee things.

827
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:37,540
Yeah.

828
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,160
Fully different.

829
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,380
And it wasn't American.

830
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,080
I mean, it didn't look.

831
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,780
There was nothing American.

832
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:51,560
But it did have the kind of, you know, the sand desert camouflage look going and stuff like that.

833
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:54,880
And it was just going down the road.

834
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,700
Down an Ohio road.

835
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,600
As if, you know, hi.

836
00:35:59,820 --> 00:36:00,700
Like it was on a great little plane.

837
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:04,760
The invaders from Canada are rolling in.

838
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,940
And the Ohioans don't even notice.

839
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:07,500
They don't care.

840
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,200
Oh, hi.

841
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:08,620
Welcome.

842
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:12,180
Our new Canadian overlords.

843
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:12,500
Overlords.

844
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:18,820
Well, when you think about it, the Canadians could quite easily become overlords and take over.

845
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:25,240
And especially since I actually did see a kind of foreign looking military vehicle.

846
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,020
Humvee, but armed, you know, like gun type arm and stuff like that.

847
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,900
Just like la, la, la, la, la.

848
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,880
There's a car maybe 20 lengths behind it.

849
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,340
And oddly.

850
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:38,440
Only two lengths ahead of it.

851
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,840
It wasn't in pursuit of these other two cars.

852
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,880
But it was just like, I'm going to go.

853
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,340
This is lunch right now.

854
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,900
But where did he where did he come from?

855
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,560
And where was he going to lunch?

856
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,860
And what was he doing that for?

857
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:53,320
Well, you know, one thing we know, they don't have to pay for their lunch.

858
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,160
Armed like that.

859
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,840
But now there's cop police.

860
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,780
Oh, you mean because of the weapons?

861
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:03,620
But, you know, in the U.S. military, yeah, they do have to buy McDonald's with their food stamps.

862
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,460
Now, I'm sorry.

863
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:15,080
But I have read that some police departments are using military type vehicles now and it scares the populace.

864
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:23,420
The cop, this one cop reported that the citizens were saying, have you come to take away our guns?

865
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:28,640
Yes, then by criminy, they are introducing it out in the hick sticks.

866
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:31,940
Because this is the first time they've seen them in many a year.

867
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:34,440
Well, but not on the way to a very safe relationship.

868
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:39,500
The Ashtabula Police Department couldn't afford that kind of stuff.

869
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,780
Well, no, they couldn't.

870
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:48,240
The Sheriff's Department, they get their LIEU regulars, I guess.

871
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,240
The regular money they get from the government spying on people, you know.

872
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,780
The LIEU money?

873
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:01,700
The ZEN baboon, you know, the whole 20,000 meters worth of it.

874
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,420
Encapsulated into one stupid, stupid bag.

875
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:04,420


876
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:04,420


877
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:04,420


878
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,380
Stupid idea, you know, just think about it.

879
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,260
I can't.

880
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:09,900
I know.

881
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:12,300
There's a rule against that, I think.

882
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:18,020
I know, there's this big halt, halting, you know, like written in German and stuff.

883
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:23,240
And you hear the whole Vincenzo Hero music going on in the background.

884
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:31,240
Well, you know, just because we don't feel paranoid doesn't mean that we're not being spied upon.

885
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,400
Just because we don't feel paranoid.

886
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,420
It doesn't seem like schizophrenics.

887
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:39,420
Doesn't mean we're not really schizophrenics.

888
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:40,560
Right.

889
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,920
Well, who cares at this point, you know?

890
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,040
What's the difference?

891
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:59,540
Oh, many of the great leaders of your Al-Qaeda type networks, like Abdul Personality, or guys like that.

892
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:02,040
Abdul Personality, and yeah.

893
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:13,080
Yeah, man, there's that new police force called the Cult of ISIS that's taking over the Middle East now, of the ISIS worshippers.

894
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:17,060
I was watching her at the strip club every week, and next thing I know she's...

895
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:20,280
Huh, what?

896
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:20,920
Huh?

897
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:22,080
What?

898
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,020
Did Dave just disappear?

899
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,900
I don't know.

900
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:27,920
We're asking...

901
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,040
Did the lonesome cowboy go off into Calpasture?

902
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,020
For a repatriation.

903
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:34,500
He's going to play, but he's not coming back with anything.

904
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:35,280
Lone cow?

905
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:37,220
Look, there he's gone.

906
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,860
Well, I guess he'll call back in a second.

907
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,180
Or maybe he didn't pay for his...

908
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:46,980
He didn't buy new minutes for his phone.

909
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,980
That would be tragic.

910
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,040
No, no, no, no.

911
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:58,720
Although, actually, I do have lots of stuff I can play, as always, because we're always ready for something terrible to happen to Dave.

912
00:39:58,800 --> 00:39:59,080
You know?

913
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:07,440
We come in doing these shows expecting to do Dave after the first 20 minutes, but we're always ready.

914
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:08,100
Oh, there he is.

915
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:11,000
I'm not expecting something terrible to happen to Dave.

916
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:11,520
Hello, hello.

917
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,820
Well, once again, it's the retroactive Soviets doing their tricks.

918
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:15,940
Oh, man.

919
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:25,340
That's why I was thinking that just recently I've noticed in phone books and in the culinary records and stuff like that, especially ones about small dogs and everything.

920
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,320
There was this article about how now...

921
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:37,560
The new name, the favorite new name of mothers-to-be and fathers-to-be and stuff of their children is Winston Smith.

922
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,180
You know...

923
00:40:40,180 --> 00:40:43,140
He was the original ESL guy, wasn't he?

924
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:53,220
Well, he was also a collage artist who did a lot of covers for the Dead Kennedys and the Church of the Subgenius.

925
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:58,300
He has a lot of work in our book, Revelation X, which has been published.

926
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,100
He's, of course, been censored by the government.

927
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,000
I'm a huge fan.

928
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,800
Yeah, Winston Smith.

929
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:11,940
He was the star of 1984, and then he was a collage punk artist, and now he's everybody's grandson.

930
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:14,100
King of collage.

931
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,880
Well, why would they...

932
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,140
You know, I...

933
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,920
It's weird how...

934
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,160
People named Smith.

935
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:18,660
You know, it works now.

936
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:21,040
I have a thing about people named Smith.

937
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,220
You have a book called People Named Smith.

938
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:23,780
Yeah, I do.

939
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,180
Actually, by H. Allen Smith.

940
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,280
It's quite interesting.

941
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,420
And...

942
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:30,160
Well, I thought it was by H. L. Hunt, the oil tycoon.

943
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,920
Did you say that was your great-great-grandpappy or something?

944
00:41:33,580 --> 00:41:33,980
No.

945
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:35,000
No.

946
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,520
Oh, okay.

947
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:35,740
Forget that.

948
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:36,420
No, not H. L. Hunt.

949
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:42,960
No, my great-great-great-great-great-great-granduncle, though, was a Dixie demagogue named Senator Cotton Ed Smith.

950
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,600
He was a copperhead, right?

951
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,440
Or it was a...

952
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:47,940
A cottonhead.

953
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,080
He was a Rosicrucian poet, I think.

954
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:50,900
No?

955
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:56,220
He was in the Senate for a long, long time, because his constituents, the South Carolina

956
00:41:56,220 --> 00:42:01,840
cotton farmers, liked him, because whenever the prices were high, he took credit, and

957
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,220
whenever the cotton prices were low, he blamed those people.

958
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,080
So, you know, so they...

959
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,020
His people liked him.

960
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:16,920
And all of his descendants were alcoholic suicides, as far as I know.

961
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:18,160
Just about all of them, yeah.

962
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:21,120
That was a different branch of Pappy's family.

963
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,140
Not before they brought another generation in.

964
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:25,400
Then they committed suicide.

965
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,200
Yeah.

966
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,780
Not the night before they were in wedlock.

967
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,580
Or conceived.

968
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,560
Well, it's all pretty scary.

969
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:35,460
That is.

970
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:36,420
Yep.

971
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:37,700
I guess it's just the .

972
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:43,400
You know, I see them with their rhinoplasty, and their red, red eyes, and their baboon

973
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:43,720
teeth.

974
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:44,820
I hate to reiterate.

975
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,020
Those are expensive.

976
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,100
And, you know, that costs extra.

977
00:42:49,620 --> 00:42:50,140
Yeah.

978
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:54,280
And the maintenance goes on forever and ever, much like the police cars and stuff.

979
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:58,760
You have to keep on driving them around so you get the stipend to drive them around.

980
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:00,640
And then never mind.

981
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,800
It's all show business, like Nate Eagle was saying.

982
00:43:04,180 --> 00:43:05,880
No, like I say.

983
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:07,400
Oh, it's all show business.

984
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,180
It's all bluff.

985
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,580
Thought it was done with smoke and mirrors.

986
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,500
That too.

987
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:15,020
Yep.

988
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:15,940
That too.

989
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:19,060
The whole tale of the entire globe.

990
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:25,340
The whole tale of the entire global dog is wagging, and we're the waggies.

991
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,160
You're such a wag, Dave.

992
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,820
What a wit and a wag he is.

993
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,680
I think of people with deformities.

994
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,440
I spilled some beer.

995
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,740
Do you have a wag?

996
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:39,220
Yeah.

997
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:42,920
Every time I hear that weird, instead of hearing the right thing,

998
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,180
I think of a person with a tongue deformity.

999
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:48,980
And more unusual growths on his epiglottis that give off sickness.

1000
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:49,460
You know?

1001
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:52,020
Like Elmer Fudd.

1002
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:53,140
Yeah.

1003
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,020
Elmer Fudd had that tongue deformity.

1004
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,000
We met Elmer Fudd in person.

1005
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:57,500
We did.

1006
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:03,500
He's retired from show biz, and he runs a little repair shop on Probability Pasture Road.

1007
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,020
Yes.

1008
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,140
In V&A Level C.

1009
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:05,740
Yes.

1010
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:06,840
Not far from us.

1011
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:13,340
And we took a fan to get it, and it cost about $100 to get the super fancy fan repaired.

1012
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:16,260
And now it's just like it was before we took it to him.

1013
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:17,340
Again.

1014
00:44:17,340 --> 00:44:18,820
When I was a young, violent teenager,

1015
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:24,240
there was an insurance agency whose first name was Elmer J.

1016
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,360
And his last name was Fudd.

1017
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:30,720
I won't say the actual name, but all you had to do was replace two letters,

1018
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,220
and it was Elmer J. Fudd.

1019
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:36,040
And we were going to further deface the sign by saying, you know,

1020
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:38,000
Warner Brothers cartoon stuff.

1021
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,640
Anyway, I'm sorry I mentioned it.

1022
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:42,920
Right.

1023
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,200
Well, that's Fudd's law.

1024
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:46,460
Yes.

1025
00:44:46,940 --> 00:44:48,860
Everyone has to.

1026
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,020
By Fudd's law.

1027
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:50,540
Yes.

1028
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:53,500
I don't remember what that law is, unfortunately.

1029
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,960
Well, it's the 29th law of thermodynamics.

1030
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:00,220
I don't know if it has to do with heat law.

1031
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:02,600
Action can neither be created nor destroyed.

1032
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,540
In a closed system.

1033
00:45:04,580 --> 00:45:07,500
But there are no closed systems except for Earth's atmosphere.

1034
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,540
What part of E equals MC squared don't you understand?

1035
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:15,440
If you don't really know the answer, you can always Fudd it.

1036
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:16,620
Yeah.

1037
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:16,920
Yeah.

1038
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,280
That's where that comes from.

1039
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:21,280
From Fudd-ing the answers.

1040
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,960
That's what you devote most of your time to, isn't it, Stangy?

1041
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:27,620
Yeah.

1042
00:45:27,820 --> 00:45:30,580
You sit up there in your high epilepsy in your castle,

1043
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:36,220
dreaming up silly stuff to try and confuse modern teenagers and young adults

1044
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:40,080
and make their minds all twisted and warped, just like yours.

1045
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:41,460
Well, that's it, man.

1046
00:45:41,660 --> 00:45:42,220
I'm sorry.

1047
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:43,400
I'm sorry.

1048
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:45,080
Oh, it's okay, Dave.

1049
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,480
Fudd them if they can't.

1050
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,140
Take a joke.

1051
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,840
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

1052
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:58,080
I'd like to accept this award on behalf of the Bursar's Here.

1053
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,180
It's a mental society for effective children

1054
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:08,000
and also Reverend Tim, who helps with the laundromat

1055
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,540
and many of the small children who can't find their way.

1056
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,400
So let's begin right now with kicking the ball as far as we can.

1057
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,040
Isn't that kind of mean to the ball to kick it?

1058
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,700
No, that's what balls live for.

1059
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,120
Oh.

1060
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:25,720
Wait a minute.

1061
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:26,720
I didn't say that.

1062
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:27,700
I didn't say that.

1063
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:29,640
Are you guys making fun of me?

1064
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,140
Listen to that cackle.

1065
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:35,560
Well, thanks for making me laugh.

1066
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:36,800
I needed it real bad.

1067
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:43,600
Well, Dr. Sinister, who comes in to do the show after us,

1068
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:45,640
is going to be very sad because...

1069
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:51,120
The delay dump button has a note taped to it.

1070
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,580
It says, dump button is sticking.

1071
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:54,840
Busted.

1072
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,260
Be careful.

1073
00:46:57,660 --> 00:46:58,820
That's inappropriate.

1074
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:07,060
I wish I knew what the hell you're talking about.

1075
00:47:07,360 --> 00:47:08,380
It's a technical thing.

1076
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,540
It's a radio technical thing.

1077
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:13,540
That means he can't censor when the people call in and say bad words.

1078
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:14,660
He can't dump them.

1079
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:15,840
He has no button to push.

1080
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:21,560
And you know, when you push the button at WCSB for the last 50 years,

1081
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:23,300
it always has said the same...

1082
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:27,340
You hear this guitar riff and then this guy going,

1083
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:29,020
Inappropriate!

1084
00:47:30,200 --> 00:47:32,120
You're familiar with that, right?

1085
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,200
Yes, yes, yes.

1086
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:33,660
Yeah.

1087
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:34,740
The people...

1088
00:47:34,740 --> 00:47:39,860
The other stations that play Hour of Slack don't get to hear that

1089
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:42,680
because I do my dumping in a different way

1090
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,260
in the excrementation chamber at home.

1091
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:46,320
That's how I...

1092
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,500
Erase the bad words from this show.

1093
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:49,680
Here, listen.

1094
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,240
Watch me do it.

1095
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:52,360
See, how's that?

1096
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:53,520
You didn't hear anything, did you?

1097
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:57,200
I just edited it perfectly right there on the beat.

1098
00:47:57,260 --> 00:47:58,620
And that was horrible of you to do that.

1099
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,440
It's like magic, isn't it?

1100
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:02,800
It's easy if there's no background music,

1101
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:05,200
but if there's background music, you've got to cut on the beat.

1102
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:07,260
You've got to find scissor space.

1103
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:09,720
And then dump on it right there.

1104
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:10,060
Scissor space.

1105
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:11,500
Oh, my God.

1106
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:14,560
Those words are from the 1980s, Stan.

1107
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,020
Why don't you...

1108
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:15,700
They are.

1109
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:15,780
They are.

1110
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,240
That was when you had to splice tape with scissors.

1111
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:19,400
I know.

1112
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,780
And they had little razor blades

1113
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,160
and those things that you had to connect to your nose hairs.

1114
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,200
I was the guy who had to do that.

1115
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:31,620
I used to edit stuff with razor blades and tape and scissors and reels and...

1116
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,280
Oh, how we...

1117
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:36,660
You wake up in the morning with pieces of celluloid in your ears and your eyes.

1118
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:37,680
It's terrible.

1119
00:48:38,020 --> 00:48:42,500
We treasure those terms, those antiquated terms, don't we?

1120
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:43,840
I do, too.

1121
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,420
I've been thinking about antiquated terms.

1122
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:46,060
I've been thinking about antiquated terms lately, too.

1123
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,580
I was thinking about how two cultures coexist, north and south,

1124
00:48:49,700 --> 00:48:52,120
even in tiny parts of the north and south.

1125
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:53,920
It's really stupid.

1126
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:54,340
Right, right.

1127
00:48:54,340 --> 00:48:58,500
Within Ohio, there's Yankees and Southerners.

1128
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:03,680
And it's like the Southern Ohioists are real Southerners.

1129
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,900
They sound just like deep South Southerners almost.

1130
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:13,260
But then in Kentucky, northern Kentucky is full of posh-sounding, pompous Yankees.

1131
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,400
And southern Kentucky, they're all pompous.

1132
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:15,760
They're all buckers.

1133
00:49:15,780 --> 00:49:19,820
But then in northern Tennessee, they all sound like posh, rich people.

1134
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,660
And then in southern Tennessee, they sound like me.

1135
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:27,120
Reverend Stang, I think you're pulling all of our legs.

1136
00:49:27,140 --> 00:49:27,840
No, it is.

1137
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,460
No, you're by pulling.

1138
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,920
Don't worry about it.

1139
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:34,380
North Cleveland is where the rich people live at the bottom of the lake.

1140
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:38,380
And South Cleveland is all the part we can see, right?

1141
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,760
The part that's above ground is South Cleveland.

1142
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:43,200
And it's all poor people.

1143
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:43,640
You are absolutely right.

1144
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,400
The rich people live...

1145
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:50,440
Ironically enough, in palaces under the salt mines under the lake.

1146
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,540
Yes, not only ironically, but erotically too.

1147
00:49:54,700 --> 00:50:00,000
That's the thing that charges me up about the whole condensed idea of a huge colony of people,

1148
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:05,320
super swine bluebloods, living in the salt mines under the lake.

1149
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:07,020
Down there with the Dunkleosteus.

1150
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:07,580
I think about it every night.

1151
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:09,080
I'm sorry, what?

1152
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:11,200
Down there with the Dunkleosteus.

1153
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:12,360
We're all D-Rows.

1154
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:12,680
Fossils.

1155
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,200
Yes, with the Dunkleosteus fossils.

1156
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:16,780
Fossils and the D-Rows.

1157
00:50:16,840 --> 00:50:19,580
Those are the hollow earth hell creatures.

1158
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,200
Yes.

1159
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,140
We're all D-Row.

1160
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,480
Now it can be told.

1161
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:29,980
So then you're saying these are trans-Hungarian, proto-Amalekites or Stupendous or something?

1162
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:30,840
What are they then?

1163
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:38,360
Well, they're just basically they're rich people, but they're fiendish hollow earth denizens.

1164
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:39,220
Yes.

1165
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:45,020
You know how Gollum started out as just a hobbit and then he got greedy and then the ring got him.

1166
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:47,620
He turned into like a goblin monster.

1167
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:52,580
That's what happens to the rich people if they're that rich, the super rich.

1168
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:54,100
I'm not talking about the 1%.

1169
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:56,400
I'm talking about the .001%.

1170
00:50:57,320 --> 00:51:00,820
They've been rich for generations and so they become.

1171
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,180
Well, the other term for them is Morlocks.

1172
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:12,040
I've seen Morlocks playing tennis and sipping some kind of expensive drink by a pool.

1173
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:12,860
Right.

1174
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:15,160
But the super rich don't even.

1175
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,140
Care for that stuff anymore, do they?

1176
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:19,300
I guess they're something else entirely.

1177
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:21,660
Well, their kick is eating human flesh.

1178
00:51:22,660 --> 00:51:23,620
Poor people.

1179
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,720
They eat the poor thing.

1180
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:27,180
It's not a joke with them.

1181
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,760
Well, that means that we have to keep breeding to keep on providing them with flesh.

1182
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:33,920
You know what that means?

1183
00:51:34,500 --> 00:51:36,540
We're going to have lots of kids because it's fun.

1184
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:38,400
You know how Babby is formed?

1185
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:39,480
It's fun.

1186
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:40,680
It's real fun.

1187
00:51:41,340 --> 00:51:43,900
So let's go form a Babby, Princess Lee.

1188
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:48,600
I just found out how Babby is formed.

1189
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:50,520
That was an old one, too.

1190
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:51,280
That's an ancient.

1191
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:53,080
God, we're so old.

1192
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,000
See, to me, that's like yesterday.

1193
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:57,440
All your base are belong to us.

1194
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,420
It was just yesterday.

1195
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,040
It was actually 2001.

1196
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:02,380
Goodness.

1197
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,820
13 years ago was yesterday.

1198
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,380
Theater reductionism.

1199
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,560
The theater of reduction.

1200
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,680
That's how that works out.

1201
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,720
Just think of it.

1202
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:16,120
You just add five and five.

1203
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,320
That's your decimal system.

1204
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:21,340
But if you add four and five, that's the noventry system.

1205
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:24,200
Noventy.

1206
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:33,620
Dave, I have a tape I wanted to play about UFOs.

1207
00:52:34,440 --> 00:52:35,020
UFO.

1208
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:37,600
But I don't have the guy's name.

1209
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:38,300
Forget it.

1210
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,040
I honestly can't.

1211
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:42,440
I didn't.

1212
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,660
I don't have the name of the person who edited this.

1213
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:47,960
It's a guy talking about UFOs.

1214
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:50,800
And since next week, the world ends at X-Day.

1215
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,680
I guess I can just play it next week.

1216
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:54,420
Oh, well.

1217
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:54,860
Yeah.

1218
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:56,140
Screw him.

1219
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:56,520
Screw him.

1220
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:57,660
Presto chango.

1221
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:58,340
Yeah.

1222
00:52:58,620 --> 00:52:59,540
Preston changing.

1223
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:01,860
Yeah.

1224
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:05,520
It's a wild horizon that we're facing when you think about it.

1225
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:10,060
I mean, the elliptical orbit now, the way it's bad as it's getting and everything,

1226
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:14,100
and how the newspapers are all controlled by...

1227
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:14,880
The internet.

1228
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,920
By the internet, which is controlled by, you know, who you were talking about earlier.

1229
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:21,460
Right.

1230
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,160
Which is controlled, and ultimately, to the Morlocks in the basement.

1231
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:25,920
Right.

1232
00:53:26,420 --> 00:53:28,720
But that isn't where I wanted to go.

1233
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:32,480
I was trying to warn us from going over the precipice of something.

1234
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:38,560
Now, you don't want to get turned into one of those kooks who sees a Republican under every bed.

1235
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:39,520
Oh, yep, I do.

1236
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,160
Chicken hiding under every pot.

1237
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:41,720
Oh, yep, I do.

1238
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,540
And a homeless hobo inside.

1239
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,180
I had every car in the garage sleeping.

1240
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,700
These are all real things, though.

1241
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:51,740
I know, I know.

1242
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:52,060
Hobos.

1243
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:58,980
I drove up to my house one time, and there was a hobo sleeping in a mystery car in my driveway.

1244
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:05,500
And I snuck up on him and woke him up real fast like I was real tough and scary.

1245
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,460
But actually, I was scared to death.

1246
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,380
And he was so scared.

1247
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:10,940
He said, please don't call the police.

1248
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,160
I'm a drunk.

1249
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,100
I had a friend.

1250
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,100
I used to live here.

1251
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:18,100
And I just came here to pass out for a while.

1252
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:19,480
Please don't call the police.

1253
00:54:19,620 --> 00:54:20,400
And I didn't.

1254
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,120
I pushed him and his car down into the river.

1255
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,720
But I didn't call the police.

1256
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,320
And it went into a tree before it went into the river.

1257
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:33,020
And then it was gone the next day.

1258
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,100
I didn't worry about it.

1259
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:39,540
Well, you know, you're boasting of superhuman strength and benevolence at the same time.

1260
00:54:39,580 --> 00:54:41,360
He threw his car in the river.

1261
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,400
No, it was a steep hill.

1262
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:45,860
I just pushed, gave it a little push.

1263
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:47,300
He screamed.

1264
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:48,300
He took it out of park and what?

1265
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,300
He kept trying.

1266
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:50,760
He was in the back seat sleeping.

1267
00:54:50,940 --> 00:54:55,260
He was scrambling to get in the front seat so he could pull the emergency brake before he went into the river.

1268
00:54:55,380 --> 00:54:56,760
But he hit a tree first.

1269
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:01,140
You know, I wish I could say that this was all true.

1270
00:55:01,520 --> 00:55:02,420
And it is.

1271
00:55:02,580 --> 00:55:04,100
But it's two different stories.

1272
00:55:04,740 --> 00:55:08,460
It was my car that went down by the river.

1273
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:11,500
Are you mashing stories together again, Reverend Stokes?

1274
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:11,720
I'm mashing.

1275
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:13,920
It sounds like the old brain rot radio.

1276
00:55:14,100 --> 00:55:16,400
It's a little bit of a theater commercial helping hand grenades.

1277
00:55:16,660 --> 00:55:24,380
While you're boasting of helping out the homeless and the needy at the same time, you're committing actual cruelty on the person as a joke.

1278
00:55:24,760 --> 00:55:30,460
I personally think that you should explain yourself and go into it further because I'm enjoying it.

1279
00:55:31,740 --> 00:55:43,080
I just think that people who might possibly be interested in a wild, bright, new, fresh horizon, they might be interested in the Starwood Festival.

1280
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:43,760
That's bright.

1281
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:45,100
Bright, new, fresh, and wild.

1282
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:45,820
Right.

1283
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:50,660
And it'll take place on my escape vessel when the world ends.

1284
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,760
Our escape vessel, dear.

1285
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:55,300
Yeah, but we need to know something else might happen.

1286
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,280
On the Stang vessel.

1287
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,160
Anything is liable to happen.

1288
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:01,260
Oh, well, well, well.

1289
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:04,980
No, no, no, no.

1290
00:56:05,460 --> 00:56:07,660
Stang's mind will change from second to second.

1291
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:11,780
You've been in a room with a bunch of Morlock-looking hot ladies.

1292
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,740
Next thing you know, you're in a room with a bunch of hot ladies.

1293
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:13,740


1294
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:13,740


1295
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:13,740


1296
00:56:13,740 --> 00:56:13,740


1297
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:17,460
And one of these weird amoeba dinosaurs is always looking at you through the microscopes.

1298
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:20,640
And then beyond that, who knows what could happen?

1299
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:24,300
The curtains could start pulsating and the...

1300
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:29,620
I'm going to be thinking about Morlock's ladies all night.

1301
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:34,240
I just realized I've never seen a female Morlock.

1302
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:35,480
Morlock.

1303
00:56:36,180 --> 00:56:36,760
Morlock.

1304
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:39,560
Marlisa, they call them.

1305
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:42,280
They have blue skin.

1306
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,540
They're kind of crushed.

1307
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:44,000
No, no.

1308
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:44,400
Blue.

1309
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,060
In pallor.

1310
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:49,000
Dave, the show is over.

1311
00:56:49,220 --> 00:56:52,240
And they are listening to...

1312
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,340
Oh, I want to go into nuclear curtains and all that stuff.

1313
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:53,880
Okay.

1314
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:57,020
Well, you've got to look at your watch every now and then.

1315
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:57,280
A boot tip.

1316
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:58,280
I'm going to watch the clock.

1317
00:57:00,040 --> 00:57:04,700
Subgenius.com is where the show just fell into this...

1318
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,460
That's a weird little puddle of static.

1319
00:57:07,540 --> 00:57:09,560
Yes, that was a weird puddle of static.

1320
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:11,100
Splashy and messy.

1321
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:13,340
The music has been by Sia Ba.

1322
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:16,240
Or C-E-I-B-A, however that's pronounced.

1323
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,560
And Code 4.

1324
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,740
A recorded Burning Man.

1325
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,280
I think I got those from Chaz.

1326
00:57:21,720 --> 00:57:22,380
I don't...

1327
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,960
I mean, it's a copy.

1328
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:25,500
I don't know the details.

1329
00:57:25,660 --> 00:57:28,220
But I do know the details of Subgenius.com,

1330
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:30,520
where you can learn everything about this show,

1331
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,020
the Church of the Subgenius,

1332
00:57:32,020 --> 00:57:35,240
our books, our campouts, our festivals,

1333
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,840
including the two that are coming right up

1334
00:57:38,700 --> 00:57:40,600
starting next Monday week,

1335
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:41,820
X-Day and Starwood.

1336
00:57:42,220 --> 00:57:43,420
We've heard some recordings.

1337
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,540
We'll be doing those tonight.

1338
00:57:45,700 --> 00:57:48,540
And Dave, I have to kiss you goodbye now.

1339
00:57:49,220 --> 00:57:51,780
I'll be dreaming of those pork shoulder sandwiches

1340
00:57:51,780 --> 00:57:53,100
in the eye sockets.

1341
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:59,840
That was a little Yeti kiss

1342
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:01,520
you just heard, friends.

1343
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,020
And I guess I have to pull out...

1344
00:58:05,860 --> 00:58:06,960
pull it out.

1345
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:08,400
Rip it out.

1346
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:11,340
Rip it out.

1347
00:58:11,340 --> 00:58:13,240
Then I will let the psycho...

1348
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,300
skeletons take us out.

1349
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,400
This is a power tune called

1350
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,060
Power Trip,

1351
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,520
dear friends.

1352
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:23,780
The Psycho Skeletons

1353
00:58:23,780 --> 00:58:26,380
from SoundClick.com.

1354
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:27,160
Yeah, yeah.

1355
00:58:31,900 --> 00:58:33,660
Yeah, yeah.

1356
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,180
I'm not sure if this thing is gonna explode,

1357
00:58:56,180 --> 00:58:56,200
but I'm sad.

1358
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:56,240
Oh, yeah.

1359
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:56,260


1360
00:58:56,260 --> 00:58:56,440
I'm sorry.

1361
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:56,900


1362
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:58,180
I'm sorry.

1363
00:58:58,980 --> 00:58:59,680
I'm sorry.

1364
00:58:59,680 --> 00:58:59,920
I'm sorry.

1365
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:00,920
I'm sorry.

1366
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:02,280
I'm sorry.

1367
00:59:03,760 --> 00:59:05,600
I'm sorry.

1368
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,880
I'm sorry.

1369
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:13,680
I'm sorry.

1370
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:09,380
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show

1371
01:00:09,380 --> 01:00:11,800
and we're even more glad that some listeners

1372
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:14,180
have donated enough to help us keep on going

1373
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:15,720
for another couple of months.

1374
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:19,180
Not just this show, but subgenius.com

1375
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,740
and all the other archive sites.

1376
01:00:21,940 --> 01:00:24,260
But if you truly love Bob

1377
01:00:24,260 --> 01:00:27,840
and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1378
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:31,740
you should go to subgenius.com front page

1379
01:00:31,740 --> 01:00:33,280
or especially the radio page

1380
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,300
or the catalog store pages

1381
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:38,640
and help out financially as best you can.

1382
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,140
Now, we know what it's like

1383
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:43,020
to be on the brink of total poverty

1384
01:00:43,020 --> 01:00:45,000
and we don't want any subgeniuses

1385
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:46,660
to make their own situations worse.

1386
01:00:47,060 --> 01:00:49,680
But some of you still have jobs.

1387
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,960
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1388
01:00:53,120 --> 01:00:56,500
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1389
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,920
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1390
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:02,220
All we're saying is that

1391
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:05,640
blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs

1392
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,700
if you don't pay Dobbs.

1393
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,980
We also take checks and money orders

1394
01:01:10,980 --> 01:01:11,120
and we're not going to be able to

1395
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:11,660
listen to Arab access.
