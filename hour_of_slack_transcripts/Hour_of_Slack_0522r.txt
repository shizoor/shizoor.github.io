Stay tuned please for the American Hour of Slack.
Oh no, here it comes.
Do we dare to do it?
Do we dare to turn on to Farm Road 666?
Okay, here we go.
Oh, it's the bad road.
This is the bad road, Doug.
I can tell because there's a Michelob truck in front of us.
And this is Dead Man's Pass.
It says you must pass here to die.
And 24 miles to Sanders.
And Sanders, the home of the chicken man, will be safe.
He'll be back on the interstate.
And he just died.
Make it this far across 666.
Six.
You'll make it.
Yeah, well it's easy for you to say.
It's easy that we usually ignore the fourth dimension.
You see, we can move in the other three.
As the doctor said, up, down, forwards, backwards, sideways.
But when it comes to time, we are prisoners.
The human race lulled into a false sense of security except for one scientist.
Who dared probe the secret of this terrifying plan.
Reverend Ivan Stagg.
Who dared probe the secret of this terrifying plan.

The secret of this terrifying plan.
OUTSIDE THE HALL.
Going to destroy us.
And kill everyone we've got to stop them.
Easy, Doug, easy.
They're here, they're here, they're...
THE SUBGENIUS.
OUR HOUSE.
WHAT?
THE SUBGENIUS.


Unbelievable.
Fantastic.
But I tell you, it could happen.
It could happen.
It could happen.
It could happen.
Yes, it could happen.
It could happen.

The soft boys read it, though.
He said it was really scary.
Good.
You have to scare some people
just to get their attention.
Should we allow these people
to find themselves
in the tribulation period
scared to death
or get their attention
while something can be done?
You know, unless you gals
open your minds and your hearts,
I'm afraid one of these days
you're going to be in
for a rude awakening.
¶ ¶
Yes, no kidding.
A rude awakening, indeed.
And you can have that rude awakening.
Please, please do.

Opening!
Glorify me that I might glorify you.
And lo, if you say, I'm ashamed of you, Bob,
then on the day of judgment, Bob shall say, I'm ashamed of ye.
And ye shall come down off the mountain.
Yea, ye wants to be he.
Ye who shall soon be ye.
Ye who shall soon be the same as thee who once were as both spoken by the prophet.
And this is important.
The glory, the faded glory that shall not be recovered, not by Bob,
need ye by the pink smiling false prophets that once bespoken
that which was not peed in the river of blood,
and yet was somehow not involved in the later slaying of John Lennon.
And so, let's worship.
Set the mirror for the congress.
It's going to happen.
We don't have a moral awakening in this country.
This creature is trying to tell me something.
I can see it in his face.
I say there are things better left unsolved.
Who knows what waits for us in nature's no man's land.
Impossible.
Unbelievable.
Unbelievable.
Fantastic.
Easy, Doug, easy.
Fantastic.
It's unbelievable.
Things like this just don't happen.
Doctor, why?
Half his head's gone.
The first satellite creature to impregnate man with its chromosomes.
It's true.
I can feel it inside.
Save me from the clutches of the Susie.
Save me from the chain of time.
Save me from the minute you die.
Save me.





Save me.
Save me from the lastоры forФ eatin'.

They have cast out lepers containing many lives and attacking the church and Christians.
They have cast out lepers containing many lives and attacking the church and Christians.
Reverend Onan Kenobite, dear friends.
Are you frightened?
Yeah, I guess I am.
I have a son.
He was just over a year when Christ returned and took the Christians in the rapture.
I lost both he and his mother.
My husband was a Christian.
Five days after he disappeared, Billy was born.
Hello.
Hello.
Come in, come first.

God, I'm not afraid, but C которые .
Lord, God, give me strength.
Oh, fight it off!
I'm not afraid.
And I ran out across the ouiy Road and,
and there it is up there.
Oh, those eyes.
Oh, can't I please wake up?
Come in, preachers.
Assume in all of you to attend.
Great.
Wake up.




Be silent, all of you.
I've opened the surface of the Earth.
It's time to attack.
I've given the Earthlings an ultimatum.
Either they agree to become my slaves,
or they'll be destroyed.
What if, um, one were not a believer?
My advice to that person would be
to be still alive as long as possible.
God is a groovy guy, huh?
Get down.
God is a groovy guy, huh?
Good God.
He sits up there so high in the sky,
examining everything with a critical eye.
If a sparrow falls, he wants to know the reason why.

He's under every fork and spoon.
He's pushing you when you're old.
He's pulling you when you're a-bawning.
He's in the thick yellow crust that you find in your eyes.
When you first wake up in the morning, he will take you.
He'll take you to the cleaners.
If you covet your neighbors.
Why, if he'll give you a rabbit punch.
If you make a graven image.
He'll short sheet your bed.
If you bear false witness.
He'll rack you up and string you out.
He'll break your jaw and give you gout.
He'll visit you with locusts.
He'll visit you with plague.
He'll visit your apartment, steal your spoons and break your legs.
He'll cover you with cooking oil.
He'll burn you out of spit.
He'll loosen up your mouth and then rub your nose in it.
He'll fill your heart with hope and then he'll take it all away.
He'll stop and crush your testicles while you try to pray.
Put glass under your tire.
Put some sugar in your tank.
Make it stand in long lines.
You have to mark it or the bank.
He'll fill you with diseases and make your teeth turn brown.
He'll be eaten up by maggots when you're six feet underground.
He does all these things cause he loves everybody.
If you disagree, he'll break every bone in your body.
He'll eat you up.
He'll eat you up.

But let's leave things of this world behind
And walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the church of the subgenius
Oh yes, praise Bob friend
This is Reverend Ivan Stang
Come to tell you the truth
The truth about the path to slack
Through hyperventilation
Yes my friend, you can get high
From hyperventilation
And it's legal
And it's an exercise we're preaching
And if you can learn to talk like me
And talk this way all the time
Then everybody you meet will be your friend
And you will get so high
You will get so high
You will meet Bob
You will not be able to stop seeing Bob
Because you will have so much slack in your brain
There won't be any more room for thoughts
And when your mind is free
Free of thoughts
Then you will have the slack
The slack you need in your life
Praise Bob
Help me somebody
Do I hear a praise Bob?
Let there be slack
Because the blood of the blood
Loading on the chains


Here in my veins
In my veins

Pray for these people.
Pray for these people.
Pray for these people.
See, Bob is a salesman,
and Bob is going to try to prevent the planet Earth from being sold.
So when Bob goes to talk to these men from Planet X,
he has to have a representative constituency here on Earth.
Because the men from Planet X, well,
they're businessmen, pure and simple businessmen.
And they're going to say,
Bob, your proposal sounds good, but I've got to see numbers.
I've got to see hard data.
Show me the numbers of subgenus on this Earth,
and it's your planet.
And we'll know it's worth saving.
Exactly.
See, that's Bob's job, is to...
Someone's got to explain to those aliens,
in ways they can understand,
why the human race is the way it is,
so that they don't put us out of our misery.
And they understand the bottom line,
which is why we're the world's first industrial church,
the church of love,
and money.
It certainly is.
Bob, of course, studied 18 months longer than I.
Bob, where have you trained?
Well, I had calculus and logarithms in elementary school in Washington, USA.
Then I spent one year in the Space Flight Center at Houston, USA.
Another year in Moscow on advanced power and propulsion systems.
Six months in England at the Academy of Celestial Navigation.
And then back to Houston for advanced computer technology.
Bob?

Bob?
Bob?
Bob?
The message is now part of and registered in every UCC.
Ah.
And, uh, yes, dear friends,
well, you regular listeners may be wondering
why we're not continuing the story of...
Oh.
Why we spent our family vacation last time.
Uh, this time.
And, well, I don't know.
I got home from last week's show and thought to myself,
that was a pretty crummy show.
And I said to my wife, you know,
I don't know if that show was all that good.
And wives, of course, are supposed to say,
oh, it was perfectly good.
It was great.
But no, a subgenius wife says,
you're right, it wasn't that good.
It was okay.
So, I'm going to blow off the...
the, uh, endless travelogue.
We're obviously working on the theme of 666,
or 999 for those of you who are more optimistic.
The number of the beast versus the number of Bobby.
And, uh...
Oh, oh, now I remember why I came on the air.
I've got to flip a tape.
It's funny, you could just get on the air
and just continue talking and talking.
But, uh, and you can too, friends.
You can too.
You can call the Will of Dobbs here
and find out just what in the hell we're talking about.
I bet you started to wonder about now
if this is the first time you happen to tune into this show.
Going, what?
What's that show?
Well, it's the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack
here on KNON and affiliated stations.
Ha ha ha!
In the meantime, I'm sure I could probably think of
something important, significant,
something with socially redeeming value to say,
but you know, even if I could,
I don't know if I'd want to.
Are you worth it?
Well, you'll have to prove that, friend.
You're gonna have to write to Bob.
You're gonna have to tell him exactly what you think.
We wanna know.
Don't call the station when, uh, we're not here
and cuss about us.
C-uh, call us and cuss about us.
that was don't tell the station manager what we've been doing whatever you do okay
and uh oh welcome to our our guest here uh who you're not hearing uh reverend gazeki from los
angeles who has come in to um uh take notes on just uh what we're doing why we're doing it and
possibly i guess give it to the uh the great finger in the sky which rules us all but probably not
that's an inside joke friends and and i know that you want to know what all those inside
jokes are about don't you well just stay tuned and uh you'll be more confused than ever thank y'all
and now i get it
you leave it up to you friends i want to explain to you why they call
it a joke
subgenius
this guy's helping to tell me tell you and me both subgenius by definition of course means
just below a genius or anything below a genius could be an amoeba you know anybody can qualify
obviously and i have um by actually by miscuing this tape let's see i had funny to hear all that
chinese
i don't sleep 64 years into the terrifying future a beautiful horrible cave world you've never dreamed
of that unleashes a hurricane of power to almost completely shield you from outside sound and shock
if the last 50 years made such a change just imagine the new york of 1980 when everyone has a
number instead of a name and the government is not going to be able to do anything about it
it's the government that's going to have to do the work of the government
and the government tells you whom you should marry just imagine 1980
here dear take your medicine come on let me have some more pills before you go
there you are now take care of yourself yeah take care of yourself mankind was made sterile in a great
cosmic plague and you adam and eve are the only male and female left to repopulate the world
i value my freedom more than this the jealousy of a she-devil is the only thing that can keep me from
living
the last survivors of the human race are doomed to murder in a killer orgy by this subhuman mutant
will you die 64 years from today after the christians disappeared life just went on
it wasn't much different at first but then i'm afraid i don't know why we're here
until after the death of extreme depertaels leonard kent i know how you feel the same
thing happened to me but you want to know something i'm not afraid anymore
well i was walking down the street looking for a job i ran into a man called himself mn
i forgot i forgot i even needed a job
it's all happened to me when i ristened to a guy named bob
chassis because he had so manyATTACUS Mario Setter

in town didn't have a dollar i was so poor i was starting to holler then i ran into a man called
himself bob and i mean i plumb forgot about the fact that i had no money in no time
well bobby's hot bobby's cold bobby's young bobby's old but i forgot forgot i needed to
know anything else i just took my own personality and put it up on the show
can't swallow your own boat how you gonna swallow your throat
because if you use your own throat to swallow it with where are you going
where are you gonna swallow if you swallow your throat what are you gonna use to swallow it with
you can't swallow your own throat you can't run from your own legs
hide from jailbox I'm too stupid you are can't hide from God who's bigger than you he's bigger
than all infinity help me somebody she ain't got no legs pull the lever and down you go
preacher my legs are on fire need to melt need to have praise job
Jesus said in John 14 6 I am the way the truth and the life and no man cometh to the father
but by me he weighed 20 pounds and was hairy as a monkey when he was 10 years old
he was big as I was
accidents were happening all the time dogs falling in the well I even found chickens
with their heads bit off I knew he'd done it I hit him with a tire and I split his face wide open
I thought I'd killed him
clown's brain
so damn big he'll make you look like a greasy little pig oh you'll forget about your whole personality
as soon as you give your entire brain to Bobby Lee
if you're young and you're looking for a job just look for a guy
whose name is Bobby and you won't have to worry about getting a job
you
won't have to worry about getting a job
you won't have no money but you have Bob
yes you have Bob
you won't have no money but you have Bob
yes you have Bob
it would be futile to fight them with military power it would lead to defeat the end of civilization
and once you start seeing it and looking at it and see the game they play
although none of you want to deal with real life games you're not going to be able to do it without me
you're not going to be able to do it without me
and that's not the reality because you're all hooked up into that other thing
well you fixin' to lose all that mess
they use their tongues to deceive
the venom of snakes is under their lips
their mouths are full of bitterness and curses
and in their paths nothing but ruin and misery
and the fear of God is not before their eyes
they have taken the hearts and minds of our leaders
they have recruited the rich and the poor


And they have blinded us to the truth.
Our human spirit is corrupted.
Why do we worship greed?
Because outside the limit of our sight,
greed egg off us,
perched on top of us from birth to death.
Our owners, our owners,
they have us, they control us.
They are our masters.
Wake up.
They're all about you, all around you.
You can't digest your own stomach.
How you gonna digest your own stomach?
Not a man or woman in this auditorium tonight
who can digest their own stomach.
You can't digest your own stomach.
You can't swallow your own throat.
You can't run from your own legs.
You can't hide from terrible jobs,
cause it's stupider than you.
You can't hide from God, cause he's bigger than you.
He's bigger than all reality.
Help me, somebody.
I'm a real old creature.
My legs are on fire.
Need some help, need some help.
Praise God.
That's not my dog.
That's not my dog.
That's not my dog.
That's not my dog.
That's not my dog.
That's not my dog.
That's not my dog.
That's not my dog.
But still you can't forget that you're alone.
An outsider.
Ginny thinks that she has the key to popularity,
parking in cars with the boys at night.
When Jerry brags about taking Ginny out,
he learns that she dates all the boys,
and he feels less important.
What about Ginny?
Does that make her really popular?
No, girls who park in cars are not really popular.
Not even with the boys they park with.
Is it because they like the way she looks and dresses?
Because she seems as interested in girls as in boys?
Because they've heard no scandal about her?
Perhaps they'll bring another couple home with them.
That would be fun.
But what about the rich guy who does nothing while I do the work?
Under the protection of our freedoms,
American Labor, Management, and Capital,
the greatest production team in the history of mankind,
have made the United States the industrial master of the world.
I don't know, the whole world's gone crazy.
...filled with their own devices.
For the turning away of the simple shall slay them,
and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely,
and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
I'm just not going to give you any report of it.
You'll never know until you get to heaven,
where I went over the budget map.
And I said, even when you get to heaven,
God will have to tell you, because I'm not knowing.
Crazy!
That whole game.
Somewhere.
Somewhere.
Somewhere is that whole thing.
You've got to understand that the...
the true education for syllogists is in the top of your head.
Not in no college or university.
Controlled by the same force that controls the universe.
You can't wet water.
Water's already as wet as it can possibly get.
You can pour water on water, but you're just going to have more water.
You can't wet water.
You can't digest your own stomach.
You can't swallow your own throat.
You can't run from your own legs.
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs, because he's stupider than you.
You can't hide from God, because he's bigger than you.
He's bigger than all reality.
Help me, somebody.
Pull the lever, and down you go.
My legs are on fire.
Need some help? Need some help?
Praise Dobbs.
Then Joe will continue to be
the king of the workers of the world.
You said it, brother.
Tenacide. Tenacide. Tenacide. Tenacide.
My leg!
So you see,
it would have been better if I had died in the hospital
than to look the way I do.
I couldn't even go to Nick's funeral.
Or the funerals of all those people in the other car.
And I...
As I said before,
I've had my last date.
This boy and girl coming home from school
look quite content with life.
And why not?
They're looking forward to an important date.
I don't...
this one,

Who Ah.
When the TV first hit your hijos
I was a little girl,
back on Erickson Drive,
my brotherás alaba.
An ass and my fridge.
On one night in Dallas I was dealing in an air crash.

And I joked.
Damn good grub.
When I left, I noticed the fry cook was talking to the waitress.
He was a kind of a tall distinguished looking guy for a fry cook and was smoking a pint.
Pleasant looking fellow.
I noticed his name Bob in a stitched monogram on his white fry cook shirt.
Well, I went out into the cool Texas night and drove off into the future.
I never caught Doc Burrows.
I missed Jack Kerouac.
Before I knew it, I was too old to wear my hair long without feeling self-conscious about it.
So I was pretty much of an outcast.
I couldn't find my social niche.
Where was my peer group?
I was irrevocably trapped between hipster and hippie.
The new wage mutants were trying to out-puck me.
Snapping at my heels.
My life came apart.
I turned to drugs and it all went downhill.
And then one day I saw that face again looking at me from a page.
Hey, I said, I've seen that guy before.
Maybe I'm just having an acid flashback.
I found out it was a man named Bob Dawes from Dallas, Texas.
And suddenly the complex pieces of the puzzle that I'd been accumulating for a time.
25 years in the back of my head.
All dropped into place.
I sent them all my money.
They sent me the word Bob.
And now I know exactly what I am.
And how I came to be that way.
And now I work only for Bob.
And the church.
And now I can tell people what I do for a living.
Without being ashamed.
And that's how the song came into being.

I can add you to my quality.
Call her every day.
You will be just fine.
Hey Bob.
Did you write me a letter.
Here.
I'm sorry to call you mom.
I know it's a very expensive message.
I believe it's против waking too early in the morning.
Hi Beth.
Thank you, Bob, for cleansing my memory.
Thank you, Bob, for helping me see.
And, Bob, I'll follow you always.
That's right, Bob, until that next day.
Thank you, Bob, for sending me pills.
Thank you, Bob, for finding me willing.
Teenage girl, and Bob, I'll follow you always.
That's right, Bob, until that next day.
Oh, yes, friends, it's a Bob Rogers revival in downtown Dallas, Texas tonight.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Right, Buck.
We've got these traditions, and we do these things,
and we have these revivals regularly and irregularly as possible.
Yeah, irregularly is right.
Thanks, that was Buck naked in the Jaybirds, the very last little thing there.
I think before we're running into our last 15 minutes of slack,
and I should give some credits before I forget.
We've been hearing a lot of media barrage tonight.
Like I say, I wasn't going to spout.
It didn't work last time.
So I chickened out, man.
I chickened out.
I ain't going to do it again.
Nancy Regalia sent a new media barrage called Signs of the End Times,
which I've been using a lot of here.
Nancy, by the way, has a book out this week called Sunglasses After Dark,
An Erotic Horror.
It's a horror novel, dear friends, which you'll probably enjoy.
I haven't actually read it yet, but no doubt, no doubt at all,
it's a wonderful, sick thing.
Something to read the kids.
It's under her fake human name of Nancy Collins.
Look for Sunglasses After Dark by Nancy Collins.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Ganze videos that I've been watching with all of you for a very long time.
It doesn't matter whether your child's favorite is mother or not.
Did you hear me?
Did you hear me?
It doesn't matter whether your child's favorite is mother or not.
She knows that it's her time.
I suspect that you know your children's father.
Well, yes, I think I know my last two children's fathers.
Yeah, you think you know.
Well, you may not know.
But if you don't know, you've got the last word on the question.
But I'm one man that thinks all children should favor their father.
Did you hear me?
Yeah.
I think that's enough.
Well, I'm going to tell you that one child don't fail me at all.
Hmm?
No, sir, don't fail me at all.
And don't talk like it.
No, sir.
And don't talk like it.
No, sir.
I've got a brother like you.
No, sir.
But I'm a dead cat on the line.
I agree completely.
That was D.K. Jones.
And this is Glass Madness, dear friends.
You've been hearing him singing all along.
I've got a little shirt to me sent in the mail by Bob.
Bob sent me a Silk Genius t-shirt, and I'm so damn proud I'm wearing it.
And I've just got to sing a song.
I'm wearing the t-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me.
It came to me in the mail.
When I'm wearing the shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me.
Nothing I do is going to fail.
I'm wearing the t-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me.
It came to me in the mail.
Oh.
And when I'm wearing the t-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me.
Oh, yes.
I know I'll never land in hell and I'll never be gone.
Don't you wish, Jimmy.
Oh, yeah.
I'm wearing the t-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me.
It came to me in the mail.
And you can get one too, dear friends.
When I'm wearing the t-shirt that Bob Dobbs sent me.
But you've got to know it.



What does that red button over there do?
Go ahead, please.
Kill me or kill me.
We don't care if you kill us or not kill us.
We can kill you or not kill you.
You can kill me.
You can kill me.
Sarge, and I just want you to know that that'll be damn fine.
See, we should like kill.
Tell us that song.
Kill, kill for the love of killing.
Kill for the love of Kali.
We kill to be free.
We kill for fun.
We kill to be men.
We make America free.
We kill for profit.
Well, that's a real nice sentimental story, but personally, I think it's a lie.
We kill.
Kill for the love of killing.
Kill for the love of Kali.
Kill for fun.
Kill to stay free.
We'll make America.
Right.
Are you still, you're still making them Doctors for Wotan tapes?
And they ain't killed you yet?
My God.
Have we strayed so far from the Bible that Doctors for Wotan can make tapes day in and day out without anybody killing them?
My God, to what depths have we sunk?
What depths have we sunk here in this nation?
No, sir.
As a matter of fact, in the Bible, it says that I come as a sword, not as a, uh, uh, a winky little flower.
And I'm going to kill the hell out of everybody.
I'm going to kill everybody I can get my hands on.
And I read it.
I'm going to pass some money changers out of the temple and, uh, tell them to the damn record album.
Billy Graham, Mr. Graham, you can see that Doctors for Wotan are still making tapes.
Oh, we're, we're Billy Graham.
Is Doctors for Wotan still making tapes?
If they are, how long?
Well, we can get our followers to do whatever we want anyway.
Well, I sent my money to Doctors for Wotan.
Good God, I'm so glad.
Should I still go to heaven?
You're still dead.
You're still dead.

This message has been brought to you.
You're still preaching at Dobbs.
Now we shall pray.
And they ain't killed yet.
Oh, my God.
Holy cow.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
I just want to die
Oh, please kill me
I just want to feel the veil
Looking at the glass in my veins
Oh, I just want to die
For a new bitch
Oh, I just want to kill
For a new bitch
I don't want to hear
Another word about Bob
I just want to die
Oh, I just want to die
I just want to die
Die, die, die, die
I just want to die
I just want to die
I just want to be dead
like Joan Baez and Bobby Dylan.
I just want to die
like David Crosby.
I just want to die, yeah, yeah.
Just want to die and be cool one last time.
Just want to die, die, die.
And he says, no matter what you guys do,
no matter how many of you people
you get in the spaceship,
there ain't no way you're going to get rid of
the white man blues.
Thank you.

My Sony's broken
My kid pawned a video
For drugs
My wife passed out on Darbon
And wrecked a new car
I got the white man
Blues again
I got the white man
Blues again
Working on a chain gang for Bob
Say we're working on that chain gang for Bob
Bob don't pay but he'll let you stay
You got him kneeling free
Working on that chain gang for Bob
Working, working, working
Working on that chain gang for Bob
What's the matter?
Doesn't that sound exciting to you?
They're dead, they're all messed up
They're dead, they're all messed up
They're dead, they're all messed up
Genuinely glad to see him
As though they had really missed being away from him during the day
And are anxious to talk to him
This is the time for pleasant discussion
In a thoroughly relaxed mood
They don't pick this time of the day
To spring unpleasant surprises on Dad
They're here, they're here
They're going to destroy us
Families throughout the country
Observe the custom of saying grace at mealtime
It is always treated as a gift






They're treated with reverence and respect
Converse pleasantly while Dad serves
I said pleasantly for that is the keynote at dinnertime
It is not only good manners but good sense
Pleasant, unemotional conversation helps digestion
Pleasant, unemotional conversation helps digestion
Let father and mother guide the conversational trend if they desire
After all, they made it.
all this possible and may want to talk over their day with each other. Tell
mother how good the food is. Maybe Cis rates a compliment too. It makes them
want to continue pleasing you.
Don't discuss unpleasant topics such as gruesome sights or sound.
Charm and relaxation remember? The dinner table is no place for discontent.
It makes dad and mother uncomfortable and unhappy. This does not mean you
should be stiff or formal. With your own family you can relax. Be yourself. Just be
sure it's your best self.
Yeah, you sure you like to do that?
I like to do things like this.
Sure.
I thought all girls wanted fellas to take them to fancy places, spend lots of money.
Not this girl.
You know, I sort of like things like this too. You won't laugh. I like to go on
bicycle trips too. Do you?
And miniature golf. Do you like that?
Yeah, and weenie ropes and square dances.
And baseball games and taffy poles. I think they're swell.
Say, you like to do lots of things.
Thanks, Georgia.
Mother, would it be slick if we had an electric ironer like Sally's mother has?
Of course it would. And I'm looking forward to having an electric dryer too.
Sounds pretty good.






Your dreaded eyes like smoking
In his great TZ chair
Your dreaded eyes like smoking
Piss your money away
There won't be no rainy day
If I will sell you all the sun
He's unlike with your old old one
But he ain't no man
He ain't no God
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried
He ain't no man
He ain't no God
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried
At his desk in Dallas
When dreaded eyes like smoking
Behind his mirrored windows
When dreaded eyes like smoking
Dreaded eyes like smoking
Let up your pipe
Let go the smoke
This is slack
It ain't no joke
Raise me to five
Lift up your chain
And you will pay
To know what you think
But he ain't no man
He ain't no God
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried
He ain't no man
He ain't no God
I don't wanna walk the path
I don't wanna walk the path I've tried
And yet
I still miss your summer
Take my hand
Make out
I miss your body
Cause the intimidated time

Things put them to use.
Bob will be your best excuse.
Bob for me and Bob for you.
No matter what, a little Bob's a little buddy.
He ain't no man, he ain't no God.
I don't want to walk the path Bob tried.
He ain't no man, he ain't no God.
I don't want to walk the path Bob tried.
I don't want to walk the path Bob tried.
He's the one who grins and smokes the pipe.
For in a world of darkness, danger and despair,
we can go on smiling because we know that Bob Dobbs is always there.
And I know that Bob's on my side, I know it as sure as I'm born.
He will make the proper deal with the exes' whore.
Then we'll come to meet him and we'll greet him and rule forevermore.
Bob is my one true savior, you can't keep all of the rest.
Looking at his smiling face helps me when I'm depressed.
For the pinks I sure feel sorry, for tomorrow they'll fry with all the rest.
Bob has got no real brain to speak of, though his luck has seen him through the lack.
For all the geniuses led us down the wrong track.
Least we know a subgenius won't turn around.
Least we know a subgenius won't turn around.
And stab us in the back.
The con thinks they have us suckered, but I know that that is a lie.
They're due for a big surprise from demons from the sky.
Makes me so glad I wised up, got it sized up.
Hell, I'm a lucky guy.
Bob brought me slack and that's lots more than I ever got from the con.
Though I know it's only cause of all those pills he's on.
Heck, I know he ain't too clever.
But whatever he says I'll do or die.
Gotta have slack.
Gotta.
You gotta have.
Gotta have.
Gotta have slack, friends.
Yeah.
I got a big ol' Bob.
I got a big ol' Bob.
He's right inside my pocket.
Got my big ol' Bob.
Just reach inside my pocket.
I just washed him off.
He ain't too stinky this time.
You gotta try my Bob.
He really wants to meet you.
Boom!
Boom!
It will open up to Bob.
You'll know that he's a love god.
And once he gets inside, he's never gonna leave you.
The burning seat of Bob is linking out my pocket.
Just open under him.
He'll crawl inside your socket.
I got a big ol' Bob.
He's waiting to baptize me.
He's waiting to baptize me.
And I got a big ol' Bob.

I got a big ol' Bob.
He's waiting to baptize me.
