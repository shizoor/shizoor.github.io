1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,560
I hit that kid in the crosswalk.

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:05,800
Please, look for pedestrians.

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:08,420
Think of the impact you could make.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,360
A message from the Federal Health Service.

5
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,360
Give me a small snack.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,820
There's a lady who's sure

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:17,400
All the glitters is gold

8
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,660
And she's buying

9
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,200
A stairway to heaven

10
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,920
When she gets there, she knows

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,040
What did she know?

12
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,740
That the stars are all closed

13
00:00:26,740 --> 00:00:29,420
The words she conveyed, what she came for

14
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,800
When it makes me wonder

15
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:35,580
How does that affect your books?

16
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,380
A sign on the wall

17
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,080
That she wants to be shown

18
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:41,440
Cause you know

19
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:45,000
Sometimes words have to mean it

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,260
In a tree by the brook

21
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:50,320
There's a songbird who sings

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,580
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

23
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:02,860
And she's buying

24
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,020
A stairway to heaven

25
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:08,960
There's a songbird who sings

26
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,720
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,300
You're having fun this time

28
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,400
It won't go

29
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,100
In case you don't know

30
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:24,980
Goodbye from calling you to join in

31
00:01:24,980 --> 00:01:27,560
It makes me wonder

32
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:29,400
And there's a thing I've been doing for a long time

33
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,520
A feeling I get when I look to the west

34
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:35,080
And my spirit is crying for leaving

35
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,060
In my book I have written

36
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:41,100
Rings of smoke through the tree

37
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:44,380
And the voice is a-throwing

38
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:46,120
To me

39
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,380
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

40
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,860
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

41
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,160
Make the noise

42
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,520
Your cat is humming

43
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,180
And it won't go

44
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,660
In case you don't know

45
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,460
The Piper

46
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,200
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

47
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,680
It makes me wonder

48
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,060
Why you

49
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,700
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?

50
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,600
And did you know

51
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,720
The stairway lies on a whisperin' wing?

52
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:10,620
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

53
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,980
And it makes us wonder

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,180
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?

55
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,760
And did you know

56
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,220
Your stairway lies on the wind?

57
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,480
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

58
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:28,600
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

59
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,260
And she's finding the stairway to heaven

60
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,600
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

61
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,080
And it makes me wonder

62
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,540
It makes me wonder

63
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,920
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

64
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,360
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?

65
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,420
Just a spring before the May Queen

66
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,100
Your stairway lies on a whisperin' wing

67
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,720
It makes me wonder

68
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:57,180
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

69
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,800
And it makes me wonder

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:58,800


71
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:58,900
And it makes me wonder

72
00:02:58,900 --> 00:02:59,040
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

73
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,380
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,600
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

75
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:01,720
And you might find

76
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,900
A sign of love and hope

77
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,200
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

78
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,420
A star that's so far from home

79
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,980
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

80
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,900
And what you may be of hope

81
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,640
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

82
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,920
Who shines white light and wants to show

83
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,000
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

84
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,160
How everything still turns to gold

85
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,760
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

86
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:25,720
You'll ain't with many hearts

87
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,480
But you will come to you

88
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,320
And love's a boy of heart

89
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:29,400
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

90
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:29,840
Good callin' fancy

91
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,740
And lovely it's not a far

92
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,820
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

93
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,120
Instagram troll

94
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:40,980
Baba J Gracias

95
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,420
And love's a boy of heart

96
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:48,420


97
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:48,680
I'm on my way

98
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:48,680


99
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:48,680


100
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,400
The star we watch

101
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:50,280
Oh oh oh

102
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,440
I'm on my way

103
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,340
I'm on my way

104
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:52,340


105
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:52,340


106
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,940
Oh oh oh

107
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,620
He's a tella

108
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,860
Ba oh ba

109
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,540
Look how far away

110
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:02,020
away to heaven.

111
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:58,520

112
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:02,020

To be continued...

130
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,240
by the conspiracy.

131
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:03,200
We were saying that we'd never see Palpatine on television

132
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,980
or read about him in the news.

133
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,660
No, for all we know, he could be like Karl Rove.

134
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,920
He could be Scott McClellan.

135
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:11,460
He could be...

136
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,080
Yeah, I mean, Bush is more like those little Chinese,

137
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:20,980
those obsequious followers of Palpatine,

138
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,440
the little Chinese acting aliens.

139
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:24,880
Oh, yeah.

140
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:27,620
You know which ones I mean with the very flat faces

141
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,440
and they wore Chinese-looking clothing?

142
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,560
The Trade Federation?

143
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,160
Yeah, and they even spoke in a kind of an odd Chinese-ish accent.

144
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:38,240
Yeah, that really blew me away, actually.

145
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,980
Like how blatantly...

146
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,120
Like, I don't know, what a blatantly racist Chinese stereotype

147
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,540
or caricature that was.

148
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,160
Didn't Lucas get in trouble for Jar Jar Binks?

149
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,860
Oh, Jar Jar...

150
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:52,600
Mesa...

151
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,280
Mesa Jar Jar Binks!

152
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,920
Ooh, yeah, Mesa...

153
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,500
We're trying to forget that one.

154
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:02,400
In order to ensure the security and continuing stability,

155
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:11,800
the Republic will be reorganized into the first galactic empire

156
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:18,780
for a safe and secure society.

157
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:30,580
So this is how liberty dies.

158
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,380
With thunderous applause.

159
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,180
The war is over.

160
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:41,740
Lord Sidious promised us peace.

161
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,520
We only want...

162
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,280
The Secret Service wouldn't let me get close enough to do any teabagging.

163
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,580
The Secret Service let me get close enough to Nancy Reagan

164
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,780
to be within slingshot distance.

165
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:55,700
Oh, man.

166
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
The good old days.

167
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:57,920
Hours...

168
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,940
Or maybe four or five hours earlier,

169
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,580
before I was inside the Republican convention as a reporter,

170
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,860
looking at Nancy Reagan,

171
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:11,360
I was on the stage of the Rock Against Reagan Yippie rally outside.

172
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,500
Wow.

173
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,180
Rock Against Reagan Yippies?

174
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,100
Opening for the dead Kennedys.

175
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,820
I didn't even know who they were.

176
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:17,380
Wow.

177
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,100
Maybe who we were.

178
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,400
We were famous in the 80s.

179
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,100
Wow.

180
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,140
Briefly.

181
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,420
Secretly famous.

182
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:25,600
Anyway, yeah, that was pretty weird.

183
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,580
When we...

184
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,620
When we got off the...

185
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:32,640
I said a bunch of stuff against the Republicans and the Democrats and the commies

186
00:12:32,640 --> 00:12:35,340
and the aliens and everybody else.

187
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,340
And then we got off stage.

188
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,760
As I walked to my car, we were being followed and photographed by guys in suits.

189
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,540
And, of course, there were cops on horseback here and there

190
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,020
just kind of keeping order, I guess, and making their presence known.

191
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,620
Did you smile and wave to them?

192
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:55,500
I went home, changed my clothes, and joined my mom, who is a Republican delegate.

193
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,560
And...

194
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,920
I was a reporter for the Austin Chronicle, and we both walked in.

195
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,620
My Bob button set off the metal detectors.

196
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,040
So you have a background in journalism.

197
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,400
Not much of one.

198
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:13,420
I just wrote a few things for different magazines in the 80s.

199
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:22,840
I got to where I really try to avoid having any kind of real job, and I only serve Bob.

200
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,900
Once more.

201
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,340
The Sith will rule the galaxy.

202
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:39,360
We are the hands of America

203
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,880
Making our country strong

204
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,520
We are the heart of America

205
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:50,080
Singing a marching song

206
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,380
The rise of Benziacs of menace

207
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,540
Who America is

208
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,440
And life and love

209
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:03,080
We are Americans

210
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,980
Drummer, plumber, soda jerk

211
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,120
Strike up the band

212
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:09,740
We are Americans

213
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,580
Stoker, broker, barber, clerk

214
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,740
United we stand

215
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,960
We're a voting population

216
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:17,820
A free and equal nation

217
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:19,980
Where freedom rings for our community

218
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:22,500
Freedom from war and freedom from fear

219
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:25,100
Who fights the battles for the free?

220
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,520
The common man is the king of the free

221
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:26,740
The common man reaches

222
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:29,640
Teacher, engineer, driller, miller, financier

223
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:31,400
Who wins the final victory?

224
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,020
The common man

225
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:35,840
Common man with common sense

226
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,820
Our poor fathers did it

227
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,080
Liberty's life

228
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,560
With love and faith and fight

229
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,480
We will spread it

230
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,700
Strong in the right

231
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,760
Never to weaken

232
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,360
The king of the king

233
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:49,840
Fight

234
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:51,300
Fight

235
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:53,200
Fight

236
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:53,920
Fight

237
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,800
Fight

238
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,580
Fight

239
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,860
Fight

240
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:09,660
Fight

241
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,360
Fight

242
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:11,920
Fight

243
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,960
Fight

244
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:14,940
Fight

245
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,440
Fight

246
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:15,720
Fight

247
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:15,940
Fight

248
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,440
You're on the air.

249
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:23,120
I, uh, I was just wondering what the actual topping was because the radio waves got destroyed while I was talking.

250
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,720
Because Stang said it would be really exciting.

251
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:27,700
What, what, what, what?

252
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:33,860
For the topping, you have your choice of, uh, a variety of, uh, fruit-flavored preserves.

253
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:34,760
Fruit flurbs?

254
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,580
That's right.

255
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:40,000
Um, you also have your choice of, uh, actually there are no toppings.

256
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,300
There's no toppings?

257
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:41,860
No.

258
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,480
Oh, crikey.

259
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,500
No.

260
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,160
Oh, blisters on the sore, on the sore back.

261
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,360
The topping was the impending war of the worlds, which is happening out at Brushwood Campground.

262
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,720
But the Martians aren't involved in this one.

263
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,740
It's just the exes, right?

264
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,300
Or is it the Martians again?

265
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,040
Hmm.

266
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,920
I think the Martians are like a servitor race of the exes.

267
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,700
Well, they do their job, that's for sure, on this planet.

268
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,720
Screwed the place up pretty good.

269
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,380
Made it ready to go.

270
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,360
And convinced everybody that...

271
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:15,200
It wasn't them.

272
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:16,460
Yep.

273
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,380
That's the oldest trick in the book.

274
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,140
Yep.

275
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,720
That's what all those, like, type of power types always do.

276
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:25,100
They do something horrendous and then they point at the person next to them.

277
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,540
They go to great lengths to avoid, uh, being known.

278
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,060
Huh?

279
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,300
They go to great lengths to avoid being, uh, known.

280
00:16:31,540 --> 00:16:32,920
They, uh, they cover up their...

281
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,840
They cover their tracks pretty well, you know?

282
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,380
They don't want you to know they exist.

283
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:39,020
And their tracks are slimy, too, like a slug's trail.

284
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:39,400
That's right.

285
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,260
That's the only way you can pick them up is with that slime trail.

286
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:44,100
Yep.

287
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,880
It doesn't matter, though, if you carry a big salt shaker with you.

288
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:47,140
They're...

289
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,180
They're not quite slug-like enough...

290
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,100
Yeah.

291
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:54,360
...to be killed by such a primitive technique.

292
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,360
Well, even if you try to kill them with such a primitive technique,

293
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:01,220
they do have certain things underwritten into their corpus...

294
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,860
their body, you know, thing where they can't be exposed.

295
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,440
I wish I could hear the rest of the conversation.

296
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,080
You sound so clear and yet you can't hear a damn thing, can you?

297
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,200
Well, there...

298
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,420
I have that, uh, that gasp...

299
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,260
...power generator providing electricity

300
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,940
because the conspiracy, you know, won't help us.

301
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:20,000
Hmm.

302
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,720
And I can barely hear over the gaspower generator.

303
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,140
When that thing...

304
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,160
When we run out of gas,

305
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:29,100
I'm gonna have to put old Bessie and old Bossy to work peddling it,

306
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,720
except that I already sold them.

307
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,900
So it's gonna be me peddling.

308
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,300
I won't be able to continue too much longer.

309
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:37,580
That's why I can barely hear.

310
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,000
Also, the ear on this side is going out.

311
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,980
The ear on this side of your head?

312
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:43,600
Or the ear on this side of the world?

313
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,480
Or, you know, I mean...

314
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,100
The ear on this side, are we speaking in a political spectrum sense?

315
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,220
I...

316
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,660
I'm all over the...

317
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:54,300
I'm all over the place and yet kind of only half there at all.

318
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,000
So only half of some supposed ear is half somewhere else.

319
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,180
That's the way it feels anyway.

320
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:02,840
Well...

321
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,920
Who knows how it truly is?

322
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,360
That...

323
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,840
And isn't that the ultimate question?

324
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:08,520
How is it, really?

325
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,520
What condition is your condition truly in?

326
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,300
Wouldn't you like to know?

327
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:13,940
I'm holding one of those really holograms.

328
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,980
Like they say now, everybody in the string theory is like,

329
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,620
Hey man, I'm a hologram.

330
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,760
You know, like from God and stuff.

331
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,220
And I'm here to screw up.

332
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,060
And, you know...

333
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,000
I don't get it.

334
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,000
How come we're holograms?

335
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,680
I just love all those...

336
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,340
Not a very high resolution hologram.

337
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:33,120
I just love all those space cadet people who, you know,

338
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,760
they're so spiritual and whatnot.

339
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,280
And they...

340
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,240
You get into a conversation with them and, you know,

341
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,440
question some of the ridiculous things they believe in.

342
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:40,720
And they're like,

343
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,000
Well, didn't you know they've scientifically proven the existence of the soul?

344
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,160
Oh, yes, they have.

345
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,560
They've observed the magical energy field around the body.

346
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:48,240
And blah, blah, blah.

347
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:48,840
That's the soul.

348
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,340
I can prove the existence of a human soul.

349
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:53,880
How so, sir?

350
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,120
Mr. Doctor of...

351
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:55,940
Yeah.

352
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,280
All right.

353
00:18:57,340 --> 00:19:00,380
A human soul could be trapped in a piece of paper.

354
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,000
Well, not just one piece of paper now.

355
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:05,820
Well, mine is trapped...

356
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:06,800
There are a number of documents.

357
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,160
Well, I'm talking about currency.

358
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,180
I'm talking about...

359
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,400
I'm talking about those six, six, six dollar bills.

360
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,460
Yeah, the subgenius soul is a gland,

361
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:17,360
a small, flat, green gland located, ironically enough,

362
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,660
in the bottom of the foot.

363
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,120
I know it sounds like a joke,

364
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:24,160
but that happens to be where soul, spelled S-O-U-L,

365
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,380
is located in the sole of the foot.

366
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,180
S-O-L-E.

367
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:28,960
Ha, ha.

368
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,160
Very funny, but there you have it.

369
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,380
Doesn't the gland have, like, an appearance of, like, a dollar sign?

370
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:37,020
That's where we got the symbol for the dollar sign?

371
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,340
Well, in the nation, there's a pound sign over in Britain.

372
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,380
There's lira signs.

373
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,260
There's all these different...

374
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,360
No, it's not that specific.

375
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:48,620
I mean, it's just a greenish-looking little ugly gland

376
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:51,500
that most, you know, what doesn't even...

377
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:54,560
isn't even noticed by medical science

378
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:58,000
because it doesn't really get sick in any way that hurts the foot.

379
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,980
Well, the ancient Chinese called it the hypohubris.

380
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,760
People try to treat the head

381
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:06,960
when the problem is actually this gland in the foot.

382
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,420
They try to treat your heart, your mind, your feelings, and so forth,

383
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,340
when really, really there's just, you know,

384
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:13,760
there's...

385
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,540
You just...

386
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,360
By the subgenius forbidden science,

387
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,960
even a lowly healer of appliances, say,

388
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,480
would be able to take on a...

389
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,200
would be able to heal soul problems

390
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,900
simply by being able to locate them.

391
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,640
And that's why a good foot rub feels so incredibly good.

392
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,960
You know the saying.

393
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:35,660
And why your feet smell so horribly bad.

394
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:36,820
That's where your soul is.

395
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:37,320
Yeah.

396
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,280
And your soul, friend, needs washing.

397
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,320
Your soul needs to be washed

398
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,080
in the...

399
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,600
I mean, in the spit,

400
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,060
in the fluid,

401
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:49,640
the love of Bob.

402
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,900
Your soul...

403
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,020
Think of it like it is sherry.

404
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,280
...must be cleansed.

405
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

406
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:57,240
You are cleansed.

407
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:01,120
You can wash the slacklessness away,

408
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,980
but Bob has to know

409
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,920
that you trust him.

410
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:08,240
Well...

411
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,540
You know, to a certain length,

412
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:12,880
you can trust him.

413
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,020
Only...

414
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:15,680
Only in the same way that you trust your doctor.

415
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,200
Why do you trust your doctor?

416
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,700
Because you know him?

417
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,500
No, you don't know him.

418
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,240
Because he gave you a big bill.

419
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,880
And the insurance company paid some of it.

420
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,020
Or you had to pay it.

421
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,640
Or you're fleeing from it.

422
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,280
Whatever.

423
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,680
Or he gives you pills.

424
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:32,940
That's how the medicine men of our society have their power.

425
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,860
They present the huge bill.

426
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,940
In another culture,

427
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,020
the medicine man might display his power

428
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,900
by showing a huge whatever.

429
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,000
But in our culture,

430
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:45,900
it's a huge bill for money.

431
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,520
That's just the way it goes.

432
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,740
We do worship the dollar here in America.

433
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,280
I mean, think of the titty and the phallic cultures.

434
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,020
Worshipping their things.

435
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:57,780
No, you don't worship the dollar per se.

436
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,880
You worship the power

437
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,360
and the ego gratification

438
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,280
that that dollar will buy you.

439
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,940
Well, all that money is,

440
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,440
it's just a measurement of work.

441
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,000
Yeah.

442
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,040
Yeah, you sound like a Marxist buddy.

443
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:11,600
I mean, you know,

444
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,060
as a measure of labor and so forth.

445
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:13,780
Yeah, perhaps.

446
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,040
Economists today,

447
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,360
I think they define it as a medium of exchange.

448
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:19,640
Like spittle.

449
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,280
Kind of like language is a medium of communication.

450
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,200
Money is a medium of exchange.

451
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,460
Jeez, they've changed commerce into a fornication art.

452
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,680
Well, it always has been.

453
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:31,540
Don't even get started on the conjugation.

454
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,040
Well, it does it by itself, doesn't it?

455
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:37,140
I mean, it's mathematical.

456
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,360
It has no choice.

457
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,460
Unless it wants to slack off.

458
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,880
These are the great mysteries.

459
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,480
Well, I don't know why that gland

460
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,000
can't just simply be removed.

461
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,700
You know, if it's causing so much pain to the humans,

462
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,700
like, oh, my soul is in agony.

463
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,560
You know, have you been walking around Public Square

464
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,200
too long with your toe sticking out of your shoe?

465
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:04,420
You know, what could be an agony that doesn't exist?

466
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,580
It must be a gland.

467
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,980
Well, Jesus and Magdalene were all about

468
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:09,120
an anointing of the feet.

469
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,520
Yep.

470
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,660
That's what they were all about.

471
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,080
I mean, as far as we know,

472
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:18,000
we don't know their beliefs about the Iraq conflict

473
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,520
or, you know, abortion.

474
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:21,300
We know they liked feet.

475
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:24,580
Jesus was a foot fetish.

476
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,980
Well, we have to have them

477
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,780
as our Lord and Master bless you.

478
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:31,400
But Bob worships the actual gland

479
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,920
that makes sign of the currency.

480
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,260
Bob worships nothing.

481
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,760
Well, no, that's right.

482
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,460
He doesn't really worship anything.

483
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,320
Or he does worship nothing.

484
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:42,140
Which is it?

485
00:23:42,620 --> 00:23:43,060
Hmm.

486
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,420
Those are different, you know.

487
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,860
Bob's a nihilist.

488
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,940
Yeah, if you worship, you could worship nothing.

489
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,100
And then you'd be a nihilist.

490
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,940
You could not anything.

491
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,380
You'd just be like, you know, one of the non-conjugating,

492
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:54,020
14-year-olds.

493
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,040
You could worship the concept of nothing.

494
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:57,920
Hmm.

495
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,040
Or you could just worship nothing at all.

496
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:01,160
The void.

497
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:01,640
The void.

498
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,540
You're fulfilling your destiny.

499
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,400
Become my apprentice.

500
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:11,480
Learn.

501
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,660
Learn to use the dark side of the Force.

502
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:21,420
I will do whatever you ask.

503
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:24,920
Good.

504
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:36,440
To cheat death is a power only one has achieved.

505
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,400
But if we work together,

506
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:43,620
I know we can discover the secret.

507
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,720
I pledge myself to your teachings.

508
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,360
Good.

509
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:55,760
Good.

510
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:04,880
Henceforth, you shall be known as Darth...

511
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,020
Mom?

512
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,160
Yeah.

513
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:23,820
I swear I'll die soon once again.

514
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,140
I will have mediums,inverse maidens.

515
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:28,280
Looks like an ocean battle isences,

516
00:25:28,280 --> 00:25:33,480
human ہ coincidences have begun.

517
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:34,140
Merry Christmas, towards Christmas,

518
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:39,280
Bora's on a boat under waiting.

519
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:39,380
Thank you, my master.

520
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:40,020
She was packed.

521
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:45,360
She also did a one-woman comedy show called God Said Ha.

522
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:49,000
Yeah, well, well, she's doing another thing now.

523
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:54,020
And I don't remember the name exactly, but it was something like Letting Go of God.

524
00:25:54,940 --> 00:26:00,120
And she was talking on the radio today, this is on This American Life on NPR.

525
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:05,440
They said she basically told her whole story of how she stopped believing in God

526
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:11,100
and all the crises she had to go through trying to cope with the fact that people just die,

527
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:17,580
having to cope with the fact that, well, actually having to stop and think as to what makes murder still wrong,

528
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,680
even though God has nothing to do with it.

529
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,780
It was so funny hearing somebody going through this.

530
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,120
Okay, now here's the thing.

531
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:32,580
A lot of Christians in this country have something of a persecution complex.

532
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,420
Catholics have a huge persecution complex.

533
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,800
A persecution complex dating back to the old days of Protestant supremacy and all that,

534
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,800
when people didn't trust them because they seemed foreign.

535
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:48,700
But then you also have, like evangelical Christians, a lot of them have a persecution complex too.

536
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,080
They have this belief that the secular humanist agenda,

537
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,960
which is really playing into the hands of Satan,

538
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,300
has been going to all these great lengths to take God out of everything

539
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,900
and to silence the voices of the believers.

540
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,740
They seem to have this belief.

541
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:04,780
Some of them do.

542
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:10,420
But they don't believe in Christ because they want to go beating the hell out of everybody for their oil and stuff.

543
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,400
Well, the reason...

544
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,240
You know, they're not real Christians.

545
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:13,880
They're like...

546
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:14,660
Well, sure they are.

547
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:16,520
I mean, I don't know.

548
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,720
Well, okay, I mean, even according to the book of Revelation,

549
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:25,120
only like 140-some thousand people will be saved when the rapture finally comes.

550
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:29,920
According to Revelation, there's only going to be like 100,000 people saved.

551
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,480
The rest of us all burn.

552
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,840
Here's an interesting statistic.

553
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,700
At any given time,

554
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:39,140
there are 140,000 people flying around in airplanes.

555
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:46,200
So what if one day all those people just flying around on airplanes just came,

556
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,880
they landed on a deserted earth?

557
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,720
Interesting.

558
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,440
Nothing but piles of empty clothes all over the ground.

559
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:56,960
Yeah.

560
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:58,340
Taken up.

561
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:58,700
Dust.

562
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:00,840
They'd have to start over again.

563
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,200
Yeah.

564
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,000
That's like the rapture.

565
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,660
Or the rupture.

566
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:06,420
Yeah.

567
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,600
Well, you think of it this way.

568
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,120
You can be saved by grace,

569
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:13,580
or you can be saved by a lunatic in a funny rubber suit,

570
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:19,520
and think of the Church of the Subgenius as your surrogate, you know, rubber suit,

571
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,980
because the evangelicals just don't afford the proper insurance and requirements on the craft.

572
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:30,380
You know, once we start leaving, things are going to get real hairy.

573
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:34,380
I mean, actually, physically, we'll start growing a lot of hair, most of us.

574
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,440
I'm sharpening my razor as we speak.

575
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:39,020
And, well, you can choose not.

576
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,000
That's one of the nice things about old rubber suits staying.

577
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,620
You know, they have that written into it.

578
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,260
They have what written into it?

579
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:50,700
That you don't necessarily have to become hairy if you don't want,

580
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:56,680
but you still have to be either saved by grace or by a guy in a trick potato, or whatever they call it.

581
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:57,960
Hmm.

582
00:28:58,280 --> 00:28:58,560
Hmm.

583
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,080
It's a scary, scary world we live in, isn't it?

584
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:03,760
Yeah.

585
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:11,500
For most people, I mean, I can't see how the average Hunan bean sauce walks around daily and daily,

586
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:17,080
just not caring about these huge, you know, three-ton problems that are falling down everywhere.

587
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,860
Because they don't affect them immediately.

588
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,420
It's the immediate stuff that people worry about.

589
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:27,080
When you feel an immediate threat, that's when you're most likely to do something about it.

590
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,480
You know.

591
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:32,360
Boy, you throw us up along a lot of them cultures that came and went and stuff.

592
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,200
We're pretty stupid, though, when you think about it.

593
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:38,400
Well, nothing really changes, you know, throughout history and prehistory.

594
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,520
We're still the same dumb, dirty apes we've always been.

595
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,880
Except that we learned how to shave the hair.

596
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,820
And we learned how to split the atom.

597
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,140
Not too long after that, actually.

598
00:29:51,440 --> 00:30:01,720
Well, somebody was saying these yetis of the Church of the Subgenius are actually sloth that got, like, smarter than beavers and stopped sharpening their teeth or something.

599
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,360
I mean, I know that sounds ridiculous.

600
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:05,280
Because it is.

601
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:13,480
But about 9,000 years ago, there were, like, giant sloths and, like, you know, temperate zone forest tigers walking.

602
00:30:13,640 --> 00:30:15,080
Sabretooth tigers walking around?

603
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:16,140
Is that true?

604
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,700
Or did you make that up?

605
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:17,740
I'm not sure.

606
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:21,060
I'm not too well-versed on that kind of stuff.

607
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:32,740
And perhaps those were the yeti, these one-ton sloths, which actually, you know, just got tired of everyone in the world eating them, even though they could have eaten everyone else because they were so big.

608
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,680
And lost their...

609
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:39,400
You know, thing with their tooth, like beavers have, of wanting to chew trees or else their head will fall off.

610
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:45,340
So they became yeti, as if they could, and are now.

611
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:47,960
I find it hard to believe.

612
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:51,580
Hey, I'm going to get off this line because I can't hear anything.

613
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,760
I'm going to try a different phone or something.

614
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,800
I'll be calling back.

615
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,920
All right, best of luck to you.

616
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:57,980
Over and out.

617
00:30:58,260 --> 00:30:59,280
All right, over and out.

618
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:03,540
I knew that was happening because you did not talk very many times.

619
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:04,120
Actually, yeah.

620
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,140
Yeah, I could tell that, too.

621
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:15,080
Actually, what I was saying before about the Christian persecution complex, I just don't see how it's justified when you have entire, like, publication industries.

622
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:23,580
You have entire cable channels dedicated to spreading their message, to spreading their beliefs, to proclaiming them.

623
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:33,400
You know, I mean, when 40% of the population identifies itself as born again or evangelical, when, you know, I just think it's so funny that they have this persecution complex.

624
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:37,460
And they have this perception that the media are hostile to them.

625
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:43,140
But if you look in the media, very rarely do you ever see religion actually denounced in the media.

626
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,800
And that's what was so amazing about what I heard this morning.

627
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:56,740
Well, it's a big lie, and that's what you have to deal with first when you deal with any media except for this kind of ridiculous thing that we're doing, is that they always lie.

628
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:59,780
We always do, too, you know, but it's like fun.

629
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,100
Well, ours is a lie in service of the truth.

630
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:03,160
Yeah.

631
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:04,280
Yeah, that's it.

632
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:04,740
Yeah.

633
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:10,460
And theirs is in the service of, like, a big, big fat paycheck that we're never going to see.

634
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,240
Yeah.

635
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:27,200
They give them the script, and they go up there, and they look good, and they sound good, and, you know, I was listening to that guy's talking about Ronald Reagan, Richard Nixon being the greatest president since Abraham Washington, and for the love of Christ, I, you know, it's, yeah.

636
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,360
Who's that one guy on the radio?

637
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,220
I was listening to him today, and he played, like, a clip.

638
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:33,640
Yeah.

639
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:46,580
And Al Gore was saying something like, you know, if it had been Republican judges appointed by a Republican Congress, no one would have accepted the decision of Bush v. Gore in 2000.

640
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:50,960
And then this guy gets on the radio, well, Al Gore's just a little crybaby.

641
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:54,260
You know, somebody needs to call him an ambulance.

642
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,060
Somebody needs to call 911.

643
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:00,140
Yeah, that kind of, you know, drives you nuts there, don't it?

644
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,320
Yeah.

645
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,840
I hate, I hate these.

646
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,060
Straw man argument.

647
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,360
That's what it sounds like to me.

648
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:07,920
You know, they're taking just, like, the most inane things somebody has said on record.

649
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,520
They love to bash liberals.

650
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,700
They love to bash liberals.

651
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:10,880
Oh, no.

652
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,200
Liberal is the ultimate dirty word.

653
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:20,520
And it's so funny because, like, you know, conservative does not have the negative connotations in liberal circles that liberal has in conservative circles.

654
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:23,320
Conservative doesn't even mean conservative anymore.

655
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,300
Well, yeah, well, these terms have all become meaningless.

656
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,480
Yeah, yeah, they're all meaningless.

657
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,000
It depends on when you're talking about classical liberalism or whatever.

658
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,260
216.

659
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:31,700
I don't know if you've seen the rest of the issue.

660
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,380
And you can tell us.

661
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:33,920
You can tell us right now.

662
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,140
If we are broadcasting, we're tired of these taped callers calling in.

663
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:40,260
These ones that puzzling evidence slips in.

664
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,400
There's really a tape caller.

665
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,140
This must be the slash caller.

666
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:44,580
We need the real callers to call in and tell us.

667
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,020
Slash passersby.

668
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,380
Are we on the air?

669
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,920
Travels along the street.

670
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,080
And I'm going to have to go froth.

671
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,740
Curious cultural artifact that we are getting.

672
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:53,740
I'm really getting nervous.

673
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:58,760
And this must be the track of the peen worm made in the sand.

674
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,900
The fresh sand of the literal.

675
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,500
You see the mark.

676
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,180
I'm having an anxiety.

677
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:03,360
I'm having an anxiety.

678
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:03,360


679
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:03,360


680
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:03,360


681
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:03,360


682
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:04,020
An anxiety attack.

683
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,220
Here it is when we catch up with it.

684
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:06,780
Oh my.

685
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:11,440
Shiny black carapace as it burrows through the sand.

686
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:12,520
Terrifying.

687
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:13,320
Oh, I'm so anxious.

688
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:14,160
If we get close up.

689
00:34:14,180 --> 00:34:15,520
As you see here, close up.

690
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:17,040
I really mean it too.

691
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:25,420
Most unprepossessingly, gigantic compound eyes, the three mouth parts or stalks, and the white beard underneath.

692
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,400
All give a very disturbing stop.

693
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,060
The smelting salts.

694
00:34:28,660 --> 00:34:32,240
Yeah, we see a multi-masted ship.

695
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,120
Four-masted ship.

696
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:38,180
And the close up of.

697
00:34:38,180 --> 00:34:39,580
All within real close.

698
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,360
Death Valley subsoil.

699
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,220
Realness of your.

700
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,840
And here is the hanged man.

701
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:49,760
And here, this is your card.

702
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,800
The dead Phoenician sailor.

703
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,460
Look, those are pearls that were his eyes.

704
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,080
Yeah.

705
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:59,300
Think of what might be an actually in NyQuil for the masses.

706
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,520
They could be like stumbling our brains and recapitulating.

707
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,380
Yeah.

708
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,380


709
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,380


710
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,380


711
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,380


712
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:03,380


713
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:08,280
You know, large portions of our MO for medulla oblongata and stuff and taking our corpse close.

714
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,080
I mean, you know, leaving things in there, you know, they just build up over a period of, you know,

715
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:22,080
you build a nano years, perhaps in this case, you know, nano periods of just long enough to start speaking new thoughts where there were none.

716
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:25,380
You know, terrible things are happening in my ashtabula oblongata.

717
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:26,840
God.

718
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:28,060
Yeah, it's polluted.

719
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,860
And the trash gland.

720
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,540
It is your birth that marijuana white trash.

721
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,020
To be.

722
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:33,700
Question.

723
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:34,100
Faith.

724
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:34,680
For us.

725
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,920
Yeah, actually, they can.

726
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:40,200
Here's the news on that Supreme Court ruling that happened early this week.

727
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:44,280
The U.S. Supreme Court in a 63 decision, I think it was.

728
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:44,800
Was it 63?

729
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:52,260
They ruled that the Federal Controlled Substances Act takes precedence over California state laws.

730
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,100
Yeah.

731
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,380
Which make it legal to cultivate marijuana for one's personal medical use.

732
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:00,000
If a doctor gives you permission to.

733
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,320
I love you, big brother.

734
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,200
I love you, big brother.

735
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:01,980
I love you, big brother.

736
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:02,640
I love you, big brother.

737
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,380
Well, here's the funny thing.

738
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:03,740
All right.

739
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:07,620
This ruling is not as simple as a lot of people thought it was.

740
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,080
A lot of people think they were ruling on the controversial controversial issue of medical marijuana, but they weren't.

741
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:18,540
What the Supreme Court really ruled on was a legal issue of what takes precedence, state law or federal law.

742
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:18,840
Yeah.

743
00:36:19,720 --> 00:36:27,520
And if if the Supreme Court snuck it in there because actually they couldn't test it on any of the grounds because it was too stupid.

744
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,560
And they came up with the species.

745
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:29,840
Yeah.

746
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,380
I'm working with a little old lady.

747
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:31,840
My daughter.

748
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:32,620
Well, here's.

749
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,080
Or why?

750
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,840
You know, actually, no, this this the ruling had nothing to do with the war on drugs.

751
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,600
I mean, it was totally not a drug related ruling.

752
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,560
Not at all.

753
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,640
The ruling they made had nothing to do with drugs.

754
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:42,880
Yes.

755
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:48,400
But if you're in California or Arizona and go get out of my house, you know, I have a disease and a prescription.

756
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:50,940
They'll say, well, we can still put you in federal prison.

757
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:51,680
No, they can't.

758
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,820
Only the feds can do that.

759
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:53,240
Why?

760
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
The feds can bust you.

761
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:56,360
State law enforcement.

762
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,760
They bust people for pot now.

763
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,480
State law.

764
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,720
When they really have to focus more of their efforts on destroying meth labs.

765
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,000
Meth is destroying this country.

766
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:07,100
Oh, meth is not destroying the country.

767
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,560
Come on.

768
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,180
Meth is.

769
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:09,680
Meth is.

770
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,420
There is an epidemic of meth usage.

771
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:13,420
But the reasons for that.

772
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,100
No, no.

773
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:15,860
Meth is not what's destroying this country.

774
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:20,320
Meth epidemics are a symptom, not a not a cause.

775
00:37:23,620 --> 00:37:24,560
Oxi-contin abuse.

776
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:27,340
This is this is a symptom, not a cause.

777
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,380
All right.

778
00:37:28,380 --> 00:37:31,500
People turn to drugs for various reasons.

779
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:32,700
But it's usually because.

780
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,880
They're not happy enough without the drugs.

781
00:37:35,000 --> 00:37:36,540
They think they'll be happier with the drugs.

782
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,600
The structure of pain.

783
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:38,440
Which often they are.

784
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:40,220
It's like the fountain of age.

785
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,640
It's not the drugs that are destroying our society.

786
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,340
All right.

787
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,580
It's the stuff that leads to people taking drugs.

788
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:49,840
You know, drug abuse is a symptom.

789
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,480
America will never think in terms of this spiral.

790
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:59,320
You get caught in this in this loop of of like never having good enough material possessions.

791
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,800
And you end up in a little cracker box.

792
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,540
See?

793
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,940
See, the same could be said.

794
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,960
The same could be said about about anything.

795
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,440
Yeah.

796
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,600
You know, it's not so clearly it's it's ridiculous to say that meth is destroying the country.

797
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,020
What flavor under.

798
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,620
Black is destroying this country.

799
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,840
Do these do these people in power where?

800
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:19,900
That's the question we have to ask when they're coming up with this stuff.

801
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:24,960
Essentially, you know, like Foucault or Ludovico Vico would say they're essentially trying to control.

802
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:28,500
They view it as their job, even though they tell us the opposite.

803
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:32,120
That is their job to control our every.

804
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,320
Movement and behavior and thing.

805
00:38:34,460 --> 00:38:35,380
Well, actually, this is.

806
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,340
Sexuality.

807
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:36,960
What you think.

808
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,240
What you read.

809
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,060
What you.

810
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,120
Very good.

811
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:40,580
Very good.

812
00:38:40,600 --> 00:38:42,120
Dave, you seem to have made the connection.

813
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:46,480
You see, this is this is what the Republican Party platform is really about when it comes to domestic issues.

814
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:50,260
Well, they claim we want to grow up to be just like them.

815
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,840
I mean, they claim to be in favor of, you know, life.

816
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:55,840
We're pro life and we're pro freedom.

817
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,700
You know, this is what the GOP keeps on saying.

818
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:01,500
But what it really comes down to when you look at their their stances on life and death issues.

819
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:11,760
What it comes down to is they have an agenda of taking the power of life and death away from those who live and die and putting that power into the hands of the state.

820
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:16,640
Yes, they want to say, you know, they want to tell people when to have children.

821
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,800
They want to tell people when not to have children.

822
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,780
They want to tell people when to die and when not to die.

823
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:25,140
Yeah, but if they want to have soul live forever, that's correct.

824
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:29,700
All you have to do is be and you have the rights of about a thousand individuals.

825
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,900
Now, isn't that funny?

826
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:36,700
Because once upon a time, a corporation was chartered to do a very specific thing and it was chartered by the state.

827
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,220
And I believe that you still get charges from the state when you incorporate.

828
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:42,100
Yeah, and the state still has a power to evoke your charter.

829
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,000
I gotta re-charter my corporation.

830
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,380
Yeah, you know.

831
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,500
Well, find the correct state, Stang.

832
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:51,240
You're in a state of confusion right now by thinking of good old Uncle Scant.

833
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,780
Scant, Scant, Scant.

834
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,620
He said, not normal. Take their passive to be normal.

835
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:59,920
People need to have their drugs for the rest of your life.

836
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:01,720
More money, more drugs.

837
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,860
Do you have any pills?

838
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,300
Sure.

839
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:03,840
Wrong.

840
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:05,820
Wrong, but acid to get normalized.

841
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:16,780
The

842
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,240
The

843
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,400
The

844
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,320
The

845
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,300
The

846
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:29,300


847
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:29,300


848
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:29,380
The

849
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,380


850
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,380


851
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,380


852
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,380


853
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,380


854
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,380


855
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,380


856
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,380


857
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,380


858
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,380


859
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,380


860
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,380


861
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:29,400
The

862
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,400


863
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,400


864
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:29,400


865
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,000
What's left of your brain?

866
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:36,920
Oh yes, and all your money to the Reverend Hyden Stang.

867
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:38,760
The

868
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:38,760


869
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,080
The

870
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,360
The

871
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:44,880
The

872
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:45,720
The

873
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:45,720


874
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:45,780
The

875
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,160
The

876
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,160


877
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:46,420
The

878
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:46,420


879
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:46,420


880
00:40:46,420 --> 00:40:47,060
The

881
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:47,060


882
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:47,060


883
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:47,420
The

884
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:47,420


885
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:47,420


886
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:47,420


887
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,980
Anyone that flows in your veins

888
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:03,260
From the front of your clouds

889
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,620
Brings slack like rain

890
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,340
Let all control what's left of your brain

891
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:09,940
Oh yes, and all your money to the reverend I've been saying

892
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,480
Embrace the yeti blood

893
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,260
That flows in your veins

894
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:27,900
From the front of your clouds

895
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:30,480
Brings slack like rain

896
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,060
Let all control what's left of your brain

897
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:41,400
Oh yes, and all your money to the reverend I've been saying

898
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:47,940
The El Queso All-Stars, dear friends,

899
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,260
one of my favorite songs.

900
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:53,940
And before that, L'Emeur and Norelle,

901
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,620
which you can get more of at Heavy Confetti.

902
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,840
And much of Dr. Sinister's show

903
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:04,920
with Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

904
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,520
Governor Rock Gnar,

905
00:42:07,740 --> 00:42:09,700
and other callers as follows.

906
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,680
And now, here's a little bit of the story.

907
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,560
I'm going to say something,

908
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:35,340
another word, but you can't say it

909
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:36,060
because it's in the book.

910
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,920
No, now you can, because it's after a while.

911
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:41,340
Let's watch our tongues.

912
00:42:41,980 --> 00:42:44,220
Let's watch our tongues, Rock Gnar.

913
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,300
Don't, uh, don't, don't.

914
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:47,460
Leave the rules setting to me, please.

915
00:42:47,620 --> 00:42:49,100
No, don't tempt the pinks, I'm sorry.

916
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,060
Think of it, yeah, think of it as a form of meditation.

917
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,180
Like people watch the end of their noses.

918
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,640
Look at the, you know, just watch your tongue.

919
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:56,660
Yeah.

920
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:57,880
And if it wags, it's a form of meditation.

921
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:00,060
Too much, there's a dog around trying to get your ass.

922
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:00,920
Ah.

923
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:01,700
Amazing.

924
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:02,780
And you know, that's bull crap.

925
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:03,860
Yeah.

926
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:06,100
In the old days, when they spelled America with a K,

927
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,060
now they have to spell it with two Ks.

928
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,120
Why two Ks?

929
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:11,260
One for each constitutional crisis they create.

930
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:11,660
Oh.

931
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,220
Ever since Ice Cube spelled it wrong,

932
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,620
now everybody wants to spell it wrong.

933
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,300
About the what?

934
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:20,320
Ever since Ice Cube spelled it wrong,

935
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,080
now everybody wants to spell it wrong.

936
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:22,640
Yeah.

937
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:25,920
Well, you know, like, there's a whole bunch of reasons

938
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,740
to spell America with a K, I guess.

939
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,300
I guess it's like a pun on the...

940
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:31,740
Well, that was a popular miniseries.

941
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,200
Like in the early 80s.

942
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:34,620
That was the...

943
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:37,260
ABC had a miniseries.

944
00:43:37,260 --> 00:43:38,820
It was like on for seven nights.

945
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:39,780
America-ka.

946
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:42,220
Yeah, it was America and it was spelled with a K.

947
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:43,020
What was it about?

948
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:46,260
The idea that the communists had taken over America

949
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:50,480
and then everybody in America was living under like a fascist rule.

950
00:43:50,820 --> 00:43:53,840
And gee, how is that any different than how we're living today?

951
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,140
Oh, I can think of a few differences.

952
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,000
Um.

953
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:00,240
See, here's the thing, Rocknar.

954
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:01,020
Here's the thing, Rocknar.

955
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,280
I don't like the shrill tone of the left

956
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,820
when it gets to be shrill.

957
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:08,740
I mean, like, I don't like shrill tones from anybody.

958
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:10,960
I mean, a good old vibrato tone.

959
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:11,780
It makes you...

960
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:12,360
A vibrato.

961
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:13,860
But, you know, what do they call it?

962
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,220
Tenor.

963
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,440
You know, when you speak shrilly,

964
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:16,540
when you speak shrilly,

965
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:18,060
it doesn't just make you sound dumb.

966
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:19,840
It makes your whole cause sound dumb.

967
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:21,040
So when you say that, gosh,

968
00:44:21,080 --> 00:44:22,540
there's not much difference between us

969
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,920
and a communist fascist dictatorship,

970
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:25,280
I mean, that...

971
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,180
Come on.

972
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:26,620
Come on.

973
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,060
Be serious.

974
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,860
If he's very serious,

975
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,840
I'm afraid to say...

976
00:44:30,840 --> 00:44:32,380
I mean, we're going down that...

977
00:44:32,380 --> 00:44:33,920
We've started down the slippery slope.

978
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:35,520
There's no question that we're heading

979
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:36,640
in the wrong direction

980
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,060
and that we could very well end up like that very soon.

981
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:41,220
No, you say that after one rigged election,

982
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:42,260
not after two.

983
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,880
I don't know how rigged the second election was.

984
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,040
How...

985
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:49,860
What kind of rigging have we uncovered

986
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:51,320
in this past election?

987
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,720
Well, in Ohio, they uncovered everything

988
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,980
and nobody in Ohio is allowed to have any idea

989
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:56,840
of whatever happened.

990
00:44:56,920 --> 00:44:57,560
The rigging...

991
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,840
You don't know how to...

992
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,240
We're talking about margins.

993
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:05,160
...of the economy of anything.

994
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:06,560
We're talking about margins

995
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:09,100
in the case of these so-called rigged elections.

996
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:10,160
We're talking about margins

997
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,320
that are a fraction of the final margin of victory.

998
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:15,840
We're talking about maybe 10,000 votes

999
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:17,900
that are questionable in all of Ohio.

1000
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:18,680
No, I don't think that.

1001
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:20,260
And Bush won by over 100,000 votes.

1002
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,020
I mean, I...

1003
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:22,320
That's kind of spooky.

1004
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,260
I cannot say my trusting friend,

1005
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:24,920
I believe that,

1006
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,620
because I listen to media

1007
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,540
from different countries,

1008
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:29,620
and they have these strange stories.

1009
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:31,200
And do they have, do they have, like,

1010
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,320
do they have spies planted

1011
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,780
in our county boards of elections here?

1012
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1013
00:45:35,880 --> 00:45:38,600
This has to do with the computer votes

1014
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:39,280
and so forth,

1015
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,300
the addition of votes

1016
00:45:40,300 --> 00:45:41,960
and what is and isn't reported.

1017
00:45:46,460 --> 00:45:47,600
In a prayer.

1018
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:49,860
You can throw in 14,000,

1019
00:45:49,860 --> 00:45:50,700
you know, ultimately,

1020
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:52,820
that's how they did that.

1021
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,260
And they did it in a couple other states.

1022
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,120
You could put most of the focus on Ohio,

1023
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,220
but you gotta remember...

1024
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:57,460
Wait.

1025
00:45:57,540 --> 00:45:57,820
Wait a second.

1026
00:45:57,840 --> 00:45:58,080
In circumstances,

1027
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,020
Blackwell was still the guy

1028
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,320
conducting investigation

1029
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:03,400
just like what your name in Florida was,

1030
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:03,780
you know?

1031
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:04,780
Yeah, it's just that, like,

1032
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:05,500
in a lot of...

1033
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,900
Man, okay.

1034
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,140
Thank you for your call, sir.

1035
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,480
I didn't mean it.

1036
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:12,400
She was a commuter.

1037
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:14,160
What I mean to say is that, like,

1038
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:16,380
there are enough,

1039
00:46:16,420 --> 00:46:17,520
there's enough local control

1040
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,240
in enough counties across the country

1041
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:20,780
by people who are,

1042
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:22,360
I don't know, I mean, like,

1043
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,760
there's so many people involved

1044
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:25,040
in this process,

1045
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:25,840
it would be very hard

1046
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,280
to make a huge conspiracy like that.

1047
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:28,340
I just, you know,

1048
00:46:28,340 --> 00:46:29,540
I have no real hard evidence

1049
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,080
that, uh,

1050
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,100
I've seen no real hard evidence

1051
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,940
that there was a serious fraud going on.

1052
00:46:35,020 --> 00:46:36,340
I mean, I can, I know that there was

1053
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,380
some minor fraud here and there,

1054
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,720
and that's every bit as serious

1055
00:46:38,720 --> 00:46:39,900
as the major fraud, mind you.

1056
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,640
Because the result, the goal, is the same.

1057
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,100
How do we even know that the numbers

1058
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,360
that are being reported

1059
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,780
about how many people voted for X candidate

1060
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:47,700
Well, you know, that's been true.

1061
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:48,440
and how many voted for Y,

1062
00:46:48,620 --> 00:46:49,540
how do we even know

1063
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,820
that those numbers are even right?

1064
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,360
Well, how did we ever,

1065
00:46:52,480 --> 00:46:53,880
how did we ever know

1066
00:46:53,880 --> 00:46:54,620
that any of those numbers

1067
00:46:54,620 --> 00:46:55,440
were ever right

1068
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,480
in all of recorded history?

1069
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:57,180
I mean, I mean,

1070
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,360
if you raise that question,

1071
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,040
if you say that,

1072
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:00,040
how do we know that any of these numbers

1073
00:47:00,040 --> 00:47:00,620
are right at all?

1074
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:01,980
Well, then, I mean,

1075
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,020
then that's all of democracy

1076
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,360
right there out the window.

1077
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,700
Because we, how do we know?

1078
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,340
All governments and administrations,

1079
00:47:07,340 --> 00:47:09,500
but figures and factions and so forth,

1080
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,900
they all create their own spin

1081
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:12,740
on what's coming out

1082
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:13,540
to make them look like

1083
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,620
they're doing their jobs real good.

1084
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:15,620
Because I know I accidentally

1085
00:47:15,620 --> 00:47:17,100
worked for the government for a while,

1086
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,320
and you push a lot of paper around,

1087
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,520
you know, trying to get people jobs

1088
00:47:20,520 --> 00:47:22,700
or, you know, get yourself out of a job.

1089
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,640
And you find that

1090
00:47:26,540 --> 00:47:27,260
they lie,

1091
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:27,640
lie a lot.

1092
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:29,520
But it's when they start lying

1093
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,200
really, really weird

1094
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,280
and really, really,

1095
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,260
that's when you got to worry.

1096
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:34,260
And what you got is like,

1097
00:47:34,300 --> 00:47:36,700
America is being lied to real hard.

1098
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:37,920
And they're thinking

1099
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:38,740
it's just the same

1100
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:39,800
as one of those regular lies.

1101
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,980
See, America's being lied to

1102
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:42,500
so well, so effectively,

1103
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,940
that I don't think that vote fraud

1104
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,080
is necessary anymore.

1105
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:45,700
I think,

1106
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:48,480
and that may sound funny,

1107
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:49,480
but it's actually dead serious.

1108
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,140
I think that it's much more effective

1109
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,360
these days and much safer

1110
00:47:52,360 --> 00:47:53,920
when you consider the legal risks

1111
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:54,800
involved for the people

1112
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,800
who are engaging in supposed

1113
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,060
fraud.

1114
00:47:57,400 --> 00:47:58,920
I mean, no, it's much easier,

1115
00:47:59,060 --> 00:47:59,900
much safer,

1116
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,360
much more effective

1117
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,200
to basically fool the public,

1118
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:05,400
to pull the wool over their eyes.

1119
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:08,600
Excellent.

1120
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:12,640
No.

1121
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:13,380
Yes.

1122
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,260
No problemo.

1123
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:25,560
Trust me.

1124
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:38,480
Trust me.

1125
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:40,660
Trust me.

1126
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:40,780


1127
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:44,840
I trust you.

1128
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:47,600
Trust me.

1129
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,260
Trust me.

1130
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:54,200
From PR News in Washington,

1131
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:55,640
I'm primarily to blame

1132
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:56,220
for regarding 데ầ description of At The Ripple fad.

1133
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:56,780
are to blame for that refinery's

1134
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,840
blast. The Ministry of Emergency

1135
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,940
Situations says PR News

1136
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,700
treats prisoners humanely and

1137
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:04,420
continues to be a leader in torture.

1138
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:06,520
On Wall Street 37

1139
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,260
1066 1212

1140
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,280
supporters say this is PR.

1141
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,720
A federal judge has killed 15

1142
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,760
people and injured PR News

1143
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:15,380
in Washington.

1144
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,380
You've got

1145
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:20,640
all the things, all

1146
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:22,880
of them, in all the right

1147
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,840
places. Oh yeah!

1148
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:28,760
Yes, indeed.

1149
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:32,080
Wow.

1150
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:36,220
Oh yeah.

1151
00:49:36,460 --> 00:49:38,520
All the sub-home

1152
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:39,160
victories.

1153
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:39,860
Crazy French

1154
00:49:39,860 --> 00:49:40,060
people.

1155
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:45,360
Dogs like

1156
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:46,140
graffitis.

1157
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,380
Strange evidence of subgenius

1158
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,500
conspiracy or harmless

1159
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:52,320
fun.

1160
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,000
What the show?

1161
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,400
Dogs like graffitis.

1162
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,720
Did you see that movie

1163
00:49:58,720 --> 00:49:59,600
Constantine?

1164
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:02,580
Does it have shooting in it?

1165
00:50:02,740 --> 00:50:04,400
It's got Keanu Reeves in it.

1166
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,680
I want some shooting.

1167
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:07,240
He's got a gun.

1168
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:10,160
He goes to hell or something.

1169
00:50:10,260 --> 00:50:11,200
He fights devils.

1170
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,620
He does something like

1171
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:13,400
the plot.

1172
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:14,460
No.

1173
00:50:17,700 --> 00:50:18,600
I've not seen

1174
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:19,700
Constantine yet.

1175
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:20,480
I haven't either.

1176
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,040
I don't know.

1177
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,160
I don't know, folks.

1178
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:31,600
I don't know.

1179
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:32,240
I don't know.

1180
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,240


1181
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,240


1182
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,240


1183
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,240


1184
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,240


1185
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,240


1186
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,240


1187
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,240


1188
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,240


1189
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,240


1190
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,240


1191
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:32,780
If you don't know,

1192
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:34,660
please call 848-4425

1193
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:35,800
right now.

1194
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,460
Well, I did.

1195
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,340
Look at that little

1196
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:37,720
special...

1197
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,700
That's cool.

1198
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,060
We need the people

1199
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:41,060
that don't know what it's called.

1200
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:41,560
You know.

1201
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:42,140
It's obvious you know.

1202
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,580
Green onion style rock song

1203
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:44,880
with shotguns?

1204
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:45,140
Yeah.

1205
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:47,060
It's shotgun brothers.

1206
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:47,780
No.

1207
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:49,500
It's not what you know.

1208
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:50,380
It's how you know it.

1209
00:50:50,800 --> 00:50:51,540
And who you know.

1210
00:50:51,540 --> 00:50:52,200
It's who you know.

1211
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,540
It's not where you know.

1212
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:55,820
It's when you know it.

1213
00:50:55,940 --> 00:50:57,200
Get me in a jean.

1214
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:58,120
Oh, let it go.

1215
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:58,620
Get in there.

1216
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:00,760
From PR News in Washington,

1217
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,940
I'm barred from the ministry

1218
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:02,860
and defrocked.

1219
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,160
President Bush delivers

1220
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:06,020
about 1.4 million children

1221
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:06,960
this morning at the

1222
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,800
U.S. Naval Academy,

1223
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,600
which he says is not finished.

1224
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,740
The Muslim holy book

1225
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:11,640
involved toilets.

1226
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,980
Personal incomes rose slow.

1227
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:15,260
The Commerce Department

1228
00:51:15,260 --> 00:51:16,360
says seven-tenths.

1229
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:17,360
It said six-tenths,

1230
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:18,060
but nine-tenths.

1231
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,220
It said that reflected

1232
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:21,520
a jump in PR News.

1233
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:21,980
Washington.

1234
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:23,500
Well, you know,

1235
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:24,320
I mean, free speech

1236
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:25,200
can just mean standing,

1237
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,240
you know, I was standing

1238
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:26,860
in line at the bank

1239
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:27,360
the other day,

1240
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:28,720
and this crazy guy

1241
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:29,320
just, like,

1242
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:30,380
stepped out of line, actually.

1243
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:32,120
He was in line at the bank,

1244
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,120
and he stepped out of line,

1245
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,440
and he started going off

1246
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:35,660
on this, like, thing

1247
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,760
that, you know,

1248
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,560
sounded, you know,

1249
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:39,160
sounded kind of schizophrenic.

1250
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:39,800
You know, you couldn't

1251
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:40,440
quite tell what he was

1252
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:40,920
trying to say,

1253
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:41,940
and then he gets to the end

1254
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,260
and he's like,

1255
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:43,840
and what if you could be

1256
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:44,760
given eternal life

1257
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:45,700
by the blood of the lamb

1258
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,180
and blah, blah, blah,

1259
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:48,200
and I'll leave you with that,

1260
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,180
and he gets back in line

1261
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:49,980
like nothing happened.

1262
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:51,340
What a heebie.

1263
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:53,200
These people are everywhere.

1264
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:54,340
They're the sleepers,

1265
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:54,720
you know,

1266
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,460
and they're starting to,

1267
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,860
like, they're sleepwalking,

1268
00:51:56,860 --> 00:51:57,100
basically.

1269
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:57,920
They're sleepwalking

1270
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:58,620
through the day,

1271
00:51:58,680 --> 00:51:59,940
and they jump out

1272
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:00,960
and say these absurd things

1273
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:01,720
and go back to normal

1274
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,460
like nothing happened.

1275
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:03,480
Oh, wait until they do

1276
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,000
what they've been

1277
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:04,960
programmed to do.

1278
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:05,840
They're going to be like

1279
00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:07,040
little Manchurian candidates

1280
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,060
running around.

1281
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:09,220
I stock up on guns

1282
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,020
and ammo now.

1283
00:52:10,240 --> 00:52:11,300
This is my advice

1284
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:12,300
to all of you out there.

1285
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:12,840
Get your...

1286
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:13,580
Particularly ammo.

1287
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:14,640
I...

1288
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:14,980
Really?

1289
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:17,720
You can get a nice AK-47 now.

1290
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:18,200
They're...

1291
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,380
You can get the bigger clips, too.

1292
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:20,960
They're legal now

1293
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:21,400
that the assault

1294
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,220
weapons ban expired.

1295
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:23,500
No, get a Desert Eagle.

1296
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:24,420
These statements do not

1297
00:52:24,420 --> 00:52:25,260
Well, you need one of each.

1298
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:27,480
You can't just have

1299
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:28,140
an assault rifle.

1300
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:29,100
You can't have

1301
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:30,020
just an assault rifle

1302
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:30,920
or just a handgun.

1303
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:31,360
You need to have

1304
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,340
one of each, at least.

1305
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:33,700
Get a 50 caliber.

1306
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:34,560
Actually, you could

1307
00:52:34,560 --> 00:52:36,120
probably get one of those

1308
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:37,980
like Chinese knockoff AKs.

1309
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:38,320
You don't even need

1310
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:38,800
the real thing anymore.

1311
00:52:39,100 --> 00:52:39,780
The opinions expressed here

1312
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:40,520
do not represent...

1313
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:41,440
Oh, we already did

1314
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:41,980
that disclaimer.

1315
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,080
...concentration gap

1316
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:44,380
or the radio station.

1317
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,240
Get a 50 caliber

1318
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,140
Desert Eagle.

1319
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:48,580
It's...

1320
00:52:48,580 --> 00:52:49,260
Action Express.

1321
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:50,600
Everybody...

1322
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:51,220
Oh, no, no, no.

1323
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:51,400


1324
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:53,540
I want a SOCOM.

1325
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:55,240
It's the...

1326
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:55,960
I'd like an RPG.

1327
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:57,980
It's the HK Mark 22,

1328
00:52:58,160 --> 00:52:58,620
I think.

1329
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:00,600
Smith & Wesson.

1330
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:01,600
45 caliber.

1331
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:02,660
Have you guys ever

1332
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:03,360
seen a commercial

1333
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:04,860
for the F-16?

1334
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:06,340
Yes, we have.

1335
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:07,360
It goes

1336
00:53:07,360 --> 00:53:08,020
boing, boing, boing.

1337
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:09,000
I came upon...

1338
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:09,840
I used to work

1339
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:10,720
for a film lab

1340
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:11,180
and they were

1341
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:12,040
throwing out

1342
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:12,740
a bunch of

1343
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:13,740
slightly damaged

1344
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:14,280
commercials

1345
00:53:14,280 --> 00:53:15,580
that they'd made,

1346
00:53:15,680 --> 00:53:16,420
I guess,

1347
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,120
for the government

1348
00:53:17,120 --> 00:53:18,180
or for Lockheed

1349
00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:19,300
or somebody to show

1350
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,820
to heads of state.

1351
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:22,000
You know, it's kind of

1352
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,340
droopy outside right now.

1353
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:23,980
Droopy?

1354
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:25,040
Yeah.

1355
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:25,340
Is it...

1356
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,880
I thought I saw lightning

1357
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:27,440
out the window

1358
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:28,700
out of the corner of my eye.

1359
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,420
Lightning out the window.

1360
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:30,340
That is the lightning

1361
00:53:30,340 --> 00:53:31,460
in your retina, my friend.

1362
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:32,700
That is the light...

1363
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:33,400
the actual lightning

1364
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:34,220
in your brain.

1365
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,340
I just heard

1366
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:36,120
either thunder

1367
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,740
or the Martian invasion

1368
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:38,740
has started.

1369
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,580
I can't believe it.

1370
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:40,100
I can't believe

1371
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:41,140
we're talking about the weather.

1372
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,440
I can't believe

1373
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,360
we're talking about the weather.

1374
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,200
We have nothing better

1375
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:44,760
to talk about.

1376
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,220
Is that it?

1377
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,520
Hey, for the people around...

1378
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:48,340
If it is the Martian invasion,

1379
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,760
this could be really important.

1380
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:50,920
Well, you know, I'm hoping.

1381
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,020
For it, but...

1382
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,020


1383
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:52,660
the smoke weed for that.

1384
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:53,340
The fact is,

1385
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:54,240
we don't have any information

1386
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,440
on the situation,

1387
00:53:56,580 --> 00:53:57,380
so anything we say

1388
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:57,660
is going to be

1389
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,080
pure speculation, basically.

1390
00:53:59,140 --> 00:53:59,500
Well, somebody

1391
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:00,280
will have the smoke weed

1392
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:00,560
for that.

1393
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:02,020
What's that?

1394
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:02,660
Is it the Martian invasion

1395
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:03,900
or is it Deep Colon?

1396
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:05,040
Who's Deep Colon?

1397
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:05,860
Hmm.

1398
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:07,040
It's either both.

1399
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:08,720
Actually, I'm glad

1400
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,900
that I wasn't able

1401
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:10,340
to get on.

1402
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,340
You guys were really

1403
00:54:11,340 --> 00:54:12,200
talking seriously

1404
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,720
about the conspiracy

1405
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:15,520
of the nationalists

1406
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,940
and the governments

1407
00:54:16,940 --> 00:54:18,240
and the corporations.

1408
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:19,360
The old project.

1409
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:20,500
See, I don't even like them.

1410
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:21,080
You don't want

1411
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:21,960
to get me involved

1412
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:22,880
in those conversations

1413
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:25,400
because I really do believe

1414
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:26,800
in the concentration camps

1415
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,360
and so, therefore,

1416
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:29,600
I can only joke

1417
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:30,800
about that kind of stuff.

1418
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:32,500
Now, we all know

1419
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,840
that this guy, Mark Felt,

1420
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:34,680
who just came out

1421
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,580
of hiding,

1422
00:54:35,780 --> 00:54:37,540
he's not the real deep throat.

1423
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:39,820
Stang is the real deep throat.

1424
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,000
Hey, I wouldn't...

1425
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:43,360
He's got a really deep throat.

1426
00:54:43,540 --> 00:54:44,040
...customers

1427
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:45,440
if I wasn't good at it.

1428
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:48,700
Unfortunately,

1429
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:50,020
so many people know

1430
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:50,580
this is true.

1431
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,220
There's your music, Stang,

1432
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:54,680
and here's your F-16 commercial,

1433
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:56,520
and here's...

1434
00:54:57,280 --> 00:54:59,280
And this F-16 reality

1435
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:00,260
world, man.

1436
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,100
Hey, how easy.

1437
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:01,300
No, no, really.

1438
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,240
I'm just saying.

1439
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,720
The F-16,

1440
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,040
this was a commercial

1441
00:55:06,040 --> 00:55:07,820
for the jet fighter,

1442
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:08,640
the F-16.

1443
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:09,180
The jet itself?

1444
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:10,060
It wasn't a commercial

1445
00:55:10,060 --> 00:55:11,540
for a company?

1446
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:12,300
It wasn't a commercial

1447
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,660
for the Air Force?

1448
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,100
It was a film,

1449
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,740
and it was designed...

1450
00:55:15,740 --> 00:55:17,520
If you were the head of state

1451
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,760
or the main general

1452
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:20,620
of the head of state,

1453
00:55:21,080 --> 00:55:23,860
these guys would show you

1454
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:24,980
this 10-minute film,

1455
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:26,380
and it'd make you want to

1456
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,200
buy a bunch of F-16s

1457
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,020
for your Air Force.

1458
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:29,640
Yeah, it's like for

1459
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:31,100
an arms expo.

1460
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:31,800
At the end,

1461
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:33,020
and it was really slick,

1462
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:34,580
it made me want one,

1463
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:36,600
and at the end of it,

1464
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,300
it showed, it said...

1465
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:41,760
Now, this was in the early 70s,

1466
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,300
and this kind of...

1467
00:55:43,300 --> 00:55:44,320
At the end of the commercial,

1468
00:55:44,360 --> 00:55:45,420
there was this roll-by

1469
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:46,780
of the flags

1470
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:47,880
of all the countries

1471
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:48,760
that had purchased

1472
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:50,340
this great new aircraft.

1473
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:51,340
It was like,

1474
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,280
Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran.

1475
00:55:54,620 --> 00:55:56,380
Just an incredible list

1476
00:55:56,380 --> 00:55:56,940
of everybody

1477
00:55:56,940 --> 00:55:58,080
that we have sent.

1478
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,200
Isn't it amazing

1479
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,060
that American companies

1480
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:01,840
are selling these horrible weapons

1481
00:56:01,840 --> 00:56:03,720
to countries we don't trust?

1482
00:56:04,020 --> 00:56:04,860
Well, it's like...

1483
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:06,140
Well, we don't really care about...

1484
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:07,540
You sell them the insanity,

1485
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:09,060
and then you sell them the cure...

1486
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:10,000
You sell them the weapons,

1487
00:56:10,060 --> 00:56:11,660
then they're hooked on the ammo.

1488
00:56:11,760 --> 00:56:13,120
They have to keep coming back

1489
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:13,840
for more ammo.

1490
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:15,440
Because that's...

1491
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,560
Because they're not used to it.

1492
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:17,680
There's just not a lot in there.

1493
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,920
You have a fight with them,

1494
00:56:18,940 --> 00:56:20,120
and they need even more.

1495
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:22,040
It's not a great market.

1496
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:23,540
It's a great market.

1497
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,560
You know, you buy this part,

1498
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:26,700
you buy this thing and stuff,

1499
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:27,400
but you're going to need

1500
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:28,660
a lot of ammo forever.

1501
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,700
Of course everybody

1502
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:31,660
needs a lot of ammo.

1503
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:32,440
How many of you

1504
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,540
have to have ammo?

1505
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:34,220
All you need.

1506
00:56:34,820 --> 00:56:36,260
It's like with our religion.

1507
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,960
First, we sell them the insanity,

1508
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:39,360
and then we sell them the cure.

1509
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:40,720
In perpetuity.

1510
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:41,560
Yeah.

1511
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,680
As I already said,

1512
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:43,040
legally,

1513
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:44,100
in perpetuity,

1514
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:44,760
and everything.

1515
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,100
I don't know.

1516
00:56:46,260 --> 00:56:47,060
Forever and ever.

1517
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:47,620
Yep.

1518
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:49,380
The Senate Finance Committee

1519
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,320
and the Department of Health

1520
00:56:50,340 --> 00:56:51,100
and Human Services,

1521
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,300
their mission is

1522
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:53,580
putting an obstetrician

1523
00:56:53,580 --> 00:56:54,620
up on a slideshow.

1524
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:55,720
He is being fired

1525
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:56,500
due to harassment

1526
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,740
and intimidation.

1527
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:59,300
Part of the National Institutes

1528
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:00,160
of Sloppy Science

1529
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,420
bending the pressure

1530
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:02,800
from sloppy sexual right

1531
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,500
to lifers

1532
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,740
suffering from AIDS.

1533
00:57:04,960 --> 00:57:05,840
All in the name

1534
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:07,200
of scientific terrorism.

1535
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:09,060
And numerous drug companies

1536
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:09,640
and researchers,

1537
00:57:09,900 --> 00:57:11,200
they are afraid to speak up.

1538
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:11,980
Documents obtained

1539
00:57:11,980 --> 00:57:13,120
by the Associated Press

1540
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:14,340
show that the U.S. government

1541
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:16,100
ridiculed and discredited

1542
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,160
their own frequent

1543
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:18,100
sexual financing.

1544
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:21,140
So, folks.

1545
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,120
It's a rough old world.

1546
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:25,460
It's a rough old world

1547
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,300
when we don't have

1548
00:57:27,300 --> 00:57:27,980
the air conditioning

1549
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,260
or the hot running water.

1550
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:31,280
Because the water

1551
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:32,220
always runs dry.

1552
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,020
Sooner or later,

1553
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,640
it's all going to run dry.

1554
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,940
Expect no less.

1555
00:57:38,380 --> 00:57:39,740
Just like those glands

1556
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,240
in our feet are salt.

1557
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:42,420
Sooner or later,

1558
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,960
everything comes apart

1559
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,360
one way or another,

1560
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:47,220
Bob said.

1561
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,480
And perhaps...

1562
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:00,780
Now, whose law of motion

1563
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:01,220
is that?

1564
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:03,320
Uh, Fudd.

1565
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:03,900
The second one?

1566
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:04,940
Wasn't that Fudd's law?

1567
00:58:05,180 --> 00:58:05,700
Fudd's law?

1568
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:06,580
Elmer Fudd's law?

1569
00:58:06,820 --> 00:58:07,700
No, no, no.

1570
00:58:07,780 --> 00:58:08,820
I can't remember

1571
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:09,460
the guy's name.

1572
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:09,980
The famous...

1573
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:11,300
Swimish.

1574
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:12,380
Scientist.

1575
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:14,120
God.

1576
00:58:14,340 --> 00:58:14,820
Oh, well.

1577
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:16,020
Dr. Paslow.

1578
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,180
Dr. Paslow?

1579
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:17,800
Dr. Paslow.

1580
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:18,460
Dr. Short?

1581
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,920
I'm Dr. Memory.

1582
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:22,640
It was Dr. Memory.

1583
00:58:23,020 --> 00:58:23,500
No.

1584
00:58:24,020 --> 00:58:24,560
That's evil.

1585
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:27,060
I'm in that loop again.

1586
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:27,820
Damn.

1587
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:28,640
It's been, like,

1588
00:58:28,740 --> 00:58:29,860
45 years.

1589
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:30,960
Well,

1590
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:31,940
I guess we must

1591
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:32,500
find some

1592
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,320
all the way around.

1593
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,000
Very second.

1594
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:35,680
If we're at this, uh,

1595
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,040
if we've caught ourselves

1596
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:37,720
in a loop here,

1597
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:39,500
might be a good time

1598
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:40,220
to, uh,

1599
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:41,500
move along, actually.

1600
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:42,400
Yeah, yeah, please.

1601
00:58:42,440 --> 00:58:42,820
Yeah, yeah.

1602
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,020
We just explained,

1603
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:44,960
we just explained

1604
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:45,720
exactly how

1605
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,780
the conspiracy works.

1606
00:58:47,160 --> 00:58:47,580
Yep.

1607
00:58:47,800 --> 00:58:48,180
Right.

1608
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,300
We just said it

1609
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,060
right out in the open.

1610
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:51,220
And we're all expecting

1611
00:58:51,220 --> 00:58:52,340
a check in the mail.

1612
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:52,900
That's right.

1613
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:53,720
Check is in the mail.

1614
00:58:53,820 --> 00:58:54,280
Take the ball and run with it,

1615
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:54,540
listener.

1616
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:56,760
You are the next Bob.

1617
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:58,300
Hey, you know,

1618
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,420
we are all

1619
00:59:00,920 --> 00:59:01,320
Bob.

1620
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:02,240
We are,

1621
00:59:02,360 --> 00:59:03,300
any one of us

1622
00:59:03,300 --> 00:59:03,920
might be, no,

1623
00:59:04,100 --> 00:59:05,180
we're not necessarily Bob,

1624
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,220
but we might be

1625
00:59:06,220 --> 00:59:07,000
the next Bob.

1626
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:07,420
That's right.

1627
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,740
You could be

1628
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,680
if you wanted to.

1629
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:10,000
Could be.

1630
00:59:10,660 --> 00:59:11,480
You could be

1631
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,020
if you wanted to.

1632
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:13,560
It's all, uh,

1633
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,500
I don't know.

1634
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:14,640
I wouldn't want to,

1635
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:16,260
and I hate

1636
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:16,840
It's a burden.

1637
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:17,780
It's a burden.

1638
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:17,780


1639
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:17,780


1640
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:17,780


1641
00:59:17,780 --> 00:59:18,380
It's a burden that is too much

1642
00:59:18,380 --> 00:59:19,340
for any one normal man,

1643
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:19,860
and this is why

1644
00:59:19,860 --> 00:59:20,940
there's a lottery for it.

1645
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:21,500
Yeah.

1646
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:21,900
Because I know

1647
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,060
nobody would volunteer for it.

1648
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:23,800
Yeah.

1649
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:24,280
Any one of us

1650
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:24,980
could be the next Bob.

1651
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:25,220
You know,

1652
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:25,760
it's like the draft.

1653
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:27,440
You're listening

1654
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,380
to the hour

1655
00:59:29,660 --> 00:59:30,380
of Slack.
