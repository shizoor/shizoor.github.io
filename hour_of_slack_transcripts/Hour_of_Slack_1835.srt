1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,440
Give me that old time religion. Give me that old time religion. Don't give me a subgenius. I rate a slap.

2
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,620
Right, that sounds very charming, very charming. Uh-huh. And of course it's got to be really elegant.

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,480
No, ma'am, then I suggest you get your money back and go home. Okay. Okay? Bye-bye.

4
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:21,820
Hello.

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:31,500
This is not a rerun. It's not even made of old subgenius radio parts, mostly.

6
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:44,880
It is instead subgenius barrage number three by that weird, weird man in Cleveland who calls himself Sheridan.

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:50,180
Sheridan, Sheridan, where do you roam?

8
00:00:51,820 --> 00:01:01,320
And boy, you should see some of the cool stuff he sends me, like old Playboys, real old ones, maybe used ones.

9
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:11,640
Anyway, he sure saved me some work this week. I'm supposed to be getting ready to leave the planet in two weeks on July 5th.

10
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:21,800
And on top of that, I spent yesterday unexpectedly in the hospital with a severe allergic reaction to a water.

11
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,780
I'm going to be getting a little bit of a

12
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:49,340
And usually when we find them in the house, we free them. We trap them and then set them free outdoors.

13
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,680
But yesterday, I guess it was...

14
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:58,240
I had that one last sting that triggered a real allergy that had been built up.

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,540
I swole up like a super itchy toady frog, and they had to give me shots.

16
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:17,020
Now, it's true that we were discussing spraying that wasp nest that very morning, and maybe they overheard me.

17
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:21,160
Anyway, thanks to Sheridan for this well-timed...

18
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:24,520
Toil saving change of pace.

19
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,120
As follows.

20
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,640
Testing 1, 2, 3.

21
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,240
God, I hope they don't play this for a long while.

22
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,040
Background 90.

23
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:04,520
The hour is constructed from an extraordinary collection of conversations recorded long ago.

24
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,720
Background 90.

25
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:13,040
Nobody loves me like I do.

26
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:20,440
Nobody loves me like I do.

27
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,440
For half a century, these recordings have lain unheard.

28
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,320
Historians have quoted from the transcripts, but now for the first time, we can hear these

29
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,380
intimate stories in the voices of those who told them.

30
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:35,020
Don't you feel responsible for trying to help this endangered planet?

31
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,740
No?

32
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,100
Good.

33
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,960
The fact is, it's too late.

34
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:47,960
There isn't a goddamn thing you as an individual can do about eco-disaster, nuclear death,

35
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,680
overpopulation, and so on.

36
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,800
Things are going to hell on a fly.

37
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:58,640
The only thing you or anyone else besides the Rockefellers can do about it is to just

38
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:00,860
sit back and watch the show.

39
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:10,940
But remember, the end of the world may be much worse and take much longer than you thought.

40
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,720
Welcome back.

41
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:21,220
Thank you for listening to WWI10.

42
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,940
In Green Bay, Ohio.

43
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,540
What's with you now?

44
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,740
GM Radio.

45
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:37,600
We just heard Bible Cactus with shrimp on the barbed wire.

46
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:47,260
Before that was Muddy Water River Puppies with Untitled Number 2.

47
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:51,800
We started out that set with the experience.

48
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:59,820
We're going to have a very extended dance mix of Our Credit by the Mount Holies.

49
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,960
Now, this update.

50
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:12,460
Hi, I'm Shauna Zurbuch filling in for Grinnell the Pumper with this news.

51
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:21,800
Thousands of upwardly mobile unemployed professionals have gathered for eight straight days to help

52
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:21,800


53
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:30,460
to protest prisons as a place they didn't want to be in as opposed to carrying their resume

54
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,440
looking for a job.

55
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:45,340
In China, nine people were killed as the enormous hole they were standing in suddenly filled

56
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:50,860
with discarded flip phones and foam beer can holders.

57
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:51,780
I'm sorry.

58
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,280
The forecast tonight.

59
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,880
Inky shadows.

60
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:07,400
Tomorrow raining cats and boots and cats and boots and cats and boots and back to you,

61
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,120
buddy.

62
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:11,720
Stop calling me that, Shauna.

63
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,260
My name is Raphael.

64
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,760
Support for this hour of What's With You Now is provided by the National Institute for

70
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,740
of the Betty Varanasi era.

00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:06,820
I'm your host, Harry Skinner.

74
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:06,960
I'll see you next time.

75
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,200
Bye.

76
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,140
Bye.

77
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:13,020
Bye.

78
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:14,060
Bye.

79
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:17,780


80
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:17,780


81
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:18,840


82
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:18,840


83
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:19,000
Bye.

84
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,000


85
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:19,080
Bye.

86
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:19,080


87
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,880
Bye.

88
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:21,700
Bye.

89
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:21,700


90
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:21,700


91
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:21,720
Bye.

92
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:21,720


93
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:21,720


94
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:21,720


95
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:21,720


96
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:21,720


97
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:21,720


98
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:21,720


99
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:21,720


100
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:51,720


101
00:08:51,720 --> 00:09:21,720


102
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:51,720


103
00:09:51,720 --> 00:10:21,720


104
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:51,720


105
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,140
placing hold of the

106
00:10:54,140 --> 00:11:00,240
theme into the originalprint budget Tom Lu

107
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:00,600
Tambo product.

108
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,220
We'll be right back.

109
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,440
We'll be right back.

110
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,520
We'll be right back.

111
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,340
We'll be right back.

112
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,660
We'll be right back.

113
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,980
We'll be right back.

114
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,620
We'll be right back.

115
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:36,840
We'll be right back.

116
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:06,540
We'll be right back.

117
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:31,040
We'll be right back.

118
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:39,680
We'll be right back.

119
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,160
We'll be right back.

120
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,500
We'll be right back.

121
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,200
We'll be right back.

122
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:38,800
We'll be right back.

123
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:38,980
We'll be right back.

124
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:38,980


125
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:41,320
One thing the channel didn't care very much about,

126
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,860
obviously, was news.

127
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,200
And it's like,

128
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:54,440
Do you have, do you have, do you have,

129
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,300
do you have

130
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,920
oat milk?

131
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:36,080
Do you have oat milk?

132
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:45,700
You can do it yourself.

133
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,060
You can use it.

134
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:48,600
You can use it.

135
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:55,400
There's no need to repent any sins or transgressions.

136
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,180
As a member of the Church of the Subgenius,

137
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,040
you'll be issued your very own official,

138
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,140
divine, all-inclusive excuse.

139
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:04,680
And friends,

140
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,780
it's a big,

141
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,380
document, fancy looking

142
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,340
poster size.

143
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,060
So why wait?

144
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,640
Hurry to subgenius.com

145
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:15,400
and save yourself

146
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:16,720
today.

147
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,180
Now just a minute, lady.

148
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,760
I won't, I'll double the amount.

149
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,880
Well, I don't know. I want money.

150
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,100
Did you say money?

151
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,080
Hi, Mr. Minister.

152
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,020
What do we do? What do we sign? Give me those contracts.

153
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,020
Coming up next, a new look at the Constitution.

154
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:31,420
Consider briefly

155
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:33,880
the story of human civilization on Earth.

156
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,840
It tells of the ingenuity,

157
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:38,020
elegance, generous and nurturing

158
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:39,840
nature of a species that is also

159
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,160
self-focused, vulnerable and defiantly

160
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:42,420
intelligent.

161
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:45,120
People, sheep, and horses.

162
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,400
All passed out.

163
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:49,320
Children are prone.

164
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,660
They urgently need this new

165
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,400
source of skill and toughness.

166
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,660
My heart is

167
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,620
loud and bright.

168
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,540
I'm going to sign a draft

169
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,160
of the Constitution.

170
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,420
Say the word debacle.

171
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,960
I need you to succeeded in

172
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,920
it, make itimaginable

173
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,100
that you'll

174
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:26,160
put ants

175
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,160


176
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:26,240
this

177
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,780
hill.

178
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,160
실�.

179
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:30,800
I'm happy the

180
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:33,860
whatever.

181
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:33,860


182
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:33,860


183
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:33,860


184
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:33,860


185
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:33,860


186
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:33,860


187
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:33,860


188
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:33,860

00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:33,860


190
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,480
the

191
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:33,560
way,

192
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:33,820
and has

193
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,240
Hey, boys, I must be dead.

194
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,960
I hear an angel singing.

195
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,280
My!

196
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,660
Ain't she pretty?

197
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,940
Boy, you can say that again.

198
00:19:59,260 --> 00:19:59,700
My!

199
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,240
Ain't she pretty?

200
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:01,900
Shut up.

201
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,240
You said I couldn't.

202
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,180
Shut up.

203
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,600
We're running.

204
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:06,900
My!

205
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:24,420
There was all kinds of experimentation and fun going on there.

206
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,180
Which means that these tape recordings I'm making are for the sake of future history.

207
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,080
If any.

208
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:37,940
Uh, there was all kinds of experimentation and fun going on there.

209
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,660
Testing one, two, three.

210
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,500
It's five.

211
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:55,940
It's five.

212
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,460
Oh, we're in like this.

213
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,980
It's five.

214
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,040
It's five.

215
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,560
It's five.

216
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:03,100
It's five.

217
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,020
It's five.

218
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:06,840
Let's just show you the negotiating go.

219
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,480

Bis.

229
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:32,360
M合ım

230
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:35,370
I said, there's no need for you to be so modest.

231
00:21:35,970 --> 00:21:42,750
He found rather the most sweet, but really the weirdest dreams to rampage in life.

232
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:47,030
Stand up for your own abnormality!

233
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:49,250
Ah, the way of life continues.

234
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:51,650
But this man is not a human being, no.

235
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:55,930
He's the one true living, the black master.

236
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:02,030
It's a spiritual know-how to help you dash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

237
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:05,890
He is the one real shortcut to slack.

238
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,790
For all we know, when said as a spirit, means the sum total of knowledge.

239
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:15,510
But when said another way, for all we know, things that we do not know at all.

240
00:22:16,090 --> 00:22:19,290
This is the beautiful, fragile drama of civilization.

241
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:25,570
We are the actors and spectators of a cosmic play that means the word to us here, but means nothing anywhere else.

242
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:29,310
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.

243
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:32,010
They look like what you expect of pharmaceutical drugs.

244
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,770
They look like carbon atoms and some other things stuck on there.

245
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,550
They look like these big, complex molecules.

246
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,850
And you're like, oh yeah, I'm complex. My brain's complex.

247
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:43,830
It takes a complicated thing to change it.

248
00:22:44,230 --> 00:22:44,830
You must make a decision.

249
00:22:45,310 --> 00:22:46,210
A cupcake.

250
00:22:46,730 --> 00:22:48,010
Just pretend some mood.

251
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,710
You must make the decision.

252
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:51,950
A cupcake.

253
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:54,110
This is not a rerun.

254
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:58,510
Do they know why it works in the brain? Like, do they know what it does?

255
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:00,770
Well, essentially, no.

256
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:07,570
And join the Church of the Subgenius.

257
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:14,470
In a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution, anything is likely to develop.

258
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:18,910
Enter the Church of the Subgenius, billing itself as the weirdest cult on earth.

259
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:21,170
What do they believe in? Everything.

260
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:24,870
Who do they believe in? A mysterious character named Bob.

261
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:30,690
Bob is the culmination of that to which man has aspired throughout his long and slackless history.

262
00:23:30,690 --> 00:23:34,190
Bob is what will bring slack to planet Earth.

263
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:35,690
And to you, young man.

264
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:41,410
There is actually only one point in the entire cosmos that is present in all constellations of stars.

265
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:44,490
And that presence is here, planet Earth.

266
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:50,370
Those pictures we have made up for the clusters of stars only make sense from this point of view down here.

267
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:52,550
Their stories only make sense here on Earth.

268
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,630
And only something to us.

269
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,670
We are creatures of stories.

270
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,650
We are the stories we tell.

271
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,270
We're the stories we're told.

272
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:02,190
We're the stories we're told.

273
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:10,110
You're in the bathroom, taking care of business after another Taco Tuesday.

274
00:24:11,690 --> 00:24:22,210
The lighter in your back pocket falls into the toilet, mixing in with your new deposit.

275
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,070
You're not going in after it.

276
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,050
And you can't leave.

277
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:34,590
You're the only one in the building.

278
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:42,390
It's late at night, and you're the late night security guard.

279
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:57,050
If you walk across the street to buy a new lighter, that would be the first time an intruder actually talks.

280
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:57,050


281
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:57,050


282
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:57,770
And you'd be the first one to be able to get in.

283
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:03,090
And only the cameras would be watching.

284
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:08,030
You love this job.

285
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:15,630
Reading comic books and mad magazines all night long.

286
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:21,590
Occasionally glancing at the monitors to earn your pay.

287
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:27,030
You'd hate to be a ghost.

288
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:27,030


289
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:30,890
You'd hate to lose this gig for a stinking lighter.

290
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:34,130
But there aren't many options.

291
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:40,230
You can't light a cigarette with the cafeteria microwave.

292
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:48,230
And you can't rummage through everyone's desk looking for a dry, clean lighter.

293
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:52,950
After all, you're a camera.

294
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:56,670
So you decide.

295
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,310
Screw it.

296
00:26:00,050 --> 00:26:05,210
Dump the rest of your smokes in the toilet and lush.

297
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:11,530
It takes two before it all goes down.

298
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:17,630
Fecal matter, cigarettes, and lighter.

299
00:26:19,730 --> 00:26:22,930
You wish you had a pen.

300
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:25,890
A pack of matches to drive away the stink.

301
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:28,710
Foiled again.

302
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:31,810
But that's okay.

303
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,530
You can tough it out.

304
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:38,650
Go without smoking till the end of your shift.

305
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:47,690
There's food, but everything in the fridge has hair growing out of it.

306
00:26:49,930 --> 00:26:52,790
You eat an entire family size.

307
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,590
A family size bag of cheese corn.

308
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,190
A couple donut sticks.

309
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,070
A whole apple pie.

310
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:02,410
And an extension cord with hot sauce.

311
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:04,610
Just realize.

312
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:10,630
A cigarette after eating is part of your routine.

313
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:19,250
And coffee and cigarettes are just so good together.

314
00:27:22,170 --> 00:27:28,450
It's only been a half hour and you're already jonesing for nicotine.

315
00:27:30,410 --> 00:27:32,230
You look at the monitors.

316
00:27:33,910 --> 00:27:36,990
You're still the only one in the building.

317
00:27:39,110 --> 00:27:40,650
Should you risk it?

318
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:44,030
Screw it.

319
00:27:44,550 --> 00:27:48,310
Anyone with a gun can get a security job.

320
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:54,810
You carve eye-quit into the wooden security desk.

321
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:00,790
Lock the front door behind you and wait to cross the street.

322
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:04,410
You've gotta have a smoke.

323
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:10,930
A Domino's delivery car passes by.

324
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,610
And it occurs to you that you could have ordered a pizza.

325
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:22,030
With a side of a cigarette lighter.

326
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,730
A fast bowling.

327
00:28:58,970 --> 00:28:59,610
A

328
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:01,790
bag of wax and paper.

329
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:02,790
A

330
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,650
ring of hope.

331
00:29:09,010 --> 00:29:10,130
You feel a train of air.

332
00:29:10,130 --> 00:29:10,550
And a

333
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:15,810
good nine-and-a-instant menu.

334
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:17,410
And the quiz,

335
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:17,590
I guess it's always spelled bad.

336
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:17,590


337
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:17,590


338
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:32,190
I remember reading about the door-to-door, house-to-house, town-to-town campaign that the whole family put on.

339
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:39,810
When we return, I remember flying with him in the middle of that.

340
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:48,090
When I first met him, I thought he was one of the smartest, quickest, funniest human beings I'd ever met.

341
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:54,390
I always thought he was absolutely best in private.

342
00:29:54,530 --> 00:29:57,650
He had a tremendous capacity to involve you, interest you.

343
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,150
You wanted to tell him everything.

344
00:30:00,490 --> 00:30:04,610
At the time, journalists either didn't know or chose to look the other way.

345
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,810
The secrets remained secret.

346
00:30:08,450 --> 00:30:08,970
No.

347
00:30:08,970 --> 00:30:14,310
Now, compare with that, a dinner at the White House at which you were served very good drinks first.

348
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:19,650
There were ashtrays everywhere, just inviting you to poison yourself with cigarettes.

349
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:25,010
And the moment comes, and these two ravishing people appear in the doorway.

350
00:30:25,850 --> 00:30:31,210
You are then brought into dinner, and dinner turns out not to be at a horseshoe table,

351
00:30:31,370 --> 00:30:37,530
but at many little tables seating about ten people apiece, with fires roaring in all the fireplaces,

352
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:38,950
so that it's all...

353
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:40,310
All like having dinner with friends.

354
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:43,710
The food is marvelous, the wines are delicious.

355
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:53,130
People are laughing, laughing out loud, telling stories and jokes, enjoying themselves, glad to be there.

356
00:30:53,550 --> 00:30:56,130
I've never seen so many happy artists in my life.

357
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,990
It was like a different world.

358
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:01,730
On this planet, there are people.

359
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:06,910
Looking up, and by drawing lines between the lights in the sky, we've attempted to make sense out of chaos.

360
00:31:07,450 --> 00:31:08,950
Looking down, we've drawn lines between the lights in the sky, we've attempted to make sense out of chaos.

361
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,790
We've drawn lines across the land to know where we belong, and where we don't.

362
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:18,490
We do mostly forget that these lines that connect the stars, and those lines that divide the land, live only in our heads.

363
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,450
They, too, are stories.

364
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:27,410
We carry out our everyday routines and rituals according to the stories we most believe in, and these days, the story is changing as we write it.

00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:38,690
Hello, we're back, and you're listening to WWYN What's With You Now PM Radio.

366
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:38,930
Hello, we're back, and you're listening to WWYN What's With You Now PM Radio.

367
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:39,710
Hello, we're back, and you're listening to WWYN What's With You Now PM Radio.

368
00:31:39,710 --> 00:31:44,350
Broadcasting this week from John's mom's house.

369
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:54,470
We've just heard autistic mime with juggling verbs in a crime novel.

370
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:00,550
From the LP, Don't Introduce Yourself.

371
00:32:01,230 --> 00:32:08,910
We started out that set with an extremely long version of Messing.

372
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:23,590
We've just heard autistic mime with a kid by Jules Magoo and the Nickel Tippers, featuring old gay black Muslim on congos, bazookas, and gesundheit.

373
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:28,730
Now, this news update.

374
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:32,710
I'm Grinnell the Pumper with this news.

375
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:38,930
During the flood, at the conclusion of rescuing 14 family members...

376
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:43,410
members from one house, the fire chief was overheard saying,

377
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,010
stop screwing people.

378
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:49,530
AC and water beds be damned.

379
00:32:51,510 --> 00:32:57,190
Fire chief Hang Dog was later quoted as saying, good thing

380
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:01,550
they didn't have pets, or I would have dropped that last

381
00:33:01,550 --> 00:33:05,450
screaming nut and saved the dog.

382
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:12,030
Investigations continue and hors d'oeuvres at 11.

383
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:21,190
In France, the economy has stalled as Parliament again fails to establish

384
00:33:21,190 --> 00:33:26,790
an acceptable voting age for refugee bagel makers.

385
00:33:28,150 --> 00:33:30,690
Back to you, Bunny.

386
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:35,050
My name is Raphael.

387
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:37,030
Ms. Pumper.

388
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:39,150
Raphael.

389
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:48,490
Support for this hour of What's With You Now is provided by Cottage Cheese.

390
00:33:49,850 --> 00:33:56,030
Disgusting to look at, smells funny, squishes in the spoon,

391
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:04,770
feels strange in the mouth, and tastes like pigeon bile on a bald tire.

392
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:08,730
But kiss Cottage Cheese.

393
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:13,390
You like it, you eat it.

394
00:34:14,350 --> 00:34:22,950
And be sure to tune in tonight for an exclusive interview with the new hit band Gay Boyle

395
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:32,230
Gastropod, who will be performing on a special platform composed of a giant slice of toasted

396
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,370
Schwebel's bread.

397
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,730
Now, a look at our roads.

398
00:34:39,390 --> 00:34:43,770
Well, it looks like they're in bad need of repair.

399
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:48,650
Some of these holes could swallow a Panzer tank.

400
00:34:50,030 --> 00:34:52,250
Use caution, folks.

401
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:54,250
Thanks, Tony.

402
00:34:54,710 --> 00:35:02,370
And don't forget to tune in to our special show about Alzheimer's tonight at

403
00:35:03,430 --> 00:35:03,970
. . .

404
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:05,730
Tonight.

405
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:18,390
Counting down the top three chart toppers, we have number three, raised castings and

406
00:35:18,970 --> 00:35:22,370
spare tires with lug thugs.

407
00:35:23,010 --> 00:35:33,390
Number two, Bissell smoke in the cardiac rug stains with you left my toothbrush where?

408
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:44,850
And coming in at number one for the second straight day on three planets, decorative ears

409
00:35:45,390 --> 00:35:53,010
and the death landscape doing their cover version of Tommy, can you hear me?

410
00:35:54,830 --> 00:36:00,230
Well, that's all we have time for until we have more time.

411
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:03,370
So until next time, keep on smoking.

412
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:04,030
Keep ticking.

413
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,870
You're the bomb.

414
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:16,590
We'd like to thank Shauna Zurbach, who filled in for Drenel the pumper last week as she

415
00:36:16,590 --> 00:36:24,690
was at the doctor for another round of tests and pokes and tests and pokes and tests and

416
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:25,210
pokes.

417
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:33,350
And I'm Raphael Slickerhoots signing checks and signing out.

418
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


419
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


420
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


421
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


422
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


423
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


424
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


425
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


426
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


427
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


428
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


429
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


430
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


431
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


432
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:33,350


433
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:43,510
But first, we have a weather update from that crazy manicure lady at the tattoo shop.

434
00:36:46,090 --> 00:36:47,830
Stay inside, people.

435
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:51,370
Just stay inside.

436
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:53,050
Ah, there you go.

437
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:53,870
Yeah, for sure.

438
00:36:54,250 --> 00:36:56,850
God, I hope they don't play this for a long, long time.

439
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,630
Do you want this job?

440
00:37:00,890 --> 00:37:03,330
He said, I thought I had a pretty good thing going on.

441
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:03,330


442
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:03,330


443
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:03,330


444
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:03,330


445
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:03,330


446
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:03,330


447
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:03,330


448
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:04,210
I was lying up till this morning.

449
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,770
Still reeling from these two back to back humiliations.

450
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,650
Okay, kid.

451
00:37:25,990 --> 00:37:31,270
This wouldn't be a great way to do that on Earth, but it's really a very efficient way

452
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,090
to do it.

453
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:33,310
And I'm sorry.

454
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:33,310


455
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:33,310


456
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:33,310


457
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:33,310


458
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:33,310


459
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:33,310


460
00:37:33,330 --> 00:37:36,910
And you just have to not be nonplussed about that.

461
00:37:36,970 --> 00:37:42,510
You just have to say, well, you go into something else or you don't, you know, you can't dwell

462
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:46,410
on, hey, I don't, you know, what you're doing isn't doing anything for me.

463
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:53,030
And she just sort of skipped across the room and looked lighter.

464
00:37:53,210 --> 00:37:57,450
The burden was lifted because you told her it was okay to be different.

465
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,090
So I'm just, hey, I don't know what you're doing over there, Mr. Drummond, but it ain't

466
00:38:01,090 --> 00:38:01,830
doing nothing for me.

467
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,310
And she said, I don't know what you're doing over there, Mr. Drummond, but it ain't doing

468
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:03,450
anything for me.

469
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:04,270
And I'm like, well, you're just so stupid.

470
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:04,270


471
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:08,370
She just sort of skipped across the room and looked lighter.

472
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:12,770
The burden was lifted because you told her it was okay to be different.

473
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:14,930
Nothing.

474
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:20,790
The chances of being here aren't infinite, yet here we are, perilous and wrong.

475
00:38:21,110 --> 00:38:24,450
There have never been more people living on Earth, using worse stuff.

476
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:30,450
And it's become obvious that many of the old systems we invented for ourselves are obsolete.

477
00:38:30,690 --> 00:38:32,030
And we have to build new ones.

478
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:33,310
I think we have a lot to learn and try to learn from each other.

479
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:33,310


480
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:33,310


481
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:33,310


482
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:33,310


483
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:33,310


484
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:40,830
They don't need much to live on, just a constant supply of mindless entertainment and food.

485
00:38:41,810 --> 00:38:52,530
And then in 1995, another quite decisive turn for me was an invitation to go to Zambia

486
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:58,910
and to see what this experience and these lessons might mean for Africa.

487
00:38:58,910 --> 00:39:03,470
One thing the channel didn't care very much about, obviously, was news.

488
00:39:03,810 --> 00:39:07,110
Consider briefly the story of human civilization on Earth.

489
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:12,210
It tells of the ingenuity, elegance, generous and nurturing nature of a species

490
00:39:12,210 --> 00:39:15,730
that is also self-focused, vulnerable and defiantly protective.

491
00:39:16,750 --> 00:39:22,650
We the people shield the flame of our existence from the raw and vast elements outside our control, the great beyond.

492
00:39:23,350 --> 00:39:26,310
Yet it is always to the flame we look.

493
00:39:26,810 --> 00:39:28,030
How much longer?

494
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:29,990
How much longer must this circus continue?

495
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:33,330
How much longer must this circus continue?

496
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,550
How much longer must this circus continue?

497
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:41,610
I don't care how pissed off you get.

498
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:51,930
I will take your point and blunt it so that even you won't know what you said.

499
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:56,330
Did you have something to say?

500
00:39:58,130 --> 00:40:00,630
Did I interrupt?

501
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:04,390
My pleasure.

502
00:40:08,470 --> 00:40:11,810
Just remember to praise Bob, friends, and you'll be okay.

503
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:14,410
Praise that mighty man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

504
00:40:14,430 --> 00:40:18,270
He's out there slacking off for you, for your slack.

505
00:40:18,470 --> 00:40:23,870
Because, you know, you can't spread slack unless, wise, you got some slack yourself.

506
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,130
And that's the truth.

507
00:40:25,210 --> 00:40:26,350
That's a God's truth.

508
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:27,890
He didn't work for you.

509
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:34,950
He hired at the job and would have been an unbelievable figure if you were cast in the role of a young man of destiny.

510
00:40:35,250 --> 00:40:38,270
Drown into the joy of thy Lord.

511
00:40:40,650 --> 00:40:42,470
And no one has ever met Bob.

512
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:44,630
The leader of our church, no one has ever met.

513
00:40:44,730 --> 00:40:48,010
Because, as you know, all cults, their leaders are usually pretty hard to find.

514
00:40:48,230 --> 00:40:49,610
And Bob is no exception.

515
00:40:50,110 --> 00:40:51,870
He was an easy fellow to meet.

516
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:54,290
Had no reserve at all about him.

517
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:57,110
He had a great sense of humor and it stuck out in front of him.

518
00:40:57,130 --> 00:40:58,010
So far, you couldn't...

519
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:58,330
You wouldn't miss it.

520
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:03,970
When I first met him, I thought he was one of the smartest, quickest, funniest human beings I ever met.

521
00:41:04,490 --> 00:41:09,130
After relaxing on the lake, Bob's wed you to have a great time entertaining his friends.

522
00:41:09,450 --> 00:41:10,270
Right, Bob?

523
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:11,970
Bob?

524
00:41:13,510 --> 00:41:13,950
Bob?

525
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:15,630
I am saying everything.

526
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,050
If you're so smart, why aren't you?

527
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,530
I always thought he was absolutely best in private.

528
00:41:21,710 --> 00:41:24,810
He had a tremendous capacity to involve you, interest you.

529
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:26,310
You wanted to tell him everything.

530
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:30,750
I do as I say, mother.

531
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:36,030
This steady awareness of the irrelevance of the thing that you really couldn't do.

532
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,030
When critical quality was a nearly preternatural self-confidence.

533
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:48,690
I think one clear element in it was simply the number of times that he had accomplished things that people said could not be accomplished.

534
00:41:49,050 --> 00:41:53,250
So that no was a word he was used to hearing and used to disproving.

535
00:41:53,690 --> 00:41:58,010
This steady awareness of the irrelevance of the thing that you really couldn't do.

536
00:41:58,010 --> 00:42:03,410
Old Bob would sell just about anything to just about anybody.

537
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,310
What's he sold you today?

538
00:42:05,550 --> 00:42:10,710
This steady awareness of the irrelevance of the thing that you really couldn't do.

539
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,030
A cupcake.

540
00:42:12,390 --> 00:42:15,150
A cupcake.

541
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,510
A cupcake.

542
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:20,030
A cupcake.

543
00:42:33,830 --> 00:42:38,090
I don't want to be caught short in a gray vinyl suit when the lid blows off.

544
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:49,510
In this kind of world, a good life is a balanced and a virtuous life, not a single-minded pursuit of income.

545
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:53,670
Friends, what are you people waiting for?

546
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,830
Did you know that for less than 10 cents a day,

547
00:42:57,830 --> 00:42:58,510
for a year,

548
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:01,730
that's less than one thin dime every day for one year,

549
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:06,870
you too can have eternal salvation or triple your money back.

550
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:08,630
Nothing else to buy.

551
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,310
No need for periodic renewals.

552
00:43:11,370 --> 00:43:13,190
You are saved forever.

553
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:16,930
Yes, for a one-time donation of a measly

554
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:17,750
mom

555
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:19,870
could change any minute.

556
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:23,010
At subgenius.com, you will be saved.

557
00:43:23,430 --> 00:43:27,370
Even better, there's no need to repent any sins.

558
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:30,010
Or transgressions.

559
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:32,870
As a member of the Church of the Subgenius,

560
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:37,790
you'll be issued your very own official, defined, all-inclusive excuse.

561
00:43:38,270 --> 00:43:40,890
And friends, it's a big document.

562
00:43:41,190 --> 00:43:42,130
Fancy-looking.

563
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:44,030
Poster-sized.

564
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:45,730
So why wait?

565
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:51,390
Hurry to subgenius.com and save yourself today.

566
00:43:52,010 --> 00:43:57,810
And it's a kind of dignity which doesn't usually merge with that much.

567
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:00,230
It's a kind of much casualness and friendliness.

568
00:44:10,570 --> 00:44:13,790
Still reeling from these two back-to-back humiliations?

569
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:19,750
Let me out!

570
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:20,890
Let me out of here!

571
00:44:21,050 --> 00:44:22,130
You can't keep me in here!

572
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:23,550
Let me out of here!

573
00:44:28,790 --> 00:44:35,330
Let me out!

574
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:36,510
You can't keep me in here!

575
00:44:37,070 --> 00:44:40,430
You can't keep me in here!

576
00:44:41,030 --> 00:44:41,710
I'll take you to the police!

577
00:44:41,810 --> 00:44:43,550
Now, compare with that.

578
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:47,430
A dinner at the White House at which you were served very good drinks first.

579
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:48,910
There were ashtrays everywhere.

580
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:52,790
Just inviting you to poison yourself with cigarettes.

581
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:54,250
Anyway, friends.

582
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:54,910
Um...

583
00:44:57,030 --> 00:44:58,230
And now this.

584
00:44:59,870 --> 00:45:00,890
Good evening, gentlemen.

585
00:45:01,150 --> 00:45:01,770
Good evening, James.

586
00:45:04,050 --> 00:45:04,790
Just a minute.

587
00:45:04,810 --> 00:45:05,530
We came with a lady.

588
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:06,150
Oh, pardon.

589
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,790
Quite a shack this Bixby joint.

590
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:13,730
Yeah, it reminds me of the reform school.

591
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,130
Ah, there you go.

592
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:15,930
Yeah, for sure.

593
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,450
When we return...

594
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:19,630
I remember flying with him in the middle of that...

595
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:21,830
When we return...

596
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:24,110
I remember flying with him in the middle of that...

597
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,130
When we return...

598
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:28,450
I remember flying with him in the middle of that...

599
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:30,390
When we return...

600
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:33,250
I remember flying with him in the middle of that...

601
00:45:40,010 --> 00:45:40,670
Yeah, babe.

602
00:45:42,630 --> 00:45:44,110
You always want more, don't you?

603
00:45:44,350 --> 00:45:45,590
Can't have it all.

604
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:47,810
But she wants to have a little more.

605
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:48,950
And she can't say no.

606
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,530
But of course she says she's got to have more.

607
00:45:51,710 --> 00:45:52,930
But I've got to have more.

608
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:54,890
So I don't know where to get you.

609
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:55,190
Yeah, bro.

610
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:56,910
And now I'm going to get some more.

611
00:45:57,950 --> 00:45:59,090
I've got to get you on support.

612
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:01,750
And I want to get you on support.

613
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:06,790
We never really knew how different life was

614
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:09,110
until it was over.

615
00:46:09,450 --> 00:46:12,410
More slack for some subgenius brains is

616
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,930
slightly less miserable for a short period of time.

617
00:46:16,870 --> 00:46:19,890
Some subgenius brains don't even get that, friend,

618
00:46:19,950 --> 00:46:21,890
and they don't get it even once.

619
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,030
You've suffered this far.

620
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:24,890
You can keep suffering.

621
00:46:24,910 --> 00:46:25,350
You can keep suffering longer.

622
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:28,010
But maybe not only suffer.

623
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,610
All right.

624
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:30,570
I need a little bass.

625
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:33,310
Jared?

626
00:46:33,510 --> 00:46:34,510
Well, that was a good one.

627
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:35,250
You know that one.

628
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:36,450
Hey!

629
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,470
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

630
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:39,790
Hey!

631
00:46:41,510 --> 00:46:42,050
Hey!

632
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:42,330


633
00:46:42,330 --> 00:46:42,330


634
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:53,890
Or you can kiss your sweet assurance of sanity goodbye.

635
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:54,890
Bye.

636
00:46:54,910 --> 00:46:55,890
Bye.

637
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:56,930
So shut up and listen.

638
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:58,970
Listen and look for yourself.

639
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:03,730
You don't even need us to translate the handwriting on the walls.

640
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:07,110
What's going on is very grotesquely obvious

641
00:47:07,110 --> 00:47:10,050
to even the most subjugated idiots.

642
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:11,430
Face it.

643
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:14,410
It's all falling apart.

644
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:18,450
This is not a rerun.

645
00:47:19,370 --> 00:47:22,070
This is not a rerun.

646
00:47:22,810 --> 00:47:24,890
This is not a rerun.

647
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:25,590
Not a rerun!

648
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,170
Bye bye.

649
00:47:37,190 --> 00:47:38,450
Previous show.

650
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,110
I have.

651
00:47:40,670 --> 00:47:42,170
I don't know what it is.

652
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:43,910
Support.

653
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:44,350
Le nào.

654
00:47:45,810 --> 00:47:46,610
Wolves.

655
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:48,430
Eagles.

656
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:49,490
An obligated regrowing.

657
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:49,490


658
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:49,490


659
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:49,490


660
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:50,750
Wnot do that.

661
00:47:51,130 --> 00:47:51,930
Sorry about that.

662
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:51,930


663
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:51,930


664
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:51,930


665
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:51,930


666
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:51,930


667
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:51,930


668
00:47:51,930 --> 00:47:52,630
will later try this at home.

669
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:53,030
The fish struggle was a overlap and it could only make the

670
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:53,030


671
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:54,890
With veil��guessery.this.etc

672
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:54,890


673
00:48:03,030 --> 00:48:08,810
Nobody loves me like I do

674
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:16,270
Nobody loves me like I do

675
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:23,210
Okay, kid.

676
00:48:24,770 --> 00:48:26,610
Vieni sur moi

677
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:28,970
Vieni

678
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:42,450
Consider briefly the story of human civilization on Earth.

679
00:48:43,110 --> 00:48:47,430
Tales of the ingenuity, elegance, generous, nurturing nature of a species

680
00:48:47,430 --> 00:48:51,090
that is also self-focused, vulnerable, and divinely protective.

681
00:48:51,410 --> 00:48:52,510
We the people.

682
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:52,870
She.

683
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:54,130
The flame of our existence.

684
00:48:54,450 --> 00:48:57,010
The raw, vast elements outside our control.

685
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:57,970
The great beyond.

686
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:01,650
Yet it is always to the flame we look.

687
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:06,030
It's because people are becoming aware how important this is

688
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:08,510
and how this can change our world.

689
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:14,450
It can change our world in immensely important ways.

690
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:18,010
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.

691
00:49:26,650 --> 00:49:33,790
Close your eyes and pretend with me for a few seconds.

692
00:49:33,970 --> 00:49:34,130
She.

693
00:49:35,710 --> 00:49:38,710
She and I are prolly grocery vendors.

694
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:38,710


695
00:49:38,710 --> 00:49:38,710


696
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,310
She is our daughter.

697
00:49:41,310 --> 00:49:41,310


698
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:46,150
She is our everything.

699
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:36,910
Oh, my God!

700
00:50:47,030 --> 00:50:50,910
Oh, my goodness, what happened?

701
00:50:51,330 --> 00:50:53,210
We would like to apologize to those people

702
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:56,170
who may have heard a short extract from Pleasures of the Dance,

703
00:50:56,290 --> 00:50:58,110
a selection of Norwegian Carpenters songs,

704
00:50:58,230 --> 00:50:59,530
earlier in this record.

705
00:50:59,590 --> 00:51:02,510
This appeared in error and will not be repeated.

706
00:51:02,830 --> 00:51:05,070
This is not a rerun.

707
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,390
We are...

708
00:51:09,550 --> 00:51:10,630
We are...

709
00:51:10,630 --> 00:51:12,770
We are...

710
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:15,750
We have one more first.

711
00:51:15,750 --> 00:51:16,770
First, we'd like you to try...

712
00:51:45,810 --> 00:51:46,370
to try to make it so that you can see

713
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:48,850
that everything that happens is what you wanted to happen

714
00:51:48,850 --> 00:51:52,970
and treat that as if it were the most normal thing in the world.

715
00:51:53,030 --> 00:51:54,530
Excuse me, the record's stuck.

716
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:55,510
The record's stuck.

717
00:51:55,590 --> 00:51:56,450
The record's stuck.

718
00:51:56,470 --> 00:51:57,370
The record's stuck.

719
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:58,230
The record's stuck.

720
00:51:58,270 --> 00:51:59,190
The record's stuck.

721
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:11,230
The process is the hardest thing

722
00:52:12,090 --> 00:52:14,430
because it takes time.

723
00:52:15,750 --> 00:52:19,310
You don't want to waste that.

724
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,210
If it turns out bad,

725
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:27,830
redo it or throw it away.

726
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:30,710
If it's good,

727
00:52:31,830 --> 00:52:33,670
move on to the next.

728
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,750
If it's mediocre,

729
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:39,390
screw it.

730
00:52:40,630 --> 00:52:41,630
Put it out there

731
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:44,650
and let someone else decide.

732
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:48,190
Um, uh, excuse me, um...

733
00:53:09,090 --> 00:53:11,410
Then it dawned on us like a...

734
00:53:11,410 --> 00:53:13,370
a very bleak dawn.

735
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:14,890
And I must say,

736
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:15,730
it's never been the same.

737
00:53:15,750 --> 00:53:16,710
Since...

738
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:19,290
Do you want this...

739
00:53:19,290 --> 00:53:24,550
He said, I thought I had a pretty good thing going up.

740
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:27,810
For more of these stories...

741
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:29,330
You can...

742
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,550
You can look for good information,

743
00:53:32,310 --> 00:53:33,470
but we've got it right here.

744
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:37,350
8-0-8-0-7

745
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:38,870
Delano, Texas

746
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:44,250
7-6-0-4-3

747
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:45,730
For all...

748
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:49,230
All your nailing needs.

749
00:53:49,490 --> 00:53:49,950
Or...

750
00:53:49,950 --> 00:53:50,570
Or...

751
00:53:50,570 --> 00:53:51,730
Or really,

752
00:53:52,670 --> 00:53:54,970
why don't you just go to

753
00:53:56,670 --> 00:53:58,510
subgenius.com

754
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:02,510
You can spend all your money there.

755
00:54:03,710 --> 00:54:03,950
Yes.

756
00:54:05,190 --> 00:54:05,750
Yes, you can.

757
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:07,630
You can.

758
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:09,290
When critical quality

759
00:54:09,290 --> 00:54:12,010
was a nearly preternatural self-confidence.

760
00:54:12,330 --> 00:54:14,770
I think one clear element in it

761
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:15,710
was simply that it was a good thing.

762
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:15,990
It was.

763
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:15,990


764
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:15,990


765
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:15,990


766
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:15,990


767
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:15,990


768
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:15,990


769
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:15,990


770
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:15,990


771
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:15,990


772
00:54:15,990 --> 00:54:17,090
exactly the number of times

773
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,530
that he had accomplished things

774
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:19,530
that people said could not,

775
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,530
be a conference so that no

776
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:23,530
was a word he was used to hearing

777
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,710
and used to disproving,

778
00:54:24,750 --> 00:54:26,270
and it's a kind of dignity

779
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,850
which doesn't usually emerged

780
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:30,950
with that much casualness

781
00:54:30,950 --> 00:54:32,590
and friendliness.

782
00:54:33,010 --> 00:54:34,190
Once more, please.

783
00:54:34,470 --> 00:54:36,850
Let me quit. Let's give myself

784
00:54:36,850 --> 00:54:37,490
a look.

785
00:54:39,450 --> 00:54:40,090
Ready

786
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:41,090
soon

787
00:54:41,090 --> 00:54:42,190
I'm

788
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:43,510
fine.

789
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:55,850
Thank you. Thank you.

790
00:54:55,870 --> 00:54:57,190
We never really knew

791
00:54:57,190 --> 00:55:00,130
how different life was.

792
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:02,470
Until it was over.

793
00:55:15,290 --> 00:55:16,750
Stop it. You know what I want to hear.

794
00:55:17,270 --> 00:55:17,970
No, I don't.

795
00:55:18,170 --> 00:55:20,110
Play it for her. Play it for me.

796
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:21,950
Well, I don't think I can remember.

797
00:55:22,050 --> 00:55:23,230
If you can stand it, I can.

798
00:55:30,050 --> 00:55:30,650
Much than

799
00:55:30,650 --> 00:55:30,850
enough.

800
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:31,530
It's in our territory.

801
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,110
We gotta do something to stop it.

802
00:55:33,470 --> 00:55:36,270
If you can stand it, I can.

803
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:39,110
Stop it.

804
00:55:39,130 --> 00:55:40,510
You know what I want to hear.

805
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:43,010
No, I don't.

806
00:55:43,690 --> 00:55:44,570
Play it for her.

807
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,510
Play it for me.

808
00:55:48,070 --> 00:55:49,670
Well, I don't think I can remember.

809
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,190
If you can stand it, I can.

810
00:55:54,830 --> 00:55:55,370
Stop it.

811
00:55:55,450 --> 00:55:57,070
You know what I want to hear.

812
00:55:57,650 --> 00:55:58,270
No, I don't.

813
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:00,430
Play it for her. Play it for me.

814
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:02,230
Well, I don't think I can remember.

815
00:56:02,470 --> 00:56:03,550
If you can stand it, I can.

816
00:56:06,150 --> 00:56:09,270
Oh, I hate my head on the table.

817
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:10,450
So do you.

818
00:56:10,770 --> 00:56:11,090
Stop it.

819
00:56:11,790 --> 00:56:13,530
Play it for me.

820
00:56:14,690 --> 00:56:15,330
Stop it.

821
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:16,790
See, nobody loves me.

822
00:56:17,790 --> 00:56:18,010
Ha ha.

823
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:20,170
Not like I do.

824
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:23,870
Self-pity.

825
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:25,830
Self-love.

826
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:27,790
Self-pity.

827
00:56:28,450 --> 00:56:29,570
Self-love.

828
00:56:29,570 --> 00:56:32,350
Self-pitty.

829
00:56:32,510 --> 00:56:35,490
Self-love.

830
00:56:38,110 --> 00:56:39,510
Self.

831
00:56:40,570 --> 00:56:41,970
Self.

832
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:41,970


833
00:56:47,070 --> 00:56:48,470
Self.

834
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:07,270
Um, uh, excuse me, um, um, uh, excuse me, um...

835
00:57:11,430 --> 00:57:16,630
Thank you, Sheridan, for providing that subgenius barrage.

836
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:18,210
That's the third one he sent.

837
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:22,950
There's a fourth one here also, and he says there are two more on the way.

838
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:26,150
I think he's having fun editing these.

839
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:31,170
It was really fun for me the first 35 years.

840
00:57:34,150 --> 00:57:41,410
Uh, anyway, friends, it's not too late to be saved and board the saucers rather than fry in hell on earth.

841
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:47,970
And the only thing you need to know about how to do that is subgenius.com.

842
00:57:49,630 --> 00:57:54,850
Now, it's possible that some folks are hearing me on the radio in prison.

843
00:57:54,850 --> 00:57:58,970
And can't get on the internet or whatever.

844
00:57:59,870 --> 00:58:01,630
So here's our mailing address.

845
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:10,550
And, and, uh, depending on how you approach us, we, we have some sympathy for the prisoner.

846
00:58:10,910 --> 00:58:12,330
Well, some prisoners.

847
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:23,810
Uh, and that address is subgenius, post office box 807, Glen Rose, Texas.

848
00:58:26,990 --> 00:58:27,630
76043.

849
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:35,730
And, uh, and that'll about do it.

850
00:58:36,590 --> 00:58:37,510
I reckon.

851
00:58:38,590 --> 00:58:40,090
Praise that old man, Bob.

852
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:43,830
And thanks for listening, listener.

853
00:58:44,950 --> 00:58:49,850
You poor bastard or bastardette or whatever.
