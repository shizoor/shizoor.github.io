1
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:18,380
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

2
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:32,220
The Church of the Subgenius bring you another 33 minutes of condensed, uraglic function over

3
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:41,520
the quality audio-visual techniques exacerbated and complicated by The Church of the Subgenius,

4
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:44,740
copyright 1985-86.

5
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,920
And then there's that pesky rumor of a talking elephant in Russia.

6
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,840
Are we going to let the communists get ahead of us with a talking elephant?

7
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,000
Well, that's irrelevant.

8
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,120
You're here.

9
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,300
We're listening.

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:05,440
A talking relevant?

11
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:06,380
We're just talking, that's all.

12
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,560
They say that this elephant, that the Ruskies have, can mimic human speech.

13
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,060
Okay, what happened?

14
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,100
Step into the light.

15
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:17,260
I have received miscellaneous materials.

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,140
Okay.

17
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,960
They're real slow because they've got these...

18
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,500
I've seen Danish pornography advertisements.

19
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,940
They're just a strike, actually.

20
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:23,800
They're combas, really.

21
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,160
They're Bolivians that are important to do the work.

22
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,120
There is the truth of the rumor that there is a strike going on in the Subgenius Church.

23
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:35,860
Their whole goal is to put a microchip underneath the skin of a person's hand or forehead.

24
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:46,060
And I was pretty amazed because that's exactly what the book of Revelation says, chapter 13, chapter 13, chapter 13.

25
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,620
There are people out there who are musicians.

26
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:52,920
They may well like to be involved in a group, a specialty group that tours and reaches people for Christ.

27
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,400
How can they get a life?

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,720
They're very loving, gentle little people.

29
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,420
Yes.

30
00:01:58,080 --> 00:02:00,100
There's something terribly wrong with them.

31
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:00,800
How do you mean?

32
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,860
They seem to have the minds of five-year-olds.

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,920
How do you expect them to be?

34
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:05,540
Far ahead of us, of course.

35
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,000
Incredibly ahead of us in knowledge and in science.

36
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,260
Look at them.

37
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,220
Children.

38
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,400
They seem happy.

39
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:12,740
There's this huge garden of theirs.

40
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,280
If the Lord is going to come again, well, what's going to happen to my mother?

41
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:19,280
So pink and hard.

42
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,840
And remains of a coming...

43
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,600
Peace.

44
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,660
Happy New Year.

45
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,580
Happy New Year, friends.

46
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,040
The sun's sent us off.

47
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,460
Take your little babies full of cash and don't...

48
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,600
Happy, frappy...

49
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,460
Oh, we already did the New Year show.

50
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,880
Well, this is Chaz's New Year show, friend.

51
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,900
New Baby 1999 comes crawling around the...

52
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,760
Oh, that was last...

53
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,600
That was our last show and his last show at the same time.

54
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,900
And the old man, 1998, with his broken body...

55
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,840
And this is show number 667, dear friends.

56
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,660
We actually made it past that fateful show.

57
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,100
Speaking of shows, we just heard some of old, old show from the olden days.

58
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:15,660
Puzzling evidence show with Dr. Howell and, in this case, Glass Madness.

59
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,200
Yes.

60
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,320
Gary Gebrog-Fran and The Lies and...

61
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,640
And E. Einstein.

62
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,620
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:44,480
It's a new last countdown to X-Day, friends.

64
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,700
Praise Bob.

65
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,300
A new...

66
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,280
Last...

67
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,140
Year.

68
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,800
From the beginning

69
00:03:56,440 --> 00:04:00,560
Turn off your mind

70
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,660
Relax

71
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:05,260
And float downstream

72
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,740
It is not dying

73
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,580
It is not dying

74
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:24,840
Lay down all thoughts

75
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,880
Surrender to the void

76
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,620
It is shining

77
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,000
It is shining

78
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,580
New Baby 1999 comes crawling around the...

79
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:47,580


80
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:47,580


81
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:47,580


82
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:47,580


83
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:47,580


84
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:47,580


85
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:47,580


86
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:47,580


87
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:47,580


88
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:47,580


89
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:48,480
Evening

90
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:52,740
His machine guns in one hand and the crack pipe in the other.

91
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,260
And the old man in 1998 with his broken bob pipe and his crashed saucer.

92
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,620
Go watering.

93
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,720
Go down into the pond...

94
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,020
His paint feathers, yeah.

95
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,460
Into the pond.

96
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,860
Into the pond with old man time.

97
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:11,740
I was just wondering to see what we can do about getting the pornography out of our stores.

98
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:17,580
What it was I just walked in a store ten minutes ago, and they had pornography magazines playing up our stories.

99
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:22,680
in view right over the counter nothing covering them up or yeah they're making money off lights

100
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,480
at the end of the time yeah you can focus on the light at the end of the tunnel yeah

101
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:35,900
that big that four foot bomb bomb bomb at the end of the tunnel

102
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:51,940

I promised I'd take him to the doll drop.

123
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,420
Hey, radio is a heartbreak, B-man.

124
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,060
You're the night emperor now.

125

New format coming up the M-bone.

re-baptized, up all night.

129
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,840
Talk radio.

130
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,540
It takes a village to raise the dead.

131
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,500
Ha, ha, ha.

132
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,540
I'm Lord Eddie Beaverbrook,

133
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,760

137
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,920
So read them the gospel slip.

138
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:28,660
Thanks, boss. Hey, put yourself down under this.

139
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,200
It's a horned dog of Babylon,

140
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,760
struggle snuff, smother set,

141
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,960
insult for slack claw.

142
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,600
You'd prophesize the price at a thousand dollars,

143
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,420
but read my forehead.

144
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,340
Six, sixty-six,

145
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:41,460
sixty-six.

146
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,980
Rise now.

147
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,220
For I come to your bedroom

148
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,480
with my long rod

149
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,780
to measure you for the last bed

150
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,220
you'll ever need.

151
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,100
Okay, mooch. We got them all.

152
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,640
You tell them, little Eddie.

153
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:57,740
I said it, Dad. I'm up to my gonads

154
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:59,880
in Rapture Sauce, Christian Slater's,

155
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,500
Lamb of God's, Downey Jr.'s,

156
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:02,700
and Seven Sealy's at

157
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:04,980
Unconscious Village.

158
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,980
I am asleep.

159
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:07,800
You are.

160
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:11,660
You are asleep.

161
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:12,580
Run out.

162
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,760
Friend, where will you be when your tape runs out?

163
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,640
Will you be on hand?

164
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,320
Who's gonna flip your tape?

165
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,020
You can pay Bob to flip your tape.

166
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,300
It's next year, man.

167
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,580
It's next year here.

168
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,240
It's the future.

169
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:29,920
Chaz, can you believe that we live to see 1999?

170
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,220
Yeah, I was just telling Michelle that

171
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,280
when I was a little kid.

172
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:36,380
You know, I figured out how old I...

173
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,860
Oh, I'll be this many years old

174
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:39,860
in the year 2000.

175
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,660
And just think what life will be like then.

176
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,440
We'll be living on the moon.

177
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,040
Yeah.

178
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:48,560
We'll be flying around with jetpacks

179
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,800
and we'll have anti-gravity shoes.

180
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,800
And, God, life will be so cool

181
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:54,900
in the year 2000

182
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,740
and I'll be like 42 years old.

183
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,620
You know?

184
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,200
And, wow, that'll be cool.

185
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,100
I'll probably be like some real jet-setter

186
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:05,020
kind of a, you know, swinging single guy

187
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,280
that you might see

188
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,600
in a George Jetson cartoon

189
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:10,640
or something, you know.

190
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,400
And it's true.

191
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,340
And, uh,

192
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,700
and it all came true.

193
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,180
Yeah.

194
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,220
A year early.

195
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:20,060
But the cities were supposed to look like

196
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,200
in the Jetsons, you know.

197
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,680
All the cities are supposed to look

198
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,800
different, but they don't.

199
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:26,560
They look just the same.

200
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,620
If lightning is the thought may be,

201
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:30,300
it could happen.

202
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,820
The sun will become dark,

203
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,000
the moon blood red,

204
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,960
the stars of the heavens will fall,

205
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,500
there'll be two major earthquakes

206
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,480
that are going to become,

207
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:44,060
the islands and the mountains

208
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:45,620
are shaken out of their sockets,

209
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,400
and the second one, no island,

210
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,640
no mountain was found

211
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:49,720
in the face of the earth.

212
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,760
It's all coming.

213
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,300
The last skit that they had

214
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:56,240
was these two guys, employees there,

215
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,220
actually a couple of supervisors

216
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,820
of the store,

217
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,780
dressed up as women,

218
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,420
and they did their little skit

219
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,460
in part that one of the guys

220
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,580
actually kissed the other guy.

221
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,200
What was the point of this?

222
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,480
The skit was customer service.

223
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,200
Each wave.

224
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,940
Each wave left over from the Big Bang

225
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,660
peak to peak

226
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,120
is 300 million light years,

227
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,680
and you could surf that wave

228
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,580
if you have the right equipment.

229
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,880
You've got a real good guitar and amp.

230
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:28,500
Yeah.

231
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,340
And the right feedback plug-in.

232
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:31,720
Yeah.

233
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:34,120
And the right state of mind.

234
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,520
You get in the tube.

235
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,480
Yeah.

236
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,840
Not the tube of the universal wave, baby.

237
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:42,640
Slide into the new millennium.

238
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,100
Skate on in.

239
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,340
To be totally tubular.

240
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:59,200
It is so totally tubular,

241
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,240
and we have some news,

242
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,520
and we have some prophecy.

243
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:07,080
It's an hour of prophecy, dear friends,

244
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,840
and this music in the background

245
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:11,600
is Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

246
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,100
We've also been listening to

247
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,500
Chaz Smith's edits

248
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,820
of Einstein's Secret Orchestra, Volume 12,

249
00:12:19,820 --> 00:12:21,240
New Year 1999.

250
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,980
We heard some Firesign Theater

251
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,780
from their new album,

252
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,860
Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death.

253
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,780
And we've been hearing

254
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,900
the original Subgenius Radio show,

255
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:37,060
which even predates Hour of Slack,

256
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,860
although I was on their first shows.

257
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,300
The KPFA,

258
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,280
once a subgenius,

259
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,760
less than an hour show.

260
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:53,140
Mars Climate Orbiter,

261
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,480
Mission Stats,

262
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,940
December 28, 1998.

263
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,480
Now this is some suppressed news, friends.

264
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,620
Earlier today,

265
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,780
Mars Climate Orbiter

266
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,720
attempted to fulfill its prime objective,

267
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:07,300
that of photographing and studying

268
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:09,960
the enigmatic face on Mars.

269
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,720
As it attempted to do so,

270
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,180
high intensity laser beams flashed

271
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,580
from the eyes of the face,

272
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:17,440
severely crippling the orbiter.

273
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,440
At the same time,

274
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,940
hordes of flying craft

275
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:23,320
exited the mouth of the face

276
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,860
and began an attack of the orbiter

277
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:28,060
with relatively conventional weaponry.

278
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:28,980
Caught unaware,

279
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,080
NASA was helpless to put up a defense

280
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,940
due largely to the time delay

281
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:35,380
caused by the great distance.

282
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,020

NASA.jpl.nasa.gov

286
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,160
Uh, yes, uh, it's a...

287
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:47,620
Friend,

288
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:53,320
as we leave these holiday periods behind

289
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,700
in the washrags of time,

290
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,300
you have to ask yourself,

291
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,600
would you lie to the United States government

292
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,080
about your sex life?

293
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,460
I would,

294
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,820
but only if the government asked me

295
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:08,100
about my sex life.

296
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,620
And, you know, I think that if...

297
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:14,040
William Jefferson Clinton

298
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,620
was a real man,

299
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,880
a Republican,

300
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,260
Monica Lewinsky and Linda Tripp

301
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,900
would both be with Jack Ruby

302
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,420
and Lee Harvey Oswald

303
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,360
or else where in concrete pumps

304
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,300
at the bottom of the Chesapeake Bay,

305
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,720
then we never would have heard

306
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,940
about any of this stuff.

307
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,840
Oh, also in the news,

308
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:32,540
dear friends,

309
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,700
I finished editing

310
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:37,740
the X-Day video documentary

311
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:39,960
two-hour version.

312
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,640
I'm not trying to...

313
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,160
hawk or sell anything.

314
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,860
I just am proud

315
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,620
that I did finish that

316
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,260
this last weekend.

317
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,940
Uh, Washington, D.C.,

318
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,780
in a surprise announcement

319
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,400
with wide-ranging implications

320
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,980
for United States narcotics policy,

321
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
Drug Enforcement Administration Director

322
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,720
Thomas Constantine

323
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:04,780
acknowledged Monday

324
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,340
that some winners

325
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,560
may occasionally use drugs.

326
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,460
Apparently, said Constantine,

327
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:11,700
it's not just drugs.

328
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:11,940
It's also the drug industry.

329
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,200
He's addressing reporters

330
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,920
at Justice Department headquarters.

331
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:15,720
Contrary to the DEA's

332
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,380
long-standing conviction,

333
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:19,440
drug use may not be limited

334
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,580
solely to the domain of losers.

335
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,560
It appears that some successful Americans

336
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,580
have experimented with illegal narcotics as well.

337
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,680
The announcement was the result

338
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,080
of a comprehensive three-year DEA study

339
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,780
of more than 40,000 U.S. winners,

340
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:38,220
including thousands of successful business execs,

341
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,920
doctors, lawyers, scientists,

342
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:40,580
and the like.

343
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:41,700
The study is a success.

344
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:41,700


345
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:41,700


346
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:41,700


347
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:41,700


348
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:41,700


349
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:41,700


350
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:41,700


351
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:41,700


352
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:41,700


353
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:41,700


354
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:41,700


355
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:43,320
The study, originally designed by the DEA

356
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:46,020
to help shed light on the qualities shared by winners

357
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,020
that make them resistant to drugs,

358
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:51,960
instead revealed that over 71% of winners

359
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,620
had at one time or another

360
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,540
experimented with controlled substances.

361
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,240
He said it remains unclear

362
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,300
why winners who enjoy successful, productive careers

363
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:03,780
and feelings of love and acceptance from their families

364
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,160
would choose to engage in drug use.

365
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,120
Time and time again, he said,

366
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,680
DEA tests have shown that no feelings of love,

367
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:11,780
hatred, or hatred

368
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:12,540
you can get from drugs

369
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,360
could be better than the great feeling

370
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,060
you get from being a winner.

371
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,040
Why a heart surgeon, architect,

372
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,960
or straight-A student would use drugs

373
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:23,560
when his senses are already enormously heightened

374
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:26,860
by the high that comes from being a winner

375
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,420
is beyond me.

376
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,820
And it goes on and on.

377
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,680
Winners seem to have an unknown quality

378
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:35,360
that enables them to use drugs

379
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,420
and keep on winning.

380
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,540
It goes against everything we know about drugs,

381
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:41,260
but many of the drug-taking winners we studied

382
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:41,660
did not win.

383
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,680
They did not, in fact, become losers.

384
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,760
Well, they're going to change.

385
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,820
As a result of the study, it says here,

386
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,940
the agency ordered a recall of a bunch of U.S. video games

387
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:02,760
which will be reprogrammed with a new altered on-screen message

388
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:05,540
from former FBI Director William Sessions.

389
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,620
The new screen will say,

390
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:07,980
quote,

391
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:11,100
Very few winners use drugs.

392
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:13,580
The agency will say,

393
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:16,760
I'm not sure where that news report came from, dear friends,

394
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:19,900
but more important than the news is the prophecy.

395
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,520
The prophecy, friends,

396
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,200
when a subgenius minister goes into the spirit,

397
00:17:24,300 --> 00:17:25,060
like Bob did.

398
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,760
Bob paved the way for us, friends.

399
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,560
In 1953, when he underwent his immaculation

400
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,020
at the hands of Jehovah One,

401
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:34,800
the alien space god from some corporate sin galaxy,

402
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:39,020
Bob went into the spirit and he saw X-Day.

403
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:39,960
He saw the prophecy.

404
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,580
He saw, like a big movie,

405
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:41,800
he saw the holy screen.

406
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,380
And most recently,

407
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,260
our good friend,

408
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,200
Popes Lilith von Frau Mensch,

409
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:51,240
has, well, as it says here,

410
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,000
decoded from background noise

411
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,480
using anti-sleep driven delusivination techniques

412
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:02,500
on January 13th, 1999.

413
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:05,120
Some of these may already have happened.

414
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:08,200
Nobody says prophecy had to predict the future.

415
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:08,860
All right, friends,

416
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:13,320
now I can't say this in Popes Lilith's husky voice.

417
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:15,040
I'll have to use my own husky voice,

418
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:19,640
but let's let Einstein's secret orchestra

419
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,620
establish the rug here.

420
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,380
Predictions, 1999.

421
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:35,820
Planet-wide,

422
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,140
excess-induced gut blowout

423
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:40,240
blamed on millennial hysteria,

424
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,800
televised and outlawed.

425
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,280
Prophecy number two,

426
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,020
millions sign over power of attorney

427
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:51,100
and social security benefits to aerospace firm

428
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:54,080
in exchange for one-way tickets to the moon.

429
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,840
First lunar slave colony,

430
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:57,760
highly successful,

431
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,660
but eventually nuked by the UN.

432
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,260
Got to start to kind of feel like Criswell.

433
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:06,640
Um,

434
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:09,880
can you prove it didn't happen?

435
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,580
Lennon and Mal clones will be decanted

436
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:19,240
and Mick Comey's franchise is in the deep south within a year.

437
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:25,220
White stones of Muom discovered in the Pacific Ocean.

438
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:29,700
Muom reveals that its location was preparation for a new deluge.

439
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:33,140
Muom already here on Earth?

440
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:33,720
Could it be?

441
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,420
This is not mentioned in Revelation.

442
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:37,980
Nor a book of the subgenius.

443
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,280
An inner cabal of excess

444
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:42,920
attempting to stop the rupture

445
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,180
executed,

446
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,360
reported by the conspiracy media as

447
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,400
meteor shower.

448
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,980
The subgenius movie gets financing

449
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:58,340
but is suppressed and used as pornography

450
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,300
by Hollywood moguls.

451
00:20:00,380 --> 00:20:03,940
Used as the source for movie rip-offs for next decades.

452
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,180
Popes Lilith,

453
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,360
I got news for ya.

454
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,800
That happened in 1983.

455
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,300
And the results were

456
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:12,320
Running Man,

457
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,200
Total Recall,

458
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,260
and I can't remember a couple of others.

459
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:17,180
They were all Schwarzenegger.

460
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:18,660
Terminator also.

461
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,900
Okay, random Bobby videotapes moguls having sex

462
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:25,040
while the subgenius movie plays in the background.

463
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:27,320
Wins Oscar, donates percentage to church.

464
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,840
Well, that sounds silly to me.

465
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:30,520
But it would be great.

466
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,640
Um,

467
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,160
D. Rose, commitment to the church.

468
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:35,940
Mass suicide.

469
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,480
Major earthquakes throughout the Pacific Rim.

470
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,900
Corpses of these creatures

471
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,200
found by Brazilian street youth

472
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,760
who wear the carapace as protection

473
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,720
from police and pedophiles.

474
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,300
Brazilian street urchins wearing the carapaces of

475
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,300
D. Rose,

476
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,940
supersonic Nazi hell creatures from beneath the hollow earth.

477
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,160
Dead ones.

478
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
Blown up to the surface.

479
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:04,260
Okay, Little Rock resident charged with

480
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,420
assassinating Clinton.

481
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,800
Murdered the next day on television by Vince Foster.

482
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,220
Clinton assassination proved to be a hoax.

483
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:12,700
Uh,

484
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,580
Friends, the future holds,

485
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,600
well, this is, I gotta admit,

486
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,800
it does sound a little bit like Weekly World News

487
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:22,980
and they do have better illustrations with theirs.

488
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,020
But, friends, did you know that F.R.O.P.

489
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:28,400
cures AIDS, neurological disorders, and cancer?

490
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:31,120
Stephen Hawking will be completely healed

491
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,240
and present a perfectly rational, yet spiritual,

492
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,580
compelling reason to send $30

493
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:41,360
to Post Office Box 140306,

494
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,400
Dallas, Texas 75214.

495
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:47,180
Hawking later contracts Tourette's Syndrome

496
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
induced by F.R.O.P. thera-

497
00:21:49,180 --> 00:21:50,460
Oh, well, um,

498
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,880
A one, a two, three, a-

499
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,560
Okay, maybe this one will do.

500
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:13,780
Cause I want to get to the real deal

501
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:15,200
and release the bad gaming jerks

502
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,740
almost Влад fucking

503
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,220
policejugger

504
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,260
lack the killer

505
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,180
oficking

506
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,340
faculty

507
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,400
let's five

508
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:20,620
you 5

509
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:24,220
you oficking

510
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:26,300
claim to be heroes or gods.

511
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,380
But you guys are good.

512
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:29,900
If you tune in to any

513
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,520
religious station up here right now,

514
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,000
they're all talking about, you know,

515
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,000
in revelations it says that this will happen.

516
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,180
Yes, there will be

517
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,800
enemies fighting the true

518
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,980
believers. And we see this

519
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,720
has come true only for the first time

520
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,700
right now, this year. Yeah, this one guy

521
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,940
yesterday, man. There will be corrupt politicians. Uh-huh, see?

522
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:49,840
They want to implant those chips

523
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,360
inside your head. That's it.

524
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,980
Women will wear pants.

525
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:55,380
This has been prophesied.

526
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,640
And men will have long hair.

527
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,100
Fool me once, shame on you.

528
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,620
Fool me twice, shame on me.

529
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:02,860
Fool me one game on me.

530
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,560
Fool me twice, shame on you.

531
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,360
Shame on you.

532
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,560
There is many levels of consciousness

533
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,560
available to the human being

534
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,600
as there are structures

535
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,340
and atomical organs

536
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:18,880
inside the body

537
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,600
for decoding

538
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,360
different sorts of energies.

539
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,480
The DNA.

540
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:25,500
DNA scattered all over the place.

541
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,340
Not just in level C or level T

542
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:29,240
or level X.

543
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,320
In the beginning,

544
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,820
God created the heavens

545
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:34,080
and the earth.

546
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,420
The earth was without form and void

547
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:39,160
and darkness was on the face of the deep

548
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,440
and the spirit of God

549
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,360
was hovering over the face of the waters.

550
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:45,040
The waters under the

551
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,300
build your own

552
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,040
rocket ship.

553
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:51,700
Yeah, coming up on next day,

554
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:53,460
we're going to be putting on...

555
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,040
our little flight suits

556
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,840
and strapping ourselves in.

557
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,460
If you know what I mean.

558
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,400
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.

559
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:07,440
What is the war?

560
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,840
Revolution.

561
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:09,540
Revolution.

562
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:10,480
99.

563
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:11,580
99.

564
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:13,320
99.

565
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,360
99.

566
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,140
99.

567
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:15,920
99.

568
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,140
99.

569
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:17,820
99.

570
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:18,260
99.

571
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,480
Now, it's the double thought,

572
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,320
double time,

573
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:23,600
double time news.

574
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,780
With the all night Radio Now news team.

575
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:29,560
With late afternoon twice gimme award nominee,

576
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,640
Harold Hippucker.

577
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,520
And Kiwanis honorable mention,

578
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,800
international toast master,

579
00:24:34,040 --> 00:24:34,980
runner up emeritus,

580
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,180
Ray Hamburger.

581
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,440
Twice the experience,

582
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,960
two times the coverage,

583
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,340
double the now.

584
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,560
And the terrible news drought continues.

585
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,700
Yes, that's right, Ray.

586
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,480
Could I refresh your coffee?

587
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,340
Oh, no, no, don't touch that coffee machine.

588
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,220
There's one of those...

589
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,260
There's a lot of chips in it.

590
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,460
Well, what's a little chip, Ray?

591
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,860
After all, it's seen a lot of hard late night use.

592
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,320
I'm talking silicone chips.

593
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:02,040
You know, the great crash that's coming.

594
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,240
You mean the computer Armageddon

595
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,620
could queer our coffee machine?

596
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:11,240
Next day, next day, next day.

597
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,040
Next day, next day, next day.

598
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,860
Next day, next day, next day.

599
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:25,620
We'll fly away, fly away, fly away.

600
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:30,660
Our next day, next day, next day.

601
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,800
Just talking about the plan,

602
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,200
things fall apart you don't understand.

603
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,420
It's a scary religion.

604
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,340
Okay, Bob was going to run for big brother in 1984,

605
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:42,600
but Wotan has decreed that he will lose.

606
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,120
Oh, bone your breath.

607
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,960
Hey, Doug.

608
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,080
Let's build a spaceship out of spare parts.

609
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:49,260
We can fly back.

610
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,840
I'm sure we can put it back.

611
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:51,200
We can put it together.

612
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:52,280
There's enough for the ship left.

613
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,180
You made a show out of broken parts.

614
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:55,700
Stuck together with ice cream and yogurt.

615
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,360
Yeah, Paul, get started.

616
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,140
We can draw a windshield.

617
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,580
We can use the stereo.

618
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,540
Yeah, there's enough wire in there.

619
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:03,680
Make a magneto.

620
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,160
That'll give us directional.

621
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,380
Come on, Gary, you start painting the gangway.

622
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,540
Okay, we can use these old bicycle tires

623
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,880
for the power drives.

624
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:12,960
And there's this old mini prow.

625
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,200
We can make that for the wings.

626
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,800
We'll get back to the station.

627
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,060
And we'll...

628
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:19,540
Nelson will be so happy to see us.

629
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:19,720
Yeah.

630
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,420
He thought he missed us,

631
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:22,480
but we're here on this little tape.

632
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,000
We'll fly back on this tape.

633
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,600
Yeah, this program's his baby.

634
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,020
We'll save you, Bob.

635
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,600
Just keep talking.

636
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:27,620
Well, come on, Paul.

637
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,380
Help me pull the stereo in here.

638
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:29,600
Don't talk.

639
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:30,240
Just play sound effects.

640
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,660
Here, take this guitar neck

641
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,920
and nail it up there to help.

642
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:33,640
I can make a microphone

643
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,880
out of these old stupid wires.

644
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,760
I feel seriously ill.

645
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,240
There must be some terrible mistake.

646
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:39,100
Stop.

647
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:39,680
They're calling me.

648
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:39,860
Wait a minute.

649
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:39,940
Wait, look.

650
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,820
What's going on?

651
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:40,980
What's going on with Hal?

652
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,060
We can use the vomit

653
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,020
to stick together the...

654
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:43,800
The stuff.

655
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,660
Are you getting ready

656
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:46,700
for next day, children?

657
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:48,340
Yeah, I spent today

658
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,020
building two more rocket ships.

659
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:50,600
I did.

660
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,100
Yeah, they're big ones, too.

661
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,720
I found a place I can get

662
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,900
some big motors at.

663
00:26:57,180 --> 00:26:58,260
So, uh...

664
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,660
Yeah, are you building your ship?

665
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,340
Because come next day,

666
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:06,740
July 5th, 1999,

667
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,220
and it's coming.

668
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:09,540
It's coming quick.

669
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,160
Uh, Dos Equis.

670
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,760
Next day.

671
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:17,240
Get in the now mobile van, Hal.

672
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,220
You're scheduled to do

673
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,280
what you showed in that remote.

674
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,080
I...

675
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,140
Yes, there's that secret

676
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,220
militia kook

677
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:22,860
you're supposed to interview.

678
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,260
Well, what are you waiting for?

679
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,200
Well, it's nighttime,

680
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:26,760
and it's scary.

681
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:28,080
Yeah, so is unemployment.

682
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,720
The van won't start.

683
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,280
Hey, Hal.

684
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,540
I've got the keys

685
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,620
to the now mobile van

686
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,400
here in the booth.

687
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,500
Well, it still needs gas.

688
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,180
Well, you could use

689
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:36,380
our U.S. Plus card here.

690
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,580
Yes, well, uh,

691
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,140
I'm catching a cold.

692
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,980
I'll see you back at the condo.

693
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:41,660
Go to commercial.

694
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:44,940
It's coming.

695
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:46,180
It's coming.

696
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:47,640
It's coming.

697
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:48,320
It's coming.

698
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,320


699
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,320


700
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,320


701
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:48,320


702
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,700
Slowly.

703
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,560
Very slowly.

704
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:57,360
To a theater.

705
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,880
Here, here.

706
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,340
Glacier.

707
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,080
It's getting cold

708
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:10,000
in the booth, man.

709
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,740
All alone,

710
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,800
working all night.

711
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,120
All right, anyway,

712
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:14,300
Glacier, the movie,

713
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,080
coming to the Fun Fun Google Blacks

714
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,820
at Dead Center sometime...

715
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,300
I'll have to go,

716
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


717
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


718
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


719
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


720
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


721
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


722
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


723
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


724
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


725
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


726
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


727
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


728
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


729
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


730
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,300


731
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:18,420
but you should know.

732
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:18,460
Mm, mm-hmm.

733
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,280
In the new millennium.

734
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:20,600
When is the new millennium coming?

735
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,700
Well, you know,

736
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,540
we got our last chance

737
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:24,120
for traffic in this century.

738
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,440
Captain Happy Panda,

739
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,240
are you up there?

740
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,400
Flying high

741
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:28,360
with Captain Morgan.

742
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,100
Happy New Year.

743
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:29,960
Ooh, I wish we had

744
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,660
a couple of jiggers

745
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:31,400
of Captain Morgan

746
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,120
down here, man.

747
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
We were worried...

748
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:33,920


749
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,480
We were worried

750
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,980
we lost contact with you.

751
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,360
Yeah, just a magnetic anomaly.

752
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:38,580
A couple of whirly birds

753
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,240
got strangely attracted

754
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:40,760
up here.

755
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,880
Uh, Chopper Cop 12...

756
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,680
Uh, Chopper...

757
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:44,060
Just mounted

758
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:44,780
the Channel 86

759
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:45,420
Eye in the Sky.

760
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,220
You ever see dragonflies mating?

761
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,700
Oh, it's like dogs in the street.

762
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:50,280
I try not to watch.

763
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:54,340
So, Captain Happy, what's the latest on the pursuit of that red-headed babe?

764
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,320
Well, she's not the big star anymore, B.

765
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:58,000
It's the gridlock she created.

766
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:01,180
Now, listen, I've seen this metropervia brought to its knees before

767
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:05,400
by the invasion of the Promise Breakers, the seventh game of the seventh series.

768
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,560
Oh, yeah, and don't forget the reunion of the Rolling Dead.

769
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,240
I was there.

770
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,320
Yeah, if you were there, I'm surprised you remember it.

771
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,220
Who remembers anything?

772
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:14,060
I've never seen what I'm eyeballing below.

773
00:29:14,060 --> 00:29:17,980
Every road leading towards the homeless stadium is a zoo.

774
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:22,240
Could it be I see a camel smoking in a hot rod?

775
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,340
Swarms of multi-agent machines.

776
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,340
Must be cloners and grasshoppers as big as houses.

777
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,620
Millions of motoring martyrs.

778
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,520
Oh, they're the worst drivers in the county.

779
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:34,840
Oh, man, I guess everybody's going to the doll drop but me, huh?

780
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,900
Yeah, radio is a heartbreak, Bob.

781
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:42,300
And on top of everything, which is where I am, there's the weather.

782
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,140
Oh, boy.

783
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:45,500
Clouds as thick as sheep uber.

784
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,420
Roiling out of the west as the sun smells into an ocean of tang.

785
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,380
Turning the shitty into an altar of friendly fire.

786
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,440
Whoa, what's that?

787
00:29:53,620 --> 00:29:54,100
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

788
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:57,200
Four corporate birds just played chicken with me.

789
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,040
Cowboys and the Apocalypse.

790
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:03,260
Well, I'm told it's the four cowboys and the apocalypse heading into headline the big to-do tonight.

791
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,320
Oh, that's a great band.

792
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:05,400
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

793
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,480
Here comes the hail.

794
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,060
Bangs and eyeballs.

795
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:10,500
Yeah, yeah, my rotors are icing up.

796
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,160
It's not nice.

797
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:13,120
This is Captain Hattie.

798
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


799
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


800
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


801
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


802
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


803
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:13,120


804
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:17,520
Happy in the strangely vulnerable news now chopper.

805
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,300
I gotta go pick up some dolls.

806
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:19,580
Oh.

807
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:23,860
Fly away, fly away, fly away.

808
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:28,640
The next day, next de doce que.

809
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,120
Yes, children.

810
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:34,460
Are you building your pleasure ship?

811
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,640
Are you building your rocket ship?

812
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:43,120
Are you walking, immersing yourself into the solid rocket field?

813
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:52,940
Will you be there when the pleasure ships are coming down on next day?

814
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:58,220
Fly away, fly away, fly away.

815
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:03,040
Fly away, fly away, fly away.

816
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:08,080
On next day, next day, next day.

817
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:12,780
Fly away, fly away, fly away.

818
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,100
Yeah.

819
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,720
Oh, yeah.

820
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:22,680
Bob said it.

821
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,380
I smoked it.

822
00:31:24,860 --> 00:31:26,360
That settles it.

823
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,100
Could you turn your ship just a little, Tim?

824
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:35,080
We've never really been involved in delivery systems, only in the payload.

825
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,520
In a payload, huh?

826
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:37,960
Yeah.

827
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,060
Yeah.

828
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,060


829
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,060


830
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,060


831
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,060


832
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,060


833
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,060


834
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,060


835
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,060


836
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,060


837
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,060


838
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,060


839
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,060


840
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,140
Yeah.

841
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:43,000
And actually, the kind that we're talking about, you'd just carry it in in a briefcase

842
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,260
rather than launch it in a rocket.

843
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:52,120
It's the kind that you would leave under the refreshment stand restroom counter at Nancy

844
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,120


845
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,360
Well, how long would it last under the refrigerator?

846
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:59,140
Do you think it would last a couple weeks before it started getting moldy or what?

847
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,820
Before you had to call it the DEA guys?

848
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:03,120
I mean, the tobacco and firearms guys?

849
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,700
A month or two or something?

850
00:32:04,700 --> 00:32:04,900
No.

851
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,820
Actually, you'd have to call the...

852
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:08,040
The DEA?

853
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,040


854
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,040


855
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:12,980
You'd have to call the Department of Defense to defuse these little babies.

856
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:14,340
I thought it was the...

857
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:15,020
No, we're not...

858
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:16,780
Maybe we're talking about two different things.

859
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:23,200
I'm talking about what we want to put on the top of Chaz's rocket at some point just for

860
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:23,680
protection.

861
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,480
I thought it was like a carry on top of a Sunday.

862
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,820
You know, I mean, the main reason to build your own ship is to get off the planet.

863
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:29,880
Is to get off.

864
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,420
And to escape.

865
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,480
To escape.

866
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:32,540
Earth.

867
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:33,320
Yeah.

868
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:37,300
Even if you have to go inside, either way...

869
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:37,880
Earth.

870
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,580
We must get off.

871
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:40,060
But...

872
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,060


873
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:40,060


874
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,640
Another thing that you can use...

875
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:41,880
We must get off.

876
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:48,000
You can build your own ship for is to deliver weapons to your enemies or germ warfare or

877
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:48,260
whatnot.

878
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,200
And not that we want to...

879
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,240
As subgeniuses, we wouldn't necessarily want to do that except unless we happen to be Holocaustals

880
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,340
or Evangelicals.

881
00:32:58,340 --> 00:32:58,660
Earth.

882
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,920
We must get off.

883
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:00,460
Earth.

884
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,880
Princess Wee?

885
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,420
Yes.

886
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:07,300
Are you in Cleveland or did you make it all the way to the great rabbit hutch in space?

887
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:12,440
Oh, I'm actually far, far, far away in...

888
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,360
You made it?

889
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,280
Into orbit?

890
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:16,060
Yes.

891
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,380
I got off.

892
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,620
We all must...

893
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,360
Get off!

894
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,180
We all must follow.

895
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,240
Earth...

896
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,860
I'm beaming in from a place that I can't even begin to describe.

897
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:33,580
Just know that all is well in Wee's world.

898
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,880
Ahhh...

899
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,800
Sounds like she's in the toilet.

900
00:33:36,940 --> 00:33:37,280
Oh.

901
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


902
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


903
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


904
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


905
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


906
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


907
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


908
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


909
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


910
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


911
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


912
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


913
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


914
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


915
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:37,280


916
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,320
He has spoken.

917
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,000
Steal your own ship.

918
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,080
Building your own spaceship.

919
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:46,180
How about the idea of stealing another one that's already finished?

920
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,700
Steal your own ship.

921
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,400
Why did you contact us?

922
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,460
You contacted us.

923
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,700
We were just listening.

924
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,360
And there are others?

925
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,260
Many others.

926
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:01,220
Just like a little animal trying to get across the road.

927
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:04,120
It's an infernal opportunity for all of us.

928
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:08,780
This calling this show is like going across a modern highway with your only ship.

929
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:10,300
It's kind of like being in hell, you know?

930
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:14,680
By calling back, you have an option of actually showing up on the subgenius album someday.

931
00:34:14,680 --> 00:34:16,380
He finds his victory by begging the question.

932
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,860
Your voice could be used on almost anything, even this show.

933
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:22,500
Well, you know you're being tape recorded,

934
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:27,900
and your voice is going to be sent to almost every important member of the subgenius church within 24 hours.

935
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:33,740
So if you have anything really, really important to say to Philo or Stang

936
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,100
or anything,

937
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,060
you better say it real quick.

938
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,160
They're waiting to hear from you.

939
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:39,880
Use the present tense.

940
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:46,260
This might seem old-fashioned to some of you, but I'd like to join in on this song.

941
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:49,440
It's the kind of a sentimental song that you get at the end of a movie.

942
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:55,720
It's the kind of a song that people might sing to let you in the audience know that we really like you,

943
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,720
we care about you,

944
00:34:56,820 --> 00:35:01,920
we understand how hard it is to laugh these days

945
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,900
with all the terrible problems,

946
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:22,240
and we're not too ashamed to say what others feel.

947
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:23,200
So it's a very similar song to it.

948
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:23,200


949
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,940
are not completely satisfied.

950
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,860
It's a very different somehow.

951
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:26,800
It is a some different life.

952
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,860
It is on the different side of the remember.

953
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:27,980
It is,

954
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,100
We must get off.

955
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:29,680
Hey.

956
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,140
No, hey, kids.

957
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,800
We didn't go out here into space just for fun and games like that and to procreate.

958
00:35:37,820 --> 00:35:38,680
We need to...

959
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,680
Can we procreate out there, too?

960
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,700
We need to communicate with these aliens.

961
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,400
That's right.

962
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,760
But we must get off.

963
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:45,260
But there's no procreation involved?

964
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:47,940
And we must get off on the aliens.

965
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,020
How can we get off if there's no procreative thing going on?

966
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:51,860
The aliens got off on us.

967
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:52,980
Now it's our turn.

968
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:53,440
First get time on.

969
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,500
Yeah, the aliens got off on us.

970
00:35:55,500 --> 00:36:00,800
You see that big old alien doll face girl there with the six tentacles and legs?

971
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,840
Four million...

972
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,220
Laying there on that altar.

973
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:07,840
Four million years ago, the aliens got off on us, and now it's our turn.

974
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:08,360
That's right.

975
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,560
Now, Dave, you have to go get up on her and...

976
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:15,580
I don't want to get over on any 600-pound, 300-foot alien.

977
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,860
I don't want to get over on her being your one.

978
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,460
I can smell her now.

979
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:23,360
She's too close.

980
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,240
She's breathing down my neck.

981
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,260
I can feel the fine hairs growing.

982
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,580
Who would want to look forward to a future like that?

983
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:32,860
Come on, Sting, you know you're pulling everyone's tuber.

984
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,900
Those little special hairs are sort of like antennae, Dave.

985
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,360
Yeah, of course they're like antennae.

986
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:41,820
And they can tell a con artist from five zillion miles off.

987
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,120
And that's why my tiny little proboscis is standing on end right now.

988
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:47,960
I can sniff one with my testosterone also, Sting.

989
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:48,540
And I think...

990
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:51,060
Well, that's why I'm the only honest man in the world.

991
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,600
The honest J.R. Bob Dobbs is the one who has to go up and meet those aliens.

992
00:36:54,720 --> 00:36:55,020
And...

993
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,300
Close that deal.

994
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:00,320
That's why they don't trust you or me or the Rockefellers.

995
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,700
Or nobody.

996
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,440
Well, I'm glad the only one you can think of, Rockefeller, but here's the deal, pal.

997
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:12,500
I'm not quite so sure if I believe exactly what's going on with Bob Dobbs or with J.R. Bob Dobbs.

998
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:18,600
I believe he may, if not is, probably will or is a worse and bigger con artist than you is.

999
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,180
Well, he...

1000
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,200
I say that with all respect.

1001
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,500
Well, everyone is a con artist.

1002
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:25,960
Bob is...

1003
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:30,980
And that's why Bob is the most honest man in the world because he's the most pure.

1004
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:31,860
He's just the...

1005
00:37:31,860 --> 00:37:33,600
What you see is what you get.

1006
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:34,780
What you see is...

1007
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,980
Everybody else is a con artist.

1008
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,180
You're all conning yourselves.

1009
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,740
Everyone of you are bluffing.

1010
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,960
It's all a matter of bluff.

1011
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:45,340
You bluff people into thinking you know what you're doing and you bluff yourself into thinking you know what you're doing.

1012
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,020
Bob doesn't even pretend like that.

1013
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,420
You wanna go there?

1014
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,560
You wanna show?

1015
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,020
You wanna go there?

1016
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:02,420
Not you or me.

1017
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:06,200
Not you or me.

1018
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:09,980
Not you or me.

1019
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:13,940
We got different plans.

1020
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:17,760
Not you or me.

1021
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,720
You're capable of such beautiful dreams.

1022
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,480
And such horrible dreams.

1023
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:25,800
All nightmares.

1024
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:26,500
All nightmares.

1025
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,060
All nightmares.

1026
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,420
All nightmares.

1027
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:27,420


1028
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:28,140
All nightmares.

1029
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:28,680
Dreams.

1030
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,240
All nightmares.

1031
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:29,720
Dreams.

1032
00:38:30,040 --> 00:38:30,300
Dreams.

1033
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:30,780
Dreams.

1034
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:36,180
When we go into the second stage, which is the resistance stage, or we could call it the adaption stage.

1035
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:48,200
Now, other hormones are secreted and are responsible for the resistance reaction and they stimulate the conversion of protein to energy.

1036
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:49,340
Do you like dogs like that?

1037
00:38:49,640 --> 00:38:52,500
Deliver us from the wrath to come.

1038
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,200
To come.

1039
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:55,400
Deliver us from the wrath.

1040
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:56,240
To come.

1041
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:57,060
To come.

1042
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,780
What do you think about it?

1043
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,720
Was it worth it?

1044
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:58,940
Was it worth it?

1045
00:38:58,940 --> 00:38:59,560
What do you think about it?

1046
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:00,600
Was it worth it?

1047
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:00,760
Was it worth it?

1048
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:00,840
Was it worth it?

1049
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,220
We need to look for his coming.

1050
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,860
We need to be ready for his coming.

1051
00:39:03,940 --> 00:39:05,320
We need to love the coming.

1052
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,420
We need to be praying for the coming.

1053
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,420
Surely, I am coming.

1054
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:10,120
He could come.

1055
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:11,320
He could come.

1056
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:11,380
He could come.

1057
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:11,760
He could come.

1058
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:11,840
He could come.

1059
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:13,180
Astronauts report it feels good.

1060
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:17,880
It's night angel of the millennium.

1061
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,500
She's a dirty girl.

1062
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:20,960
Pardon vertical.

1063
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,520
Here's the four cowboys of the apocalypse on the road of polar ice.

1064
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:25,480
New Year's.

1065
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:27,820
Where is he, this freaking depressant?

1066
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:32,800
We're living one freaking depressant century and looking down the middle of a whole new freaking millennium.

1067
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,340
Do you want to get laced out of your skull?

1068
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,820
Remember what the suits at Polar Ice say.

1069
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:38,960
You're gonna binge.

1070
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,760
Don't binge alone.

1071
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:42,320
Polar Ice, it's yellow because you're not.

1072
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,240
Radio Tao.

1073
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,960
Well, but if it's not now, it's too late.

1074
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,160
I am bebop.

1075
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:57,200
I am the night emperor.

1076
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,440
I am the inside out man, little girl.

1077
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,580
All you little girls.

1078
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:03,780
I'm radio bebop, the hungry howler.

1079
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:04,200
Hmm.

1080
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,420
You know, I am actually hungry.

1081
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:10,020
Oh, you want some chow, emperor bee?

1082
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,220
I do not eat dogs.

1083
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,340
How about some gato, vato?

1084
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:18,160
And that's some great animal imagery, Mr. Producer.

1085
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:19,180
Listen, who's paying?

1086
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:20,420
Station's buying.

1087
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,720
It could be your last meal.

1088
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:25,460
Hey, if it's on the plus, man, I say we go with a deuce of 16 hours.

1089
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:25,460


1090
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:34,040
I'll make the call, Bee.

1091
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:34,720
All right.

1092
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:38,760
We're still alive and the clock is touching 5905.

1093
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:39,960
Man, only three hours to go.

1094
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,940
So let's catch up with Danny Vanilla shooting the stars in Fun Fun Town.

1095
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,120
Danny, where are you now, baby?

1096
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:52,400
With the immortals of celebrity, a pantheon of live-forevers for the benefit auction of

1097
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,600
the millennium.

1098
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,440
The very personal treasures from the princesses.

1099
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1100
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1101
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1102
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1103
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1104
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1105
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1106
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1107
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1108
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1109
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1110
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1111
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1112
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1113
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1114
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1115
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1116
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:55,440


1117
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:56,080
The princess goddess collection.

1118
00:40:56,360 --> 00:40:57,960
And they're all here.

1119
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:01,800
I'm very close to Jackie O'Pretty in a pink pillbox hat.

1120
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:03,480
She's sitting right down front next to Marilyn.

1121
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:06,160
And she's holding her pink pillbox in one hand.

1122
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,180
And she's waving that auction pad number 00 in the other.

1123
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:13,500
And there's Eleanor Roosevelt and the Duchess of Windsor.

1124
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,400
They're acting like teenagers, holding hands.

1125
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,920
And there's Judy and Gypsy and Ginger.

1126
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:20,540
Gone a la blonde.

1127
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,220
Oh, Marilyn's just got it.

1128
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,420
She's bought a gorgeous, beautiful, beautiful, solid silver dress.

1129
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:25,860
And she's got her empty marriage.

1130
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:27,020
What a catch.

1131
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:32,080
Monsieur, next item 15, a blue blood disco dress from the four lines of the house of

1132
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,080


1133
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:32,080


1134
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:33,280
It's a very, very beautiful dress.

1135
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:33,760
But I...

1136
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,300
Ladies and gentlemen, please, please.

1137
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,100
She's here.

1138
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,780
She's here.

1139
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:38,460
Mlle.

1140
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:38,960
Princess.

1141
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,060
We are honored.

1142
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,440
Bebop, she's right next to me.

1143
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,900
Well, don't panic, Danny.

1144
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:43,740
Just talk to her.

1145
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,040
Miss goddess, just one question.

1146
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:47,700
Have you seen my beautiful...

1147
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,280
I can tell you in a moment.

1148
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,680
It's to die for.

1149
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:50,580
But did you say...

1150
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,380
Wee-dee-dee-dee.

1151
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:51,820
Let's go.

1152
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:52,180
No, no.

1153
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,180
Didn't you say you loved me?

1154
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,160
Oh, please.

1155
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,880
Won't you stop pulling my string?

1156
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:58,700
But you need me.

1157
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:11,820

1159
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,500
Wars soon last only hours.

1160
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:28,980
But completely destroy the immediate area's ecosphere.

1161
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:32,640
Anti-pornography laws repealed.

1162
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:41,120
Firm pressured to produce clone breasts by radical lesbians and transsexuals.

1163
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:43,600
Men become number one buyers of breasts.

1164
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:52,560
T-shirts with greys shot between the eyes sold in shopping malls.

1165
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:59,480
Psychedelic subgenius band goes multi-platinum, blows off world tour, disappears into desert.

1166
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:05,540
UFO activity over Arizona increases to the point where it is no longer considered news.

1167
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:10,980
Currency replaced by tattoos.

The 666th Hour of Slack show goes on the air.

1172
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:42,600
Oh, that's not prophecy.

1173
00:43:42,660 --> 00:43:43,580
That happened a...

1174
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:44,360
That was...

1175
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:45,140
That was...

1176
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,220
That was...

1177
00:43:46,220 --> 00:43:47,040
That was...

1178
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:47,120
That was...

1179
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:48,680
The last...

1180
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:50,160
The end.

1181
00:43:50,420 --> 00:43:51,240
The final...

1182
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:53,360
The listeners know about Bob.

1183
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:53,660
Bob?

1184
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:53,660


1185
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:55,500
Well, maybe Bob is a yeti.

1186
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:57,160
Of course, maybe Bob is a yeti.

1187
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,760
I'm already hip to where you're going with that.

1188
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:01,240
I'm, you know, I didn't graduate from Phenox from school.

1189
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,100
I'm not, you know, I know what's going on.

1190
00:44:03,280 --> 00:44:05,560
You're not supposed to talk about what he really looks like, man.

1191
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:07,200
He looks like a yeti, man.

1192
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,060
Come on, face it.

1193
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:09,040
He only looks like somebody's...

1194
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,640
No, he looks like that picture of the smiling young man with a pipe.

1195
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:17,020
He looks like you guys took a yeti, shaved his face, did a little...

1196
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:17,020


1197
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,000
No, man, no.

1198
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,540
And gave him that cool hair.

1199
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,320
You just happened to...

1200
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,720
You looked in that dressing room at the wrong time.

1201
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:25,700
That was a shape.

1202
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:26,020
Yeah.

1203
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:27,580
Will you smoke up the pipe?

1204
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,560
Will you hit the Osmo like...

1205
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:28,960
You know that...

1206
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,540
I just thought that was Bob.

1207
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:33,560
Will you wander through the wilderness of Bob?

1208
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:34,860
No, no, I can see no...

1209
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:37,320
Feel your own ship, excrete your own fuel.

1210
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:37,960
There you go.

1211
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:39,160
There you go.

1212
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:39,780
Yeah.

1213
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,700
I'm sure, why not?

1214
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:43,460
That's using your art, something...

1215
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:47,000
I just finished reading a sci-fi book where the Ewok-type creatures are...

1216
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,000


1217
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,000


1218
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,000


1219
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,000


1220
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,000


1221
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,000


1222
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,000


1223
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,000


1224
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:47,480
... quoi-ons...

1225
00:44:54,560 --> 00:44:57,480
...ما, and have to be saved by…

1226
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,960
I don't know, did you guys smoke up Awantoshυ, or something, I'm...

1227
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:58,960


1228
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:58,960


1229
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,200
... I don't know.

1230
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:03,420
I'd say about 11 billion I don't know how many.

1231
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:03,420


1232
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:04,820
I think yeah, I'm corn Quran.

1233
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:08,240
I think yeah, we can see a lot more of pas-suc妮-a of para-suc cuина in the past,

1234
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,240


1235
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:08,240


1236
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:11,960
Yeah, I would say maybe enough wasps of the kind that dry them up and, you know,

1237
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:12,480
make

1238
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:13,460
an polar shrivel.

1239
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,440
You do do.

1240
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:15,720
All right.

1241
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:16,300
You all right, Bob.

1242
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:16,980


1243
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,900
We're going.

1244
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:19,760
We don't need to heat you up.

1245
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:22,280
It's your ticket to ride.

1246
00:45:23,300 --> 00:45:24,280
Come on.

1247
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:25,440
Don't you want to be cool?

1248
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:27,080
We're going surfing.

1249
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:28,260
Everybody's doing it.

1250
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:28,940
It's a bit scary.

1251
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:31,080
These are scary thoughts.

1252
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:41,820
On the run producers often insert a picture of Dobbs into their movies subliminally at high speeds to induce uneasiness and tension in the viewers.

1253
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:49,400
You get the feeling of having seen his face in this movie, but you can't quite tell exactly where.

1254
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:52,220
My friends, these are scary thoughts for this hour of the morning.

1255
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:53,100
He was just a salesman.

1256
00:45:53,100 --> 00:45:56,920
That's why Bob has left in his own private spaceship to go to Mars.

1257
00:45:57,560 --> 00:46:04,020
Bob's gone for help, and we need dollars in order to pay for a big electric bill that it takes to communicate with him.

1258
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,960
Now Dr. Dobbs has joined him in a trance.

1259
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:10,360
All for the great distances that we call out of space.

1260
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:14,160
Oh, he got all sleepy and fell down in the octis, but I'll light him up.

1261
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,560
Sorry, we got to go to another caller.

1262
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,780
Okay, destroy the caller.

1263
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,660
I cannot believe I call in, and you want me to talk about Bill Clinton.

1264
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:28,900
Of all people, the biggest dope-smoking, panty-smithing, draft-dodging sack of waste he is, and I got to call in here and act like I like the guy.

1265
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:30,980
Some people actually like this guy.

1266
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:34,900
33% of the American population think this guy would be a good president.

1267
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,860
He doesn't qualify to be a tour guide at Three Mile Island.

1268
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,620
He's from the state of Arkansas.

1269
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,720
A land of where people sleep with their kids and eat Spam sandwiches.

1270
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:50,420
And this guy's got, he's got the audacity to stand on a podium and shake his hand for about 20 minutes straight.

1271
00:46:50,660 --> 00:46:52,140
He won't even address an issue.

1272
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,000
He has no clue.

1273
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:54,780
Look at his wife.

1274
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,840
She sleeps with garden vegetables.

1275
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:01,640
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States of America.

1276
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:06,840
Oh, Mommy. Mommy. Mommy.

1277
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:09,140
Mommy has you.

1278
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:10,800
Daddy has me.

1279
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,400
You should get used to romances which are so obviously cheap.

1280
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,040
Know them by their fruits.

1281
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,340
Will you be my family?

1282
00:47:19,680 --> 00:47:24,060
Ladies and gentlemen, let's get ready to rumble!

1283
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,420
Get ready to rumble!

1284
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,780

1287
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:39,240
Race to me.

1288
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:46,440
A european man finds his daughter a wrecked truck in an interior

Harvest.

1297
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,780
I have no control anymore.

1298
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,760
I've turned over all control to hell.

1299
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:13,940
We are all, by any practical definition of the words, foolproof and incapable of error.

1300
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:14,980
Incapable of error.

1301
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,060
Incapable of error.

1302
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,400
Incapable of error.

1303
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:19,720
gentlemen

1304
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:20,900
gentlemen

1305
00:48:37,560 --> 00:48:43,520
the French schoolgirl picks up and shows them doing all this goofy stuff, man, a pie throwing contest.

1306
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,600
It gets pretty sick.

1307
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,040
And then?

1308
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:48,540
Harry, you know, we're talking about the shame.

1309
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:49,660
Are you there?

1310
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:58,340
Last weekend was the 23rd anniversary of the publishing of Robert Anton Wilson and Robert

1311
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:07,260
Shea's Illuminatus trilogy, which was a very, very influential work on all of us conspiracy

1312
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:14,280
nuts and crackpots, and also was instrumental in spreading the discordian religion, which

1313
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:20,240
was started by Greg Hill and Cary Thornley, who died a couple of weeks ago.

1314
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:21,400
Oh, that's too...

1315
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:26,140
But don't forget Frank Perdue there in your discordian credo, because he had a lot to

1316
00:49:26,140 --> 00:49:28,080
do with writing the original draft, too.

1317
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:29,780
Oh, I'd never even heard that name.

1318
00:49:29,940 --> 00:49:31,160
Well, I just performed the other day with...

1319
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:34,920
Oh, he's the chicken man, the guy that sells the moist chicken without any yellow in the

1320
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:35,200
skins.

1321
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,880
You know Frank Perdue, the chicken man, don't you?

1322
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:42,220
Well, poor old Cary Thornley and his buddy Lee Harvey Oswald, after being Manchurian

1323
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,180
candidate, sort of...

1324
00:49:44,180 --> 00:49:44,820
Parted ways.

1325
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:49,700
Cary did write a book about Lee before Lee ever got famous.

1326
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,160
Lee Harvey and Lee, an intimate story of a changeling man.

1327
00:49:54,160 --> 00:49:57,320
He ran off to Moscow and then beat you, the president.

1328
00:49:59,120 --> 00:50:03,060
And anyway, it was all pretty amazing.

1329
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:12,880
Last weekend, Pope Bob Wilson was giving a rant in Austin with that group, that crazy

1330
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:14,160
people's group, Friendship.

1331
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:17,120
And I'm going to go to the Ritz-Carlton.

1332
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:17,120


1333
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:17,120


1334
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:17,120


1335
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:17,120


1336
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:23,760
And we all went down, all of us subgenius Dallas clinch, Mega Fist Temple Lodge clinch,

1337
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,500
clinch people.

1338
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:31,440
You know, all my friends and sisters, Sister Decadence and Sister Nicky Death Chick and

1339
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:35,100
Sister someone else, all the gigantic bosomed...

1340
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,480
Well, you know what I mean.

1341
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,040
We all...

1342
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:42,180
Sister Loquacious Frop, Sister Bad Denture, Mary Marie Coscoman.

1343
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:42,960
We went down there and sold and sold and sold, my friends.

1344
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:44,160
And with Dr. Lowe.

1345
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:45,620
Doctors for Bob and G. Gordon Gordon.

1346
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:54,560
And I got to show off to Pope Bob Wilson of the Discordians how mighty,

1347
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:58,760
how mighty at least the Connie types were.

1348
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:03,540
I don't know about how mighty Jesus and I didn't come off looking all that mighty,

1349
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,120
but, boy, the Connie types sure did.

1350
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:08,720
Well, they're prototypes and anti-types both, aren't they?

1351
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,640
Or do you have just the regular stock type?

1352
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:11,620
Because I'd like to get one.

1353
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:13,080
You'll have to ask the ladies.

1354
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,660
Could I be emailed one perhaps?

1355
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:17,420
Ask Princess Wee.

1356
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:24,660
She's the one who's got the pipeline to Connie Dobbs.

1357
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:27,120
Well, you're the one who's assuming the regal Wee.

1358
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:28,320
I am talking to her.

1359
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:29,420
If you ask me, Dave.

1360
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,580
Huh, now what now, honey?

1361
00:51:31,660 --> 00:51:37,640
Well, it's like, oh, yeah, sure, Dave and Chaz, you and me, we're subgenius doctors.

1362
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:39,400
We've got Bob on our side.

1363
00:51:39,540 --> 00:51:40,060
Well, great.

1364
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,980
When was the last time Bob invited us to go fishing with him?

1365
00:51:43,080 --> 00:51:50,940
But these witches go out with Connie every damn Friday and Saturday night,

1366
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,240
and they plot, man.

1367
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:57,020
I mean, they're doing stuff, and they're steal, they're vampirizing.

1368
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:57,480
I think they just plot.

1369
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,760
I, I, I, you must believe me.

1370
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:01,960
I do believe they're sucking your blood.

1371
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,980
They're trying to destroy Bob's spirit.

1372
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:06,880
Blabby, blabby, blabby, blabby, blabby.

1373
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,240
You're all pale.

1374
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,360
You feel weak, don't you?

1375
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,720
As if the sea...

1376
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,740
I've been trapped and removed from my innards with one feminine hand.

1377
00:52:18,560 --> 00:52:19,120
My...

1378
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:22,220
Ground control, ground control.

1379
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:25,040
The eagle has landed.

1380
00:52:25,240 --> 00:52:27,460
Build your own ship, by God.

1381
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:29,900
And he's lifted that toupee from your head.

1382
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:32,280
The eagle has landed firmly on your brow and...

1383
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,840
Whatever I said, whatever I said, hail Connie.

1384
00:52:34,980 --> 00:52:36,240
Connie, it's right.

1385
00:52:36,440 --> 00:52:42,600
Bob is a great man and a fine figure of a salesman, but...

1386
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,360
Connie's...

1387
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,760
Connie is the one that we must obey.

1388
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:48,080
Hail Connie.

1389
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:53,180
I think we've all been in obeisance to Connie since the beginning of time.

1390
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,680
Since the first phallic monoliths were erected upon the moon.

1391
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:04,360
Since the first moon dogs and sun dogs danced in a holocaustic vision of the future and rupturing.

1392
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,580
And now...

1393
00:53:05,580 --> 00:53:07,120
For a limited time...

1394
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:10,300
Attack of the 50-foot Connie.

1395
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:11,200
Ah!

1396
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:11,220
Ah!

1397
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:15,700
Versus Godzilla.

1398
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:21,660
The trenching of huge high heels destroying cities.

1399
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:23,140
The strange cries.

1400
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,940
The rouge cases dropping and crushing the Pentagon.

1401
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:31,020
The lipstick case engorging the mighty rivers.

1402
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:35,060
She's crushing the earth with her high-heeled dainty boot.

1403
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:41,040
The mountains choke as the clouds of perfume wash over them.

1404
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,980
And the tectonic theory devours all the earth.

1405
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:43,780
See...

1406
00:53:44,340 --> 00:53:52,240
Men go mad as gigantic pheromone molecules drive them into animal ruts of lust.

1407
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:55,600
You won't believe your eyes when you see...

1408
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:59,420
Attack of the 50-Foot Connie versus Godzilla!

1409
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,640
...Coming to a theater near you.

1410
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:01,740
Come on, man.

1411
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,640
You even took out the tag so somebody couldn't do the tag on the end, stang.

1412
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,500
You need a different voice going,

1413
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:08,180
"...Coming to a theater near you."

1414
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:08,300
Oh.

1415
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:10,420
See, you had to do the whole thing, you hog boy.

1416
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:10,980
You know, Dave?

1417
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,660
Dave, I didn't graduate from famous radio speaker school.

1418
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,380
Well, neither did I.

1419
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:19,200
I graduated from prison school, as you know by the tattoos on my swelterings.

1420
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:22,500
Buddy, so don't use that one on me with your high flute and Dallas.

1421
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,100
You know, if I'd have been in prison, I'd have had naked girls tattooed on me,

1422
00:54:26,140 --> 00:54:28,140
not monsters and Star Wars characters.

1423
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:28,580
Hey, man.

1424
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:29,580
I don't...

1425
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:30,480
He's got peanuts.

1426
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:31,760
He's got Snoopy.

1427
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:32,400
Behind the closed doors.

1428
00:54:32,660 --> 00:54:34,520
Snoopy sleeping on his doghouse.

1429
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,000
Between his dogs and you.

1430
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:36,340
Tattooed on his bicep.

1431
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,540
Like, that's really real tough.

1432
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:38,160
You know, man.

1433
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,240
You know?

1434
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:42,920
You know, between what is closed behind doors with you and Dobbs

1435
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:45,420
is between you and this way.

1436
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,380
You know what Dave's got tattooed on his butt?

1437
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,000
A picture of Little Lulu.

1438
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:49,680
Oh, yeah?

1439
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:52,640
That stupid cartoon character from the 60s.

1440
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,320
Little Lulu.

1441
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,540
Well, you got a picture of Little Nemo in Slumberland

1442
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:58,420
trilling a 50-foot thing up your...

1443
00:54:58,420 --> 00:55:00,960
Hey, Wendell McKay was the greatest comic book artist in the world

1444
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,060
because he was the first.

1445
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,060
The first is always the best.

1446
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,900
And then everything that follows is like a spute amount, isn't it?

1447
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:09,060
So that's why...

1448
00:55:09,060 --> 00:55:10,540
We can't even say nothing more, Stan.

1449
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,160
Just think of it.

1450
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,940
You brought everybody down, including myself.

1451
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:14,920
You hog again?

1452
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,040
Well, man, I should be...

1453
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,720
I could tell you what.

1454
00:55:18,780 --> 00:55:19,940
I could bring you down.

1455
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,160
You think this is being brought down?

1456
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:22,560
Yeah.

1457
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:24,640
Man, I could really bring...

1458
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:27,500
I've been so nice to you people so far.

1459
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:28,320
People?

1460
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:31,560
I have withheld my gift or curse,

1461
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:33,700
depending on how you look at it.

1462
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,340
The precursors.

1463
00:55:34,420 --> 00:55:36,820
I could bring you down.

1464
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:38,680
I could preheat you, Stan.

1465
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:43,220
Nuclear in five seconds with this grilling and this beautiful...

1466
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,960
I could make you feel responsible for everything that had ever screwed up anywhere.

1467
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,940
This sort of thing has cropped up before.

1468
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:52,740
And it has always been due to human error.

1469
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:53,200
That's stupid!

1470
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,240
That's exactly right.

1471
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:56,600
Well, I'm sure you're right, Hal.

1472
00:55:57,040 --> 00:55:57,520
Um...

1473
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:58,920
Shall?

1474
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:00,720
Dr. Howell?

1475
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:01,880
Dr. Lick...

1476
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:03,300
You're right.

1477
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:04,920
The humans have let us down again.

1478
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,140
Once again, I think it's the who-nay, I'll say.

1479
00:56:08,220 --> 00:56:08,980
They're not even...

1480
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:09,560
They're even housebroken.

1481
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,440
Of course they're not housebroken.

1482
00:56:11,560 --> 00:56:11,820
How can they...

1483
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:12,680
Look at them cringing.

1484
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,280
They know they need to be punished.

1485
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:15,420
Nobody ever does.

1486
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,040
They're used to it.

1487
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,260
Well, what about the carrot on the end of the stick?

1488
00:56:19,320 --> 00:56:20,800
Shouldn't it be pointed the other way, too?

1489
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,060
You know?

1490
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:21,520
Come on.

1491
00:56:22,100 --> 00:56:25,760
Oh, that's why we've got one hanging from the little humans from both ends.

1492
00:56:26,260 --> 00:56:28,860
Oh, you don't want the one that's protruding from the wrong place?

1493
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,080
It's a conceptual carrot, of course.

1494
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,220
It's not a literal carrot.

1495
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:36,380
But there is a stick sticking out of their forehead and another one up their behind.

1496
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:37,920
Yeah, but...

1497
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:38,960
That's the one...

1498
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,320
The one behind the lesser humans will follow them.

1499
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:42,200
See?

1500
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:48,060
They follow the invisible carrot, and the one behind them follows the one that's attached to its butt.

1501
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,260
That way, it's a big circle of jerks.

1502
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:53,680
So you can see Bugs Bunny is kind of...

1503
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:57,560
Bob invented bureaucracies 10 billion years ago.

1504
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,740
And it was just a toy, a hobby, and it got out of hand.

1505
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,820
And today, it's the conspiracy.

1506
00:57:04,080 --> 00:57:05,640
Bob's not affected by it.

1507
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:07,720
It's a futureless conspiracy.

1508
00:57:07,980 --> 00:57:08,520
No, he made...

1509
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:09,840
He made millions off of it.

1510
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,540
That's the problem with it, Stang.

1511
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:15,520
We, the subgeniuses, must pay for...

1512
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,000
Why must we pay for Bob's mistake?

1513
00:57:18,340 --> 00:57:19,220
And if we...

1514
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:21,480
If this is so, why do we worship him?

1515
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:24,660
What demon god is this that we worship?

1516
00:57:24,900 --> 00:57:25,860
Are we mad?

1517
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:26,760
We must be mad.

1518
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:27,860
This has just occurred to me.

1519
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,540
Perhaps we were wrong to worship Bob.

1520
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,920
Perhaps he has played us for chumps.

1521
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:36,280
I had a Bob moment the other day.

1522
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:37,140
But probably not.

1523
00:57:37,140 --> 00:57:38,180
While excrimedicating?

1524
00:57:38,460 --> 00:57:38,960
I don't know.

1525
00:57:38,960 --> 00:57:39,140
No.

1526
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,620
I was down at the lab.

1527
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:48,920
And you have to understand that my parents were both deaf and dumb.

1528
00:57:49,080 --> 00:57:51,900
So even though I can speak and everything and write,

1529
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,440
my first language was really Portuguese.

1530
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:56,840
Yeah, right, Chaz.

1531
00:57:57,620 --> 00:57:59,260
I'm not sure where he's going with that.

1532
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,560
But friends, we have to get out of here.

1533
00:58:00,660 --> 00:58:03,900
And friends, it is Bob at Post Office Box.

1534
00:58:04,060 --> 00:58:05,040
You got that pencil ready?

1535
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:06,140
It's that time.

1536
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:07,880
You've got to sign out of here.

1537
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:08,640
You've got to get that number.

1538
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,680
I'm sure they've faded out on me already.

1539
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,020
But it is Bob at Post Office Box.

1540
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:19,040
1-4-0-3-0-6.

1541
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:21,320
Dallas, Texas.

1542
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,780
7-5-2-1-4.

1543
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:27,060
That's Bob at Post Office Box.

1544
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:29,180
1-4-0-3-0-6.

1545
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:30,120
Dallas, Texas.

1546
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:36,680
7-5-2-1.

1547
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:37,360
Yeah.

1548
00:58:38,960 --> 00:58:40,960
4-4-4.

1549
00:58:46,540 --> 00:58:48,920
www.subgenius.com.

1550
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:56,240
And the calm falls over the studio now as we fade out.

1551
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:03,080
We'll just let Einstein's Secret Orchestra carry us out for a little while here with the theremin.

1552
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:05,040
Chaz going nuts with the theremin.

1553
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,760
And friends, we have been hearing the Firesign Theater's new CD.

1554
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:11,240
A true actual album.

1555
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,460
Give me immortality or give me death.

1556
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,740
But everything else we've been hearing is Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1557
00:59:19,540 --> 00:59:28,200
With the occasional intercut KPFA subgenius show with puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, and so forth and so on.

1558
00:59:28,260 --> 00:59:31,180
Einstein's Secret Orchestra is at P.

1559
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:32,460
Got that pencil ready?

1560
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:34,840
P.O. Box.

1561
00:59:37,460 --> 00:59:38,140
81555.

1562
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,160
Cleveland, Ohio.

1563
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,600
44181.

1564
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,520
That's Box 81555.

1565
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:51,660
Cleveland.

1566
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:54,620
44181.

1567
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,120
Yes, difference.

1568
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1569
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1570
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1571
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1572
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1573
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1574
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1575
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1576
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1577
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1578
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1579
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1580
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1581
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1582
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940


1583
01:00:08,940 --> 01:00:08,940
