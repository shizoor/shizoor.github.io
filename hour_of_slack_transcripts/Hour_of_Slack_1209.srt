1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,740
Car input, computers, tapes, all go.

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,660
Laser beam cycling, normal cryogenic systems, go.

3
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,480
Cathodes at 67,000 volts and steady.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,140
Time selector set at present.

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,000
All set, Al. Stand by for a time synchronization.

6
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,520
Standing by.

7
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,640
Date. 5 July, 64.

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,020
Time.

9
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:28,740
11 hours, 14 minutes.

10
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:30,980
Counting.

11
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:37,320
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:38,500
Mark.

13
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:39,540
Mark.

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:40,460
Lights.

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:45,240
Stand by to activate image stabilizer switch.

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,340
Ready.

17
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:48,280
Switch on.

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:49,980
Switch on.

19
00:00:53,980 --> 00:00:56,520
Men and women of all races and breeds

20
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,280
pause to destroy the Earth.

21
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,120
Check

22
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,120


23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,120


24
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,000
Adam.

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,020
FreeDRHINX.com . James . Chris .

26
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,020


27
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,020


28
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:20,920
Designed, Initial屍

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,820
You can call me Bob.

30
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,560
I like you, Danny.

31
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:30,160
I'll be in the back.

32
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,720
Where's it that you're from?

33
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:37,860
Cleveland.

34
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,440
Cleveland.

35
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:39,900
Cleveland.

36
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,860
Like Erie.

37
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,080
Erie.

38
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:53,260
Well, that doesn't explain why you've come all the way out here.

39
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,840
All the way out here to hell.

40
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:00,720
You're just as likely to find your own grave.

41
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:09,820
On July 5th, 1998, 7 a.m., when we all have hangovers,

42
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,880
Wotan's judgment will take place in the form of what the prescriptors call

43
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,960
the Advent.

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,800
Advent of the angelic host.

45
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,580
And if you let Bob do your thinking for you,

46
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,480
you won't have to worry about nothing come July 4th, 1998.

47
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,720
Ha, ha, ha.

48
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,140
When Bob comes down in his giant mothership,

49
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,840
looking kind of like a big pillbox,

50
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,960
Bob will be landing and you can climb right in because he's going to know.

51
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:41,880
He's going to have your name on a computer printout.

52
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,980
Yes, sir, dear friends.

53
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,700
And that's CRT tube available.

54
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,800
Right there at his fingertips.

55
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,380
He can call your name up and he'll know exactly what you've done for him.

56
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,200
He'll know exactly how much donations you've taken in.

57
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:59,840
He'll know exactly how much money you've given to the church.

58
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,980
Besides his own exaggerated human nature and the powers granted him by Jehovah One,

59
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,840
Bob also benefits.

60
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:23,640
From being the chosen broker on earth for superior beings from the furthest reaches of known space.

61
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:31,220
The so-called men from Planet X or exists for they are nothing like men.

62
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:38,420
Bob has a covenant with these angelic beings, a cosmic contract, a deal.

63
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:43,700
On July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.

64
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,000
The exists shall make.

65
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,280
A mass landing on this planet.

66
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:53,560
The children of Bob shall be rewarded at this fortold rupture.

67
00:03:54,260 --> 00:04:09,260
This day of judgment when all those who paid their church dues will be lifted up in power and glory to gain new homes and bodies aboard the pleasure saucers of the sex goddesses.

68
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,860
All the while watching the hapless pinks twitch and bleat and wail in the death throes of.

69
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:16,660
Their world.

70
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:22,740
And we faithful shall be transfigured into new enlightened beings.

71
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,720
Superior mutants called over men and uber women.

72
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:32,860
Who will start a new Jerusalem in the promised land of dimension X.

73
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,020
Asgard.

74
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:39,780
The zone of eternal slack and cytor spasmic ooze squirt.

75
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,600
Behold my servant shall prosper.

76
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:45,840
He got exalted and laid.

77
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,600
Lifted up on the pile.

78
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,980
Shall be very high.

79
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,040
He who knew it of the fools who prophesied for him.

80
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,120
Shall be made over man.

81
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,280
Many will be astonished at him for his appearance is so mild.

82
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,180
Beyond the human semblance.

83
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:08,860
That his form is beyond that of a sinful man.

84
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,760
We can't do much about those evil gods from the other side of the cosmos.

85
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:26,480
Who fly through the air and through the nebulous darkness of space.

86
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,120
Space my friends.

87
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,580
The infinite inky clouds of nebulae.

88
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,300
They fly on their membranous leathery wings holding in their coiling tentacles.

89
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,720
Shiny steel cylinders each one containing what was once a human soul.

90
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,540
What was once a member of the church of the subgenius.

91
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,720
But enough of this.

92
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,480
You don't want to hear about this.

93
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,980
I must and yet I cannot.

94
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:52,320
I'll tell you what you'll be wishing it was that kind of aim.

95
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,940
At least you'll be wishing.

96
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,520
You'll be glad to have them on your side.

97
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,360
Because at least I have them on my head.

98
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,940
At least there's two arms and two legs.

99
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,720
It could be worse.

100
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,420
It could be much worse.

101
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,340
It's looking for us.

102
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,180
It's an eyeball.

103
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,440
It's looking for an answer.

104
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,920
That's how the aliens see us.

105
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,220
Well you want some aliens to see you.

106
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,960
If you're right with them.

107
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,420
If you've paid dues.

108
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,880
If you've done your incantation.

109
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:30,500
If you've sacrificed your chickens and children.

110
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:35,460
Bob is looking for you and more importantly Connie will be looking for you on July 5th.

111
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,500
At Brushwood.

112
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,340
Bob and Connie.

113
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,220
Bob and Connie want you and they will get you come X-Day.

114
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:52,920
Which is almost here and may in fact already be gone for some listeners.

115
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,060
Sorry too late.

116
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,020
You could have but you didn't.

117
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:00,840
Because we're preparing to leave the planet or at least throw a big naughty company party.

118
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:08,600
This is Hour of Slack number 1209 from the Church of the Subgenius and is a Best of X-Day special.

119
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,500
An X-Day B.O. if you will.

120
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:17,980
What we just heard was ESO Swamp Radio from Chaz Smith from WCSB Cleveland some years back.

121
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,800
Dr. Hal Robbins narrating the subgenius video Arise with music by BK Jones.

122
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,580
Dr. Philodrummon on the road and getting the date wrong for the end of the world.

123
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,500
And clips from Deadman, Jay Turney, Lee Murr and the Time Travelers.

124
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,320
Speaking of which, that's us friends.

125
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:41,480
I say this here to ensure disbelief but the fact is every year we return here from the subgenius.

126
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:48,880
To the subgenius future trying to make sure that X-Day happens right and that it's only the final days for some people.

127
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,540
Final days.

128
00:07:58,780 --> 00:07:59,300
Caraportation.

129
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,980
These people have come from the future to visit us.

130
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:09,040
Using the Earth Union's time machine, we've been sent back here to warn you all.

131
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,640
We wish to change incidents that are about to take place here.

132
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:15,440
Things that have caused catastrophe in the 23rd century.

133
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,020
We came here to warn you all about your country's gloomy future.

134
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,540
Because in the century that we come from, there's no longer a Japan.

135
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,020
Why? How could that possibly be? And why? What's the reason for it?

136
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:29,100
You want to make an omelet, you gotta break some eggs.

137
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,060
See that the humans remain entertained until the end.

138
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:37,300
The Book of Revelations tells us to watch for the seven signs of evil.

139
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:38,300
By the way.

140
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,040
Sign of evil number four.

141
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,620
We're continuing our sign of evil countdown.

142
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:44,400
Here's Vanessa with...

143
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,340
How are things going here? Doesn't look so hot.

144
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,240
We'll be broadcasting in a few minutes. The mobile unit is also getting ready.

145
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,800
Good. Keep it up. The world's depending on us.

146
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,380
Okay.

147
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:56,760
The one question that I heard asked more than any other.

148
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,560
The question is, man going to destroy himself?

149
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:01,960
Are we coming to the end of the world?

150
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,680
Oh, God, no. Is today the fifth?

151
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,180
What?

152
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:06,220
What?

153
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,120
The aliens are here!

154
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,980
Is God outraged with all of this?

155
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,340
I don't know.

156
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,780
He hears the rattling sabers and sees the spewing rockets.

157
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:22,580
He sees the atomic bombs that are buried beneath the Sandia Mountains

158
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,520
close to Albuquerque, New Mexico with enough detonating force

159
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:29,180
and destructive force to completely destroy the entire world.

160
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:33,620
He sees the lethal snouts of atomic submarines that plow their way

161
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,500
through the waves of the mighty oceans,

162
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,240
levetians of the deep that could completely destroy them.

163
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,680
He sees the

164
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:47,860
He sees the mighty Saturn missile belching its black smoke and flame of fire,

165
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,420
taking its cargo of flesh to the moon.

166
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:51,100
He sees it.

167
00:09:51,300 --> 00:10:01,000
He also knows that madmen, in spite of their front of civilization and intellectualism and getting along and peaceful coexistence,

168
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:05,620
that have but one desire, and that's to destroy and take over this entire world.

169
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,300
Well, he sees this.

170
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,080
He knows this.

171
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:21,300
They are friendly people and are by far more advanced spiritually and physically than the people of this planet.

172
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:27,280
At the present time, they are observing us.

173
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,600
They wish to help us to help ourselves to attain a higher spiritual state.

174
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,500
They wish to help us to have a higher understanding of life and its meaning.

175
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,900
What do you think about Bob?

176
00:10:42,660 --> 00:10:43,520
Who's Bob?

177
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:49,560
Alright, well, what do you think about the UFOs which are presently going to,

178
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:55,660
which are presently in formation to blitz the Earth and put particle beams through the head of everyone that doesn't know Bob?

179
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,200
You're out of your mind.

180
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:05,580
Spacecraft entered the moon's gravitational field in the sixth century.

181
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,100
The Earth's first segment of the flight.

182
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:12,260
The gravity of the moon is one sixth of that on Earth.

183
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:20,080
The orbit around the moon was flown 66 miles above the moon's surface at 6,000 miles an hour.

184
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,160
At ten after nine, the beeping began.

185
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:29,440
Went down to the reserve fence, watched through binoculars, and we did see this thing.

186
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:34,760
Now, it's about the size of the moon with a small crescent at the bottom.

187
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,680
It's well lit like starlight.

188
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,740
The top is a dark gray mass.

189
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,140
It came down through the trees, whatever it was.

190
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,580
Have you ever heard of one?

191
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,000
Have you ever been in one?

192
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,960
Have you ever seen one?

193
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,620
Have you by television ever seen one?

194
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,440
If you haven't, it's the greatest sight this side of heaven.

195
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,180
People from this Earth have already seen some of their spacecraft,

196
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,420
which they call flying saucers.

197
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,220
And other flying objects which they cannot describe.

198
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:15,160
These objects are real and are spacecrafts.

199
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:19,680
The astronauts return to Earth on the sixth day of the week.

200
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:27,320
Yeah, I'm reading here on the internet where you think the world's going to end your life here through 2007.

201
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,060
Well, brother, I'll tell you what the Bible says.

202
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:32,140
No man knows what hour our Lord doth come.

203
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,520
So you've got a heck of a...

204
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,560
email going on here.

205
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:41,580
I hope God forgives you for trying to predict when He's coming back in Jesus Christ.

206
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:46,660
But I hope you find Him in the end and get your heart right and your soul straightened out

207
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:51,000
and ask Jesus Christ into your life and your heart and ask Him to forgive you of your sins

208
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,880
and you repent because you're doing some blasphemy against God because there's no way you know that.

209
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:03,520
But I feel for you, buddy, and I just pray that you get to know Jesus Christ as your personal Savior.

210
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,080
God bless.

211
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,280
This is me, Bernard.

212
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,720
I just wanted to call.

213
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:20,960
You know, as I speak, you know, the UFOs are appearing outside the window again today, the fifth of July.

214
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:29,500
And you know, sometimes when they do appear, like, other lights start flashing on and off of them, like these newly, like this newly built house,

215
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:34,740
like these newly built houses right next by this house here.

216
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:34,740


217
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:34,740


218
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:35,900
that I'm living in.

219
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,780
Sometimes the lights flash on and off

220
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,600
when they appear or don't appear.

221
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,980
The UFOs have come back.

222
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,020
They're outside my window as I speak.

223
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,840
I can see them.

224
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:54,620
I hope it means that X-Day is coming.

225
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:00,120
Meanwhile, far below the Earth's surface...

226
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,380
I don't know why you don't sign up here.

227
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,040
Well, I've tried. I've tried everything.

228
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:05,380
They won't listen to me up here.

229
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:08,320
I've sent my prophets Ezekiel, Hezekiah.

230
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,080
You know what a good apocalypse costs.

231
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,040
I know, Dad.

232
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,860
You tried that earthquake in Los Angeles last year.

233
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,360
Oh, no, no. Don't blame me for that.

234
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,980
That was San Andreas' fault.

235
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,300
That shows the endless connection

236
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,040
how one crime succeeds another,

237
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,300
for he says the land is full of bloody crimes

238
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,340
and the city is full of violence.

239
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,140
Therefore, God says,

240
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,980
I will bring the basis,

241
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:36,040
the worst of heathen Gentile people,

242
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,380
and they are going to conquer you

243
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,260
and drive you out and move into your houses

244
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,520
and your holy places will be defiled.

245
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,320
Destruction comes, God says.

246
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:47,980
Oh, good God, we're doomed.

247
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:48,600
No!

248
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,180
We're out of donuts!

249
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:54,780
One could go on and on with reports of this nature.

250
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,860
Week after week, we get letters to our office

251
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:59,980
and it'll say, Brother Smith, it saved my life.

252
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,840
You don't realize where I was headed.

253
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,760
A farmer.

254
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:02,960
A farmer.

255
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:02,960


256
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,700
I was wakened one morning

257
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:07,740
and the clock struck one, two, three, seven,

258
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,080
twelve, thirteen, fourteen.

259
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,860
His wife said, Honey, wake up.

260
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,940
He said, What time is it?

261
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,720
She said, I don't know,

262
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:15,780
but it's later than it's ever been before.

263
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,840
It's funny because it's true.

264
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,200
World leaders are indeed pessimistic.

265
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,940
They should be.

266
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:25,160
I heard Stang on the radio

267
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,400
said we'd better get cracking.

268
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,940
X-Day Zoomer.

269
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:37,860
Post, Goody am Logy.

270
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,660
and get to work right now.

271
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,900
Sometimes, I'm frustrated,

272
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,660
and I'm really frustrated.

273
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:47,680
Would this empire fell from his own hel rear,

274
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,540
If it should still existed,

275
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:51,980
We would still be a motley gang.

276
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:54,000
I'm happy you're having fun.

277
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:54,260
terrifying�지

278
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:00,900
terrifyinggi...

279
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:10,520

280
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:21,480

00:16:52,900 --> 00:17:03,880
let's quit our jobs in five weeks i'm believing in dogs we've got five weeks get that in your head

286
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:14,880

287
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:21,300
pow right to the moon we've got five weeks my brain hurts a lot

288
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:30,800
five weeks it feels like a clock we've got five weeks till deliverance comes

289
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:33,200
five weeks

290
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:48,580
until next day delights five weeks till we board that flight in five weeks we're trashing it all

291
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:50,880
five weeks

292
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,900
Torch this s*** ball.

293
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,060
Five weeks.

294
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,720
Your gloco boo.

295
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,160
In five weeks.

296
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:01,420
Because Bob sealed their doom.

297
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:05,920
Five weeks.

298
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,000
You screwed up and carried the thumb again, Bimbo Breath.

299
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,780
Look at the calendar.

300
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,940
You got four weeks.

301
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,560
What?

302
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:20,040
No, actually, it's three weeks.

303
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,000
No, two.

304
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:24,140
Friends, that was Reverend Susie the Floozy singing.

305
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,240
Yes, singing.

306
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:26,060
What lungs.

307
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:31,040
Before that, we heard lots more of Susie's audio collage editing work

308
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,720
and sandwiched between those,

309
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,080
Reverend Stevie Hambone's UFO interview

310
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,240
and two actual phone messages left on my answer machine.

311
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,940
Some just aren't joiners, friends, I guess.

312
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:45,000
Of course, you don't have to join us and become a subgenius minister.

313
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:49,140
The average subgenius who doesn't exist never does.

314
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:51,460
But we had to.

315
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:53,660
Leave him and all the others behind.

316
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:58,960
Because they did not have faith in their hearts.

317
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:02,340
No, they chose to follow their minds instead.

318
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,980
To follow so-called common sense.

319
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,520
Yes, dear friends.

320
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,900
Well, I guess it's common indeed.

321
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,900
Some may call it quite common.

322
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:14,040
I hated to concur with you there, Monthers,

323
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,460
but I could see that the sides of your heads, your flanks, as we call them,

324
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:20,580
were starting to radiate.

325
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,000
Ah.

326
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,060
Ah, my old flanks.

327
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:23,840
Start doing that.

328
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,740
I could smell.

329
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,600
You know, when I get feeling the power in the slack

330
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:30,720
and the smoke in this fine, fine crack.

331
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,140
Yes, at quadruple X day,

332
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,640
the crowds, the masses will all rise up,

333
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,680
raise their hands up and sing,

334
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,760
all flesh is like grass.

335
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,780
They shall raise their feet.

336
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,480
That's what they're singing there in German.

337
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,840
All flesh is tastier than grass.

338
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,460
And that lemon grass can be...

339
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:53,200
...used with practically any...

340
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,600
...vegetable fruit, fowl, or...

341
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,100
...fules, fuels, fuels.

342
00:19:57,220 --> 00:20:01,300
And a new barb odor will rise up.

343
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:03,680
And a new, newbite reporter...

344
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,560
...will sing behind him and...

345
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,740
...stand all as flesh as is the grass.

346
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:15,560
Froppet, froppet, froppet, froppet, froppet, froppet.

347
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:16,780
I gotta tell ya,

348
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,100
man, I love church.

349
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,300
I just love church.

350
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:21,580
Church.

351
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,180

00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,860
Yes, giving.

356
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,380
Yes, giving.

357
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,460
Bob!

358
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,920
I love this guy.

359
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,240
Come join the fun.

360
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:38,080
All of you have heard of...

361
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:38,480
Bob!

362
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:39,800
Love church.

363
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,300
I gotta tell ya,

364
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,220
it makes you feel real big.

365
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,040
Go, go, go!

366
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,360
Love church.

367
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,220
Bob!

368
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:50,960
Yes.

369
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,960
Giving.

370
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,440
Yes.

371
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,440
Giving.

372
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,360
Love church.

373
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:58,080
Bob!

374
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,760
Come join the fun.

375
00:21:00,700 --> 00:21:02,540
All of you have heard of...

376
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:02,980
Bob!

377
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,800
Love church.

378
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,360
It makes you feel real big.

379
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,100
Yes.

380
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:09,980
Giving.

381
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:11,920
Yes.

382
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:12,960
Giving.

383
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,000
Bob!

384
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:16,640
Go, go, go, go!

385
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,760
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

386
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,800
Go, go, go!

387
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:21,380
Go, go, go!

388
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:21,380


389
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,080
We all thought you were dead.

390
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:22,560
No, no.

391
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:23,060
Still here.

392
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:25,240
How are you, Bob?

393
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,620
Bob.

394
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:29,800
Man and women of all races and creeds

395
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,420
pause to destroy the earth.

396
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,180
Oh, I'm standing here

397
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,020
When the trumpet calls its death

398
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:45,560
And a brother and sister bend

399
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,220
While they blow the wind away

400
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,280
Oh, I'm standing here

401
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:51,280


402
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,780
We shall have paradise, subgenie of the world, unite!

403
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:05,000
Alien sex every night, subgenie of the world, subgenie of the world, subgenie of the world, unite!

404
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:08,500
Are you a loner kind?

405
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:11,860
Not join her all the way?

406
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:18,220
Two subgenies are alike, if they are then one must die.

407
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:24,240
We shall have paradise, subgenie of the world, unite!

408
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:33,660
Alien sex every night, subgenie of the world, subgenie of the world, subgenie of the world, unite!

409
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:45,020
That's great, it starts with a handshake. Exits UFO's outer space. J.R. Dobbs is not afraid.

410
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,780
He is the eye of a hurricane.

411
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:48,200
Watch out!

412
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:48,740
Watch your money burn.

413
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,220
Pinks serve their own needs.

414
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,380
Yetis serve your own needs.

415
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,460
Feeding on a purse with work-day strength.

416
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:54,880
End times are close at hand.

417
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,960
Uberwoman, overman.

418
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:58,040
Liar in a fire representing all we hate.

419
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,280
With a government for hire and a combat site.

420
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:04,480
The best is left subgenie in a hurry with a con breathing down their neck.

421
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,400
Group by group, normals falsified, full-farts.

422
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,480
Look at that load playing.

423
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,200
Fine.

424
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:09,540
Then.

425
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:11,000
Uh oh, oh no.

426
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,220
Population they don't know.

427
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,280
Save yourself, serve yourself.

428
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,600
Pinks serve their own need.

429
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,740
Yetis serve your own need.

430
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:16,860
Time to plunge your own seed.

431
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,200
Yeti with a rupture in the brain.

432
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,180
He's revered in the right, right.

433
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,060
He's super slack maniac.

434
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,460
Slam, bite, bright, light.

435
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,940
Feeling pretty psyched.

436
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:27,060
It's the end of the world as we know it.

437
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,720
It's the end of the world as we know it.

438
00:23:31,960 --> 00:23:36,280
It's the end of the world as we know it.

439
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,420
All feels fine.

440
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:43,180
Two-Eyed Vibe.

441
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,560
X-Day.

442
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,720
Pleasure shifts are on their way.

443
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,340
Quit your job.

444
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:45,880
Keep your slack.

445
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:47,040
Jared Ops has got your back.

446
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:47,580
Hail Connie.

447
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:48,180
Hail Bob.

448
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,340
On your knees, self-righteous flock

449
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,540
Give it up, give it in

450
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,640
Find yourself your Yeti kit

451
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,140
New religion, radio, help

452
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,960
Hope gonna blow

453
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,160
Pay to find out what you know

454
00:23:55,160 --> 00:23:56,300
Pass the pipe, take a trick

455
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:57,520
I'm telling you this is no joke

456
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,560
Spirits see, steer clear

457
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,640
A turn a minute, turn a minute, turn a minute lies

458
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,040
Offer me solutions and you offer me alternatives

459
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,300
And I decline

460
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,620
It's the end of the world as we know it

461
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:13,200
It's the end of the world as we know it

462
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:17,980
It's the end of the world as we know it

463
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:20,100
And Bob feels fine

464
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:30,460
It's the end of the world

465
00:24:31,780 --> 00:24:35,080
It's the end of the world

466
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:39,720
It's the end of the world

467
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,180
It's the end of the world

468
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:50,540
It's the end of the world as we know it

469
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,960
Bob feels fine

470
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,180
The other and other, chunch and bars, immortals living behind bars

471
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,600
Yeti driving fast cars, bang!

472
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:10,580
Reverend Ivan stank

473
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,700
Jesus Christ and Princess Wee

474
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,820
Smoking for offence, so do we

475
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:14,040
Reverend Susie, such a floozy

476
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:14,920
Dr. Pesoff stank

477
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,300
And one more time, I know you can

478
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:18,860
Anite Christian, Reverend Geo, doctors getting right, right

479
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:22,820
It's the end of the world as we know it

480
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,320
Bob feels fine

481
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:41,600
It's the end of the world as we know it

482
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,800
It's the end of the world as we know it

483
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:43,640
Bob feels fine

484
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,180
It's the end of the world as we know it

485
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:52,840
Bob feels fine

486
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:59,940
It's the end of the world as we know it

487
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:04,780
It's the end of the world as we know it

488
00:26:04,780 --> 00:26:05,400
Bob feels fine

489
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,400


490
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,400


491
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:05,400


492
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,380
It's the end of the world as we know it

493
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:09,100
It's the end of the world as we know it

494
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,280
Bob feels fine

495
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,800
It's the end of the world as we know it

496
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:12,800


497
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:38,020
And please don't forget to wear all the special equipment we've given you

498
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:44,140
and quote as many of the silly science fiction phrases like proton pack, nuclear device,

499
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:50,380
weekend whacker, and all of the other things that we've been telling you as you board the ships.

500
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,640
If it makes you feel better.

501
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:58,740
Also remember, after boarding the ships, there's a brief moment of unconsciousness called the swoon,

502
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,700
followed by some indigenous music played by aborigines.

503
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,160
On a didgeridoo.

504
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,000
And there's the smell of acrid fires burning.

505
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:11,140
As the temple of truth goes up all poo-poo.

506
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,920
A friendly reminder again.

507
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:20,080
Sack after sack of delicious coffee beans will be ground for your delectation and enjoyment.

508
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:26,800
And for some of you, your bodies will be ground and made part of that sample sumptuous ritual.

509
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:30,300
Yes, there will be that communication of communion.

510
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:32,780
We call it the mingling.

511
00:27:33,680 --> 00:27:35,260
Welcome to your source.

512
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,520
I am pleasure.

513
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:41,640
CV 456,154.

514
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:50,060
Sexual gratification and desire for film will begin in a moment.

515
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,660
First, we invite you to look out your window.

516
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,240
Say goodbye to the pinks who were left behind.

517
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,300
Now unzip your pants.

518
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,740
Just sit back.

519
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:08,220
And relax.

520
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,640
Feel better.

521
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,360
Feel better.

522
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,980
Then Connie shall be teleporting over shortly to congratulate you on your success as a subgenius.

523
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:50,820
The option to copulate with Isaac can be taken advantage of.

524
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:55,040
And I have taken the liberty of preparing a warning frock.

525
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,960
The time is 8A on July 5th.

526
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,880
I shall leave now.

527
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,340
Press the blue button.

528
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,420
Should you need me, goodbye.

529
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:20,140
The Special Saucer, your special saucer created by Reverend Heart Ignition.

530
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:25,100
Before that, Dr. Hal and Lonesome Cowboy Dave recorded at a future or past X-Day.

531
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:25,900
It's a moot point.

532
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:32,660
Before that, the end of the world as we know it take off was by the great Saint N and Hell in a Handbasket.

533
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:38,320
Before that, the subgenius anthem by the Mondo Retardo Band recorded at 8X Day.

534
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:43,040
The Love Church was collaged by Norrell Preff of NorrellPreff.com.

535
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,820
And before that, Chaz Smith and Dave and me on WCSB Cleveland's Swamp Radio.

536
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,700
And Ford Johnson as the Walking Dead.

537
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:57,040
Yes, on that fateful day, friends, some of us will be taken up, some will just be taken,

538
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:01,280
and some left behind with no radio stations from which to blabber,

539
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:02,640
but only little blabbers.

540
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:05,760
All because of their doubts.

541
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:12,220
I am unable to continue blindly working on a project of such phenomenal destructive potential.

542
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:15,640
Accordingly, there is only one course of action open to me.

543
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,460
Zach Hobson, July 5th.

544
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:27,360
One, there has been a malfunction in Project Flashlight with devastating results.

545
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,560
Two, it seems...

546
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:32,440
Two, it seems...

547
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:32,540
Two, it seems...

548
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:33,620
The only person left on it.

549
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,960
Well, you know, many people are going to be dreadfully, dreadfully out of juice

550
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,460
when the Planet X approaches.

551
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:45,740
Supposedly there are 12 years of extremely large sunspots.

552
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:49,480
A cycle like we've never seen before in solar activity,

553
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:53,820
which will cause many, many, many people to fail to reproduce.

554
00:30:53,900 --> 00:31:01,460
There will be a darthening, if you will, of sexual prowess and even a deepening of lackage.

555
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:01,940
And let's...

556
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,540
children, that's going to be the first

557
00:31:04,540 --> 00:31:06,200
sign there's going to be less and less children

558
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,080
because there's going to be less and less

559
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,300
sperm and eggs to go around. Is it any wonder

560
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,520
that they're low on liquid after all those

561
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:14,280
years in the crematorium?

562
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:16,500
Yes, especially with the sun

563
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,340
spots the way they are nowadays,

564
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,240
Grandma. I remember

565
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:22,640
when we used to get up and beat the jackal

566
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,800
like a hound. Remember those days?

567
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,360
Those days, of course, of course.

568
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:28,140
Sometimes it was at night, but

569
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:30,440
the angels would come, and then

570
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:31,300
we'd all dance,

571
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,160
and was that a dream?

572
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,520
No, I remember those dreamy angels.

573
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:37,900
Maybe that was a dream.

574
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,660
I don't know.

575
00:31:38,660 --> 00:31:39,380
I think it was

576
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,760
sun spots

577
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,620
in your head.

578
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,840
Sun spots.

579
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:13,800
I think that was ah Oooh

580
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:17,220
The Maid of horror

581
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:17,620
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

582
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:21,080
The Maid of horror

583
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,160
Is she out?

584
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:23,520
Oh, yeah

585
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,260
I guess so.

586
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,060
Yeah?

587
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:31,160
She said oh thelast time.

588
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,420
as hard as you can

589
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:35,100
Golden, golden

590
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,440
We've been the pinks in the boomers too

591
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:42,940
From the unreal sex goddess

592
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:46,320
We'll get him up on his knee

593
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,520
Fossils in the mud

594
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,240
Party till the morning

595
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:56,360
Then we're done, we're done

596
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,860
People standing and sleeping bags

597
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:03,520
Golden, golden

598
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,960
Ten hours of me sleeping less

599
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,960
Golden, golden

600
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:15,180
Connie's honey sitting by my side

601
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:18,620
We're gonna take that fine

602
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,140
Well, I can do it all the next day

603
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:25,020
Fossils in the mud

604
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,340
We'll get him up on his knee

605
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:28,860
Party till the morning

606
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,980
Then we're done, we're done

607
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:40,620
Out in the reeks

608
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:47,520
Geeks, freaks and loonies

609
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:54,240
If you ain't coming

610
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:00,640
Get money

611
00:34:16,300 --> 00:34:17,880
We'll get him, saucer him

612
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,240
Since 7 a.m.

613
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,800
Golden, golden

614
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:26,020
It's why the earth would cost a star again

615
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,020
Golden, golden

616
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:29,640
Golden

617
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:33,220
We're getting off this burned-down sphere

618
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,660
Or else we do this all again next year

619
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:40,160
Get him up on his knee

620
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,360
Fossils in the mud

621
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,960
Party till the morning

622
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:50,080
Then we're done, we're done

623
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,360
Get him up on his knee

624
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,000
Fossils in the mud

625
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,540
We're getting off this burned-down sphere

626
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:01,560
Fossils in the mud

627
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:02,000
Fossils in the mud

628
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:02,760
Then we're done

629
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:08,240
We're getting off this burned-down sphere

630
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:11,720
Fossils in the mud

631
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:12,840
Get him up!

632
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:13,320
We're getting off this burned-down sphere

633
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,320


634
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,320


635
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,320


636
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,320


637
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,320


638
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,320


639
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,320


640
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,000
A song by Reverend Ouroboros Rex

641
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:19,060
Of our beloved sister station, WEFT in Champaign, Illinois

642
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:23,020
Birthplace of both Dr. Hal and the Hal 9000 computer

643
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:23,680
Seriously

644
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:28,380
Before that, Princess Wheein lonesome cowboy Dave and a clip from the quiet earth.

645
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:34,540
Now, the bullfrogs of Brushwood recorded at the site of 9X Day by Reverend Rosnah.

646
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,700
Recently, a group of big wives asked this simple question.

647
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:03,680
What kind of food do you buy?

648
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:09,240
An overwhelming majority of wives said they preferred to buy small children packed in glass.

649
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:15,220
And by a ratio of more than 8 to 1, they insisted on prepared babies packed in glass.

650
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,600
Here are the three reasons mentioned most frequently.

651
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:23,000
First, you can heat, serve, and store leftover portions

652
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:23,660
of prepared food.

653
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,620
You can store prepared babies in the same glass container.

654
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:31,240
And third, glass lets you see sterilized children before you buy it.

655
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:37,440
You fool! You idiot! You fool! You idiot!

656
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,500
No! Don't! Don't!

657
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:42,540
The secret of X Day.

658
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,420
The secret of X Day.

659
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,340
Am I evil?

660
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,480
I don't know, my son.

661
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,680
All my life I've been a little man.

662
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,740
A happy little fellow.

663
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,420
But in the dressing room...

664
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,980
I, uh, I don't understand.

665
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:58,560
Did you ever hear of X Day?

666
00:36:59,180 --> 00:36:59,700
No.

667
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:00,560
You mean...

668
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:01,520
Yes, yes!

669
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,020
A chance to grow to normal size!

670
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:07,000
Please, please, please let him do it!

671
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,460
Just what does this X Day look like?

672
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,680
Uh, uh...

673
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:13,060
A rag.

674
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,480
I had grown! I had grown!

675
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:16,640
I was growing!

676
00:37:18,940 --> 00:37:22,820
You've grown, but not so much that I can't handle you.

677
00:37:22,980 --> 00:37:23,660
I was not...

678
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:25,340
Normal! Normal!

679
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,720
You look good to me.

680
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,600
I do?

681
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,700
Well, I always did go for big men.

682
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,420
Big?

683
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,300
Yeah.

684
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,320
I was vaguely disturbed.

685
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,340
No! Please, don't!

686
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:38,740
What's the matter, baby?

687
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,160
I... I... I... I...

688
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:42,240
It seems to me you're growing bigger.

689
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:43,220
Bigger?

690
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,540
Yeah. Yeah.

691
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:46,620
I thought at first I was seeing things, but...

692
00:37:46,620 --> 00:37:48,000
Now I know it's true.

693
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,880
You've grown bigger.

694
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,300
Don't...

695
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,300
I'm afraid of you, John.

696
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:53,400
Don't...

697
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:53,640
Don't...

698
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:53,640


699
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:53,640


700
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:53,640


701
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:53,640


702
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:53,640


703
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:53,640


704
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:53,640


705
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:53,640


706
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:53,640


707
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,300
You're too big now.

708
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,100
I mean, don't get big luck!

709
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:57,960
I mean...

710
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:59,800
Oh, stop! Stop that screaming!

711
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,580
You want to waste the whole street up!

712
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:01,940
I mean, don't!

713
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,380
No!

714
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,960
You're hurting me!

715
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,140
Help!

716
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:06,340
Help!

717
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:09,560
No!

718
00:38:11,060 --> 00:38:11,580
Yes!

719
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,000
Yes!

720
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,180
I'd grown at least six inches.

721
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:17,440
Now I was a freak again!

722
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,800
All my life I was a little man.

723
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,820
I wanted to know what it was...

724
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,620
What it was like to be a big man.

725
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:25,700
Now I am big.

726
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:27,420
Too big.

727
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:32,200
Too big!

728
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:35,460
Like the swing of a pendulum!

729
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,760
The secret of X-Day.

730
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:44,780
Russian and Cuban trawlers, undoubtedly surveillance vessels, have been circling the area.

731
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:48,600
And Soviet aircraft have repeatedly been warned away.

732
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:51,560
Pippi, what's the matter with you?

733
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:52,740
What's the matter with me?

734
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:53,200
Nothing.

735
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:58,200
We're just in the middle of some big time international incident like the Cuban Missile Crisis or something.

736
00:38:58,420 --> 00:38:59,680
Figured that out for yourself, did you, Hip?

737
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,100
Something is going on!

738
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,500
Come on, come on.

739
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,900
Pippi, you think everything's a conspiracy.

740
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,740
Everything is.

741
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,080
Every day is X-Day when you have a gun!

742
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,340
You know, you've got to educate them.

743
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,060
If you have a gun, you can make your own reality.

744
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,340
Probe into their lives and really inspect them.

745
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,220
And so let's go into their own reality.

746
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,780
Armed and humorous.

747
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,420
People, yeah, we march into the future.

748
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,380
A hundred years from now.

749
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:22,860
But we have safe guns.

750
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:26,640
We have to sell them all kinds of important things later.

751
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:30,240
The guns laugh instead of making shot sounds.

752
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:30,620
Yes.

753
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:32,740
And the bullets, when they hit you, they tickle you.

754
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,040
They've gone to figure out what they want, what they like, what they don't like.

755
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,260
It's going to be a wonderful future.

756
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,340
This is random nonsense.

757
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,360
Church reform the next hundred years.

758
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:42,980
Take it!

759
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,440
Okay, church reform.

760
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,000
We're okay.

761
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,200
What are we going to do for the next 100 years?

762
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,540
I mean, how are you going to keep people down?

763
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,160
You are on the board.

764
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,660
You, for 250, you have...

765
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:51,820
Once again, the gay Paris.

766
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:52,600
Recently.

767
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:53,000
Well, gay.

768
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:53,480
Well, gay.

769
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,880
Gay is the underlying word here, I think, I'm sure.

770
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,340
How do you keep them busy?

771
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:00,160
How do you keep them gay when they're down on the farm?

772
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,300
How do you keep them on the farm when they're gay?

773
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:03,080
That's right.

774
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:07,260
Well, how can you improve upon a church that has done so much for so little?

775
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:08,600
For so few.

776
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:09,420
Look at the numbers.

777
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:11,280
Never have so few probably...

778
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:11,720
And the output.

779
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,760
Just output.

780
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,180
...by so much...

781
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:19,560
Well, if you look around, almost every member of the church of the subgenius is in this

782
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,760
radio studio right now.

783
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,180
Right now.

784
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:21,960
I mean, it's like...

785
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:23,920
I mean, there's an atom bomb to go off right now.

786
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:25,340
Not that there should be.

787
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,480
There were a couple of subgeniuses...

788
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:27,960
Clam Chow.

789
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,540
...in the Al Qaeda here.

790
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,660
Otherwise, I'd be asking a free speech.

791
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,520
Or FBI.

792
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,800
All of the world is screwed.

793
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:33,260
That's right.

794
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,680
The church is screwed.

795
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,220
CIA.

796
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:41,180
If the bastion of free speech gets nuked right now by Al Qaeda...

797
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,360
This is the Vatican.

798
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,840
...there's about three or four major religions...

799
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,180
That's right.

800
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:44,220
That's right.

801
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,500
Alternative religion is going down.

802
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:48,660
This is the Vatican of alternative religion right now as we see it.

803
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,260
Well, at least...

804
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,220
That's right.

805
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,580
...they're going down if Al Qaeda gets their way.

806
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:52,580


807
00:40:52,580 --> 00:40:54,560
The church of the subgenius goes down.

808
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,600
Civilization goes...

809
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:56,960
Safety.

810
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,020
It's off.

811
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:58,720
It's smoking.

812
00:40:59,020 --> 00:40:59,380
You're a stupid boy.

813
00:40:59,380 --> 00:40:59,560
Stupid.

814
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:01,060
I would say it was the edict of the mountain.

815
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:02,180
Well, four cents.

816
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:02,920
You owe me four cents.

817
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,900
I own the rights to the word stupid.

818
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,100
There's no trust with these darn parents.

819
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:06,980
Every time you use the word stupid...

820
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,400
This is it.

821
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:07,840
...you owe me four cents.

822
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:08,600
Four cents.

823
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,340
This will decide the fate of the world.

824
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:11,140
Stupid.

825
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:11,520
What?

826
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:12,480
Accusations against...

827
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:12,700
Stupid.

828
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,320
I own the rights to the word stupid.

829
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,420
The fate of the entire universe is about to be discussed now.

830
00:41:16,540 --> 00:41:17,440
I've got trademark rights on that.

831
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:18,020
So I get...

832
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:21,580
Every time anybody uses it in print or verbally, I get four cents.

833
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,020
Leave alone.

834
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:22,900
So...

835
00:41:23,380 --> 00:41:24,680
Is it broken?

836
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,320
Rototill, all of reality.

837
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,540
I listened to our guest call.

838
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,760
She was around here screaming.

839
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:31,980
Then, if it's not broken, I think we should use the bathroom now.

840
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,760
Reverend Stang, Rototill, all of reality.

841
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,380
He's going...

842
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:37,360
If it is...

843
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:41,280
If it's not broken, I say we go in there and fix the damn thing.

844
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:41,840
Fix it.

845
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,360
Fix it.

846
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:43,960
Fix the hell out of it.

847
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,240
Fix the freaking hell out of it.

848
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,620
Broke or unbroke.

849
00:41:47,620 --> 00:41:47,860
You get a brisker.

850
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,200
There you are.

851
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:49,900
There you are.

852
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:51,080
You have to come to the $25 million.

853
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:51,560
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

854
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:51,560


855
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:51,560


856
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:51,560


857
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,500
Just fix it.

858
00:41:52,580 --> 00:41:52,980
Just fix it.

859
00:41:52,980 --> 00:41:53,240
Tamper.

860
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:54,660
That's our motto.

861
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:55,620
Tamper.

862
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:58,980
If you don't work, you gotta fix it.

863
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,900
I don't contest.

864
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:01,720
Simper tamper.

865
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,800
Simper tamper.

866
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:08,940
That was from the subgenius retreat recorded at KPFA Berkeley a few years back with an

867
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:13,740
all-star cast including Dr. Howe, Puzzling Evidence, Philo Drummond, Bishop Joey, Michael

868
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:17,280
Pepe, yours truly, Reverend Stang, and host, Don Joyce of Negative Land.

869
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:21,160
Before that, the abyss of Norel Pref and also Lemur.

870
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:29,280
Now, from 13 years ago, some classic ESO swamp radio from producer Chaz Smith and the

871
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:36,000
whole ESO band in the old WCSB studio recorded before our first X Day drill in 1996.

872
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:41,940
These phobias can be conquered if...

873
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:48,800
No, but those insects were there the night Harry put over the energy.

874
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,200
Oh, my God.

875
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:51,140
Oh, my God.

876
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:56,760
Their energy.

877
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,000
Look!

878
00:42:58,560 --> 00:42:59,540
His energy.

891

In Brushwood, New York, on July 5th through 7th this year and every year from now till X-Day.

892
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:30,340
That's right, Ivan. That's right.

893
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:34,440
Remember to call for free information about the amazing X-Day drill.

894
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,620
Yes, it's like the legendary Dockstock Gathering.

895
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:39,160
That's right, Ivan. That's right, Ivan.

896
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:43,440
Oh, you'll see the most hated preachers of the subgenius church.

897
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:48,020
You'll camp out on a lovely, fully developed campground surrounded by...

898
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:52,940
Geeks you'd rather not ever spend much time with.

899
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:56,560
But by God, you'll know more about the church of the subgenius mother.

900
00:43:56,620 --> 00:44:03,680
Because, friends, you will have practiced for that fatal day, that glorious day, X-Day.

901
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:09,900
Yes, only two years from now, in 1998, the sex goddesses from Planet X shall come.

902
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:17,440
And rupture up the news paying fully Dobbs-approved subgenius ministers.

903
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:17,920
That's right.

904
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:22,280
Call 4,000 of us and destroy the rest of the planet.

905
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:22,880
That's right, Ivan.

906
00:44:23,080 --> 00:44:30,400
Well, not destroy it, but turn it back into the stinking swamp that it was before the filthy humans came along and muddied everything up.

907
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,380
But, friends, you can come along and muddy everything up.

908
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:34,880
You can wallow in the filth.

909
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:36,740
You can dance all night.

910
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,880
You can pull your clothes off and county law doesn't care.

911
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:46,640
Because we are having the first X-Day drill this July 5th through 7th.

912
00:44:46,780 --> 00:44:47,300
Sunday.

913
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:47,480
Sunday.

914
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:48,600
Sunday.

915
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:48,980
Sunday.

916
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:49,700
Sunday.

917
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:49,700


918
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,900
You'll see the pill.

919
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:54,360
You'll see the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

920
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,480
It lives.

921
00:44:55,600 --> 00:45:00,320
It bleeds for you if you don't vomit your money back.

922
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:03,620
Friends, you will see things you wouldn't dare believe.

923
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:07,440
Things you never wanted to believe and things you'll wish you never saw.

924
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,320
That's right, Ivan.

925
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:11,340
Yetis will be copulating in the bushes.

926
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:12,080
Oh, dude.

927
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,040
The blackness monster will rise up from the little pond.

928
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:15,940
But, Ivan.

929
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:16,540
The...

930
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:20,800
The crazed pagan drummers will drum all night long and keep you from sleeping.

931
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:25,060
Mosquitoes the size of dobson flies will devour you.

932
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:25,980
But you won't care.

933
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:31,320
You won't care because you spent your money and came to the X-Day drill.

934
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:34,660
July 5th through 7th in Brushwood, New York.

935
00:45:34,700 --> 00:45:35,440
Brushwood, New York.

936
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,320
Only three hours from Cleveland.

937
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,580
And, friends, you can call for information.

938
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:41,540
216-

939
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,340
Yelp.

940
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:42,720
Yelp.

941
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:46,160
60338.

942
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,580
I'll give that number again.

943
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:48,680
Write that number down.

944
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:53,100
It's the free information divival hotline of the Church of the Subgenius here in Cleveland.

945
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:56,280
12060338.

946
00:45:59,200 --> 00:45:59,920
That's 12060338.

947
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:01,620
What do those numbers add up to?

948
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:02,020
Aha!

949
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:03,160
Now you know the secret.

950
00:46:03,380 --> 00:46:05,620
Now you know what we're really trying to tell you about.

951
00:46:05,720 --> 00:46:06,420
The froth.

952
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,440
Yes, the froth.

953
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:08,460
There's no end to it.

954
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:08,740
That's right, Ivan.

955
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,720
Buckets of froth.

956
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:11,260
Back tubs full of froth.

957
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:12,100
Three months tired.

958
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:12,660
That's right, Ivan.

959
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,220
Of froth.

960
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,380
A different nature.

961
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,320
We're home to the Romanian ocean full of flow.

962
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:16,520
We're home to the Romanian ocean full of flow.

963
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,600
Ancient Tibetan herbs.

964
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:19,720


965
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:22,120
Scrolling right up under your feet.

966
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:23,500
You won't be able to sleep.

967
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:28,240
There'll be so much froth growing at high speed underneath your sleeping bag tossing you around.

968
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:29,960
It's like a giant funhouse.

969
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,080
Yes, it's insane.

970
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:31,860
It's crazy.

971
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:37,540
But ain't it always been the crazy people that were able to party like they do now?

972
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:39,180
Yes, sir, E-Bob.

973
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:40,880
Yes, sir, ma'am, sir, lady.

974
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:45,760
You will finally learn what it's like to be a subgenius.

975
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:46,040
We're home to the Romanian ocean full of froth.

976
00:46:46,040 --> 00:46:46,140
We're home to the Romanian ocean full of flow.

977
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:46,140


978
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:46,140


979
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:46,140


980
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:50,160
That's right, Ivan Stang of the Church of Subgenius and...

981
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:55,140
Oh, did I say that?

982
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:57,020
Well, then, pick up on it, man.

983
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,640
It's said that the end of the world shall come in a great flash.

984
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:15,360
I sure hope so.

985
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:16,120
So long, man.

986
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:16,120


987
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:16,160
Well, that's why we're here today.

988
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,160


989
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,160


990
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,160


991
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,340
Some people might go and the other ones might last.

992
00:47:19,460 --> 00:47:21,880
Will you be the one who goes?

993
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:24,400
Where will you be on next day, brother?

994
00:47:25,140 --> 00:47:26,100
Where is your ex?

995
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,020
Where will you be on next day, brother?

996
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,880
Will you be in the sausage?

997
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:35,340
Will you be in the sausage with ba-ba-ba-ba-ba?

998
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,840
There's still lots of room.

999
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,280
Oh, will you be down in the...

1000
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:43,040
You can hang up on anything you want...

1001
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,440
Will you be burning?

1002
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,580
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1003
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:46,120
Do you have that little cover on?

1004
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,120


1005
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:46,120


1006
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,980
Well, it seems perfect pleasure.

1007
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:50,880
Perfect pay.

1008
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,200
Which will it be?

1009
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:53,680
It's up to you to choose.

1010
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,060
Bob gives you free will.

1011
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,340
But you can't feel anything until you sign on the dotted line.

1012
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:05,300
And X Day is coming, so you better move fast because where will you be on X Day?

1013
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:10,680
I've got plenty of time to spend my $30 on that Bob ministership.

1014
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,140
I've got plenty of time.

1015
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,180
It's two more years for X Day.

1016
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:15,720
Why am I in any kind of hurry?

1017
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:23,100
Well, there couldn't possibly have been some kind of a misprint in the book of the subgenius.

1018
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:31,880
I mean, just because that first edition from McGraw-Hill actually did say that X Day was on July 5th, 1996.

1019
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,460
Well, they changed it after that.

1020
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,760
I'm sure that, I mean, it looked like a mistake.

1021
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,280
I probably was a mistake.

1022
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:43,280
I don't think I really have to spend that $30 quite yet.

1023
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,520
Because that probably was just, it's probably not.

1024
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:49,180
I bet the world's going to end this year, 1996.

1025
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,640
Probably not.

1026
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:54,560
I could probably afford to take that risk.

1027
00:48:54,860 --> 00:48:57,340
I mean, I've got that $30.

1028
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,400
That's not a problem.

1029
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:02,280
But there's this Hootie and the Blowfish CD I wanted to get.

1030
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:07,620
And, well, you know, I wanted to go to this movie about water spouts.

1031
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:12,300
And, well, I just, you know, I mean, Bob will wait on me.

1032
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,240
I mean, Bob's a patient man.

1033
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:17,380
He ain't a rat, poor God.

1034
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:23,560
Now, I heard Bob loved these subgeniuses, even if they never spent any money.

1035
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:24,260
A patient man?

1036
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:25,880
A patient man?

1037
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:27,680
Man, he ain't no patient.

1038
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,880
Bob is the doctor.

1039
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,440
He ain't no patient man.

1040
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:39,160
Bob is the surgeon who will excise the filthy, rotting tumor that is America.

1041
00:49:40,420 --> 00:49:41,840
That is modern America today.

1042
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:44,940
Yes, my fellow rebellious citizens.

1043
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,280
And untaxed payers.

1044
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:48,680
And militia members.

1045
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,840
All the citizens of courts.

1046
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:53,460
We must come together.

1047
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:54,740
We must come together.

1048
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,520
Quick, they're coming.

1049
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:57,000
They're trying to stop me from speaking.

1050
00:49:57,200 --> 00:49:58,600
All of us religious nuts.

1051
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,180
And crazy, bright-winged maniacs.

1052
00:50:01,180 --> 00:50:02,820
We must band together against the man.

1053
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:04,340
Because, oh, wait, they're coming.

1054
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:06,240
I've got to get my message out.

1055
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:12,660
The last true hope is 5560338.

1056
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,680
Call 55603.

1057
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:15,320
Here they come.

1058
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,180
Come on.

1059
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:17,400
I see you.

1060
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:18,220
Come on.

1061
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,160
Let's go.

1062
00:50:19,400 --> 00:50:19,800
Come on.

1063
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:20,760
I see you.

1064
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:28,560
I'm going to tell you it's going to be.

1065
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:35,000
I'm going to give your love to me.

1066
00:50:35,960 --> 00:50:36,660
No, no.

1067
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,520
No, no, no, no.

1068
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:42,180
You'll have to laugh more than one day.

1069
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:44,780
No, no, no, no, no.

1070
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,500
No, no, no, no, no.

1071
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:45,500


1072
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:45,500


1073
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,320
I love the town I play in

1074
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:55,080
I love the town I play in

1075
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,440
Hey!

1076
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:29,480
Gotta coat the snake for a necktie

1077
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:36,380
Got me a church by the roadside

1078
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:39,060
Made out of rattlesnake hide

1079
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,320
Bob is gonna ask you

1080
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,440
Who do you love?

1081
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,120
Bob is gonna ask you

1082
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,420
Who do you love?

1083
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:55,120
Who do you love?

1084
00:51:56,180 --> 00:51:58,180
Oh, who do you love?

1085
00:51:59,120 --> 00:52:01,620
Oh, who do you love?

1086
00:52:03,800 --> 00:52:04,820
Oh, I tried to

1087
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:06,760
Drop it, but

1088
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:11,700
Your lover man

1089
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:13,700
Got me around

1090
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:14,780
Oh

1091
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:15,260
Oh

1092
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:15,300
Oh

1093
00:52:15,320 --> 00:52:15,480
Oh

1094
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,200
Oh

1095
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:22,380
Oh

1096
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,000
Oh

1097
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,280
Oh

1098
00:52:31,280 --> 00:52:31,280


1099
00:52:34,120 --> 00:52:35,520
Oh

1100
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:35,640
Oh

1101
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:36,420
Oh

1102
00:52:36,420 --> 00:52:37,620
Oh

1103
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:38,960
Oh

1104
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:38,980
Oh

1105
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:39,000
Oh

1106
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:39,020
Oh

1107
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,740
Oh

1108
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:40,820
Oh

1109
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,060
love is real and not paid away.

1110
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:47,400
Love is real and not paid away.

1111
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,860
Love is real and not paid away.

1112
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:54,260
Love is real and not paid away.

1113
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:57,540
Love is real and not paid away.

1114
00:52:58,420 --> 00:53:00,780
Love is real and not paid away.

1115
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:04,380
Love is real and not paid away.

1116
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:14,260
Anyway, friends, the human race is obviously, let's face it, a parasitic fungus,

1117
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:22,160
an infestation much like fleas, and the host is soon to be dipped, as Carter was saying.

1118
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:30,120
The warranty on this planet is about to run out, but J.R. Boggoss is the extended service policy.

1119
00:53:30,860 --> 00:53:36,060
For all you know, he may already be world overlord.

1120
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:43,120
In fact, if what Bob said is true, then you might already be world overlord.

1121
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:50,840
So we must ask ourselves, why don't we have Halloween every day already?

1122
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,640
Why not the bottomless bowl of ice cream?

1123
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:58,820
Why not the dishwashing machine that really does the dishes?

1124
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:03,120
You alone can make this happen.

1125
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,380
Bob is not the answer, and neither is anything else.

1126
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,520
Praise Bob!

1127
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:16,460
You must learn to think for yourself, but only Bob can show you how.

1128
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:20,580
So stop asking what's in Bob's pipe.

1129
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:25,280
Throw yourself into his pipe and let him make an ash of you.

1130
00:54:25,460 --> 00:54:27,440
For the nameless mission!

1131
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:29,960
This is all for the nameless mission, friends.

1132
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:36,120
This church is a religion that doesn't bullshit you that it's not bullshit.

1133
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:40,800
Therefore, it's the one true religion.

1134
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:49,720
Now, no matter how stupid we must look or even be, we must continue for Bob!

1135
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:59,200
You too can be a part of this last-minute effort at changing all Earth history retroactively.

1136
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:03,600
Do you have what it takes?

1137
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:06,900
Then Bob will take it, my friend.

1138
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:11,220
You will go down Bob's pipe one way or another.

1139
00:55:12,140 --> 00:55:17,580
You must be saved, even if it kills you.

1140
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:23,760
So put your frock where your mouth is, my friend.

1141
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:26,840
Repent! Quit your job! Slack off!

1142
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:29,840
The world ends tomorrow and you may die!

1143
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,120
Now, did you hear that?

1144
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:34,400
The world ends tomorrow!

1145
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,320
Not the next day!

1146
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,040
Not in 1998!

1147
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:38,800
Tomorrow!

1148
00:55:39,220 --> 00:55:41,320
The world ends tomorrow and you may die!

1149
00:55:41,460 --> 00:55:46,480
Have you been living every day as if it was the last day of your life?

1150
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:50,560
Or else as if you have all the time in the world?

1151
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,620
Because it's one and or the other.

1152
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:59,160
Bob has made it quite plain

1153
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:04,660
that we had better cover our own asses just in case.

1154
00:56:05,020 --> 00:56:07,280
And build our own ships.

1155
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:09,580
We can't wait for the aliens.

1156
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,220
We have to build our own ships.

1157
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:15,560
And in the meantime we might as well clean up the one that we're already on.

1158
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,980
People ask me, they say,

1159
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,280
Reverend Stang, come on, tell me the truth.

1160
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,800
What do you really believe in?

1161
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,920
What do you truly, really believe in?

1162
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:28,680
I believe in that!

1163
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:29,140
I believe in that!

1164
00:56:29,140 --> 00:56:29,880
That face!

1165
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:35,720
That face will always be there!

1166
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,760
And it will always be laughing.

1167
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:42,840
And not necessarily with us.

1168
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,140
If you want a picture of the future,

1169
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:51,360
imagine a pipe smoking in a human face forever.

1170
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:57,780
The only thing that never fails is failure.

1171
00:56:57,780 --> 00:57:01,840
The only thing that never works is perfection.

1172
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:03,540
And therefore,

1173
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,900
Fuck them if they can't take a joke!

1174
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:11,260
Join the Church of the Subgenius, my friend!

1175
00:57:11,500 --> 00:57:13,300
It's a no-brainer.

1176
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:20,040
Praise Onam for so many of the one-liners.

1177
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:29,040
Why, he's mad!

1178
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,060
Look in his eyes!

1179
00:57:31,640 --> 00:57:33,400
Why, the man's gone crazy!

1180
00:57:36,040 --> 00:57:37,520
Crazy for Bob, friends!

1181
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,800
I've got Bob on the Brain, B.O.B.

1182
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,340
The sermon was from Baltimore D Bible 2008.

1183
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:45,440
The crazy laugh from Dwight Frye in Dracula.

1184
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:52,000
The background music behind me right now is the amino acids of TheAminoAcids.com

1185
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:56,780
who will be playing and premiering their feature film at 12X Day this July 4th.

1186
00:57:57,000 --> 00:58:00,240
This is the Church of the Subgenius Radio Ministry,

1187
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:04,140
the hour of slack number 1209 from June 2009,

1188
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:06,620
last days of man on earth.

1189
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:09,420
Remember, if you have questions about anything,

1190
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:17,280
Google Subgenius or go to Subgenius.com for answers and some solutions creating chaos with madness.

1191
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:18,240
Pop culture.

1192
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:18,880
Madness.

1193
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:20,380
The meaning of life is sex.

1194
00:58:20,560 --> 00:58:21,120
It's money.

1195
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:21,840
It's power.

1196
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,160
Fall in love with power.

1197
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:25,880
What just happened in Kansas.

1198
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:26,980
We have real problems.

1199
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,080
Ratings on restaurants.

1200
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:30,620
People can't figure these things out on their own.

1201
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:32,700
Give me that little twinkle way down deep inside.

1202
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:33,840
Way down deep inside.

1203
00:58:33,960 --> 00:58:34,540
Deep inside.

1204
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:35,720
Beginning to make sense.

1205
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:37,260
Madness now.

1206
00:58:37,440 --> 00:58:39,480
Christians, Christians, they offer no hope.

1207
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:45,800
All they offer is despair because it's in their benefit to have you dependent on them.

1208
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:47,140
To have you fail.

1209
00:58:47,260 --> 00:58:48,400
To implement despair.

1210
00:58:48,940 --> 00:58:49,740
Get a job?

1211
00:58:49,880 --> 00:58:53,300
You talk about a message of hopelessness that's so vile.

1212
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,620
It's so hopeless.

1213
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:55,600
Christians, Christians,

1214
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:56,980
Everywhere you turn, there's hope.

1215
00:58:56,980 --> 00:58:59,380
They give you this message of just total despair.

1216
00:58:59,860 --> 00:59:03,500
Your life is not going to amount to anything without the heavy hand of God.

1217
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:05,100
Go and live on welfare for good.

1218
00:59:05,320 --> 00:59:07,800
I'm getting high every day, hanging out at the beach.

1219
00:59:08,020 --> 00:59:09,760
That was a subgenius.

1220
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:12,140
You know, subgenius.

1221
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:13,380
Subgenius.

1222
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:14,680
Subgenius.

1223
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:15,680
Subgenius.

1224
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:15,680


1225
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:16,220
Normal.

1226
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:21,480
What is wrong with you that you would buy into this lie, this concept they call America?

1227
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:22,820
This is on minimum wage?

1228
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:23,660
Snatch.

1229
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:24,240
Snatch.

1230
00:59:24,280 --> 00:59:24,560
Snatch.

1231
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,860
Their mama is on crack.

1232
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:26,820
Subgenius.

1233
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:28,160
Grace.

1234
00:59:28,220 --> 00:59:28,660
Grace .

1235
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:28,660


1236
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:28,660


1237
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:28,660


1238
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:28,660


1239
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:28,660


1240
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:28,660


1241
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:28,660


1242
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:28,660


1243
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:28,660


1244
00:59:28,660 --> 00:59:28,660


1245
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:32,680
Serviceabeuu.

1246
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:33,160
Serviceabeuu.

1247
00:59:33,160 --> 00:59:33,160


1248
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:33,240


1249
00:59:33,800 --> 00:59:34,380
Serviceabeuu.

1250
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:37,840
Serviceabeuu.

1251
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:51,560
Serviceabeuu.

1252
00:59:51,560 --> 00:59:52,560
Serviceabeuu.

1253
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:53,560
Serviceabeuu.

1254
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:38,060
Thank you.
