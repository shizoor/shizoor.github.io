When they say, repent, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.
When they say, repent, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.
When they say, repent, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.
Give me that burning wall, give me stone and St. Paul, give me Christ or give me Hiroshima.
Give me the burning wall, destroy the law.
Mother feed us now, we're doing that children anyhow.
I've seen the future, baby, it is murder.
Things are gonna slide, in all directions.
There won't be nothing, nothing you can't measure anymore.
The prison, the blood of the world is across the...
...threshold and it's over, turn the order of the soul.
When they say, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.
When they say, repent, repent, I wonder what they meant.
When they say, repent, repent...
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.
Now, holy men have pointed out that brains are like radios that can be tuned, and the will is like a gun that can be aimed. Some aim better than others.
These occurrences are pure figments of imagination.
Everything you know is wrong, every note of every song, every truth you've ever known are lies.
People know what they believe, but nothing's really up their sleeve.
They try to hide their faith in this.
They try.
JFK and grassy nose, dinosaurs and hosannas, desert storms and somebody's brains are drugs.
Everything you know is wrong.
Smash a little egg with a frying pan.
Fry it up.
Cook it up.
Serve it.
Serve it.
Serve it on a sandwich.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
We'll be right back.
word of Bob. Of course, you always have the random unpredictable audience participation,
which may include healing of the sick, sickening of the healthy, performances of, yes, anti-music,
sing-alongs, hate-alongs, and the occasional self-emolation. That's what it says right here
in the paper, so we've got to live up to that, and we also have to live up to that description
from Christina Tate, who, I'll remind you, said,
Delight in the visage of the one true slackmaster as your old life burns away and your hate-lust
is quenched in an endless ejaculation of loathing and scorn!
Oh, Christina. It's wonderful net, don't you see? Oh, yeah, and special guest stars,
Lunch Cowboy Dave.
Herman Neck.
Dr.
Chow.
Chaz.
The Einstein Secret Orchestra.
Live, right there, to be abused, right for Dr. Katad Legume, the scariest Yankee subgenius
preacher, the terrifying, mysterious Pennsylvania redneck investments, carrying a chainsaw,
the mystic chainsaw.
The great Dr. Legume, one of the all-time natural, from-the-gut subgenius ranters.
For a sweet pop music band called Forms of Insanity.
Oh, yeah, those guys are great.
Yeah, Reverend Toth Wilder's band.
They do a charming rendition of the old raunch song, Hey Bob Rebab.
Hey Bob Rebab!
Hey Bob Rebab!
Hey Bob Rebab!
Hey Bob Rebab!
Hey Bob Rebab!
The old rooster to the little red hen.
Coming over, baby, let pop us.
Oh, I can't see.
You'll have to come to the show to learn the real lyrics to Louie Louie and Frank Zappa's King Kong.
We have the secret videotapes.
Oh, yeah.
You know those totally weird tapes?
That's so genius.
One of those genius shows.
It was like they had these video projections that were like I was frapped to the gills.
But when I walked into there, man, it was like I was just.
It was like I was on.
I was on head.
You know, it's like I was on bleeding head on the magnetized.
It was like these these visions of like Bob entered my mind because it was like so psychedelic up on that screen.
And there were these guys were like screaming about hating the normal people.
And I was I was like, yeah, this guy handed me this pipe and it had like.
Could you dim the lights a little bit so I don't get too nervous and be myself?
I'm selfish.
Shit.
I may have a problem with my holding my bladder for the past seven and a half years.
I've been in and out of mental institutions and as a form of therapy.
They put me on a radio station.
And throughout this time, I was attended to by a shamanistic Indian holistic medicine man named Psychopath Finder.
But throughout this time, I was attempted to be incarcerated back in the Sebring State Mental Institution by by an evil Neo Freud.
It found me with noмe seemed to care if some some certain revalidate.
Now withally, I got Goldberg who told me only �纆 Grandma was dead.
Why, for justice me
Yeah, she felt great suffering there.
But every century, there's been men and women who we're saddened by it.
I'll tell you how I found Bob.
I found Bob in parades of Russians on Route 90 on the
shoreway driving by, masturbating and
ejaculating strange cries.
I found Bob in a bad onion breath in a bodega in New York.
I found Bob in a bad poor boy sandwich with rancid ham.
And I realized that maybe I should search, search, search,
search, search, search, and find religion.
Because after all, my life as a substance abuser was going
nowhere.
I said I'll stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby.
I said I'll stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby.
Because I'm a man.
I'm a man.





Because you kick him in the face, and then you get such a
disgrace the way you treat him, and you treat him, and you
treat him.
.
And it was at that time, I began to write songs for
therapy.
And in a hallucination and a midnight vestigial, I heard the
Yeti cry.
.
He!
I said I'll stop abusing that substance abuser now, baby.
Hey, was I cross-eyed when I started playing?
Dude, whoa, you're getting way out there again.
Good, man, because it was like, I don't know, I was going like, Bob, what is this Bob?
And I was going, yeah, I can dig it, because they're into slack.
You know, I'm like, I can dig that.
I could, you know, cut me some slack.
I'll use some slack.
And then, yeah, Bob, okay.
But then they started like, I suddenly, they gave me another one of those pills.
And suddenly I thought to myself, like, I'm a drug abuser, man.
I'm destroying my body.
I'm like wrecking myself.
And so I thought, well, I've got to get off these conspiracy street drugs, like Bob says,
and get one of those machines they were selling.
Because you could, like, turn it up.
It was a mind machine.
And it would, like, squeeze the middle of your head, man.
It would put you out there, man.
And you'd, like, see Bob.
You'd see Bob.
And then you'd turn it all the way up to 10.
Yeah, and you'd puke.
But it was cool.
It was like you'd puke, and it was cool.
You started crying.
Yeah, you cried.
Yeah, excuse me.
And you'd, like, you'd, like, soil yourself, man.
Soil it, yeah.
Soil it.
Soil it green.
Yeah.
Soil it green, man.
Yeah.


Yeah.


Do that.
That was cool.
And, yeah, they were selling it.
Soil it green was, like, 50 cents.
Well, I didn't do any of that stuff, man.
It was, like, made from normal people or something.
They said.
If I'd done that, I would have tried it.
They had me sign this paper.
I signed up for it.
That's what they told me.
I'd be on the waiting list to get some of it.
If I died, like, they'd, like, something about Bob's basement.
Something about Bob Dobbs' basement?
Bob.
I don't know.
Man, when my parents see this Bob tattoo I got on my forehead, they're gonna, like, freak,
dude.
Whoa, dude.
There's no tattoo on your forehead.
Yeah, this Bob tattoo.
Yeah, man.
It's, like, the invisible mark of the beast.
I got one on my hand, too.
Whoa, dude.
Where'd you get that?
You know what, Dad?
The subgenius revival down there, man.
Like, the Art Institute.
The factory building.
They were doing it, man.
Like, tomorrow night.
It's time control.
I was there.
It's tomorrow night.
It's time control, dude.
Bob made time control.
He invented it, like, Slack, man.
He invented money, man.
Bob invented money.
Wow, man.
Yeah, and dogs.
He invented dogs, man.
That's what they said in the alien times.
You did, like, Bob, Dad.
Of mutantas.
I found out I was reincarnated, dude.
This priestess.
Like, there were these priestesses, dude.
Dressed like nurses.
Wow, priestesses.
God.
Yeah.
And they'd come up and they'd, like.
They had big ones?
They had a whole bunch of them.
Wow.
I never saw so many.
Man.
Well, they, it wasn't that.
They were, they were moving, though.
Ah, the sausage man was there.
And they, they were, they were like these, this chick.
She, like, read my, my, my third nostril, she said.
And she said I was reincarnated from, like, this yeti master of mutantas in the days of dinosaurs.
And I was, yeah, I was like a king, man.
But then I misused my powers, so that's why I had to pay for it by working down there at White Castle.
That's what happens, man.
You don't want.
Yeah, it's like my karma.
But it's, you know, that's what, that's what this priestess said.
And I was like.
Wow.
She acted like she might go out with me.
She was bad, man.
No way.
I think I got some karma, man.
She had them, like, all over her.
She had them on her legs, dude.
She had, like, these globular round objects on her, on her ankles, man.
They were, like, on the side of her head hanging off.
It was like, it was, I was so turned on, dude.
She was, she was like.
I was like, I'm a angel.
I was into it.
I was like, man, if this Bob Church, if they're, it's gonna be like this.
And they have the karma with the little fingers on it.
The purple fingers.
Sometimes those globes ooze, too.
Yeah, man.
Especially the priestess chicks, man.
They ooze big time.
I knew this guy that had some, too.
You never knew anybody like that.
That had what?
The karma with the fingers on it.
The rotating karma.
You smoked the karma with the fingers on it.
You smoked good chicken.
Oh, yeah.
Wait a minute.
I'm gonna have to go to the bathroom.



Dude, you never tried this.
You smoked the chicken, and then you put, like, the 50 cents in the rotator bed, and the karma
comes and, like, you know.
Oh, dude.
So, and he oozed, right?
He oozed.
Yeah, that's the lubricant, man.
That's the KY jelly.
Cool.
Yeah.
Cool.
Yeah.
Whatever.
Yeah.
Oh, I wouldn't try that.
Did you try that, man?
Like, the other day, I said, hey, hey, mom, I'm getting, like, the slack has, like, shaved
into my haircut and back.
It says slack.
And she goes, hey, like, if all your friends were in it and jumped off the edge of a cliff,
would you, like, do it?
I would, man.
Yeah, man.
Yeah.
I did that once, man.
Jumped into the abyss, man.
Jumped into the abyss.
Yeah, there's things that suck your soul in there, dude.
If you go all the way in the abyss, man, there are, like, these, like, things that suck your
soul.
I did that when I was 14.
Yeah, there was this dude there.
They had, like, this devival thing, this subgenius thing.
They had, like, this spook house, dude.
And there was this trap door, and you'd go in there, and you'd pay 50 cents, and they'd
say, see the thing, and you'd go in there, and they'd just leave you in this room with
this trap door.
Are we gonna be...
And, like, the high priest would look at you and go, whatever you do, kid, like, don't
knock on that door three times and say, yog sa thoth.
And then they'd, like, leave.
Oh, man.
And you'd be in there, and you'd, like, go...
You gotta do it.
Yeah, you gotta.
But then I got kind of...
Because Bob said no, too, right?
But then I thought, well, but they made me pay 50 cents, man.
It's like something might really happen.
Right, like you could maybe a cop...
Yeah, it's like maybe, like, yog sa thoth would be invoked, you know?
Maybe that's the cop's marriage here, you know?
Or Satan or something.
Yeah, or they might like...
Yeah.
Or that's like, well, that's just what they want me to do.
They want me to buy that stuff.
I'm not gonna...
No, man.
No, I don't...
So did you do it, right?
I bought it.
No, man.
No, man.
I got...
I freaked, man.
You just got real upset.
You had a heart-tide split?
You had a...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Uh-oh.
It was the way the guy said it, man.
He just said, whatever you do, don't knock on this trap door three times and say yog
sa thoth.
Yog sa...
I don't want to say it three times.
I'm afraid, man.
See what I mean, dude?
Yeah, I read that book.
It's like when they put you down in the well.
You can't get out.
It's like when you're in that box.
Stoop not down, dude.



You're not going down into the darkly thing, you know, abyss thing there, right?
Yeah.
It's like when Father McGillicuddy put you in the box and there's a little man in there
that bites your feet, dude.
That fucking little puppet head, man.
It's gross, man.
I hate that.
Something eats your feet in there.
I don't know what it is, man.
But there's something in there that actually eats people's feet.
It's like it's a bummer, dude.
Well, it sure would be a dumb in it, but maybe you should...
Oh, quiet.
Limb, limb, limb, limb.
How do you have any more of that glued?
Limb.
Limb.






Let's go start some fires.
Cool, dude.
Is this Tolo?
Hey, it looks like Bob said, like, kill yourself for Bob.
Yeah.
Hey, hey.
Let's do it, dude.
Oh, sure, man.
Bob said to do it.
It's Dobbs' privilege.
Let's do it, man.
Now, wait.
If Bob says to do it, we're not supposed to, right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
But we're supposed to think that.
He knows that we're going to think that, so it's like...
So we, like, trick him and go ahead and do it.
That's what we're supposed to do.
Well, yeah.









He, like, knows we have no free will of our own, right?
Yeah.
Well, he's...
He knows.
Well, I don't know.
We're supposed to, right?
Or we're not supposed to.
I can't remember.
I was trying to pick up that chick when they were talking about that part.
No, that was predeterminism, man.
So, I realized that there was room for me in some kind of religion or another, but to
religion...
Religion to me had always been pain and suffering.
Religion had always meant...
Yeah.
I could be either going like this, or going like this, or going like this, or going like
this, but I can't do it up here.
And it was pain.
It was pain.
Oh!
Beat me to a pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.
I ain't got religion, I got a damaged brain.
If I had a dollar for every licking that I took, I'd write the pope in Vatican and write
a dirty book.
Beat me to a pulpit, I'm praying for some pain.


for some pain beat me to a pulpit I'm praying for some pain
so could be anything virtual there man are we gonna be able to get virtual oh
man there's no virtue in that stuff well you know there are inherent dangers in
virtual reality especially for those whose only reality is virtual you could
become a Spanish voice Roy just like that you could end up like Dave in that
little tin can tied to a screen spinning through space might as well be you're
actually sitting in your your little coke can filled apartment instead of
instead of going out and running around the lake a few times you're sitting
there tied surfing the internet it's you don't have a life you're just sitting
there just going from one argument to another just screaming and yelling by
typewriter to people you don't even know
you know that there are hundreds of miles there states and continents away so
you can be as insulting as you want it's a gas dude it's like it's like that that
first time I did the napalm with Dobbs
that was really funny

Pray for America to end tonight.
Pray for America to end tonight.
Boys and girls, you have to pray for America to end tonight.
You got to put your hands together and pray for America to end tonight.
Pray.
Get down on your hands and knees and bark like an animal.
Make animal sounds in the night and pray for America to end tonight.
Pray.
Pray for America to end tonight.
Amen.
America just ended, my friends.
Yes, I'm sorry.
The one world government won.
It's not just one world government.
Unfortunately, it wasn't Bob that owned it, but Dr. Bronner, the soap maker.
One world government under Dr. Bronner, a seam soap maker.
The seam soap maker.
But it's great soap.
Something has happened in the motorcade.
Something has definitely happened in the motorcade.
But friends, you know, we'll never be able to destroy America as long as the corruptigating worms are here.
That is the greatest.
The corruptigating.
You have touched the wrong.
You have touched the wrong nerve.
You have touched the wrong nerve in me, Ivan.
Don't ever talk about the corruptigating worms of hell.
Please.
And I don't think there's any man or woman in this country alive who knows the threat they represent.
It needs to be said, though, man.
Somebody's got to talk about it.
I mean, the conspiracy was just a cover for all of that.
You took a confidentiality affidavit.
You signed it.
They paid us.
They paid everybody.
They paid us all to make this buck.
That's all any of us want.
Huh.
Just a bag of prop and some money to walk on?
That's it.
That's all life has to offer you, pal.
You might as well get used to it.
The school of hard knocks.
No, we must stamp them out.
Oh, sure we must stamp them out.
We must stamp them out.
We will stamp them.
But if they pay us to, then that's the whole problem.
They've got the money.
All we've got is the trademark of Bob's head.
And one bullet.
One bullet.
And one and three nuclear weapons.
You know, they've got 50,000 nuclear weapons,
and lonesome cowboy Dave only has three.
And yet he dares to fight the corruptigating worms.
Yes, I do.
Day after day.
Day in and day out.
Unfortunately, the way he chooses, the weapon he chooses is...
Extra medication.
Improvisational so-called music in a terrible radio show.
But it's all we have.
That's all there is.
Everything outside of this room doesn't exist.
Because the corruptigating worms control every aspect of our lives.
They're down in our brains.
They have control of our personalities.
They know where we live.
They know where we come.
And when you walk outside of this room, friends, they're just making you think you're walking
down a hallway, walking down the street, walking to your car.
It's actually the silent radio that's making you believe all that.
You'll hear it.

You'll actually fall into a specially designed box right outside the door and be shipped
off to Malaysia for later use in the off-world colonies on our beautiful sister planet, Jupiter.
And she is beautiful, too.
She is so big and beautiful.
She's lovely.
She was so big and yet she was so hard with her chitinous outer layer.
I knew that she loved me.
We were not of the same species.
But I loved her nonetheless.
We were not even from the same planet.
But Bob brought us together.
In his great wisdom, he knew that we would be perfect together.
My Jupiterian babe with her carapace made of methane, solidified methane, and her beautiful
lips, yes.
You had a Yeti mate.
You had a Yeti mate.
You deserted.
And her pipe.
She had a pipe.
You had to remove it in order to use her.
But, oh, it left a big hole when you yanked it out.
And what a fine hole it was.
A little bit rough, like a metal file on the edges.
But, you know, for some of us, that's the best.
That's just what we want.
We like them that way.
Oh, we're doctors.
Oh, we're doctors.
Oh, we're doctors.


Hey, I got to work in Chicago a couple of weeks ago and got to do some more with the
great comedian Rudy Ray Moore.
Are any of you guys familiar with Rudy Ray Moore?
I don't know his name.
He does a character by the name of Dolomite.
Dolomite.
And he's known as the king of party records.
And bottle beers.
He's a...
The Shakespeare...
The fine book...
Dolomite.

A high weirdness by mail called Dolomite, the Shakespeare of black English.
And he does this...
I can't quote a single Dolomite line because by definition it's, as he calls it, raw.
It is rude and raw humor.
And he's a...
This guy's been one of my heroes for 20 years.
I've got all his albums going back to the cockpit.
This belongs to him.
This belongs to me.
Petey Wheatstraw, the devil's son-in-law.
I've heard of Petey Wheatstraw, the devil's son-in-law.
I've heard of that.
Yeah, he also did...
Rudy Ray Moore was also a movie star.
He was in Avenging Disco Godfather, the movie Dolomite.
He was in The Human Tornado.
And I mean, this guy is like a major blaxploitation film star, as well as the father, the godfather
of rap.
In that what Mr. Ray Moore is best known for is bellows and brags that are based on rap.


He's also on prison toasts and so forth.
It's a manly, hairy, steaming type of humor.
If only I could go into these quotes, but every single one would get this station fined.
Anyway, I got to work with this hero of mine.
You got to work with him?
I got to work with one of my...
His autograph, he was playing the good guy, this fireman in a video game.
We were acting in the filmed part of a CD record.
It was a video game called Dueling Fireman, produced by Run and Gun Incorporated of Chicago.
I play a rogue mason who's a thousand years old.
And Rudy Ray Moore is the hero who runs through burning Chicago.
Chicago is burning down in this game because the president, Oprah Winfrey, crashed into
the Sears Tower in Air Force One at the same time as the space shuttle did.
So a nuclear explosion destroys most of Chicago.
And the only thing that's left is Rudy Ray Moore and the crazed character actor, Irishman,
to fight the flames with their magic smoke jumpers.
It's like a video game that's been filmed, and you go from one little film story to film
story, and then there's games in between where you take on these characters.
And instead of killing other characters, you have to dance bizarrely.
That's how you get points.
This is a game in this new art style.


It's a style of spaz.
You might call it spaz fashion photography.
It's spaz fashion acting.
Everyone in it's cast like a Fellini movie.
Everyone is cast not for how good of an actor they are, but by how rubbery their face is
and what kind of a type they are.
So it's populated by freaks and subgeniuses.
It has cameos by such professional weirdos as Mark Mothersbaugh, Timothy Leary, who else?
Ferguson from the David Lynch TV show about weird TV shows.
And, oh well, Rudy Ray Moore.
Who else?
A bunch of rock and roll guys that I am not familiar with because I'm an old man.
Are there spaz actors?
It's spaz.
It's in the spaz form.
I spent most of my time in vampire makeup in front of a blue screen saying things like,
Step aside, ye fixed-legged earth fools.
Trapped, milling about in your own world.


In your cage of only three dimensions.
Your beauty god is no match for my dark purpose.
You know, see what I mean?
It's like in living-
It's exaggerated character acting.
Yeah, and it's a video game.
And it was cool.
I was getting paid and the most wonderful atmosphere on the set.
It's like the grips are standing around talking about Fellini and Bergman films.
Kurosawa did this one scene that was lit like this one where he had the fake snow.
And meanwhile the director and me are communicating on this level.
Did you ever see Evil Dead 2 when the moose head comes alive and the guy goes,
That's what-
It's kind of like that.
Do kind of like that.
A junction of different-
I had just gone to see the movie Ed Wood before doing this job and it was great.
And in fact, in this-
Have you seen Ed Wood?
No, I've wanted to.
I've been very broke.
I got to imitate Martin Landau.
In this video game, you get to see me imitating Martin Landau imitating Bela Lugosi saying,
Pull the strings!
Pull the strings!
Which for you bad movie enthusiasts out there on alt.fan.bad.movies, of course is that classic non sequitur,
sequence.
And then you get to see the one scene in the Ed Wood classic, Glenn or Glenda, the groundbreaking
film about transvestitism, which you will sketch your eye load full of, I bet at the
Akron revival at Cavanaugh's on Saturday night, which is like the crazed party after the Cleveland
light show smoke machine.
Yeah, we'll have all kinds.
Did you know that we're going to have like laser shows and all good psychedelic dude
and all that?
I know they're going to have-
Yeah, the base mind machines.
Smoke machine?
and laser machines and...
Mind machines?
Mind machines.
All the trendy techno goods.
What's a mind machine?
Have you ever taken a mind machine trip, Dave?
No, I have never taken no mind machine trip.
I'd like to know what one is.
Well, mind machines are electronic meditation assistance devices.
Then you made these yourself?
Well, I know we didn't make them ourselves.
We buy them.
You said mine are.
You said mine are actually levitation teleportation devices
having to do with a pre-funkter...
You said something, it was yours.
I forgot about that part.
Well, anyway, these mind machines are capable of transposing you into another key.
Exactly, yes.
Perhaps one of Solomon's keys of marijuana from Brazil.
Yes.
Some different state than you're in before you put the headphones on your ears.
Now, this is not virtual.
This is not a virtual ride.
It could be bad or good.
You could just put them on and you'd feel terrible maybe even, right?
Is that possible?
Oh, I don't think you would feel terrible unless you...
The muscle grows as the brain shrinks.
If you have a tendency to be an epileptic, it's not suggested
because it's flashing lights and it could spur on an electric trigger.
You could be defoiled.
You could actually throw a spaz action on the middle of the floor.
Why, yes, exactly.
So any epileptics are not advised to try a mind machine,
but if you're not an epileptic...
I don't know.
Really.
You're totally fine.
...it's not the fun thing to do.
Man, you love epilepsy, dude.
It's like this wild...
It's like I don't hear the music but go baby!
Your feet flap, don't they?
You put a pair of goggles on.
A pair of sunglasses that have little teeny tiny lights
mounted in the inside of them.
You keep your eyes closed so the lights flash
and you just get the impression of the lights on your closed eyelids, Dave.
And the sounds, in your ears are like
,
And the lights are blinking, and it's the blinking lights and the whoosh, whoosh, whoosh in your ears
that just brings you to a different state.
It brings you to far-brain, hind-brain, sync-lock.
And what people report seeing are things like fireworks and mandala amazing moving.
Yes, it's true.
You see mandalas?
Oh, yes.
You see eyes of Nelson Mandela?
Mandela will appear to you as a ghost.
I mean, they're virtual, but it's not virtual with your eyes open.
It's virtual with your eyes closed.
Yeah, if you open your eyes, man, it burns out your retina, but that's a trick.
No, no, you can't open your eyes.
Reverend Stank, don't kill them to open their eyes.
You won't want to.
They're too bright.
You'd never want to open your eyes.
So does that really burn your retinas if you open your eyes too brightly?
I really don't know.
No one's ever been able to hold their eyes.
My eyes open against the scorching heat.
We only...
A transfigural occlusion occurs in the back of your brain, doesn't it?
If you open your eyeballs too wide, it goes right in and gives you like a body slam.
It reprograms you to be brutal, strong, heavy, violent.
It could burn the visual purple.
That's the way I like my girlfriend.
Well, actually, it programs some people to be loving, friendly, intelligent, and tasteful.
Well, who the hell wants to be like that?
Well, I've... we...
Those are the people that want their money back.
Like, well, let them have it.
All of a sudden they've decided this is a gaudy, lurid, cheap trick.
And they're the ones it doesn't work on.
Boy, I want one of those machines.
No, they just use a mind machine.
I'd like to hook my kids up. Yeah, I want a mind machine myself.
Oh, you did hook your kids up to them. You put them in a little box with Father McLahomer.
Well, it was homemade. I lined a bunch of flash cubes up on the stick and put them in the car.

Oh, that will cause retinal damage.
If you line up some flash cubes on a stick, your children will sue for divorce in a court of law.
You'll be sent up the river.
I wouldn't do it.
I mean, I did try it on... I had a few pet monkeys, and I used to make really, really high, like, 12-foot high stacks of flash.
Oh, yes, it's those... look over there across the river. It's those monkeys over in the trees there.
You can hear them. You hear... listen. Do you hear them?
Yeah.
You hear their...
You hear their cries in the background. Those are...
What are they crying about?
Some of them are birds.
Something must have happened.
The fast ones are birds. Oh, look, going by, there's that...
A monkey's leaping.
...a heliopter slipping into the water. Do you see it?
Oh, wow, that's cool.
A little heliopter over there. That's a... he's an old... that's an old grandfather of the river, I think.
Oh, yeah.
You can see the tick birds on his back.
No, no, they can't hunt for him. No, no, they can't hunt him.
No.
Because, well, he's been in there forever. Oh, no, and then...
If you... if you listen, we may be able to hear the... the cry of the...
Of the long swallows?
...the last yeti out in the... out in the forest here as we...
I'm gonna gag there.
Do you hear the drums? Those are the natives outside of Dob's fortress.
I thought that was one of the feisty monkeys pounding their breast and abdomen.
No, no, there's... well, they... oh, they've gone silent.
They've gone silent.
And what if the past go and collect $300?
Oh, no.
No.
The line broke. Man, this virtual reality stuff is too expensive.
I know, every time you get a good knob...
We were about to get to the part where the... where the natives are fighting the subgeniuses.
Yeah.
The spears come out and the drums start to pounding...
God, we gotta reboot it now.
...and the subgeniuses are...
Baba, baba, daba, daba, baba.
We gotta re... hey, hey, man, do you like to have a quarter?
No, uh...
We're gonna... I...
I don't. I don't even have a...
We can use my parent's credit card, man. I wanna get back in the game. I've gotta get back in the game.
I get an idea. Let's use my parent's credit card.
Let's ask the Dob's Oracle... I'll tell you what, if you got... we'll put in one quarter...
We jump.
...and we'll ask Bob. We'll go to...
Yes, no.
...go to the Dob's Oracle page and ask... we'll type in the question, you know, and ask...
Here, Bob. Bob. Dear Bob, should we use Dad's credit card?
Or... or we... a can of dog food. We can... or the can of dog food, too.
Look, man, he's about to talk. He says, on the night of slack, the exes will...
Run suplee...
Run... and then it said run...
Run em... run em...
Run em... run em...
...and mow em.
Run em and mow em? What does that mean?
I think it means that... what it... it's like...
Holler.
...that the...
Dob's is trying to tell us, man, that, like, in the grand scheme of things, like, our parents'
credit card doesn't matter. It's like the exes that matter.
Yeah.
So we might as well, like, you know, these minor earthly things, like, we can't get hung
up in them. I think that's what Bob's trying to tell us on this game, man. It's like the
Oracle.
What's a sec?
But I don't think Bob has anything to say. It's not like an Oracle or nothing.
Hey...
I think it's just a random thought that emerged.
Hey, somebody's online. Somebody... somebody just came online.
Look, it's a chat line.
You wanna flame on em?
Yeah, let's flame on em. You got that lighter?
Yeah, I...
Here's the beans.
Let's pyroflagellate em.
What are we gonna do with a bottle of beans?
Let's flame em.
They'll... they'll... they'll really know we're clever if we insult them a whole bunch.
I've got a new board or what? Could you have a collar?
She said... she said something with a head... she had a headboarder.
Dave, it's your girlfriend, man. Be polite.
Oh, she died last month.
Well, which one is this?
This must be Peggy, the ointment woman. Peggy.
Did you... did you bring...
Peggy Stew.
Did you bring the ointment?
Peggy Stew.
Look, I'm gonna come down to the CSE and I'm gonna kick all you guys' butts if you
don't answer the call.
Oh, let's just put our butts all in the big line so you don't have too far to move.
One buttock, two buttocks, three buttocks, all shaking in unison as you kick, kick, kick,
kick, kick like in a Broadway musical.
Yeah, we'll... we'll keep the lines free.
You can call now.
You can get through now.
It's like if you hang up and then call us, you'll be able to get through.
It'll come right in.
Just... just remember, don't rush, head... headlong or oblong.
Don't just put... put it down.
Put it down and try it again.
Yeah, don't rush into this thing.
I mean, before you sign up, you may want to think twice.
It's not for everybody.
Read them small prints and just study it first before you decide to do anything because
for God's sakes, you don't want to step into that abyss and never come out.
No, we don't want your family to sue us, you know, just because you couldn't handle
it.
And family suffrage meant, believe me, it goes long... long, long, long after.
Oh, it's like millions of bucks now that family just could... you deprogram one kid
and the family can get five million, ten million bucks.
In all their living.

And all their children and all their descendants are suddenly evacuated as just some, you know,
some blissful turd.
Something just popped right out of them.
Excuse me, I'm sorry, I... but...
Obviously, the corner...
The dog bit it.
...is backed.
Put that dog out, hon.
Put that dog outside and give it some hush puppies and some gravy and step on it.
Did you ever have a dog?
I had four dogs and five husqvarna's.
They were the like, the little totem poles that you used to drive around.
And some of them had sleds underneath for the heavy winter time.
I have this one dog.
It's like one of those wiener dogs.
You have a wiener dog?
Well, it's a cross between a Chinese Shih Tzu and a dachshund.
A Shih Tzu?
It is the ugliest little long sausage-like dog you ever saw.
And what...
It looks like Broderick Crawford on a bun.
I know that's in the...
When it goes outside to do its little doggy business, as doggies are wont to do, it hunches
over and it...
Look at that.
It looks like a toothpaste tube being squeezed by the invisible man.
And you must have an awful lot of fondness for a dog that was such an absurd way of relieving...
You can trade videotapes of this kind of stuff on the internet.
It's like there's a board for everything on there.
You can go to...
I saw, and this is true, I've got it printed out down in my briefcase.
There is an internet message that says, bad tooth fetish.
Single male interested in trading...
Photos, videos involving models with very bad or no teeth.
He is becoming...
Well, I think...
Becoming...
The friends of the aliens lose their teeth.
The friends of the aliens lose their teeth?
Not those bad aliens.
Not the...
Friends of Bob's...
If you're a friend...
Gain their teeth.
New teeth.
Ah.
New and better teeth.
Healthy teeth on the...
So is that why teeth are...
Escape vessels of the sex goddesses.
Yes.
You will learn to...






You will get a brand new set as you enter?
Or as you...
You will shunt your earthly shell.
You will leave behind...
It's like taking your shoes off.
It'll appear...
Your earthly body will appear to be like a burning monk screaming in terrible agony.
But in fact, your soul, your identity will be transmutated up to the escape vessels of
the sex goddesses where you will fill the body of your healthful, youthful soul.
You will find yourself at around age 25, but with all your memories intact.
It's perfect.
So you're...
And you can do anything you want when you're on...
Anything?
Anything.
Anything.
On the escape vessels of the sex goddesses as a dues paying subgenius member.
And you can get more information about this.
You can be saved.
You can achieve, yes, eternal salvation or triple your money back at the subgenius...
Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.
For free information on Bob's...


Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius send a self-addressed stamped envelope to...
Got your pencil ready?
Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.
Stay tuned and praise Bob.
Praise Bob.
Yes.
Finally, dear friends, we have come to the very bitter end.
We are at the end of the show.
And only now might I deign to lower myself to telling you what else you've been listening
to.
A time for credits and addresses because we don't want to hog all this talent just
to ourselves.
Nay.
You know, not everything that ends up under the banner of Dobbs started out that way.
Some of it even exists outside of Dobbs' influence.
As hard as that may be.
So have your pencils ready, friends, so you can send off for info from these fine other
mutants.
And rewinding back to the beginning of the show, the nice Zappa-esque piece of music
called Everything You Know Is Wrong, back there at the beginning, that was by Dr. Bizarro
and the Disgustos, who can be reached by email.


That's iBob Digital.
Got that pencil ready?
P.O.
Box 3405.
3405 in Skokie, Illinois.
60076.
That zip is 60076 in Skokie, Illinois.
And their phone number, for those of you with tape decks, is 708-982-9697.
That's it.


Now, that song was followed by a typically delicious, yet roughly recorded rant on Master
Control by the great Nenslow.
And you can get Nenslow's very soul by writing to Nenslow.
One dollar.
P.O.
Box 86582.
That's Nenslow at Box 86582, Portland, Oregon.
972-9.
972-8.6.
The Nensletic zip is 972-8.6.
And if you've been reading Revelation X, then you know that you owe Nenslow that one buck.
And then you heard, or thought that you heard, that slightly devoistic, very modernatical
sounding industrial alien rock song, Robotopia, which is by Punch Drunk, whose CD is very
good.
And they're at P.O.
Box 53582.
Punch Drunk at Box 53582, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
And the zip is 19105.
19105 in Philly.
Pah!
For Punch Drunk.
And then, pretty much for the entire rest of the show, we played recordings from both
ESO Radio, live on WCSB Cleveland, and ESO Live on Stage at the last Cleveland subgenius
D-Vival.
And you can get information on other tapes by ESO by sending an SASE, what in the, this
is getting ridiculous, self-addressed stamped envelope to ESO P.O.
Box 14776.
That's ESO at Box 14776, Cleveland, Cleveland, Cleveland.

Ohio.
Ohio.
44114.
That's Box 14776, Cleveland, Ohio, 44114.
Because ESO stands for Einstein's Secret Orchestra, and they have other tapes.
And they are that amazing improvisational trepanation group consisting of Lonesome Cowboy
Dave and the newly appointed cantor of the church, Chaz.
Chaz Smith and his violinist mate, Michelle, and Todd, the breast-kneed baboon player.
And in this particular case, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang was a guest, along with
the beautatious Princess We Are Doe, queen of all the UFOs.
And listeners of WCSB in Cleveland get to hear ESO every Thursday night at 10.
But only subgeniuses got to see that live on-stage performance.
More of those tapes next week.
And that was thanks to the sponsors of The Devival and the WCSB Subgenius Show.
The sponsors being the Flying Lemur Bookstore of Lakewood.
Yes, the Flying Lemur, the coolest hangout in Cleveland, be there or be square.
And special thanks to the hard-working slackmeister, Steve Bevilacqua, for making that possible.
And to Pastor Craig in Philadelphia, who also helped pay for the plane ticket and more recordings
of the live preachings from those devivals next week.
We must go, time control is faltering.
price stops
I don't know.
That music I was playing there at the very end was, of course, by Osric Tentacles.
Hard to find CDs by a groovy group.
Thank you, our dear listeners.
Let's just let it die now with this groovy, mensletic theme.
