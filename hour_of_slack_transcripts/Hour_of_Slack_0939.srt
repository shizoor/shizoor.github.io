Oh yeah

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,120
It's time for slack.

4
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,720
Or learning.

5
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,380
Sensitive artistic endeavors.

6
00:01:08,020 --> 00:01:08,660
Artistic?

7
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:09,440
As is.

8
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,020
What sweet music!

9
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,300
You need replenishment, my son.

10
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,600
What sweet music we'll be playing tonight.

11
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,260
Oh, a Mendelssohn.

12
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:24,100
Hello, Stranza!

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,720
I love to sing, and I love to move, and I love to sing, and I love to sing.

14
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,500
I love to sing.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,860
A blue RT-42.

16
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:33,140
A singer!

17
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,700
A crooner!

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,140
A rapper!

19
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:37,420
Stop!

20
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:40,460
Stop the rappers and crooners!

21
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:42,580
Taking over the music business!

22
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:43,620
Listen, mama.

23
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,740
If you must sing,

24
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,420
we will teach you to sing like we want him to.

25
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,860
This little bunny rabbit has no brain.

26
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,280
There's absolutely nothing inside this cranium.

27
00:01:58,420 --> 00:01:59,480
It's empty.

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,320
It's as hollow as your heart.

29
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:04,000
And check here.

30
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,620
The special alimide bits that conduct messages from deep space.

31
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,420
What a face.

32
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,600
What a pair of blistering blue ears.

33
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,660
This is the child of the future.

34
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:20,000
And you're invited to spank freely.

I'm so glad you're here.

77
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,600
A fat young man, perhaps too fat to carry out his dreams,

78
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,660
to plan, to propel, to include himself in his own okay wishes.

79
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,440
Is that like P-H-A-T or F-A-T?

80
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:58,740
Oh, yeah.

83
00:02:59,460 --> 00:02:59,560
Is it?

84
00:02:59,560 --> 00:02:59,980
Is it?

85
00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980

00:02:59,980 --> 00:02:59,980

Speaking of which let's get back now to the gossip

146
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:02,040
Speaking of which let's get back now to the gossip

147
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,900
About Mrs. Alzheimer

148
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,960
Mrs. Alzheimer gave

149
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:10,080
Freud spelled in Yakub the mad cow disease

150
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,060
Freud spelled in Yakub the mad cow disease

151
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,120
And that's why

152
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,000
I have to find some kind of medicine

153
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,500
That'll defeat the P test

154
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:19,060
For Alzheimer's

155
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:20,920
The P test for Alzheimer's

156
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,840
Do you know if anything that I could take

157
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,720
It's not that I have Alzheimer's or anything

158
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,520
But I'm gonna take this test

159
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,080
You know it's a P test for this job

160
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,940
And they want to give me the Alzheimer's P test

161
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,240
And I was wondering if there was any

162
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,420
You know if they

163
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:35,740
I know for if you like pot heads can

164
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,280
If they eat enough Jimson weed

165
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,800
That'll negate the pot or something like that

166
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,540
If you eat Jimson weed bad things will happen

167
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:43,620
Yeah I know

168
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:46,500
I was just saying that just to influence young people

169
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:46,920
And to

170
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:50,140
Damaging their nervous system

171
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,300
Dr. Sinister advises you to go out

172
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,180
And eat poisonous plants

173
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,880
Yeah I know a guy who

174
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,520
These hick guys in Virginia

175
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,060
Didn't have anything better to do than

176
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:02,200
Try the Jimson weed

177
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,500
And the guy

178
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,600
Sort of came to

179
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,160
Taking a dump on his

180
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,680
Living room floor in front of his parents

181
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,160
He spent six

182
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,320
He spent the next three weeks

183
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,900
In a hospital bed

184
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,180
For the insane

185
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,920
Yeah the thing with the hallucinations caused by

186
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,640
The plants in that family is that

187
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,380
You can't really tell they're hallucinations

188
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,900
From what I understand like it's

189
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,020
It's not like a psychedelic thing

190
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,160
It's just

191
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,300
Your mind is going off

192
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,000
So where did you say you get some of this stuff

193
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,740
I think it grows in some people's yards

194
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,740
Yeah actually it does

195
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,260
It grows and it has

196
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,060
A lovely flower

197
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,600
Yeah in fact I've seen

198
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,140
Like in Tower City I

199
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,580
Think their decorations one year

200
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,860
Had some weird kite

201
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,460
It was built like a kite

202
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,900
But it was in the shape of one of those flowers

203
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,500
These people are wasting their money on crap

204
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,400
There's organic versions

205
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,500
In PCP, Angel Dust

206
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,100
And all that there's organic things

207
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:04,100
Certified USDA organic

208
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,020
Coca plants and

209
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:06,860
Deterra plants

210
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:09,280
Yeah Deterra that'll make you want to fight

211
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,220
They used to make this in head shops

212
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,720
Back in the day

213
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,720
Before you know

214
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,540
When we thought the ring was destroyed

215
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,960
There was this

216
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,360
Stuff in the head shops called

217
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,900
Bobbo's Better Blend

218
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,240
Which I later

219
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,380
Came to realize the ingredients included

220
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:29,200
Deterra

221
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,700
Which would just make you want to get in a fight

222
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,680
It didn't make you particularly high

223
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,660
It just made you want to pick fights with people

224
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,500
Sort of like some other

225
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,820
Herbal drugs I know of

226
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:41,420
Like alcohol

227
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,480
It just just oh god

228
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,420
And I almost did get in a fight

229
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,400
With a 7-11

230
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,300
Employee that I'd always disliked

231
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,200
I walked in and just

232
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,100
He didn't get the cartons of coke

233
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,680
Fast enough or something I

234
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,560
Just started screaming

235
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,360
At this guy

236
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,040
And then he just about kicked my ass

237
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,380
So the moral of the story

238
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,340
Is kids don't

239
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:08,600
Buy your legal highs at head shops

240
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:10,320
Unless you know what

241
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,620
Those ingredients are

242
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:12,940
That's right folks

243
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:16,120
There's a good chance that you could end up

244
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,700
Having to use those

245
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,400
Diapers a lot sooner than you thought you would

246
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,180
That is right

247
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,960
Always always know what you're taking

248
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,480
Especially when it's

249
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,500
Something like the Daytura

250
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,460
Right here's the rule to live by

251
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,240
Anything that makes it harder to pee

252
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,920
Is anti-slack

253
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:36,760
Oh oh oh yeah that's a real shame

254
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:37,580
Because one of my favorite

255
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,360
Or anything that makes you pee uncontrollably

256
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
One of my favorite things

257
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:43,680
Has caused some difficulty urinating

258
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:45,240
And like I can't take it

259
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,220
What guys?

260
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,680
Something they just recently pulled from the market

261
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,120
Oh a veteran?

262
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,360
Oh god that stuff's deadly

263
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,440
That's in most cold medicine

264
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,560
Not anymore

265
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:59,840
Now it's pseudoephedrine

266
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,300
Yeah

267
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,660
Which is not really as speedy

268
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:05,220
But you can still use it to make crystal meth

269
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,720
Which is why the government gets curious

270
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,060
If you buy a lot of pseudofed

271
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,540
That's horrible

272
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,000
Conspiracy street drugs man

273
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,760
Whatever happened to

274
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,640
The old fashioned ways of getting high

275
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,280
Like cramming a bucket of nails up your exit wound

276
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,260
You know the manly ways

277
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,380
Getting them endorphins going

278
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,400
Chewing on some old

279
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,060
Razor blades

280
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,280
That was the way that we'd get high

281
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,720
In the Dobstown brigade

282
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:33,600
When we were in training

283
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,920
Play mumbly peg

284
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,480
Yeah with the bones of your enemies

285
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,300
Yeah

286
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:42,100
Them was the days

287
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,200
Them was the days

288
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:45,680
Back then

289
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,180
When

290
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,660
Bob used to whip us into shape

291
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,380
Everything's all gone to hell now

292
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,420
Since Commandant Dobst

293
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,340
Left the camp

294
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:57,760
Don't know

295
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,680
What he's been out

296
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:00,760
Don't blame him for leaving

297
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,180
We're gonna take another call right now

298
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:19,960
That's Dave

299
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,160
You're on the air

300
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,840
Yeah that was me I'm sorry

301
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:23,940
Hello

302
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:25,160
Yeah you're still here

303
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:25,980
Oh I kept on

304
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,500
I kept on

305
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:26,500


306
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:26,500


307
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:26,500


308
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:26,500


309
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,260
I was just gonna ask a question about

310
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,620
Concerns about

311
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:31,160
Down humans

312
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,140
Downer humans?

313
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:36,840
Downer humans which may also have downy fresh syndromes

314
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:38,640
They may be harboring

315
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,000
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease

316
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,920
And not even know it

317
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:44,180
Well yeah each and every one of us is probably carrying this virus

318
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,160
Around either in their wallet

319
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,140
Or probably in small parts of their pockets

320
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,480
It's half a virus and we're gonna take another call here

321
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,640
Oh they hung up

322
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,600
Before I could get to them oh well

323
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,700
Have you ever noticed how the logo for the

324
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,580
Special Olympics looks an awful lot like

325
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,520
The people who participate they're flapping

326
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,660
Like crazy oh I've got a terrible terrible

327
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,980
Joke that's probably gonna get me in some trouble for saying this

328
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,520
It's actually a Burger King ad they're gonna use those people

329
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:06,920
As meat I'm sorry

330
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,340
You know what's even better than winning a gold medal in the

331
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:09,960
Special Olympics

332
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,780
What? Not being retarded

333
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:15,480
I don't get it of course

334
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,320
That is a no no no no

335
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,520
We're not trying to make fun of those

336
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,580
People I'm just trying to point out

337
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,260
That I would rather

338
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,380
Not be eligible to participate

339
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,000
Than be a winner well you know though

340
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,880
There's another way of looking at that

341
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,620
A lot of those people are really happy

342
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,600
Yes they are

343
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,580
They have that I don't know

344
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,940
Something you do know look

345
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,700
They do know it too and what about bowling for dollars

346
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,280
What's better than

347
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:43,020
Not winning bowling for dollars

348
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,200
Bowling for dollars

349
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,080
Not having a huge

350
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,920
Macrocephalic head that gets mistaken for the bowling ball

351
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,600
Oh wow

352
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,820
Cause that happens to a lot of these kids

353
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,180
The world is

354
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,220
It's a hard place

355
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,200
It's a hard round place

356
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,380
With three holes in it

357
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,600
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

358
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:05,560
That's right

359
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,200
Attention car buyers

360
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,820
Now let me ask you a question

361
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:11,720
Do you have liquid respiratory medications

362
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,180
Like albuterol

363
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,980
They make things easy

364
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:16,520
That's right

365
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:21,040
For more information call 1-V-F-I-T-A-D-D-S-9-6-1

366
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:21,880
That's right

367
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,500
Man by day

368
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,020
Beast and devourer of the unwary by night

369
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,400
Who is this creature

370
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:34,640
Whose origins lie in medieval Europe

371
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:37,280
As a potent symbol of fear

372
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:40,280
And the violence that lurks at the center

373
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,860
Under the veneer of civilization

374
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,700
The slavering

375
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,980
Quavering

376
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:53,040
Gelatinous werewolf

377
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,580
The one who

378
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:53,580


379
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:53,580


380
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:53,580


381
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:53,580


382
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,100
Has its huge corpulent bulk

383
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,580
Slid across the plain

384
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:01,320
Leaving its slimy trail behind it

385
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,660
The werewolf

386
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,540
Or the werewolf worm

387
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,480
As it were

388
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,540
Slithering and glithering

389
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,760
Like some

390
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,060
Ancient

391
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,160
Hideous beast

392
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:17,280
Too symbolic to even mention

393
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,640
And the emphasis is on mention

394
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:20,920
I might add

395
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:20,920


396
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,360
The strange things that ever met your eyes

397
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,340
While the tradition that we seek

398
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,660
In uniting the water with the air

399
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:28,580
Yes

400
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:32,040
It represents the coming together of matter and spirit

401
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,320
Right now over me

402
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,240
This positive force that we know

403
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,340
We know we can perceive

404
00:14:38,340 --> 00:14:40,520
With our obvious logic and reason

405
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,980
But of course

406
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:43,240
Ha ha ha ha

407
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,640
Those fools

408
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:47,240
They will never understand as we do

409
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:48,580
It's like an endless knot

410
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,940
One you can't untie for

411
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,580
Well you could untie it if you just had a little bit of strength

412
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:54,400
You could just pick and work

413
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,960
Gonna tie one on eh

414
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:58,240
I'd like some coconut milk

415
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,540
But uh

416
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,840
I'm gonna tie one on

417
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,540
Right over here

418
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,440
You tie one on over there

419
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,520
And I'll just tie one on over here

420
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,940
And tie one on over here

421
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,660
It's on

422
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,740
I'm aware of that now

423
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,820
Please

424
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,200
You know plants may be calculating creatures

425
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,820
To most people

426
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,980
The word computer

427
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,420
Conjures up an image of a PC

428
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,800
Squatted on the desktop

429
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,920
According to a new study however

430
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,040
Complex computations

431
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,360
May also be underway

432
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,740
In another bit of office equipment

433
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,600
The potted plant

434
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:38,380
Right over there

435
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,340
That's right the potted plant

436
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:42,360
That brightens up the window sill

437
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,280
Is calculating and considering

438
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,600
And performing vast and complex

439
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,760
Networks of computations

440
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,460
Unlike traditional computation

441
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,580
In which a central computer

442
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,880
Or central processing unit

443
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,520
Or CPU

444
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,580
Carries out programs

445
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,980
Distributed emergent computation

446
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,040
Lacks a central controller

447
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,560
Instead large numbers of simple units

448
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,680
Get that CPU out of my nose

449
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,500
Interact with each other to achieve complex

450
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,900
Large scale computations

451
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,600
Now these plants don't add

452
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,960
Subtract, multiply or divide

453
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:17,260
But they do seem somehow to compute

454
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:18,740
Solutions to problems

455
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,620
Of how to coordinate the actions

456
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:23,300
Of their cells most effectively

457
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,300
Many biological systems

458
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,840
Appear to carry out this type of

459
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:27,800
Distributed computation

460
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:30,000
For instance

461
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,100
Ant colonies

462
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,560
They are one example

463
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,340
Of nervous systems and immune systems

464
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,060
One favorite example among biologists

465
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,820
Is slime molds

466
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,020
Which exist for most of their lives

467
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:45,080
As single celled

468
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,500
Rubbery gelatinous blob like

469
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,180
Amoeba type creatures

470
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,740
When their food supply runs dry

471
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,240
They somehow figure out

472
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,400
Through local signals between cells

473
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,500
How to swarm together into

474
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,360
A pulsating slug like

475
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,220
Multi-cellular organism

476
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,820
That produces the spores

477
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:04,940
That give rise

478
00:17:04,940 --> 00:17:07,140
To the next generation

479
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:10,040
Ah, rising the generations

480
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,540
Raising and rising

481
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:13,480
And they're above the dairy lane

482
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,340
Those dying generations

483
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,760
That pass on

484
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,720
Fish, flesh or fowl

485
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,300
Every child seeks

486
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:23,580
From the time he first dies

487
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:26,580
This is no country for old men

488
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,920
The quest for more ice cream

489
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:29,300
The young in one another's arms

490
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,260
Oh,

491
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,580
Buzzing evidence

492
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:35,240
And K-Rob were mixing

493
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,620
While Dr. Howell and Dr.

494
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,920
Philodrummon spouted

495
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:40,840
In the trance

496
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,100
And you can tell, can't you?

497
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,400
And I guess sometimes they read from

498
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,320
Old subgenius

499
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:48,760
Sacred pamphlets

500
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:51,120
Depending. Anyway, that's all from

501
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,180
KPFA station in Berkeley

502
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,040
Every Friday morning they've done that

503
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:58,260
For 25 years

504
00:17:58,260 --> 00:18:00,460
See subgenius.com

505
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:01,820

506
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,340

Downloading that show for free

509
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,500
There are some terrible

510
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,260
Terrible jokes coming up

511
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,020
And one great big but

512
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,420
But, but, but

513
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,880
But, but, but

514
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,520
That reminds me of this guy

515
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,600
I once knew, he was just a head

516
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:23,060
And this is kind of a parable I have to tell you here

517
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:26,080
He was born by some freak of nature

518
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:26,740
He was just a head

519
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,440
And he moved into this apartment one day

520
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,540
He was finally able to gather up his courage

521
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,780
And live on his own without assistance

522
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:35,500
And there was this really hot girl down the hall from him

523
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:37,700
And one day he finally got up the courage

524
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,900
To go down there and talk to her

525
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:40,360
And so he rolled on down the hall

526
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,020
And then rolled up against the door a couple times

527
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,280
Hoping she'd hear him knock there

528
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:46,320
And opens up the door and looks down

529
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,540
And sees him there

530
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,320
And says, oh, hello

531
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,760
And he says, yes, I'm uh

532
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,380
I'm gonna change his name

533
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:56,420
For the sake of protecting him

534
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,540
We're gonna say his name was

535
00:18:59,480 --> 00:18:59,800
Jack

536
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,220
I'm Jack from down the hall

537
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:02,260
And um

538
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,720
I was just wondering if you'd like to go out sometime

539
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,380
And she said, oh well, um

540
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,160
Maybe, you seem like an interesting guy, but what would we do?

541
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:11,920
And he said, well, uh

542
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,640
We could go to a movie

543
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,860
And she says, oh well, how would you see over the front

544
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,160
The seats in front of you

545
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,020
And he said, oh well, um

546
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:20,960
We could go dancing

547
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,900
And she said, well, I don't know

548
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:25,860
How would you dance?

549
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,660
You don't have a body

550
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:28,540
And he said, well, how about we go bowling

551
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,240
And she said, uh, you know, I'm afraid you don't

552
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,080
You might get accidentally used as a ball

553
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,700
How would you bowl?

554
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,760
So he's very depressed by all this

555
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:37,660
And he rolls back down the hall

556
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,840
And he bounces back up into his bed

557
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,700
And he says his prayers before going to bed

558
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,300
He says, dear ancient elder gods of destruction

559
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,540
Please grant me

560
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:48,860
One favor

561
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,200
I have never been born as a head

562
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,880
Please make me something other than a head

563
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,100
Anything else, I cannot bear to be a head

564
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:56,720
Another day

565
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,100
So he, um, next morning he wakes up

566
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,820
And he's not a head anymore, he's a grape

567
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,100
So he

568
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:06,380
He gets up and looks in the mirror

569
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:08,680
With his, um, metaphysical eyes

570
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,220
Because physical grapes don't have them

571
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,860
And he sees himself there

572
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,820
And he says, wow, I'm a grape

573
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,220
And, uh, very very proud of his change

574
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,760
And very happy

575
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:19,200
And he rolls on down the hall and tries to get up to that girl again

576
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,280
And she's really big enough to knock on the door

577
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,360
So he just waits until she, uh, comes out

578
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,060
On her own business

579
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:27,540
And she opens the door and looks down and sees a little grape there

580
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,940
And, uh, picks him up and eats him

581
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:31,580
And the moral of the story

582
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,340
You've been reading way too much Kafka

583
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:35,760
The moral of the story is quit while you're ahead

584
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:37,520
Ugh

585
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,140
Boy

586
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,040
There are more convolutions in that

587
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,960
Than the top of that bird's head

588
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,880
That's what you call a shaggy yeti story

589
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,300
Yes

590
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,840
Yeah, it made me weep a little bit towards the end there

591
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,740
You started to, my legs were atrophying

592
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:57,280
I was crying for the, uh, 300 megabytes that went down

593
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,440
And he metastatically saw himself in the mirror

594
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,260
He didn't see himself as a grape

595
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,520
He saw himself as grape

596
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,160
You know what I'm saying, Jellybane?

597
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,580
He was a truly grape man

598
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,640
Uh, well we've, you know, we've had a lot of, uh, uh

599
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,080
Experience with oracular disembodied or, uh

600
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,660
Discarnate heads, heads without bodies

601
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,900
Heads high

602
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,160
Huge eyes following you around

603
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:23,620
Heads of celebrity figures launched

604
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:26,020
As this kind of a ritual sporting

605
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,840
Slash religious event

606
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:30,060
Errant feet walking next to you and stuff

607
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,160
With no people connected

608
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,520
But, uh

609
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,160
It gets harder every day to, to identify

610
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,820
These body parts and their meaning

611
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,800
Within the context of, you know, like

612
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:41,600
If you're taking this on a subconscious level

613
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,220
You wanna make things work for yourself, you know what I'm saying?

614
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,760
And then, you know, it means

615
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,140
Maybe you're not going anywhere or you're invisible or something

616
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:49,500
I don't know

617
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,940
But, but the quandary of being just a head

618
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,160
You know

619
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,080
In a way you're ahead of your time

620
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,520
I don't mean that as a joke

621
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,060
Because in the future people will basically be

622
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,060
Just

623
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:04,420
A, a head floating in the air

624
00:22:04,420 --> 00:22:06,620
Well it's better than being just an ass, isn't it?

625
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,360
Oh yes

626
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,060
If Bob wins then the human race will evolve into heads floating in the air

627
00:22:11,060 --> 00:22:13,060
But they'll have big genitals hanging down

628
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,240
Just like Bob

629
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,860
Well an ass is functional though

630
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,480
You could go, you could go on speaking tours

631
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:20,300
You could probably, uh, have a

632
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:22,720
Have a lot of friends that maybe irritate you a little bit

633
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,220
And stuff

634
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,400
You could be a politician, most of them talk under their asses

635
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:26,800
A politician? Most of them are asses

636
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,780
A televangelist

637
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:31,300
Oh, that would probably be your combined activities

638
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,600
You'd be speaking politically about the Lord

639
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,040
And, um, you could live well

640
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,500
That's right

641
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:39,820
You know, I think we're all evidence that

642
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,960
The decay of society is being brought about

643
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,680
Partly by poor management of water treatment plants

644
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:47,080
Because a lot of heavy metals are getting into the tap water

645
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,720
Yeah

646
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,300
And it's leading to an increase in the... Rock on, Jim!

647
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,980
...to believe in fairies and auras

648
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,040
And are still allowed to drive cars and leave the house

649
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:56,580
Without being accompanied by an adult with a stun gun, for instance

650
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,880
Well it makes your spine heavy

651
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,140
It's one of the major problems with driving

652
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,220
It makes you... All the heavy metals make your

653
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:04,340
...heavy. Your spinal fluids literally

654
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,860
Become like liquid metal

655
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:07,180
Color number four, you're on the air

656
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:09,320
...in your car seat, you know, that

657
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,580
And it makes it harder to sell

658
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,740
Not to mention the brain damage

659
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:17,180
No wonder my pants don't fit the way they used to

660
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,540
Damn

661
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:20,220
Right, yes, the aluminum in the water... Your organs aren't even the same

662
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,100
It's not the problem with your pants

663
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,600
It's that now you have perhaps an errant leg

664
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,820
Like the errant feet that follow you around without bodies

665
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,720
Perhaps your members become engorged in some way

666
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,200
You looked at something you shouldn't have seen

667
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:31,980
You know

668
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:34,520
We've got stuff in our drinking water

669
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:35,960
That didn't even exist

670
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:36,620
Oh yeah

671
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:38,680
...elements 20, 30 years ago

672
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,940
They were brought here long ago

673
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,000
Very, very long ago

674
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,380
And left for you and me

675
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,060
They don't like us

676
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,080
Yeah

677
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,980
They throw a small dog at a foreigner

678
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,340
Which you always wanted to try

679
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:55,620
Yeah, you might do that now

680
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,080
You are now permitted everything

681
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,080
Unfortunately, everything is permitted

682
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,620
It will be de rigueur

683
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,740
Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law

684
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,460
Everything is permitted

685
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,420
Halim al-Dab

686
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:08,880
Halim al-Dab?

687
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,900
It's permitted but you still have to pay for it

688
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,080
I should play some of his stuff after

689
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,900
And then it becomes de rigueur

690
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:18,280
It's forced behavior and you have to keep repeating it

691
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,200
Like that same dried monkey in the movie

692
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,880
That you keep seeing when you sleep

693
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,840
Come speak to yourself

694
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:24,920
Dave, again

695
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:28,080
Not everybody sees the dried monkey in their sleep

696
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:28,900
Yeah, I remember

697
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,660
We were talking to the giant snowflakes

698
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,560
That run it everywhere

699
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,600
You guys gotta slow down a little bit

700
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,280
You guys go like way too quick

701
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,220
Maybe you're just too slow

702
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:41,960
No, I'm not slow

703
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:43,380
I hear everything you say

704
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,680
And the other guys say

705
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,620
And I hear it again in the radio

706
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,840
And now

707
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,560
From Reverend Ezekiel Tito Garacas

708
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,620
Whoever he is

709
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,560
What promises to be the next big hit song

710
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,460
Or really rather the new technique

711
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,900
That will supplant hip hop and rap

712
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,080
Okay

713
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,340
Here's the situation

714
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:08,920
My parents went away on a week's vacation

715
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,340
And they left the keys to the brand new Porsche

716
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,140
But they mined

717
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:13,560
Well of course not

718
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,240
I'll just take it for a little spin

719
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,800
And maybe show it off to a couple of friends

720
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,760
I'll just cruise it around the neighborhood

721
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,300
Well, maybe I'll just take it for a little spin

722
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:20,520
Maybe

723
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,040
The final

724
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:23,920
The

725
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:25,760
The

726
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,340
The

727
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:26,480
The

728
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:27,420
The final

729
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:34,100
Thanks to some caring and determined individuals

730
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,120
These dolphins are considered nuisance animals

731
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:41,760
Today these creatures are dodging cars in the bathroom

732
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,240
There is plenty here to eat and to drink

733
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,120
And a lot of open garbage cans

734
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,300
Are unloaded and opened

735
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:50,300
And a lot of open garbage cans

736
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:51,600
The animals race out

737
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,060
Happy to be in the bathroom

738
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,080
It's a makeshift home for two happy nuisance animals

739
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,900
Happy nuisance animals

740
00:25:59,900 --> 00:25:59,940
Happy nuisance animals

741
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:01,520
Happy nuisance animals

742
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:03,340
But

743
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,200
But

744
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:04,820
But

745
00:26:04,820 --> 00:26:06,260
But

746
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:06,760
But

747
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,200
But

748
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:07,260
But

749
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:07,760
But

750
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:07,760


751
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,520
But

752
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:08,880
But

753
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:09,780
But

754
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:10,460
But

755
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,120
It's

756
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,600
It's

757
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:24,740
Such

758
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:28,260
Such a

759
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,360
Such a

760
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,360


761
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:30,580
Such a

762
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:30,580


763
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,740
Such a

764
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:37,740


765
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:37,740


766
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:37,740


767
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:37,740


768
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:41,120
acid I've ever seen anybody eat in my life.

769
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,200
Pills, pills, pills, Bob.

770
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,060
I can't begin to understand.

771
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,560
I can't begin to understand.

772
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:50,120
We are trying to transmit it to my head.

773
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:52,260
Listen, it is not my fault.

774
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,080
The thoughts are not my thoughts.

775
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,800
I'm sure now.

776
00:26:58,080 --> 00:26:59,620
That's what I thought they were laughing at.

777
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:04,420
You're the king of my head.

778
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,180
Your head.

779
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:08,440
Hey, are you smoking?

780
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:09,780
No, but the pipe is.

781
00:27:09,940 --> 00:27:10,900
It will help you.

782
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,060
It's going to help everybody.

783
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,420
This is disgusting.

784
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,480
Stand up, baby.

785
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,600
You know, I tried curing part of my trouble recently

786
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,840
by licking the cover of the Book of the Subgenius,

787
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:26,320
but it didn't really seem to help.

788
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:27,980
I'm kind of hurt.

789
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,560
Did it lose its charge over time on the bookshelf?

790
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:31,640
Help, O'Keefe.

791
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:33,540
It's the little spot inside.

792
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:36,200
In Chapter 19, there's a spot that says,

793
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,120
lick this spot.

794
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:37,620
Oh.

795
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:37,980
Duh.

796
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:40,260
Well, the cover used to help me.

797
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,400
Maybe it was all in my head,

798
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,680
like all too many things are.

799
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,920
Well, actually, help, O'Keefe,

800
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,640
you've been a subgenius for a long time,

801
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,540
and I bet you have a real old copy, right?

802
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,940
Fairly old, yeah.

803
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:51,500
Yeah, well, there were some accidents

804
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,820
when we had those copies around the house

805
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,420
when Civet, my daughter, was very young.

806
00:27:56,660 --> 00:27:57,000
Right.

807
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:59,900
She would baptize the Books of the Subgenius.

808
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,380
And you're laughing,

809
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,760
but actually it's quite literally true.

810
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,860
I believe it.

811
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,960
And that might account for some,

812
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:07,720
if you felt like,

813
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,420
felt a psychedelic kick

814
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:12,520
from licking a cover of Books of the Subgenius,

815
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,540
that may be it,

816
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,860
because they don't all do that.

817
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:18,180
You have to buy 10 or 12 of them

818
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,300
before you'll find the one that makes you high

819
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,960
any time you lick it.

820
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,260
Well, now, I did have...

821
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,580
You know, if kids are going to go out

822
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,260
trying to get high,

823
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,560
really, you're going to have to plan to buy

824
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,360
about a dozen copies of Books of the Subgenius.

825
00:28:31,580 --> 00:28:32,980
Well, now, my nice ex-wife

826
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,540
did let a Seventh-day Adventist

827
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:36,040
into the house a couple of years ago,

828
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,300
and there was a copy of

829
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,960
Revelation X on the coffee table,

830
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,100
and this woman picked it up,

831
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,580
and she dropped it real fast,

832
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,820
and her hair began to smoke,

833
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:44,880
and I knew that was still a viable copy,

834
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,760
and I'm glad she did,

835
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,940
because she could have spontaneously combusted it.

836
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,900
Well, I really liked that chair she was in.

837
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,600
I would have hated to have seen it go, you know.

838
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:54,500
Oh, that makes a wonderful event for the children.

839
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,860
So much better than when the police officer

840
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,560
shows up and scares them

841
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:01,620
to see a woman's hair smoking on its own,

842
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,440
perhaps reaching that...

843
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,980
Did anybody ever catch,

844
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:10,360
the conspiracy that was combusting people?

845
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,800
Was that ever explained?

846
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,520
I mean, was it like crop circles

847
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,400
are done by hippie artists?

848
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,840
Were spontaneous human combustion cases

849
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:24,460
just really weird Dada artist projects?

850
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,020
As a matter of fact, yes,

851
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,500
it can be traced all the way back

852
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,160
to the early 1920s, actually.

853
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:33,440
Oh, before that.

854
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:36,060
I'm sure there were cases before the 20s.

855
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:36,780
I mean, when you saw it,

856
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:39,340
it had become a massive artistic movement,

857
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,640
the human combustion.

858
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:42,900
The anti-futurists in the 20s.

859
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:47,100
In fact, the first ever talking sound motion picture

860
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:52,340
was a Dada film of spontaneous human combustion.

861
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,000
Yeah.

862
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:55,400
That's something they don't tell you

863
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,020
in the film history classes.

864
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,200
Yeah, it was called Andalusian Kabassi

865
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,040
or something, I think.

866
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,920
Or Andalusian Sausage.

867
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,960
Remember the part where they,

868
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:10,060
they actually slipped the little eye socket

869
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:12,040
into the leather belt

870
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:14,020
and then they let it fly out

871
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:15,320
and then everybody...

872
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,700
And Hanson's armpit hair crawled out of it

873
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,840
while the moon went crazy.

874
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,600
But that wasn't...

875
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,580
That was a cool movie.

876
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:22,760
But that was kind of an answer to the futurists,

877
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,280
you know, the few...

878
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:27,700
Wasn't that Ernst Buniel and Salvador Hitchcock?

879
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,140
I think it was...

880
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:30,620
That did that?

881
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,840
Curtis Mayfield?

882
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,560
No, it was the one,

883
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,380
it was the talking eyeball, I think,

884
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,020
was responsible for the whole project.

885
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,460
And that's why we were...

886
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:44,140
Remember the blue lines we had to take out of each page?

887
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,920
We had to, like, excise the whole tract

888
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,520
because of the crap we had to go through.

889
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,020
Don't you guys...

890
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,720
Yeah, those old-timey surrealists

891
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,520
were ahead of everybody.

892
00:30:53,860 --> 00:30:55,760
Oh, Edward versus the Baptist.

893
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,640
I remember that.

894
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:57,100
Right.

895
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:58,880
Hey, hey, um,

896
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,720
want to hear my Marcel Duchamp joke?

897
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,540
There's an old pensioner, see?

898
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,140
And he keeps going to his hotel

899
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,500
and he goes up to the concierge at the desk,

900
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:06,940
and he says,

901
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,260
well, when I give you my key

902
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,280
or I come for my key,

903
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,340
I will announce my name.

904
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,520
My name is André Martin,

905
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,800
and I will say my name

906
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,240
and I will say,

907
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:16,820
room 29,

908
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,880
you will give me my key.

909
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,540
So every day he does this

910
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:20,400
and the concierge says,

911
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,320
well, the old guy, you know,

912
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,460
he's getting short on his forehead

913
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,500
and he's giving me the keys

914
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:24,400
and he says his name

915
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:25,280
and stuff and he goes up.

916
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,480
So one time the guy comes in

917
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:27,680
and he says,

918
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,880
André Martin, room 29,

919
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,080
and the guy gives him his key.

920
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,540
And just a few short seconds later,

921
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:35,200
a man comes in,

922
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,080
he's all disheveled,

923
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,540
he's bleeding,

924
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:37,420
and it looks like somebody

925
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,720
hit him real hard on the head.

926
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,860
Part of his ear is ripped off

927
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,100
and his clothes are ripped

928
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,760
and he comes up and he goes,

929
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,600
André Martin, room 29.

930
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:46,680
And the guy goes,

931
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,020
hey, buddy, you can't fool me.

932
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,460
André Martin just came in

933
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:50,400
and got his key and goes,

934
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,320
I know I fell out of the window.

935
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,340
Huh.

936
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,280
Well, no, it wasn't a real joke.

937
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,260
It was just kind of a...

938
00:31:59,200 --> 00:31:59,880
True story.

939
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:00,360
...attempted.

940
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,100
Wait, is...

941
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:01,500
No.

942
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:03,860
There goes another 300 megabytes.

943
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:04,600
That was...

944
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:05,540
It was a joke.

945
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,240
Damn.

946
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:06,640
Yeah.

947
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,700
Three-ring existentialism.

948
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,720
Get it while it's hot.

949
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,620
Get the rings while they're hot, man.

950
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,060
Never mind the existentialism.

951
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:15,620
You got to deal with that every day.

952
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,660
You know what I'm saying, jelly band?

953
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,480
The, the, the, the, the, the,

954
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,780
the final, the, the, the, the, the, the,

955
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:28,020
the, the, the, the, the, the,

956
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,000
the final, the, the, the, the, the, the...

957
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,760
Caller number four, welcome.

958
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:32,620
You're on the air.

959
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:35,180
What's it?

960
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,640
This is both of...

961
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,760
Mad cow, mad human.

962
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,020
I told you earlier...

963
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:41,200
Dad, is that you?

964
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:41,940
God?

965
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,360
He got out of the home again.

966
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:49,940
Inappropriate.

967
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:51,860
Oh, wow.

968
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,260
I feel certainly a lot happier...

969
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:55,000
That got bounced.

970
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,260
...now knowing I'm not that guy.

971
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,240
That got dropped.

972
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,120
What's wrong with this person?

973
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,280
I don't know, but he...

974
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,440
Well, I think I do know what's wrong with him.

975
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,220
Well, for one thing, he's obviously got a serious speech impediment,

976
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,040
and he should consider...

977
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,200
getting some speech therapy for that.

978
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,400
They do offer programs nowadays.

979
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:11,420
Yeah, but it sounded kind of good, though.

980
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:11,840
I mean...

981
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,360
Yeah, yeah.

982
00:33:12,380 --> 00:33:12,960
Maybe we could...

983
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,460
I can't hear him at all from...

984
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:19,140
I'm on the furthest tin can down the line of strings,

985
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,720
and he's, you know, from him,

986
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,280
and so I couldn't hear...

987
00:33:23,280 --> 00:33:24,340
I couldn't even hear...

988
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:26,100
He's not only...

989
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,720
Just a tin can, not even someone talking in one.

990
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,340
Right.

991
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:30,300
So...

992
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:30,980
Yeah, it was just a...

993
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:32,160
I could hear a tin can.

994
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:32,540
That was it.

995
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,900
Is he really institutionalized?

996
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:34,540
Is he...

997
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,540
Why do you get such weird questions?

998
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,740
I...

999
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,860
Can't say why.

1000
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,260
I...

1001
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,300
Got me.

1002
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:46,540
You got me.

1003
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,600
Creepy, crawly, creepy callers.

1004
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,240
Pychosephalic.

1005
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:00,620
Huh?

1006
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,000
Pychosephalic people.

1007
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:02,780
Pycho?

1008
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,940
Even smaller than microcephalic.

1009
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,260
Oh.

1010
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:05,920
Oh.

1011
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:06,680
Even worse.

1012
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,100
You're going to start getting calls from youth for Christ people.

1013
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,700
Well, as a...

1014
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:11,500
As a...

1015
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,100
Burr.

1016
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:16,220
A head-sized, overly endowed person,

1017
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:22,240
I personally find this talk about cranial capacities and head sizes somewhat offensive.

1018
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:23,680
Why?

1019
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,140
Well, you know, we...

1020
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,900
Don't you believe in the natural order of size?

1021
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:29,580
I'm a...

1022
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,840
I got a big one.

1023
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,140
I got a huge head.

1024
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,680
I got a size 8 head.

1025
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,300
Oh, whoa.

1026
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:35,760
Whoa.

1027
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:35,760


1028
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:36,600
Size 8.

1029
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:38,440
The head around which the sun revolves.

1030
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:40,920
Feels a whole size 8.

1031
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,700
Am I amazed?

1032
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:44,280
I'm so impressed.

1033
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:44,600
Woo.

1034
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,220
Well, what if you had a size 3 hat?

1035
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,400
Wouldn't...

1036
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:51,880
Don't you think there would be a modicum of embarrassment accompanying your...

1037
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:59,160
I would probably have a lot more slack if I had a size 3 hat size than I do with the

1038
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:05,740
gigantic, Fellini-esque 8 1⁄2 that not only I, but my poor tiny...

1039
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,560
Oh, listen to who's talking.

1040
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:13,160
I knew Stang back when he was a fetus, but I shook the jar too hard, and look what happened to him.

1041
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:17,060
Well, my head has been the same size since I was born.

1042
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:19,100
That's the hellish aspect of it.

1043
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:19,940
Actually, you're a fetus.

1044
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:25,200
You talk and make jokes about people that are just a head, but that's what I looked like when I was born.

1045
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:29,300
My dad almost had me killed, and I...

1046
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:35,540
It turned out that I basically am a dwarf who has a...

1047
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,220
Side condition of giantism.

1048
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:38,980
Oh, gosh.

1049
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:45,060
And so that may help explain the sort of al cap...

1050
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,020
The nasal...

1051
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:52,640
Sort of proportion of my own physical body, which I've noticed turns some types of girls on.

1052
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:53,740
That's Drew's argument.

1053
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:54,500
Call it number four.

1054
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:58,040
They like that Tasmanian devil kind of physique.

1055
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,160
The danger factor.

1056
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:05,400
Yeah, well, it's the ape thing, you know, monkey card dance fetish, that fantasy thing.

1057
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:09,860
I never feel as alive as when I'm right on the verge of maybe being ripped to shreds.

1058
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:12,480
It's kind of a problem, but it's exciting, too, you know.

1059
00:36:12,540 --> 00:36:14,300
Well, that's the Yeti in you, Pope.

1060
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,380
Hell, Pope Huey.

1061
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:15,680
You know.

1062
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,160
It's the Yeti inside, shrieking to get out.

1063
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:25,140
If your head gets too small, it could conceivably condense, actually, to a point.

1064
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,080
To an infinitely smaller point.

1065
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,000
Well, then you have to get one of those little football helmets like they have at the department store.

1066
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:33,040
I mean, the fast food chain when you go through and they give you...

1067
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,320
I'm talking about your head becoming infinitely small.

1068
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,780
Like, uh, shrunken down to a tiny single point.

1069
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,480
Imagine your conscious head shrinking to a point infinitely.

1070
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:50,880
Oh, tiny heads on radio synesthesia, friends.

1071
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:54,900
We had a special guest call there from Hell, Pope Huey.

1072
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:02,500
Uh, the collages are by Lemur and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, king of all butts.

1073
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:04,760
Butt, butt, butt.

1074
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,300
Butt, butt, butt.

1075
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:09,140
Hey, dig this.

1076
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:09,620
Huh?

1077
00:37:10,120 --> 00:37:13,160
You said you like, uh, acid cases?

1078
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,460
Yeah.

1079
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,200
What?

1080
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,300
Acid cases.

1081
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,440
Yeah, cases of...

1082
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,560
What about the, uh...

1083
00:37:18,560 --> 00:37:19,520
Yeah, cases of acid?

1084
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:19,880
Sure.

1085
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,600
...by Devo called Automodown.

1086
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:23,800
Automodown.

1087
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,420
By Devo?

1088
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,520
Automodown.

1089
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:28,720
Down in Youngstown, where the crazies live.

1090
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,620
Acid head goon in the noonday sun.

1091
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:34,980
Didn't mean...

1092
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:36,260
Didn't mean to do it.

1093
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:38,580
In the noonday sun.

1094
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:43,180
He mowed them down with a 55 Dodge.

1095
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,740
He didn't mean to do it.

1096
00:37:44,860 --> 00:37:45,400
Ride them.

1097
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,480
Mow them.

1098
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,160
Automodown.

1099
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,020
Down in Youngstown.

1100
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,400
Where the crazies live.

1101
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:55,520
Automodown.

1102
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,160
True story.

1103
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,760
Automodown.

1104
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:59,560
Down in Youngstown.

1105
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,760
Where the crazies live.

1106
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,380
Man, that's cool.

1107
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:05,740
Acid head goon in the 55 Dodge.

1108
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,120
Didn't mean to do it.

1109
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,980
I know that song.

1110
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:13,240
That's cool.

1111
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,560
In fact, Occupant does a great cover of that song.

1112
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,180
Shut the fuck up, man.

1113
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,960
You sound like you got a speech impediment, man.

1114
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:21,060
You just get your hair lit fixed.

1115
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,740
What's going on?

1116
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,320
He made fun of the way I talk.

1117
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,120
Why did they make fun of us?

1118
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,080
Why do they...

1119
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:29,700
Uh...

1120
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,780
...throw things at us?

1121
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,340
Mr. Bus Driver, please open the door.

1122
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,640
Oh, there's no more music playing.

1123
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,300
How about everything's dead now?

1124
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:37,780
Oh, no.

1125
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,240
Oh, no.

1126
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,060
There was quiet for a minute.

1127
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,540
We were real, real, real quiet.

1128
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,640
Like, real, real, real, real quiet.

1129
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:48,800
Ffff...

1130
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,100
Oh, yeah.

1131
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:52,460
Oh, yeah.

1132
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,000
Oh, yeah.

1133
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,540
Oh, yeah.

1134
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:54,020
Oh, yeah.

1135
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:54,560
Oh, yeah.

1136
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,760
When I lost the Raj least I'll give you one.

1137
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:23,120
Oh, for fuck sake it's time to go off.

1138
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,120


1139
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:23,140
Oh, yeah.

1140
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:32,000
Just trying to get free.

1141
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,760
Them old fashioned punks.

1142
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:35,700
The old Russian clown.

1143
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,360
Bodies in the street

1144
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,140
At the Moor Down

1145
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,460
Noon in downtown

1146
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:43,520
Bodies with no feet

1147
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,280
At the Moor Down

1148
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,780
Down in Youngstown

1149
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,420
Bodies got the blues

1150
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,300
At the Moor Down

1151
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:53,520
Noon in downtown

1152
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,660
Bodies with no shoes

1153
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,460
Nothing had gone in a fifty-five dodge

1154
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,640
Didn't mean to do it

1155
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,900
But a sidewalk run in a loom day

1156
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,700
Something the one he had to lose it

1157
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:22,160
At the Moor Down

1158
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,840
Down in Kentown

1159
00:40:23,840 --> 00:40:25,300
Got the Acubeat

1160
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,240
At the Moor Down

1161
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,680
Robotech sound

1162
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:31,600
Got to move your feet

1163
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,780
Hit the retro style

1164
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:34,880
You can spare a beat

1165
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:37,700
Turn around the way the Spartan boys used to do it

1166
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:41,200
Now it's time to show that we're all evil

1167
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,800
An occupant's here to prove it

1168
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,120
At the Moor Down

1169
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,880
Down in Youngstown

1170
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,440
Bodies in the street

1171
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:04,180
At the Moor Down

1172
00:41:04,180 --> 00:41:05,460
Noon in downtown

1173
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,720
Bodies with no feet

1174
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,240
At the Moor Down

1175
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:11,180
Down in Youngstown

1176
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,440
Bodies got the blues

1177
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,240
At the Moor Down

1178
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,520
Noon in downtown

1179
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:19,620
Bodies with no shoes

1180
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,420
Nothing had gone in a fifty-five dodge

1181
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:25,680
Didn't mean to do it

1182
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:28,860
But a sidewalk run in a loom day

1183
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,580
Something the one he had to lose it

1184
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,740
workloads listen to the song

1185
00:41:36,740 --> 00:41:37,100
Do you have a

1186
00:41:37,100 --> 00:41:37,380
Do you have a

1187
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:37,840
Do you have

1188
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:40,480
Do you have a

1189
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:44,520
Do you have a

1190
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:50,600
Do you have a

1191
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:55,320
Do you have a

1192
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,000
Do you have a

1193
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:57,920
Do you have a

1194
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:57,920


1195
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:57,940
Do you have a

1196
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:03,760
Occupants version of Auto-Mo-Down

1197
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:03,880
Occupants version of Auto-Mo-Down

1198
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:03,920
Occupants version of Auto-Mo-Down

1199
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,840
There you have it.

1200
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,000
Erect Iraq.

1201
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,560
Whatever it was.

1202
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,580
Erect Iraq.

1203
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:18,840
You know, alternative radio, one of the alternatives is like going, you know, stick some sharp object in your ear hole.

1204
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,540
You don't have to listen.

1205
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,340
That's right.

1206
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,840
You can always...

1207
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,260
You can still listen and not listen.

1208
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:26,560
There's so many choices you can ignore.

1209
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:30,460
You can always stick your head in a bucket of ice water and probably won't hear a thing we're saying.

1210
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,600
Boy, would... I think I need something like that.

1211
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:40,960
I think I need to immerse my whole spiritual being in a bucket of the most frozen water there is.

1212
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,080
No, Dave. Desire is the problem.

1213
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,480
Thinking that you need that is itself the problem.

1214
00:42:46,580 --> 00:42:47,920
Our desires must be extinguished.

1215
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:49,840
You know what movie I just saw recently?

1216
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,760
I just saw Altered States for the first time, speaking of submersion.

1217
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,060
You ever seen that?

1218
00:42:57,060 --> 00:42:58,180
I'd never seen that before.

1219
00:42:58,360 --> 00:42:59,420
Oh, Altered States?

1220
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,340
I was very pleased.

1221
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,900
Well, you know, that's one of the great bad things.

1222
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:14,200
Ken Russell did such a Ken Russell-y job on that film that the screenwriter, Patty Chayefsky, had his name taken off of it.

1223
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,100
Patty Chayefsky, yeah.

1224
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:23,560
Patty Chayefsky wrote Altered States, which is loosely based on John Lilly's experiments with ketamine.

1225
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,760
Which is free-based on John Lilly's experiments.

1226
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:33,020
And the movie, like all of Ken Russell's epics, is...

1227
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:41,220
Sometimes inappropriately laughable and with an especially melodramatic and hilarious ending.

1228
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,940
I know people who have taken DMT and gone into...

1229
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,440
William Hurt banging himself repeatedly against the wall.

1230
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:57,380
So that the power of the love will bring him back from his state of being at universal oneness with the...

1231
00:43:58,020 --> 00:43:58,840
With the Yeti.

1232
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,140
What a premise, Jerry. You're sitting on a goldmine.

1233
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,900
That flat-ass is as big as...

1234
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,660
Come on over and have a drink with me.

1235
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,040
Sit down. We'll sign the contracts tomorrow.

1236
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,740
Look, there's a 50% deal on this one.

1237
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:10,640
Sign here. And here. And here.

1238
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:17,940
Anyway, it was cool where he took the drug and suddenly there was fireworks going off around him.

1239
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,320
And the Indians were laughing at him.

1240
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,180
He was stumbling around.

1241
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:21,860
I have been there, dude.

1242
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,380
I have been there.

1243
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,740
Wait, what part of...

1244
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,140
Is that new?

1245
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:27,900
She turned into the lizard that was blowing away in the sand.

1246
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,680
Did you actually go to that part of Mexico?

1247
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:30,960
I know there ain't...

1248
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,760
I know there ain't a listener out there who hadn't had that.

1249
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:34,480
That beer.

1250
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,400
Too many.

1251
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:47,580
Now, Dave, what drug are you on?

1252
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,320
I'm on the facial hemorrhagic.

1253
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:53,540
You rub it into your skin. It's an antedendral.

1254
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,320
It starts to break down the molecular surface.

1255
00:44:56,860 --> 00:44:59,820
And so you not only have to shave, you...

1256
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,080
You lose a lot, so...

1257
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:10,760
I'm also using one that reconnects the synapses in the back part of my brain by the M.O.

1258
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:13,000
By the medullar oblongator.

1259
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:15,760
And the government pays for the medication?

1260
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:17,780
Well, they pay for the right.

1261
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,480
They pay for any substantial growth in revenue.

1262
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:25,560
Do you get a pinch of this, a dash of that?

1263
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:29,140
Sometimes referred to in the trade as a sleeping beauty boilermaker.

1264
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,380
Take no notice if he begins to levitate.

1265
00:45:32,620 --> 00:45:33,900
It's a common side effect.

1266
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:34,640
The...

1267
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,760
The final...

1268
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,120
The...

1269
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,080
The...

1270
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:39,580
The...

1271
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:39,820
The...

1272
00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:40,080
The...

1273
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:40,820
The...

1274
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,680
The users of drugs...

1275
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:50,960
Drugs, dear friends, on the other hand, are placing themselves in grave danger.

1276
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:55,680
They can never get as truly fried as they want to be.

1277
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,480
They gotta take one on top of the other.

1278
00:45:57,540 --> 00:46:01,060
Sometimes they take so many that when they forget one or two,

1279
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,900
they later get mad at themselves for it.

1280
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:08,040
So to keep mentally levitating, they always need more.

1281
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:12,820
Sooner or later, they burn out and become too slacked to react.

1282
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:22,400
As they say, the brain tunnels through which they once excavated and blasted with such drunken zeal begin to cave in.

1283
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:25,980
The abuser wakes up one day impaired.

1284
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:28,420
His muscles feel ravaged.

1285
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,880
His nerves nullified.

1286
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,600
There's a hollowness inside, but a hot hollowness.

1287
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:40,700
And discomfort mounts to panic as he realizes he's annihilated one brain cell too many.

1288
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:42,500
His teeth grind.

1289
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:47,820
His cells shrivel, yet seem to scream for more when there is none.

1290
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:54,780
His skin exudes bitter greases from every pore, as if he were getting a long overdue oil change.

1291
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,600
Everything's clammy and numb to the touch.

1292
00:46:57,740 --> 00:47:03,520
His eternal itch gasps and convulses with the amputation nausea.

1293
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:09,000
The electric glue of his brain becomes tacky and stiffens.

1294
00:47:09,120 --> 00:47:14,920
The snot-like shock fluid in which the brain once cozily floated has drained away,

1295
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:21,660
and the dried husk of grey matter slams against the rough cranial walls with every movement of the head.

1296
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:28,100
The gyroscopes inside the ears' balance tubes wobble crazily, and the world is no end up.

1297
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:33,580
The floor lurches and shifts its steepness and changes its slant right and left.

1298
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


1299
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:33,580


1300
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:34,360
The bed is right under his feet.

1301
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:42,020
If he lays down, he suffers the slow ovals, the bed seeming to spin very slowly end over end through space.

1302
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:50,940
He goes to the bathroom to expel the bad water, but his urine smells burnt and leaks out in a weak radioactive dribble.

1303
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,760
He looks in the mirror.

1304
00:47:53,000 --> 00:48:02,880
His skin is Krishna blue in pallor, and he worries that the quiet interior shattering noises he hears are the sounds of his blood crystallizing.

1305
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,580
His heart beats.

1306
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:17,100
His heart starts to dry hump the back of his throat in hysteria, for he knows that to die on drugs is to doom his soul to eternal earthbound wandering in a purgatory where the liquor stores are all closed.

1307
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:27,160
If the nental eye is intoxicated, the very soul is intoxicated when the body dies, it doesn't know it's dead and so never heads for heaven.

1308
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,500
Laying on the floor, glowing feebly in the dark,

1309
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:33,200
the wretch moans out,

1310
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:33,580
The drug is dead.

1311
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,660
The drug users lament.

1312
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,740
I can't decipher anything.

1313
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,420
Put me where you want me.

1314
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:42,600
Give me rubber blankets.

1315
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:53,760
Eventually his cohorts show up and give him succor in the form of more, and the wheel starts rolling again.

1316
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:00,060
The conspiracy encourages, blatantly,

1317
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:03,580
a useless, empty pattern of suffering.

1318
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,080
Disorganized Odd прост integrations sleeping,

1319
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:11,900
The anti-reality sleep drugs like alcohol and downers are legal pretty much,

1320
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,540
while the wake-up drugs are only available.

1321
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:18,380
You can tell which ones they'd rather you take.

1322
00:49:30,820 --> 00:49:33,240
Chico, California. We have time for two more calls.

1323
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:33,940
Chico, you're first.

1324
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:37,500
Yes, I am basically a loaded person.

1325
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:40,500
Gosh, the more loaded, the more callers call in.

1326
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:41,640
Thank you very much.

1327
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:48,260
In fact, I mean, there's just so much that...

1328
00:49:50,760 --> 00:49:51,980
Okay, thank you, sir.

1329
00:49:53,380 --> 00:49:55,220
Hollywood, Florida. Go ahead, Hollywood.

1330
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,080
Yes.

1331
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,760
Roxbury, Massachusetts. Good morning. What's on your mind?

1332
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:00,920
Hello?

1333
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:01,460
Yes, sir.

1334
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:03,920
I'm calling from Roxbury.

1335
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:05,880
Roxbury?

1336
00:50:07,220 --> 00:50:10,280
I'm happy and I'm glad because I'm not me.

1337
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:16,180
I sit here to die to death on the outside.

1338
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:18,260
We were bad and...

1339
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:19,020
Roxbury, thank you.

1340
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:21,140
Next call is from Detroit.

1341
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,580
Hello, yes. Thank you for taking my call.

1342
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:26,540
Kill everything. Kill everything.

1343
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:27,720
Kill, kill, kill.

1344
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:29,400
Kill, kill, kill.

1345
00:50:29,580 --> 00:50:30,700
Okay, thank you very much.

1346
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:32,440
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.

1347
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:33,280
You made that point.

1348
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:33,920
Thank you very much.

1349
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,700
She died yesterday.

1350
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:38,220
Next call is Overland Park, Kansas.

1351
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,060
Good morning to you.

1352
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:41,220
My...

1353
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,420
Well, he died.

1354
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:49,740
I think my husband was going to kill people when he was 20 years old.

1355
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:57,040
I think the New World Order was exposed to asbestos in 1929.

1356
00:50:57,560 --> 00:51:00,000
It's atrocious. We should be ashamed of ourselves.

1357
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:00,500
Thank you.

1358
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:01,700
That's Overland Park, Kansas.

1359
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,920
Next is Cliffside Park.

1360
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:04,900
Cliffside Park, New Jersey.

1361
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,520
Oh, hi. How you doing?

1362
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:06,880
Good morning.

1363
00:51:07,220 --> 00:51:09,360
Good morning.

1364
00:51:12,840 --> 00:51:15,160
Yeah, I guess the...

1365
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:18,420
I don't remember the...

1366
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:19,380
Thank you.

1367
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,240
Next, Fort Lauderdale.

1368
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:21,760
Good morning.

1369
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:24,360
Are you there, caller?

1370
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:24,720
Yes.

1371
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:25,540
I'm...

1372
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:25,840
Hi.

1373
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,340
And...

1374
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:29,400
Uh...

1375
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:29,820
Uh...

1376
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:29,960
Uh...

1377
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,400
SARS syndrome.

1378
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,540
Infestation.

1379
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,200
Uh...

1380
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:34,760
Uh...

1381
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:37,560
SARS.

1382
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:38,980
Um...

1383
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,680
The...

1384
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,840
The Sto-o-otic...

1385
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,900
SARS infection.

1386
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,460
Well, thanks, CDC,

1387
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:45,160
for SARS.

1388
00:51:45,220 --> 00:51:45,620
SARS...

1389
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:45,840
Uh...

1390
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:46,380
And...

1391
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:47,500
SARS...

1392
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:48,420
And...

1393
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:48,920
Uh...

1394
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:49,480
Um...

1395
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:50,980
If you want to keep an eye on that...

1396
00:51:50,980 --> 00:51:56,860
Friends, does this show sometimes make you feel like you're on some kind of drugs?

1397
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,440
Some kind of...

1398
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:05,760
Does listening to this show make you wish you weren't, that you hadn't done the drugs?

1399
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:07,420
Well, maybe that'd be a good idea.

1400
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,580
Maybe next time you should leave the drugs alone and just come to Bob, friends.

1401
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:14,000
You know, Jesus loves you.

1402
00:52:14,040 --> 00:52:18,460
And Bob, well, he doesn't actually even know who you are.

1403
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:20,340
We're not going to try to kid you about that.

1404
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:26,980
But whereas Jesus doesn't really care about your money, Bob does care about your money.

1405
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,680
I mean, this is a prosperity ministry, friends.

1406
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:39,900
We want to take your money away from you so you won't be enslaved by that handcuff of the conspiracy known as your paycheck, your ability to pay your bills.

1407
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,740
We'll take all of that on our shoulders for you.

1408
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:44,580
Are you going to end wage slavery?

1409
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,820
Are you going to put an end to wage slavery?

1410
00:52:48,120 --> 00:52:50,680
I'd want a way to put an end to wage slavery.

1411
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:52,760
It's put an end to your wages.

1412
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,860
And just put you up straight up and sit beside a waiter.

1413
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:56,780
A damn.

1414
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:58,560
Slave the way you want to be.

1415
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,140
Thank you very much.

1416
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,520
A ludicrous idea.

1417
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:02,880
But I don't.

1418
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,520
I don't.

1419
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,200
I don't.

1420
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:06,700
I don't.

1421
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:08,140
Do you?

1422
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,160
I don't.

1423
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:09,800
I don't either.

1424
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:10,860
No, I don't.

1425
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:11,780
How long has it been?

1426
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:12,560
Well.

1427
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:16,160
Four, five, seven, any numbers you know?

1428
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:17,720
Can you have numbers in your head now?

1429
00:53:17,880 --> 00:53:18,320
Oh, no.

1430
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:19,660
I don't like to think about it.

1431
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:22,080
I remember when I used to have a pile of them.

1432
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:22,960
I block it out.

1433
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:25,400
Sometimes I would block them out.

1434
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:26,700
I used to put them like in little.

1435
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:27,120
Piles.

1436
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,780
I would have the sevens and the twos.

1437
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:29,200
Oh, yeah.

1438
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,280
And then I would put the fives and the fours.

1439
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,180
Oh, that's a good way.

1440
00:53:32,440 --> 00:53:32,740
Yes.

1441
00:53:32,760 --> 00:53:34,700
And that way I was anti-localized.

1442
00:53:34,740 --> 00:53:36,760
And at the same time I was everywhere like.

1443
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:43,800
These space-grown crystals are so pure that they're going to bring revolutionary advances

1444
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:46,400
in electronics, which will benefit every one of us.

1445
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,000
In fact, they're so.

1446
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:48,420
Attention.

1447
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:51,680
Clear all channels for possible emergency re-entry.

1448
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,080
Oh, no.

1449
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:53,720
Not again.

1450
00:53:54,180 --> 00:53:54,800
Stand by.

1451
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,500
Video signal coming in.

1452
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:56,960
On all channels.

1453
00:53:56,980 --> 00:53:59,520
Just as I thought.

1454
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:04,300
Somehow, this silly bird trips the emergency system every time he comes in.

1455
00:54:05,260 --> 00:54:07,440
And I think he knows the last on us.

1456
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:13,400
Not trying is caused by those things on your testicle, son.

1457
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,320
But don't worry.

1458
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,880
They will fly away like the Japanese wind.

1459
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:19,260
You'll be set free in just a moment of pain.

1460
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:20,100
It's a prophecy.

1461
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:21,840
See, everything Dave says is prophecy.

1462
00:54:22,180 --> 00:54:25,920
It sounds like insanity, madness, man.

1463
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:26,620
But it's prophecy.

1464
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:27,920
It's a big man.

1465
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:28,820
It's like a dreamer guy.

1466
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,700
You know what I'm saying?

1467
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:30,680
He's a dreamer.

1468
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:33,100
You know, he sees things that don't exist and things that might exist.

1469
00:54:33,100 --> 00:54:33,540
He's a big man.

1470
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,220
I'm a little man.

1471
00:54:34,460 --> 00:54:35,180
He's like Moses.

1472
00:54:35,420 --> 00:54:36,720
He's like Jesus.

1473
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,500
He's like David Koresh.

1474
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,700
I'm a pair of scuttling claws crawling across ocean floors.

1475
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:44,420
Oh, you of so little faith.

1476
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:52,160
You have passed asunder and yet have not spread your obeisance and your tiny little legs to

1477
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:52,480
Zeus.

1478
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:55,100
You shall be punished.

1479
00:54:56,020 --> 00:54:56,580
Wait.

1480
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:56,660
Wait.

1481
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,080
Wotan.

1482
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:57,720
Wait.

1483
00:54:57,780 --> 00:54:58,320
I'll take that back.

1484
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,620
By Wotan, you shall be punished.

1485
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,040
Sounds like you're hurting that place.

1486
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:05,120
No.

1487
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,940
Wotan backwards is not-aw.

1488
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:08,780
Not-aw.

1489
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:09,160
Whoa.

1490
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:10,740
Not at all.

1491
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,080
It's like really cosmic in here.

1492
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:14,800
Yes, of course it's cosmic.

1493
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,320
Everything is threaded the same way.

1494
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,880
The little mystery is hidden in each word.

1495
00:55:20,180 --> 00:55:21,600
Wotan spelled backwards.

1496
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:23,180
Not-aw.

1497
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:24,160
Not-aw.

1498
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,100
Not-aw.

1499
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:25,780
Not-aw.

1500
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:26,280
Not-aw.

1501
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:26,480
Not-aw.

1502
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:26,560


1503
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:26,560


1504
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:26,560


1505
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:26,560


1506
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:26,560


1507
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:26,560


1508
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:26,560


1509
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:26,560


1510
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,560
The-moied.

1511
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:56,560


1512
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:56,560


1513
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:56,560


1514
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:56,560


1515
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:56,560


1516
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:56,560


1517
00:55:56,560 --> 00:55:56,560

you guys don't waste no airtime no we don't

1533
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:52,060
We squeeze every last drop out of it.

1534
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,920
We suck the meat off the bones.

1535
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:01,200
Do it, do it.

1536
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:02,460
Do it, do it.

1537
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:08,160
You see, these giant squid of the species Architeuthis doxia

1538
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,280
are actually isostatic,

1539
00:58:10,940 --> 00:58:14,740
which means that their body in the water has no weight,

1540
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,400
enabling them to hover.

1541
00:58:16,740 --> 00:58:17,300
Ah.

1542
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:17,560
Ah.

1543
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:21,540
And their prey comes to them into the grass.

1544
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:22,840
Okay, I'm writing that down.

1545
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:23,280
Let's see.

1546
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,900
Tentacles and their two long arms.

1547
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:34,780
With the sucker-strewn pads at the end of each palpated appendage.

1548
00:58:34,780 --> 00:58:35,000
Wait a minute.

1549
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:35,300
Okay.

1550
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:38,660
Now, right here, you see, they hang upside down in the water.

1551
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,740
What was that?

1552
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:41,040
Isocentric?

1553
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:41,900
What was it again?

1554
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,220
The prey swims right into.

1555
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:43,740
Iso what?

1556
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:46,560
Iso-tired.

1557
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:47,280
Iso-tired.

1558
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:47,280


1559
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,080
I can't do it no more.

1560
00:58:48,080 --> 00:58:48,760
Was it isometric?

1561
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:49,980
Isometric.

1562
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:51,080
Iso.

1563
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:51,640
I.

1564
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:52,460
So-tired.

1565
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:53,360
S-O.

1566
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:54,000
Iso.

1567
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:54,820
M.

1568
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:55,180
What so?

1569
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:56,100
I don't know.

1570
00:58:56,120 --> 00:58:56,500
T.

1571
00:58:56,640 --> 00:58:57,580
I don't know.

1572
00:58:57,640 --> 00:58:58,080
T.

1573
00:58:58,260 --> 00:58:58,580
I don't know.

1574
00:58:58,660 --> 00:58:59,580
I just, I just.

1575
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:00,660
Isometric.

1576
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:01,480
R.

1577
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:03,060
Did I say isomorphic?

1578
00:59:03,060 --> 00:59:04,300
I said isostatic.

1579
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,120
Isostatic.

1580
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:05,840
Oh, darn.

1581
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,420
All right.

1582
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:06,720
Now.

1583
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:07,060
Isostatic.

1584
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:07,820
Isostatic.

1585
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:08,420
Where's the eraser?

1586
00:59:08,840 --> 00:59:09,280
Isostatic.

1587
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:09,980
I need an eraser.

1588
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,180
I'm going to erase this.

1589
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,140
Hey, no way.

1590
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:12,700
You can't.

1591
00:59:13,580 --> 00:59:13,800
All right.

1592
00:59:13,820 --> 00:59:14,360
Now, I.

1593
00:59:14,880 --> 00:59:16,660
Now, I can't remember what I.

1594
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:17,000
Oh.

1595
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,100
You erased.

1596
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:20,040
Now, I can't remember that.

1597
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:20,420
T.

1598
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:21,520
A.
