Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show, except
that actually it's not.
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays
and holy days and the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of salad.
Selling.
Selling.
Yes.
Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.
But anyway, happy whatever you do.
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.
It's cool, man.
Cool.
And praise Bob and the whole world.
Oh.

I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas.
Christmas.
Christmas tree.
Christmas tree.
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree.
Yeah.
Will you stop it?
Woo!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
When this angel heard chop-a-pa-pop-a-chop-a-pop-a-pop, a dreadful fear went right into my heart.
Those pine tree needles sting me.
Ram-a-jam-a-ram-a-jam-a-ne-ma-ding-dong.
You'll never know.
You'll never know how much that smarts.
So who put the stump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp?
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong?
Who stood the wood where I boop-sheep-boop-sheep-boop?
Who put the stick up my hip-a-dip-dee-dip?
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush?
He made this angel beg for mercy, please.
I might squeeze him too tight.
It's that.
It's that psychedelic time of the year.
Do you know where your brain cells are?
It's already 9 p.m.
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him.
Don't go walking down to the bar because old Frankie died last night in the backyard.
I mean, I'm in the apartment store.
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw.
Oh, yeah, and I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells till I get the damn chainsaw fixed.
Get back in my arm the way it was Tuesday.
Now, you boys be good, and I'll give you some of this here apple mango pie.
That dog's running off with them brain cells.
Can you do something about that, boy?
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to...

Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.
He's like a cowboy Santa.
How jolly.
Oh, Jazz is giving, gives Dave the show pills.
Boy, I really need one of those.
What am I going to do about laundromat in this suit, though?
I need the show bath.
The show de-lousing.
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.
That's enough of that.
Oh, he's got headphones.
I have some.
I have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.
It's been increased in size to...
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.
Look, it's swelling.
I have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain.
I'll put more pills out for everybody.
Oh, those pills.
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.
And my brain feel like it's a puddle of liquefied crystals.
I'm shocked.
It's funny.
I'm sorry.

I like to take the red one and the blue one.

We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.
It will empower us to resist us.
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.
It will be called Bobber for Kids.
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?
Good has lots of muscles.
Good.
Good.
The primitive earth societies should accept this value judgment.
Good will have free physical attributes according to human desires, sexual desires, latent in children, brought out through the vehicle of this so-called good.

All farmer told me is why is that church?
Better is not good.
She's new, from Kenner.

The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.
Once upon a time, there was the baby Jesus.
And he had two eyes made out of coal.
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.
And he wanted his two front teeth.
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.
And he took all the presents.
from Whoville
and his friend Yukon Cornelius
came with the three wise guys
and he wanted to play the drums
and be the little drummer boy
but he couldn't
he wanted 10s and 20s
10s and 20s
and he got McDonald's dish certificates
and he got Zuzu's pedals
and that's the real story of Christmas
Take the halls and miles of holly
Tears of the season to be jolly

Santa Claus
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas
He wanted to be a man who could do anything
He wanted an electric train
He had the whole thing in his mind
Even to the table where he was going to set it up
He had the whole thing in his mind
He had the whole thing in his mind
He would dream so hard
That the whole thing would come to life
Like before he died
Like before his eyes
Like before his eyes
Like before his eyes
Like before his eyes
Like before his eyes
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher
And what he started wishing for
Was a pretty fancy looking train set
With locomotives and freight cars
And a station and a gateman
And a station and a gateman
With a coach
With a wrong sign
With a light on
With his power

covariating
And what made ben graph
Wonderland


For perfects
He could make everything
With driving
With perfects
Baby get the annihilation

And that's all

To my啦
The will see ya

See ya

Bye
Bye
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.
It is turnover.
The time of the year when all things sell.
The end of the year sale.
Oh, yeah.
So come and get it, everyone, and just buy our products.
Now, are we, is Christmas, I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.
But the presence of genie, try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now
and sell everything to the pigs.
Oh, yes.
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.
And it was something else in between there.
Before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season,
it was something else, but I think they started to war over it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Happy holidays.
And see you after Christmas.
Bye.
Bye.
Friends, try to imagine somewhere in the snowy north, the Santibob trudging mindlessly through the Himalayan snows, driven by strange forces to complete his nameless errand.
And he may show up at your house, my friend, if you've been a bad subgenius or a halfway subgenius, or if we keep getting tangled up in these other shows and having strange microphones.
How did that paternity suit ever turn out between Dobbs and Santa?
And who?
His dad.
Santa dog.
I don't know.
I don't think it was...
Yes, but St. Nicholas, this is fact.
St. Nicholas.
St. Nicholas punched another bishop in the nose and bloodied his nose.
Really?
The historical St. Nicholas?
Over the trinity of God.
The original St. Nicholas in Turkey?
Who the hell is God?
Who the hell is God?
Who the hell is God?
S. Dobbs one day.
That's the question we should be asking.
Suddenly, a lightning bolt struck from nowhere on that bright sunny day.
Bob did a backflip, and from that day on, he too was a believer.
And from the snowdrift truck, a little child bearing flowers emerged.
Chip, what else is on the table?
Each one a dirty flower.
St. Nicholas.
Sip.
Sip.
The historical Santa Claus is originally lived, as the caller knows, as a bishop in...
Was it Constantinople?
Yeah, like one of those...
It was an ancient Byzantium.
Yeah, Asia Minor in general, yeah.
Yes, and he was known for sneaking into the rooms of young women and leaving gifts.
Light-sized lumps of gold, complete with a fake beard and a CIA Wall Street credit card.
A saint he was, the girl said.
St. Nicholas invented...
He invented the CIA.
That's good.
You got it, brother.
He snuck into people's houses through the chimney.
You got it, brother.
He knew when they were sleeping.
He knew when they were awake.
You got it, brother.
But like the CIA, he was...
That's Foucault, baby.
He was protecting them.
Foucault knew that St. Nick was a creeping, stinking spy.
What?
He knows when you've been sleeping.
He knows what you've been eating.
Hey, man, my kids still believe in St. Nicholas.
And who keeps that belief alive in their fevered, sick little brain?
True, and for him, so is...
Madison Avenue, of course.
Sure.
No, the surveillance community under your direction.
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company.
Miller Bear, you know.
He's a very powerful being.
If you're bad, he punishes you.
If you're good, he rewards you.
He's probably the closest thing to Jesus walking the earth.
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is.
He rewards those who knows when they are smiling when they're awake.
I think, really, if you want to make a deal, you have to do it with, you know...
Could Dr. Claus, in fact, be the wandering, quote, milkman?
Rumored to have fathered our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?
Well, we find it a very likely possibility from the falsified documents we have here.
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on Bob's feet.
You better watch out.
You better not...
You better not tell them, tell anyone.
St. Nicholas is coming to town.
Rumored to have fathered our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?
He's a broken man, this chocolate twas.
Gonna find out who's no longer in there.
St. Nicholas is coming to town.
Rumored to have fathered our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?
You better watch out.

He knows when you awake.
He knows when you're in bad or good.
So be goodness, goodness sake.
Oh, you better watch out.
You better not tell, you better not tell them, tell anyone.
St. Nicholas is coming to town.
Rumored to have fathered our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

And also the fluffy beard that often grew on our feet.

The Weirbobs and Ima, those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands.
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole.
Oh, friends, it's tough.
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.
You've got to send your money to the Santa Bob.
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids that Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.
Can you believe that?
The kids were asking if their parents, maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.
And the mom said,
No, no, he won't because he bills us.
We can't afford that.
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

You didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.
It was a wonderful

Christmas has lost its meaning.
Scott, you made your choice.
When you rejected my word,
you rejected me.

you have found

Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.
Dare I ask it? Yes.
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?
The answer? Yes, definitely.
Take that and shove it up the tube marked certainty,
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage.
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage.
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger,
and a slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger.

You know, see a subgenius has so much faith
that he not only can accept somebody making fun of Bob, stomping on a picture of Bob,
he'll do it himself!
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.
Now we subgenii, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,
but we subgenii may be bad, but our way of bad is holy!
is holy compared to the evil of some not all at all by any means but so many
American fundamentalist charismatic save evangelicals etc in general of course
they and their corresponding types in Iran Russia Libya South Africa etc if
you ask me are actually the ace of the devil's sleeve wolves and sheep's
clothing friends just like Jesus warned about my we're Jesus and Bob like we say
are old drinking buddies got nothing against Jesus it's just his fan club and
now we are saying that Bob is the ace of God's sleeve he's more like the smear on
God's handkerchief just like you or me but the uptight rival cults they don't
think God has a handkerchief I know cuz God's perfect he doesn't even sneeze
we're made in his image except that we have all these nasty parts attached to
us we have to go in the secret room
bathroom
do awful things but God he's clean and pure according to them oh and he's male
but he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do

O holy night, the stars are brightly shining, it is the night of our kiss and youth's birth. Long lay, long lay the world in terror and repining, the pit and the stone-bounded twelfth.
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices, beyond our grace, a new and glorious morn. Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices, oh night divine.
O night when Christ was born, O night, O night.
O night divine.
O night divine.
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here, or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob, as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures?
O night divine.

Something's up the chimney hole and Satan is his name.
Yeah.

Merry fucking Christmas!
