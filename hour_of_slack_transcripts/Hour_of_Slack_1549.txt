Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show, except
that actually it's not.
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays
and holy days and the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of salad.
Selling.
Selling.
Yes.
Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.
But anyway, happy whatever you do.
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.
It's cool, man.
Cool.
And praise Bob and the whole world.
Oh.

I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree.
Christmas tree.

Oh, yeah.
Right here.
Khai.
Look that gene!
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree
When this angel heard
A dreadful fear went right into my heart
Those pine tree needles sting me
Ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-ding-dong
You'll never know how much that smarts
So who put the stump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong
Who stood the wood where I boop-sheep-boop-sheep-boop
Who put the stick up my hip-a-dip-a-dip
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush
He made this angel beg for mercy, please
Too tight, too tight
Too tight, too tight
And I'm gonna say to you
It's already 9 p.m.
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him
Don't go walking down to the bar
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard
I mean, I'm gonna park my store and look at the credits
And in the right
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw, yeah
And I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells
Till I get to bed
I have chainsaw fixed and back in my arm the way it was Tuesday
Now you boys be good and I'll give you some of this here
Apple mango pie
You ain't no good of a child
That dog's running off with them brain cells
Can you do something about that, boy?
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right
No!

No!

No!











No!

No!
No!
No!

Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.
He's like a cowboy Santa.
How jolly.
Oh, Jazz is giving,
gives Dave the show pills.
Boy, I really need one of those.
What am I going to do about Laundromat and his suit, though?
I need the show bath.
The show de-lousing.
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.
That's enough of that.
Oh, he's got headphones.
I also have the part of my pancreas
that I'd like to show you now.
It's been increased in size to...
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.
Look, it's swelling.
I actually have the capability of a man
with 190 IQ's brain.
I'll put more pills out for everybody.
Oh, those pills.
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.
And my brain feel like it's a puddle
of liquefied crap.
I'm shocked by the...
The red pills are really good.
I like to take the red one and the blue one
at the same time.

We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.
It will empower this resistance.
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.
It will be a baller for kids.
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?
Good has lots of muscles.
Good.
Good!
The primitive Earth societies should accept this value judgment.
Good will have great physical attributes according to human desires.
Sexual.

The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.
Once upon a time.
There was the baby Jesus.
And he had two eyes made out of coal.
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.
And he wanted his two fingers.
And he had two front teeth.
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.
And he took all the presents from Whoville.
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys.
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy.
But he couldn't.
He wanted tens and twenties.
Tens and twenties.
Tens and twenties.
And.
He got McDonald's gift certificates.
And he got Zuzu's pedals.
And that's the Real Story of Christmas.

Bob Dobbs comes with rocket pipe, head launcher, jayner device, oligarchatism, fighting Jesus, and other action figures sold separately.
Some assembly required, batteries not included.
This toy falls apart in three days.
He-Bob and the Bastards of the Universe.
Too much is always better than not enough.
He-Bob and the Bastards of the Universe will be back after this message.
Santa Claus.
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas.
He wanted an electric train.
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up.
But he never got lucky.

He could picture the whole thing and he would dream so far that the whole thing would come to life way before his eyes.
For ainflux, the


was a pretty strong wisher.
And what he started wishing for
was a pretty fancy-looking train set
with locomotives and freight cars,
and a station and a gateman,
the mortar tower,
and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.
So grand that you might think
Tommy was wishing for something that just didn't exist.
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.
It is turnover.
The time of the year when all things sell,
the end of the year sale.
Oh, yeah.
So come and get it, everyone,
and just buy our products.
Now, are we...
I'm a little confused about
what Christmas is all about.
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus
or his death when they nailed him?
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.
But the present subgenie
tried to make sure that
we have our inventories cleared by now
and sell everything to the pigs.
Oh, yes.
Once a pagan holiday,
and now a shopping season.
And it was something else in between there.
Before it was...
After it was a pagan holiday
and before it was a...
a shopping...
a shopping season.
It was something else,
but I think they started a war over it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm trying to get a read 4 Kerala book page!



Thank you.
Thank you.
At your house, my friend, if you've been a bad subgenius or a halfway subgenius,
or if we keep getting tangled up in these other shows and having strange microphones.
How did that paternity suit ever turn out between Dobbs and Santa?
And who?
His dad.
Santa dog.
I don't know.
I don't think it was.
Yes, but St. Nicholas, this is fact,
St. Nicholas punched another bishop in the nose.
And bloodied his nose.
And sucked it.
Really?
The historical St. Nicholas?
Over the trinity of God.
The original St. Nicholas in Turkey?
I swear upon Bob.
Who the hell is God?
The heart.
I could tell you said God.
Who the hell is God?
Who the hell is God?
Ask Dobbs one day.
That's the question we should be asking.
Suddenly, a lightning.
Lightning bolt struck from nowhere on that bright sunny day.
Bob did a backflip and from that day on, he too was a believer.
And from the snowdrift truck, a little child bearing flowers emerged.
Chip, Chip, what else is on the TV show with St. Nicholas?
Sip, sicken.
The historical Santa Claus is originally lived, as the caller knows, as a bishop in, was it Constantinople?
I, yeah, like one of those.
Or it was an ancient Byzantium.
Asia Minor.
Yeah, Asia Minor in general, yeah.
Yes, he was, and he was, uh, he was known for sneaking into the rooms of young women
and leaving gifts.
Light-sized lumps of coal, complete with a fake beard and a CIA Wall Street credit card.
A saint he was, the girl said.
St. Nicholas invented the CIA.
That's good.
That's good.
You gotta.
You got it, brother.
Snuck into people's houses through the chimney.
You got it, brother.
They knew when they were sleeping.
They knew when, he knew when they were awake.
That, you got it, brother.
But like the CIA, he was.
That's Foucault, baby.
He was protecting them.
Foucault knew that St. Nick was a creeping, stinking spy.
What?
He knows when you've been sleeping.
He knows what you've been eating.
Hey, man, my kids still believe in St. Nicholas.
And who keeps that belief alive in their fevered, sick little brain?
In Madison Avenue, of course.
No, the surveillance community.
And Disney.
Under your direction.
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company.
Miller Bear.
He's a very powerful being.
If you're bad, he punishes you.
If you're good, he rewards you.
He's probably the closest thing to Jesus walking the earth.
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is.
He rewards those who knows when they are smiling when they're awake.
I think, I think really if you want to make a deal, you have to do it with, you know.
Could Dr. Claus in fact be the wandering, quote, milkman rumored to have fathered our savior,
JVR, J.R. Bob Dobbs?
Well, we find it a very likely possibility from the falsified documents we have here.
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on Bob's feet.
You better watch out.
You better not.
You better not.
I'm telling you why.
St. Nicholas is coming to town.
St. Nicholas.
St. Nicholas.
St. Nicholas is coming to town.
He knows when you awake.
He knows when you're in bad or good.
So be goodness, goodness sake.
Oh, you better watch out.
You better not.
You better not.
I'm telling you why.
St. Nicholas.
St. Nicholas is coming to town.
St. Nicholas.


Do you think I'm psycho, mama?
I've seen my ex last night.
Oh, I'm sorry.
We all saw Xmas last night.
At a Dancer Miller store.
A vision of Christmas that was dancing in Stank's head.
It would not lay for the little shig or plums and berries dropping toxic tears.
Shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck.
Shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck, shuck.
Shuck, shuck, shuck.
The poison in the plums.
Material plums.
Biological agents who only take 15%?
It's time for the Facts.
The Facts are back.
And now...
Oh, it's a great day, all right.
A salute to Mr. and Mrs. Iron Man.

Sometimes I think,
all that Santa crap's just bull.
Santa Claus is real.
Santa Claus is real.
Who's the head man?
Santa Claus.
Santa Claus.
He was a huge, beastly,
bulging man.
He was so real,
how come we didn't get squat last year?
Yes, the birth of the baby Satan
on July 4th.
And now you can have it all,
all pure 100% vinyl chloride CID.
The birth of our baby Satan
as told by various authors
and eclectic scholars
from around the globular unit.
Including that announcer.
This announcement has not been
a perfunctory announcement,
but an announcement of the blessed
anointment and birthday of our Lord
Jesus Christ.
For one bright Christmas morning
was born in a cradle
to a rich man's family.
The Rave Jesus.
Oh, I know the Rave Jesus.
I'm partying with the Rave Jesus.

The Weirbobs and Ima, those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands.
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole.
Oh, friends, it's tough.
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob.
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids that Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.
Can you believe that?
The kids were asking if their parents, maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.
And the mom said, no, no, he won't because he bills us.
We can't afford that.
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

The tale-bearer will be at the judgment.
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.
Dare I ask it? Yes.
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?
The answer? Yes, definitely.
Take that and shove it up the tube, mark certainty,
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.
Merry Christmas!
Merry Christmas to all!
Now you're all gonna die!
The night Santa went crazy,
the night Saint Nick went insane.
Realized he'd been getting the wrong deal,
something finally must have snapped in his brain.
Well, the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it.
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet,
and he tied up his helpers.
And he held the elves hostage,
and he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage.
He got dancer and prancer with an old German Luger,
and he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger.
And he picked up a flamethrower and a barbecue blitzer,
and he took a big bite and said it tastes just like chicken.
The night Santa went crazy,
the night Kris Kringle went nuts.
Now you're all gonna die,
you can't hardly walk around the North Pole
without stepping in reindeer guts.
There's the National Guard and the FBI.
There's a van from the eye witness news,
and helicopters circling round in the sky.
And the bullets are flying,
the body counts rising,
and everyone's dying to know,
who sent them why.
My, my, my, my, my, my,
you used to be such a jolly guy.
But now you're gonna be good,
for goodness sake.
You better watch out.
You better not cry.
You better not pout.
I'm telling you why.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Santa Claus is coming to town.
Have yourself an Advance Dogmatic Christmas,
a song thing called Santa is Coming by F. Gillespie and F. J. Coote.
ElectricElf at Loop.com can tell you more about that.
But now...
Who gave the Lord the claptrap?
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind?
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season.
The time of the Lord, of the fact that...
How many before you reach your limit?
How many do you get?
Jesuses?
Yeah, how many can you bag?
How many messiahs can you bag?
Hail Jesuses.
If you're doing it in season...
If you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit.
Oh, you never do...
And you can only take one.
You never bag the Lord in C.
You bag the Lord in B-flat so you get that kind of rough sound.
But when they're in season, it's every God for himself.
This is the season for the fighting Jesus.
Obviously.
We are between Iraq.
And a hard place.
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea in the old age
and he got a very, very hard foot?
And he got elephantages of the rectum.
You know, it's not something well known by many Christian scholars.
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was...
I kind of like those stories where the Lord dies
and then comes here to America and settles, you know, tames the West.
I like when he moves into a trailer park and...
I like the cowboy's problem.
He's a dog.
He's a dog.
Jesus fought for the Confederate army.
The ranger.
I like the Texas ranger.
Jesus, Texas ranger.
Johnny Ripple was a Jesus.
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police, for maybe the Hopi police force.
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus.
He was the white brother who came to instruct the Indians how to be liberal.
Well, what about old peacemaker, the Jesus of the Iroquois,
who was actually Huron, a Huron.
You didn't know that, did you?
I got you.
I got you.
I got you.


Elrond.
I got a Jesus like no other Jesus you've ever seen.
Oh, it tastes like butter.
A new Jesus.
A different Jesus.
It tastes like clapping pie, children.
A future Jesus.

A pipe-smoking Jesus.
Dave, you know where it is.
Go kick that window open.
I already kicked it.
I'll kick it again, though.
Kick it good this time.
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God.
We hope that...
We thank you for all the nice things that you've done for us this Thanksgiving.
Clapping.
We appreciate all that.
And we're just trying to insult your fan club.
That's all.
That's why we do this blasphemy stuff.
But we knew that you knew that because you're in all things and everything, right, Jesus?
Right.
I could hear him say that.
Praise God and Bob and Jesus.

The greatest, scary Christmas song ever, friends, from his new album,
Don't Trust aspiration.
The credibility of his album, don't trust огром不是在你, James Kochalka Superstar.
A subgenius has so much faith,
that he not only can accept someone making fun of Bob on a picture,
he'll do it himself.
He has so much trust in the mystery of Jane Austen and the嚇死 under the mountain,

Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.
Now, we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,
but we subgeni may be bad, but our way of bad is holy, is holy compared to the evil of so many,
not all, by any means, but so many American fundamentalists, charismatics, evangelicals, etc., in general.
Of course, they and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya, South Africa, etc.,
if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about.
We're, Jesus and Bob, like we say, are old drinking buddies.
Got nothing against Jesus.
It's just his fan club.
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.
He's more like the smear on God's head.
Handkerchief, just like you or me.
But the uptight rival cults, they don't think God has a handkerchief.
Uh-uh, no, because God's perfect.
He doesn't even sneeze.
We're made in his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us,
and we have to go in the secret room, the bathroom, to do awful things.
But God, oh, he's clean and pure, according to them.
Oh, and he's male.
But he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff.
We don't take stuff out of him like we do, because we sin.
Oh, yeah, we all sin.
We're bad.
We're worthless.
We're no good to God, unless we sign a contract with his agent.
We interrupt this program for a special promotional announcement.
Returns.
E-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.

Thank you.
