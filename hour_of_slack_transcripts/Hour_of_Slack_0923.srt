🎵 La, la, la, hour of slack 🎵

8
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:52,000
Ah, you see, you see, my ears didn't work, uh, because this fuse had blown and these wires had broken and so forth, but I was able to reach into my little tool kit here and find not only the tools and the special attachments that I needed to get my hearing going again, but also...

9
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,340
Ah, he's reading from a damn script.

10
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,300
The news!

11
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:55,560
No, it was...

12
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:06,260
I read the news. I went to the trouble of actually looking at the news before I came in to do the show, and they have discovered the largest known prime number.

13
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:12,060
Yes, the largest known prime number has been discovered over a godzillion.

14
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:21,160
Uh, it's so large that it took two hundred and eleven... two hundred and eleven thousand computers working together on the internet.

15
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,700
This one kid in Wisconsin or someplace was the... happened to be the one.

16
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:31,680
The one kid on the computer that got the answer that took so long to calculate since the last prime number.

17
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:44,960
A number 6.3 million digits long that would take, uh, fifteen hundred pages to write out.

18
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:47,260
That's a big number.

19
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,480
That is a big, big number.

20
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,580
That's a primal... that's the largest primal number, and it is the number of inches.

21
00:01:55,580 --> 00:02:01,460
Of the primal member, of the primal epoped J.R. Bob Dobbs in length.

22
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,800
That is the size of his love for you, dear listener.

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,380
Uh, yes.

24
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,700
Yes, yes, yes.

25
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:20,220
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is singing in the background this love song.

26
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:22,180
So sweet.

27
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,080
To the listener.

28
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,200
I'm singing it.

29
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,800
Oh, that's not Dave.

30
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,480
That's a record.

31
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:29,100
I'm sorry.

32
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:34,280
It sounded... it sounded... uh, look.

33
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:36,800
Poor Dave's ears are broken now.

34
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,560
Why, maybe it's something contagious.

35
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:43,640
Maybe it's something that just listening to this show...

36
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,720
A virus of pinkness.

37
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,780
A virus of pinkness.

38
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:53,520
Friends, we just came back weeks ago, actually, from numerous devivals.

39
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,580
The, uh, Detroit...

40
00:02:55,580 --> 00:03:02,040
The D-Vival, or the D-Trovivital, I like to call it, uh, was a fantastic success with

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:07,840
Mann, uh, the Christ Punchers, uh, the Amino Acids, and, uh, and the Jollies.

42
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,680
It was most jolly, and we had the Beachland Ballroom Show, uh, with, uh, Einstein's Secret

43
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,400
Orchestra and Lonesome Cowboy Dave, with backup babe singers, uh, Princess Wee and Reverend

44
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,760
Cinzia, and, uh, also numerous...

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,560
numerous...

46
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,220
new ranters, uh, and some... in some cases, not exactly so new.

47
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,440
Uh, the young Reverend Pisces delivered a great rant about Connie, and, uh, the dynamic

48
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:41,880
Reverend Carter LeBlanc did, uh, a wonderful 15-minute stretch, and, uh, we'll be hearing

49
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:49,280
lots of live D-Vival show, uh, tonight, and, uh, plus little bits and pieces of, uh, Norrell

50
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,940
Preff, uh, and now...

51
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,220
Mann.

52
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:53,960
Mann.

53
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,000
Mann.

54
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,420
Mann.

55
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,400
Mann.

56
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:10,840
Mann.

57
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:11,780
Mann.

58
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,020
Um...

59
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,540
What the fuck am I...

60
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:34,700
supposed to be if I'm not supposed to do what I do

61
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,860
fuck am I supposed to say if I'm not supposed to say what I say

62
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,760
What the fuck am I supposed to fuck if I'm not supposed to fuck what I fuck?

63
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,160
And the only booze on Sunday is the blood of Christ

64
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,880
Goddamn the Christians

65
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,420
Goddamn the Christians

66
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,080
Goddamn the Christians

67
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,640
Goddamn the Christians

68
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:38,060
Goddamn the Christians

69
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:39,780
Goddamn the Christians

70
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,420
Goddamn the Christians

71
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:52,840
God damn the Christians

72
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,000
God damn the Christians

73
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,580
and fuck the fucker up

74
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,260
if you care to do so.

75
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,000
Thank y'all.

76
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,340
I need to speak to you about a few things

77
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:50,960
tonight.

78
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,860
I know the evening is winding down.

79
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,260
Those of you who care are drunk.

80
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,600
Those of you who don't are probably drunk too.

81
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,720
But, uh,

82
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,480
I have, uh,

83
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,380
I have just a few

84
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,460
points I want to touch on because right now

85
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,960
we are dwelling in

86
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,300
what, uh, what I, what seems

87
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,280
to me to be the hour of

88
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,560
strong delusions. It's a time

89
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,540
of delirium.

90
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,320
Time of

91
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,280
denial. It's a time of

92
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,540
blindness and self-deception. It's a time

93
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:24,340
where a lie is

94
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,320
being told to all of the

95
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,240
people all of the time.

96
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,220
And it starts when you're young.

97
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,360
You know? You try

98
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,160
to do things the way you're told.

99
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,220
You try to follow the rules, maybe.

100
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,440
Just to, just to figure out what the

101
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,440
hell is going on. You know, just to,

102
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,440
just to, just to try to

103
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,340
make sense of what all the grown-ups are telling

104
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,620
you. But the more you try to comprehend

105
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,300
what those grown-ups are telling

106
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,420
you, the more you start to see

107
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,660
the contradictions, the more frustrating

108
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:54,400
it gets. Because you start to

109
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,140
realize that all of these people

110
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:58,460
are lying. And they're not just lying

111
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,420
to you. They're lying to themselves

112
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,100
all the time.

113
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:04,500
And, and

114
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,300
and it, it, it starts to make you,

115
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,380
you know, angry. You know? You start to get

116
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,500
frustrated. You, you start to realize

117
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,600
the cards are stacked against you.

118
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,840
You feel violent urges.

119
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,660
You want to smash things.

120
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,480
You know? You want to maybe be a punk

121
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,880
rocker. Or you want to be an anarchist.

122
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,460
Or a thug. Or a gangbanger.

123
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,740
Or maybe you want to be a hooligan.

124
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,280
Or maybe you want to be a hacker.

125
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,960
Or a terrorist. Or whatever.

126
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,520
But, but, but you know that the

127
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,680
people that make you feel this way,

128
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:35,480
these people are outside of your reach.

129
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,440
And the things that they do, they're not just

130
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,340
things that they care about. Maybe those are the things

131
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,340
you can touch. So you try and throw a brick

132
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:42,380
through a bank window. Or maybe you try

133
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,240
to kick the shit out of a yuppie.

134
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,440
Or maybe you try to throw some pipe bombs

135
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,460
and some mailboxes out in the midwest.

136
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,500
But that's no good either.

137
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:52,660
Because they've been waiting for that.

138
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:56,220
They've been telling each other

139
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,500
for years that you're just the sort

140
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:00,440
of person that's bound to

141
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,040
do that sort of thing eventually.

142
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,340
That's why they keep files

143
00:09:04,340 --> 00:09:06,020
on you is because they

144
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:08,280
want to see it coming before you do.

145
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,380
And they know how to handle violence.

146
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:12,660
They understand violence.

147
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,480
They have ways

148
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,920
of dealing with violence.

149
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,920
Because your violence

150
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,780
can only be retail.

151
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:22,260
And them, they've got the corner

152
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,740
on the wholesale market.

153
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,180
So maybe you try to play the game.

154
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,360
You go the other direction. You get a decent

155
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,400
job. You get married. You open a

156
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,560
bank account. You approve your credit rating.

157
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,400
You vote. You buy a house.

158
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,280
You go back to college. You

159
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,380
maybe even

160
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,400
work somewhere peaceful

161
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,740
like a community college

162
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:42,700
library.

163
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,480
Maybe you even get to

164
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,640
start your own business.

165
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,180
Or maybe you get to get paid to do

166
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,880
something you like like playing music

167
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,280
or write creatively. Or maybe

168
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,280
you get involved with a cause that you believe in

169
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:00,220
like environmentalism or drug

170
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:02,500
legalization or the peace movement.

171
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,200
But eventually one of two

172
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,440
things is going to happen to you.

173
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,460
You're either going to stop

174
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,360
feeling or you're

175
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,680
not going to stop feeling.

176
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:14,040
And you know when you stop feeling

177
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:16,220
well you got to do something.

178
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,340
You know something that will provoke a

179
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,080
reaction. You know maybe

180
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,780
you try psychedelic drugs.

181
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,300
Maybe you try pornography. Maybe you try

182
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,220
new age religions. Maybe you try

183
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,480
paganism, comic books, art,

184
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,200
philosophy, food,

185
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:32,120
casual sex, whatever.

186
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:34,360
Or maybe you're from

187
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,440
the other school. Maybe you're

188
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:36,560
from the other school. Maybe you

189
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,060
still feel too much.

190
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,580
Maybe you need to numb yourself

191
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:43,200
so you try drugs, pornography,

192
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,980
new age religions, paganism,

193
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,760
comic books, art,

194
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:50,220
philosophy, food, casual

195
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,360
sex, whatever. What is

196
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,380
it that you want all along?

197
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,780
You want one thing.

198
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,000
You want slack.

199
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,340
Where's your slack at tonight?

200
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,500
Because mine,

201
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,440
mine's right here.

202
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:06,420
And

203
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,220
you may not have slack right now

204
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,200
but you better know that you need

205
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,060
slack tonight.

206
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,820
The subgenius,

207
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,260
we all know the subgenius

208
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,920
must have

209
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:18,920
slack.

210
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,100
But it's the eternal

211
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,340
paradox because you can't get slack

212
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,580
just by slacking off.

213
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,900
Any goddamn

214
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:30,140
pink boy with a semi-functional

215
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:32,360
brain stem can sit on the couch

216
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,340
like a lump of dog shit.

217
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,320
If you're gonna

218
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,260
make the effort to pull the wool

219
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,880
over your own eyes

220
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,000
for the sake of

221
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,280
all those little subgenius

222
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,160
children that are trying to

223
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:50,040
figure out why adults lie

224
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,060
all the time,

225
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:54,260
be honest with yourself about it.

226
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,360
I'm gonna say that again. I mumble sometimes.

227
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,320
I want to make this clear. If you're

228
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,260
gonna lie to yourself, at

229
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:02,380
least be honest with yourself about

230
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:04,020
it. Because if you're

231
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,260
okay with where you're at,

232
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:07,940
with who you are, with what you're doing,

233
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:12,100
at least take the time to

234
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,100
tell yourself the things you

235
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,420
tell yourself to make yourself believe. At least

236
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,020
have the balls to say

237
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:20,020
give me false slack

238
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,340
or kill me.

239
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,760
Come on, say it!

240
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,860
Give me false slack or kill me!

241
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,420
Who's gonna say that?

242
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,940
Come on. You know, people are like,

243
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,160
oh, Reverend Carter, you gotta

244
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,080
admit, false slack

245
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,180
is better than no slack.

246
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,180
You're all bullshit!

247
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:40,240
False slack

248
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,340
is no slack

249
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,420
at all!

250
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:46,940
Slack!

251
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,300
Slack is like the square root of negative

252
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,020
one, and false slack

253
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,060
is zero! No

254
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:56,420
amount of false slack added

255
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,280
to or multiplied by

256
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:00,300
any other amount of false

257
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,960
slack can ever

258
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:03,880
equal anything but

259
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,380
nothing! Nothing at all!

260
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,160
You will never get enough

261
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,340
false slack, and that's what

262
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,140
we're after, right?

263
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,020
We're after

264
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,480
too much.

265
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,400
And you can't get enough false slack,

266
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,040
much less too much.

267
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,400
A friend of mine used

268
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,380
to say, nothing exceeds

269
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,860
like excess.

270
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,300
Well, you know, it's hard to know

271
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,260
when you've got enough, but

272
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,260
you can usually tell when you've got too

273
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:34,080
much. There's enough

274
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,260
ambiguity in the world

275
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,340
today, and

276
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,060
too much is

277
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,960
not an ambiguous concept.

278
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,060
We all know what too much is,

279
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,260
and I bet you a lot of people here

280
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:50,080
would, just to be safe, like

281
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,720
just a little bit more,

282
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,360
just to be sure, because

283
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:54,800
I mean,

284
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,100
slack

285
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,620
too much,

286
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:02,200
that's not when the vending machine

287
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,260
gives you an extra bag of

288
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,380
M&M's. That might be more than

289
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,140
you deserve, but

290
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,660
that's not

291
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,400
too much.

292
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,140
Too much is when the

293
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,300
things that life gives you

294
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,640
are so real,

295
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,660
they're so overwhelming,

296
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:21,820
so rich,

297
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:23,980
so full, so

298
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:26,200
amazing, and rewarding,

299
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,200
and funny as shit,

300
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,340
and maybe it knocks you down, or maybe it wakes

301
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:32,480
you up, maybe it blows your fucking mind,

302
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:33,620
but maybe,

303
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,960
maybe you even get to experience something

304
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:36,840
so intense,

305
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,360
and so startling,

306
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,480
that it suddenly makes you

307
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,340
see through all that

308
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,340
other bullshit, and get

309
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,380
one good look

310
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,080
at the face of your true desire,

311
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:52,180
and that is a pretty

312
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:54,360
clear sign that you're not

313
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,080
dealing with false slack

314
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:56,940
anymore.

315
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,280
And that's what I'm here to talk

316
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,540
about. What is your true desire?

317
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,240
What

318
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,220
do you want to the exclusion

319
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:07,680
of all else?

320
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,120
If you're tired

321
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,740
of getting by

322
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,220
with your weekly pat

323
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,060
on the back, your nine

324
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,800
lives, tuna casserole,

325
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,960
you're gonna need a bigger piece

326
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,420
of wool

327
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,820
to pull over your own eyes.

328
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,100
Once you decide

329
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,920
that you want that big old

330
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,760
juicy chunk of raw,

331
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,580
unadulterated slack,

332
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,880
once you know you want it,

333
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,140
well they're gonna have to kill you to

334
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,540
stop you, right?

335
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,500
Just give me slack,

336
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,100
or kill me!

337
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,360
And nobody here is gonna

338
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,120
get killed over some piece of crap

339
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,640
they bought at a mall, right?

340
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:50,760
We're all smarter than that, we're subgeniuses,

341
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:51,860
but we're not stupid.

342
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,160
It's like

343
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,180
collecting coins,

344
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:58,140
or antiques, or comic

345
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,080
books, or old ceramic

346
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,560
insulators from the

347
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:03,060
power lines.

348
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,620
These things are only worth

349
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:08,180
what you're willing to pay for them.

350
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,460
And you're selling yourself

351
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,360
short, if the

352
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,680
things that matter to you

353
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,740
are things that you can pay for.

354
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,980
Bob Dobbs,

355
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,580
Bob Dobbs makes a million dollars

356
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,540
every time he fucks up.

357
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:24,540
I fuck up every day.

358
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,100
Where's my million dollars?

359
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,580
Hell, if I could get one dollar,

360
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,480
one dollar for every time I

361
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,580
fucked up, I'd have something, wouldn't I?

362
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:34,180
Come on!

363
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:35,560
You can do that?

364
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:38,420
Stupid people make

365
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,580
money all the time.

366
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,280
It's not that hard.

367
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,460
What's your excuse?

368
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,420
Reverend, Reverend,

369
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,320
Reverend Carter LeBlanc, dear

370
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,000
friends, and now

371
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,180
man.

372
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,040
Are you late again?

373
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,680
Get back to work.

374
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:14,080
I want that on my desk right now.

375
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:15,640
Have you been drinking?

376
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,260
Give me those figures.

377
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:18,800
Read the memo.

378
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,080
Get back to your cubicles.

379
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,160
This will affect your performance review.

380
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,200
And you think you

381
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,640
deserve a raise?

382
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,420
You're fired!

383
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:30,740
You're fired!

384
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,240
We wanted someone

385
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:40,360
who's intelligent, highly motivated,

386
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,380
creative,

387
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,900
yet flaccid and gullible.

388
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,320
I share my profits,

389
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:49,640
pay your rent,

390
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:51,020
feed your kids,

391
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:54,500
put the fat on your ass and the gas in your car.

392
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,220
And you think you

393
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:59,660
deserve a raise?

394
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:00,660
You're fired!

395
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,280
And you think you deserve

396
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,180
a raise?

397
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:06,040
You're fired!

398
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,680
Fired!

399
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,240
And he feels so fine in his

400
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:15,540
brand new red suit.

401
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:18,320
He's ready to take his sleigh out for a ride now.

402
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,340
He's ready to join the new Iraqi

403
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,560
army. But he's going to be interrogating

404
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,260
those elves and dropping them off at high

405
00:18:24,260 --> 00:18:26,060
altitudes if they don't give him the correct

406
00:18:26,060 --> 00:18:26,540
coordinates.

407
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,820
He's that kind of guy.

408
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,240
They don't give him cream corn either.

409
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,140
He's Lambo.

410
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,020
Baby, where'd you get those coordinates?

411
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,260
I'll never tell.

412
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:40,100
I think it looks like 15 south

413
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,700
to west. Wow.

414
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,560
That's a number.

415
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,940
My compass is going wild!

416
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:48,360
Look at mine's pointing all the

417
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,640
way due north.

418
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:52,000
The magnetic poles have shifted.

419
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:53,420
Your compass is in control, young man.

420
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,380
We can't. The poles have changed.

421
00:18:56,780 --> 00:18:57,260
Yes.

422
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:59,220
What was once right is wrong.

423
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,700
And what was once

424
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,920
good is now evil

425
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,900
and vice versa.

426
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,780
What was once frozen is now laid to waste.

427
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,800
What was once helium is now

428
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:09,460
toothpaste.

429
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:12,160
Once that was... Oh, never mind.

430
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,240
I'm sorry.

431
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:16,920
Wait a minute. Can you get some helium?

432
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,600
Oh yeah. I've

433
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,180
got the scores on helium.

434
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,560
That stuff that you rub on your teeth?

435
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:24,160
No, you don't necessarily have to rub it on your teeth.

436
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,840
You just open up the bottom of the balloon

437
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,920
and you just run your nostril

438
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,860
and you very gently puff on it.

439
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:31,620
And...

440
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,920
And then what happens?

441
00:19:36,060 --> 00:19:37,480
I'm at a loss for words now.

442
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,100
I know that something inside your head

443
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:40,900
explodes and has to be replaced

444
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:41,420
there.

445
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,280
That doesn't really sound like fun.

446
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,680
It's not fun.

447
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:49,080
It's part of a learning experience we all

448
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,640
have to go through, starting with you.

449
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,880
Don't they give you some kind of medication for that?

450
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:55,360
Isn't the medication actually pretty fun?

451
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:57,020
Well, it's much worse, though, than the

452
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,300
actual helium nostrils.

453
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:00,900
Like, for days and days afterwards,

454
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,860
you can't defecate, you can't fornicate,

455
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,520
and you can't spatulate. You can't...

456
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh, give me a break, Dave. You can't do any of those things

457
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,080
with the time anyway.

458
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,780
Yeah, but see, any words that end with 8 can't be done.

459
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,220
You can't confiscate,

460
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,180
you can't masturbate, you can't

461
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,200
do any of those words that end

462
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,140
with the letter 8. Or it's a number, I think.

463
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:21,300
Oh, there's not much

464
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:23,240
left to be confused about anymore.

465
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,120
Well, Dave, you should

466
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,240
count your blessings that you're not afflicted by

467
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,300
with that right this minute.

468
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,620
I'm counting my hairs, and I'm also counting

469
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,380
concepts that I'm throwing out the window for New Year's.

470
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:35,060
A concept, a

471
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,780
sentence! That is the goal!

472
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:38,420
Oh, damn, I just blew it.

473
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:42,980
Hey, look at your lips. They're all frozen.

474
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,160
Somebody...

475
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:45,380
What?

476
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:48,860
Now, when we talk about the exes, the men from Planet X,

477
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,600
we're not talking about them little UFO

478
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,960
piddly shits, you know.

479
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,140
We're not talking about these little guys

480
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:57,100
who crash saucers and rods

481
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,400
and stuff like that.

482
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,020
The masters will come back and

483
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:01,380
save us!

484
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,420
What the hell is wrong?

485
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,060
Now, see, the devil,

486
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,940
the devil gets into the equipment.

487
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,760
This is nothing but a simple...

488
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:14,160
Wait a minute.

489
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,120
Now, it could sit down, friends,

490
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,640
before we jump to conclusions, remember,

491
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,520
I am a subgenius.

492
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,960
Fuck Bill Gates!

493
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,620
Oh, really?

494
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,240
Now, what did Bill Gates ever do to

495
00:21:27,260 --> 00:21:28,900
you to deserve such a wonderful

496
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,140
activity as fucking you?

497
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,040
He gave you a bar of

498
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:33,480
slack!

499
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:37,080
Actually, you know, you know the weird thing is

500
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,760
I sometimes wonder about Bill Gates.

501
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,480
I sometimes go, what if

502
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,060
that guy was somebody who sent me a

503
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,000
buck in 1981

504
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:46,340
and

505
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,880
I didn't, like,

506
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,260
address it right

507
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,040
and it didn't get to him. And he was

508
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:54,820
a subgenius. He could have been saved.

509
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,140
But, that one little

510
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,700
chance thing didn't happen.

511
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:01,300
Maybe I dropped the ball. Maybe the postman dropped the ball.

512
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,400
Maybe he never even sent in

513
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,160
that dollar. Maybe he ripped us

514
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,240
off and stole it. Maybe that's

515
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,140
where his fortune began. We just don't

516
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,580
know. You can't know

517
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,620
who is a pink and who is a subgenius.

518
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,020
Only Bob knows

519
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:17,080
that! So don't you go spiting

520
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,800
your fellow bipeds

521
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,260
thinking that somehow they... I actually heard

522
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,120
a person say to me

523
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:25,360
it's

524
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,520
he said

525
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:28,860
and he was a good liberal

526
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:31,320
he said, well, you know the thing about conservatives

527
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,700
is they're just not

528
00:22:33,660 --> 00:22:35,200
quite as human as we

529
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,120
are. And I thought to

530
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,560
myself, well, my God,

531
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,980
I guess the end justifies the means.

532
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,840
I guess it's alright

533
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:44,920
if, I guess

534
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,400
one side of the conspiracy

535
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,200
is better than the other

536
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,300
side of the conspiracy. Jesus!

537
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,980
Well, I don't want to get into that, friends.

538
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,040
Fuck them if they

539
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,260
can't take a joke, friends.

540
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,380
The thing is, though,

541
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:01,260
I mean, those

542
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,980
exes, those men from Planet X,

543
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:04,500
to them,

544
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:06,920
the difference between

545
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:08,600
George Bush

546
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,980
and Al Gore is

547
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:13,160
they just don't see that they're

548
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:15,160
just all a bunch of monkeys to them. In fact,

549
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,220
it's like roaches. It's like looking

550
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,880
at a bunch of roaches. When the

551
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,100
exes get here, they're gonna look

552
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:23,240
around and go, well, hell, we thought there was

553
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,960
somebody going to be here, but there's nobody here

554
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,420
but bugs, just insects.

555
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,900
Shit! Oh, well,

556
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:31,020
I guess us space men,

557
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:32,720
us exes, we'll just take this water,

558
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,420
these icebergs, we'll just skim these oceans

559
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:37,140
off this useless ball of

560
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,060
rock, maybe suck off

561
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,100
some of the magma, the mineral

562
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,680
rich magma, oh yes,

563
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,360
and the gold, and the diamonds,

564
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,480
yes, and the rubies, and the emeralds,

565
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,200
and Princess Wee, and

566
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,060
Bob, the Bob, if they have

567
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:53,360
one, and then they'll

568
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,260
notice that one little pipe-smoking

569
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:56,760
roach down there,

570
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,180
oh, it's you, Bob. We thought

571
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,520
you were just one of those useless

572
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,820
fighting roaches down there.

573
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,480
Not Bob!

574
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,640
What? What's that you say, Bob?

575
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,380
You want us to leave the oceans?

576
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:11,160
And the magma?

577
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:13,080
What? Bob, you

578
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,100
want us to leave the diamonds too?

579
00:24:15,680 --> 00:24:17,100
Well, what the hell are you

580
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,260
gonna give us in return, Mr. J.R.

581
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:19,840
Bob-Dot?

582
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,980
Your souls! Oh!

583
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:23,980
Souls!

584
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,240
You're gonna give us

585
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,580
some souls!

586
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,060
Well, okay then, souls!

587
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,760
It's a deal, because

588
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:34,900
souls are the

589
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:37,160
one commodity of true value

590
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,840
to the exes and

591
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,020
to us subgeniuses. Why? Because souls

592
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:43,260
are made of time, and time

593
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,020
is the only thing worth a shit!

594
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:47,060
Time, sales, and

595
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,760
souls! The whole idea

596
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,120
is to milk as much slack as you

597
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,020
can get from the limited, pathetic

598
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:55,120
time that you have. And

599
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,960
friends, it could be really pathetic

600
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,540
if you've decided to kill yourself.

601
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,360
And that might be a good idea,

602
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,280
but I suggest you

603
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:04,260
wait until

604
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:05,660
X day!

605
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:09,460
That is the one message of this stinking,

606
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,920
ridiculous, little pathetic

607
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,200
church. If nothing else

608
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,100
sinks in, don't kill yourself

609
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:16,780
until X day. Sure,

610
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,120
it's miserable, life is fucked, you're in

611
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,220
chronic pain, go ahead and plan to

612
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,480
kill yourself, but

613
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:25,140
what's the hurry? Bob's

614
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,880
gonna do it anyway for you.

615
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,740
Let him do it! Why

616
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,820
hurry the process along? Well, cause

617
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:32,220
you're miserable, yeah right, but

618
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,740
just wait until X day.

619
00:25:34,820 --> 00:25:37,040
X day is what? July 5th.

620
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:39,040
Surely this year, we ain't gonna

621
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,420
let the Mormons or Jehovah's

622
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,740
Witnesses out kook us.

623
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:43,780
Huh!

624
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,780
Absolutely not.

625
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,480
While they're waiting,

626
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,160
we might as be working the

627
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,500
Rubenburger!

628
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:38,180
Thank you.

629
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:11,180
Thank you.

630
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:32,520
Thank you.

631
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:01,980
Thank you.

632
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:42,080
Thank you.

633
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,540
Thank you.

634
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,840
Thank you.

635
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,260
Thank you.

636
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,900
Thank you.

637
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,740
Thank you.

638
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:44,480
Thank you.

639
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,280
Thank you.

640
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,120
He's gargling in German.

641
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:31,040
He's a secret spy for the Oriental police.

642
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,800
It's not one of ours.

643
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:39,920
And those of you who are not prepared or aware must take the golden vow now.

644
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:44,520
You will fight for something holy, whatever that might be.

645
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,400
Well, I can't agree with Reverend Stang that the world is a monster club.

646
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:25,160
I can't agree with Reverend Stang that the world is a monster club.

647
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:33,180
I know I'm medicated, but I know things are gonna be all right.

648
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:40,140
I called 911, had some cereal, and I cried.

649
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:47,580
This world is a monster club, and it must be well.

650
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:54,780
There's plenty of crazy things, terror, love, or scare.

651
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:11,500
There's plenty of crazy things, terror, love, or scare.

652
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:16,740
Baby, I thought I saw a mummy crawling on my tummy and inside.

653
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:18,840
You're crazy.

654
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,580
It might be in my head, but baby, I don't want to wind up dead.

655
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,080
Baby.

656
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:31,320
I swear I saw the werewolf drinking from my toilet last night.

657
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:33,220
Crazy.

658
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,860
I know I saw it, baby.

659
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,880
Hold my head, I'm gonna be all right.

660
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,760
This world is a monster club, and it must be well.

661
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:53,120
There's plenty of crazy things, terror, love, or scare.

662
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,160
Baby.

663
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:22,520
I thought I saw a werewolf staring through my window last night.

664
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:24,460
Crazy.

665
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:27,060
I thought I saw a vampire.

666
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:27,240
I know I saw a werewolf staring through my window last night.

667
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,060
I drank it from my toilet last night.

668
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:31,880
Baby.

669
00:34:32,360 --> 00:34:37,160
I know I'm medicated, I'll come back one morning and feel all right.

670
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:38,780
Crazy.

671
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,880
I know I might seem crazy.

672
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,900
I'm not.

673
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:48,480
This world's a monster club.

674
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,020
Thank you for watching this video.

675
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:55,120
Best kids and men in high school.

676
00:34:55,620 --> 00:34:56,260
I'm out.

677
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,220
Bye.

678
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


679
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


680
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


681
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


682
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


683
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


684
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


685
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


686
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


687
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


688
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


689
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


690
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


691
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


692
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


693
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


694
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


695
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


696
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:57,220


697
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:27,240


698
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,360
I'll see you next time.

699
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,880
Bye.

700
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,380
Bye.

701
00:35:46,220 --> 00:35:46,220


702
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:46,340
Bye.

703
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:46,540
Bye.

704
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:46,540


705
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:55,900
You crazy.

706
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,660
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

707
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:02,840
And now...

708
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:04,440
What is this, March?

709
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,320
It is March, yes.

710
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:08,840
Is this coming up on the Ides?

711
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,220
This would be the Ides.

712
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:10,580
Wow.

713
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:11,480
Wow, indeed.

714
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:12,920
Well, just past the Ides.

715
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,180
Hey, it's the Ides of March.

716
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:14,840
It is.

717
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,120
Yo.

718
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,640
How could that have relevance to war?

719
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,340
Well, let's see.

720
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,200
They stabbed Caesar in the back.

721
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,940
That was the Senate.

722
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,500
They did?

723
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:24,840
After banning partial birth abortions.

724
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:25,160
Right.

725
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:29,960
Then Colin Powell coerced the Senate to...

726
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,100
Spank him on public TV.

727
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:36,860
And then Rome fell because of all the sodomy that ensued.

728
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,260
And there was war when that happened.

729
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:40,260
Rome fell, Rumsfeld.

730
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,780
That's right, Rumsfeld.

731
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,680
And then there was the Dark Ages,

732
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,780
where basically...

733
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,540
It was just sodomy all the time.

734
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,680
So tonight we're going to be discussing sodomy.

735
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:49,940
And all it...

736
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:50,560
Oh, no.

737
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,740
Tonight we're talking about war.

738
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,540
What's it good for?

739
00:36:53,560 --> 00:36:54,720
Sodomy in the trenches.

740
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,220
So anyway,

741
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:06,080
the Ides of March and these topsy-turvy times

742
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:09,320
compel me to ramble about something

743
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,740
I've been reluctant to mention

744
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,080
for fear of...

745
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:14,400
Well...

746
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:15,800
A jinx.

747
00:37:16,620 --> 00:37:19,540
I speak, of course, of the Curse of Tecumseh.

748
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:24,040
You see, President Harrison, elected in 1840,

749
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,100
like many of our early presidents,

750
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,080
was a big Indian killer,

751
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,320
which, long story short,

752
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:35,000
led to a curse being placed upon him by Tecumseh.

753
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,700
President Harrison was the first president to die in office,

754
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:44,200
contracting pneumonia secondary to the Indian Curse.

755
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,320
A fluke took a step towards becoming a trend

756
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,880
with Abraham Lincoln,

757
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,280
who was elected in 1860

758
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,060
and then re-elected in 1864.

759
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,760
But not for long.

760
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:02,420
A Catholic cabal struck him down on April 14th of 1865.

761
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,640
In 1880,

762
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:06,800
it officially became a trend

763
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:10,400
when General James Garfield won the presidency

764
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,940
by a scant 10,000 votes.

765
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:15,100
He proceeded to piss off...

766
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:17,460
big business and the New York political machine.

767
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:20,700
And, less than four months into his term,

768
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:23,080
on July 2nd, 1881,

769
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,840
he was shot by an angry lawyer,

770
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:27,560
Charles Giteau.

771
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:30,540
He died on September 19th,

772
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:34,820
after months of tasty torture at the hands of quacks,

773
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,520
which may have been some sort of Masonic ritual.

774
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:40,580
It basically just gets spooky in 1900,

775
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:44,900
when President William McKinley is re-elected to his second term,

776
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,180
and he was standing in a receiving line

777
00:38:47,180 --> 00:38:49,900
at the Buffalo Pan-American Exposition,

778
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,080
when an anarchist with an unpronounceable name

779
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:54,760
that, on first inspection,

780
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,780
looks like some kind of joke,

781
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:58,220
Leon...

782
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,720
Sholgaz, possibly,

783
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:05,420
C-Z-O-L-G-O-S-Z,

784
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:08,000
shot him twice in the chest.

785
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:09,680
You know,

786
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:11,600
for anarchy.

787
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,980
President McKinley had the decency to linger,

788
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,720
for a mere eight days,

789
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:20,900
and died on September 14th, 1901.

790
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:24,480
Again, medical incompetence played its role,

791
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:27,700
giving him a touch of the gangrene before he died.

792
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,940
Mr. Sholgaz's trial started a week later,

793
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,040
and lasted a day.

794
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:35,160
He was executed less than two months after the act.

795
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,860
Like a good hashishin,

796
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,140
he signed a confession,

797
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,560
and was unapologetic.

798
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,380
By now, you may be noticing,

799
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:44,520
that all the presidents elected in a zero year,

800
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:45,060
eventually,

801
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,140
died in office.

802
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:49,060
And this trend continued in 1920,

803
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,200
with Warren Harding,

804
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:53,680
who was perhaps the worst president ever.

805
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,300
The Federal Vampire and Zombie Agency

806
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,700
indicates that he was bitten by a vampire

807
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,160
planted by Al Capone.

808
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,240
Officially,

809
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,580
the return to normalcy candidate,

810
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,060
embattled by multiple scandals,

811
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,040
fled to Alaska,

812
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:11,040
and died of food poisoning on August 2nd, 1923.

813
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:13,400
His wife died the next year,

814
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,040
on November 21st,

815
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,060
1924.

816
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,380
FDR, like Lincoln,

817
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:20,500
survived his zero year presidency,

818
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:25,400
but finally stroked out on April 12th, 1945,

819
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:28,700
in his fourth term as president.

820
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:31,520
In 1960, JFK was elected,

821
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:35,860
and we all know who killed him on November 21st, 1963.

822
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:38,940
Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980,

823
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,400
and after just a few months in office,

824
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:44,380
was shot by a son of George Bush's friend.

825
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,100
He died.

826
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:49,160
He died and was replaced by a CIA robot on March 30th, 1981.

827
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:53,460
Which brings us to the much contested 2000 election.

828
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:55,180
Wasn't that exciting?

829
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,740
Who knew what was at stake?

830
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,880
A virtual free pass?

831
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:05,720
Of course, the superstitious will insist that the Reagan bot broke the curse.

832
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:08,120
But, time will tell.

833
00:41:09,620 --> 00:41:10,640
Time will tell.

834
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:26,080
Reverend

835
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:26,720
assessor.

836
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:28,340
Station.

Но вот,

842
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:45,020
In the end,

843
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:50,800
of Brutus and the rest? For Brutus is an honorable man, so are they all, all honorable men. Come I to

844
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,240
speak at Caesar's funeral. He was my friend, faithful and just to me, but Brutus says he was

845
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:01,480
ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. He hath brought many captives home to Rome. Did this in

846
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,480
Caesar seem ambitious? When but the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept. Ambition should be made

847
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:12,380
of sterner stuff, yet Brutus says he was ambitious, and Brutus is an honorable man. What cause withholds

848
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:17,440
you then to mourn for him? O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts, and men have lost their

849
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:22,620
reason. Bear with me, my heart is in the coffin there with Caesar, and I must pause till it come

850
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:27,880
back to me. But yesterday the word of Caesar might have stood against the world. Now lies he here,

851
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:33,860
and none so poor to do him reverence. O masters, if I were disposed to stir your hearts and minds

852
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:39,640
to mutiny and rage, I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong, who, you all know, are honorable

853
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,360
men. I will not do them wrong. I rather choose to be a man of honor, and not of the world.

854
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,380
I choose to wrong the dead to wrong myself and you.

855
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:14,860
In a world gone mad.

856
00:43:44,100 --> 00:43:49,040
Now how many people must get killed for oil families' pockets to get filled?

857
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:53,920
How many oil families get killed? Not a damn one, so what's the deal?

858
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:55,180
Ah, that's better.

859
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,080
Well, you look different now, though.

860
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,000
It's like having a vice.

861
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:04,180
Now it looks like your head has actually been slightly protruded in a vice, just enough

862
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,320
to give you a painful headache.

863
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,380
Are those headphones? I thought that was a sea clam.

864
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:10,580
I thought those were growing out of the side of your neck.

865
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:12,280
It's a sea clam.

866
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:15,140
The things we don't see when we don't open our eyes to the world.

867
00:44:15,140 --> 00:44:15,560
It's my new girlfriend, the sea clam.

868
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:18,680
Sea clam what?

869
00:44:20,080 --> 00:44:24,400
I had one a couple years ago, but it just sort of started smelling really bad after

870
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:24,880
a while.

871
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,360
It stopped coming out of its little clamshell.

872
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:27,820
Oh.

873
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,220
Well, you probably had it out of the water too much.

874
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:33,760
That's why you need to stick with the land stuff.

875
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:36,360
Well, he didn't have high-maintenance girlfriends.

876
00:44:36,680 --> 00:44:37,080
Really?

877
00:44:37,120 --> 00:44:39,500
You have to wash them three or four times a day.

878
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:40,640
You've got to keep a tub of salt water.

879
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:41,680
Prairie squids.

880
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:43,680
They don't lick themselves.

881
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:44,820
Well, they don't lick.

882
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:45,320
They don't have to.

883
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:45,840
Well, they don't have to.

884
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:46,560
They clean themselves.

885
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,200
They use that beak.

886
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:52,020
Yeah, and you don't have to sweet-talk them or anything.

887
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,440
You just have to tickle them a bit and de-beak them.

888
00:44:54,520 --> 00:44:58,380
Yeah, well, of course, you have to de-beak them after they do the dirty work, but beforehand.

889
00:44:58,440 --> 00:44:58,760
No, no.

890
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:01,680
Yeah, you go ahead and do it afterwards.

891
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,120
Have you ever had one clamped onto your neck going for your jugular vein?

892
00:45:05,660 --> 00:45:09,280
Just trying to suck the top of the tumors out of your skull?

893
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:09,640
No.

894
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:11,060
You've never had that?

895
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:11,940
Prairie squid?

896
00:45:11,980 --> 00:45:12,340
No.

897
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:15,320
You have never had a prairie squid go for your neck?

898
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:19,080
Oh, man, you are missing all the sport and fun.

899
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,520
I thought you were...

900
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:23,880
I knew you were a secret follower of Christ.

901
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:24,640
I could tell.

902
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:27,060
You are always talking that...

903
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:31,480
You know, Jesus, you are a secret follower of the...

904
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:32,840
We just do it different in Texas.

905
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:34,240
The pale Nazarene, aren't you?

906
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:35,080
You really are.

907
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,800
You don't know what real fun is, man.

908
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:39,740
That's like Satanoplus, baby.

909
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,400
How do you know?

910
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,560
How can you stand in judgment?

911
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,140
You don't know what real fun is.

912
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:43,340
I'm not judging.

913
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,420
I'm just saying once...

914
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:47,440
You don't know what a Lucifer high is until you've had one of those things.

915
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:51,900
Take that little beak and stick it right in there in the tender meat part and start ripping

916
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:53,100
your flesh apart.

917
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,620
Dave, you make me feel so normal.

918
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:56,380
I don't make you feel...

919
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:56,460
No.

920
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,120
I make you feel like you are missing things.

921
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:58,700
And you are.

922
00:45:58,700 --> 00:46:03,100
You should expand your horizons or at least, you know, try and open your left eye once

923
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:03,460
in a while.

924
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:05,980
I know it's very painful, you know, and the pus and everything, but...

925
00:46:05,980 --> 00:46:06,600
Mm-hmm.

926
00:46:06,660 --> 00:46:07,060
It just...

927
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,440
Yeah, I feel like...

928
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,540
I love having conversations with you because in the end, I feel like I'm not the only one.

929
00:46:11,540 --> 00:46:15,080
In the end, I walk away feeling like the sanest man who ever lived.

930
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:15,940
See, that's more...

931
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,920
It's just all relative.

932
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:18,980
Cardboard delusion, they call that right there.

933
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:19,340
Maybe.

934
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:23,120
Oh, I talked to old so-and-so and now I feel better because he's way whacked out.

935
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:25,340
Stang, you're more whacked out than all of us.

936
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,240
Yeah, how elitist.

937
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:26,520
How elitist?

938
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:28,300
I mean, you know, it's not a joke or anything.

939
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,320
That sounds elitist to me, man.

940
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:30,920
Yeah, yeah.

941
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:31,400
You want...

942
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:31,800
Bourgeois.

943
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,660
Right, right.

944
00:46:32,660 --> 00:46:36,000
You want one person to be in charge of being the weird person that is...

945
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:36,500
How bourgeois.

946
00:46:36,940 --> 00:46:38,440
Yeah, how bourgeois, man.

947
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:43,260
I'm actually here to warn you.

948
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:48,380
I'm here to warn you of what is coming.

949
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,820
Some of us here know what is coming.

950
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,060
That's nothing compared to what is coming.

951
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:00,380
You think that was fucked up.

952
00:47:00,420 --> 00:47:03,100
Wait till the fucking you're gonna get from Connie.

953
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:14,140
Connie has come to some of us, Connie-ites.

954
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:19,600
And what you have to understand is that the Connie that you boys have been learning about

955
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:20,880
is not the true Connie.

956
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:28,900
Connie's the kind of chick who may have been the band whore, okay?

957
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:36,200
Connie is the woman who will come up to you even though you haven't got laid since, say, 1991.

958
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:38,420
Connie will fuck.

959
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:38,680
Connie will fuck you.

960
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:46,040
Connie likes fucking losers like your asses.

961
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:58,720
Connie likes fucking your bobby, wimpy, non-slack-havin' bastard motherfuckers.

962
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:04,840
Connie likes doing this because Connie gets power from this.

963
00:48:06,080 --> 00:48:08,320
And that's what you bobbies just don't understand.

964
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:14,040
Because every time you look at that Connie-ite walking across the field at X-Day or at one of these Devivals

965
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:15,620
and you're sitting there looking at it and going,

966
00:48:16,520 --> 00:48:18,420
Man, she's got a nice ass.

967
00:48:20,220 --> 00:48:22,960
Man, she has got a nice set of tits.

968
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:28,280
And you go home after the Devival or after X-Day and you're sitting there in your bed all alone

969
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:29,580
and I know you're doing it.

970
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:33,460
You're sitting there and you haven't gotten laid in a couple of months, maybe six months,

971
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:34,500
maybe a couple of years.

972
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,120
And you sit there and think about that blonde brunette.

973
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,300
And you sit there and think about that redhead and that beautiful Connie-ite you saw.

974
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:44,460
And you pull out your penis and start pulling the pud.

975
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,220
You know what?

976
00:48:46,920 --> 00:48:55,440
While you're jacking off, thinking about that Connie-ite, you're giving Connie even more power.

977
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:06,960
Because every time you sit there and gawk at a Connie-ite or jack off about a Connie-ite

978
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:07,980
or maybe.

979
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:14,100
If you are the truly luckiest son of a bitch and you actually get to fuck a Connie-ite,

980
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,580
you are giving Connie more power.

981
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:24,760
And as you give Connie more and more power, it sort of tilts the balance.

982
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:30,860
So I want to say to you, go ahead, look at my ass.

983
00:49:31,740 --> 00:49:37,580
Go ahead and admire this nice set of natural non-silicone tits that I possess.

984
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:46,800
Go ahead and look at all the Connie-ites.

985
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:54,360
Go ahead and stare.

986
00:49:55,980 --> 00:50:03,920
Because every single time you look at a Connie-ite,

987
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:05,740
you look at a Connie-ite.

988
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:08,240
Bob loses a little.

989
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,060
He's a little bit more slack.

990
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:11,780
And Connie gains more and more power.

991
00:50:12,140 --> 00:50:13,860
So boys, keep it up.

992
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:19,480
Keep bringing your friends to the church and tell them about the free sex that we always brag about.

993
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:26,320
Just keep getting your little hard-ons following around Connie-ites at X-Day.

994
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,420
Hang around the pool and watch for the Connie-ites to get naked.

995
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,020
Go ahead.

996
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:31,920
Keep it up.

997
00:50:32,460 --> 00:50:36,460
Because what you don't understand is and what staying over here doesn't understand

998
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:38,300
and what all the rest of you boys.

999
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:45,940
don't seem to quite comprehend is that the balance of power is changing, fellas.

1000
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,880
And those Wiccans thought that the goddess power was something.

1001
00:50:53,020 --> 00:50:56,100
Just wait until Connie gets a hold of the reins.

1002
00:50:57,440 --> 00:50:58,540
Thank you.

1003
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:02,700
Thank you.

1004

Can you do that?

1009
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,780
I'm going to blow your fucking head off.

1010
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,980
You have the authority.

1011
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,200
Tell me what you're going to do with it.

1012
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:42,580
Let's go.

1013
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,560
There's some kind of super secret police from hell or something.

1014
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,360
Holy bloody pretense.

1015
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,580
There may be a history of a mental disorder.

1016
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:57,580
There may be a history of a mental disorder.

1017
00:51:58,200 --> 00:52:00,400
There may be a history of a mental disorder.

1018
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,360
There may be a history of a mental disorder.

1019
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,760
They programmed them here.

1020
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:20,520
That's invasion of privacy, girly.

1021
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,300
Yes, sir.

1022
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:23,600
They programmed them here.

1023
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,420
That's invasion of privacy, girly.

1024
00:52:26,480 --> 00:52:27,120
Yes, sir.

1025
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,400
They programmed them here.

1026
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:32,160
That's invasion of privacy, girly.

1027
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:32,940
Yes, sir.

1028
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:35,220
They programmed them here.

1029
00:52:39,160 --> 00:52:40,360
You know what I think?

1030
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,620
I think you're all paranoid.

1031
00:52:42,980 --> 00:52:44,180
Are we in any danger?

1032
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:47,780
Your Honor, it was art of Shiokze.

1033
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,800
It was art of Shiokze.

1034
00:52:49,120 --> 00:52:52,160
It was art of Shiokze.

1035
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:52,380
It was art of Shiokze.

1036
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,360
It was art of Shiokze.

1037
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:53,800
It was art of Shiokze.

1038
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:53,840
It was art of Shiokze.

1039
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:53,840


1040
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:53,840


1041
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:53,840


1042
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:53,840

00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:53,840


1044
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:55,500
You're not killing me.

1045
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:55,640


1046
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:55,820
You're not killing me.

1047
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:59,260
You're not killing me.

1048
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:33,440
This is a one-way.

00:53:54,540 --> 00:53:56,260

This is a one-way.

This is a one-way.

1054
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:48,480
Friends, if you've got some kind of tapes or CDs you want to play on that you think is suitable,

1055
00:54:48,660 --> 00:54:58,260
is suitably bobbed and slacked up and conspiracy bashing and ear bone ripping to play on this August radio show,

1056
00:54:58,360 --> 00:54:59,180
then you can send that.

1057
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,240
To me, Reverend Ivan Stang at this address.

1058
00:55:02,660 --> 00:55:19,040

Praise Bob.

1063
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:28,240
Hey, praise help.

1064
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:28,860
Hope you eat it back.

1065
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,060
Run.

1066
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:29,140
Run.

1067
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:29,380
Yeah.

1068
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:29,660


1069
00:55:29,880 --> 00:55:30,140
Yeah.

1070
00:55:30,540 --> 00:55:31,120
Yeah.

1071
00:55:34,320 --> 00:55:34,900
Yeah.

1072
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:49,040
Yeah.

1073
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:49,760
Yeah.

1074
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:50,540
Yeah.

1075
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,440
Thank you.

1076
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,360
Thank you.

1077
00:56:54,120 --> 00:56:55,520
Thank you.

1078
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:30,880
Thank you.

1079
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,400
Thank you.

1080
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:26,020
Thank you.

1081
00:58:59,740 --> 00:59:01,140
Thank you.

1082
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,240
Thank you.

1083
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:24,740
Thank you.
