1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,400
Ah, yes, dear friends, welcome to the Hour of Slack, number 1,370-something.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:21,480
And may this Hour of Slack be the most slackful of all the hours heretofore and forthwith.

3
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:30,600
Your time of listening is now your time of deep, relaxing slack.

4
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:35,940
Slack is the soft voice, slack the luminous cloud.

5
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,200
We in our slack rejoice.

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,380
And thence comes all the charms or ear or sight,

7
00:00:44,580 --> 00:00:47,480
all melodies the echo of that voice,

8
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:50,780
all colors a suffusion,

9
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:52,140
all vision of that light.

10
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:59,560
And though the exists once more withheld the lights of their countenance

11
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:05,880
from the helpful, hopeful, upturned faces of the ex-day postulants,

12
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,720
we have not even been challenged.

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:16,020
Nay, rather than that, our faith has been reinforced even more

14
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,360
so that we are truly the children,

15
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,900
the warriors of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

16
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,440
Praise God!

17
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,440
But not the worriers, sir.

18
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:31,620
We're not the worriers of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

19
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:36,860
We're not worried because we have faith in the ultimate success of our mission,

20
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,440
the nameless mission,

21
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:44,160
a small part of which is to bring you broadcasting opportunities such as this one,

22
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:50,520
where you and we can participate together victoriously in what we call...

23
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,640
the Hour of Slack.

24
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,800
Rar, rar, rar, rar, rar, rar, rar.

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:59,200
That actually hurt my Adam's apple.

26
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,500
I have done that so many times in the last few days.

27
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,400
I've developed a bruise on my throat.

28
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:08,700
In Adam's fall, we sinned all.

29
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,400
And the bruise on the throat, which the Bobcaster feels,

30
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,640
is only cognate to the bruise on the heel given by that old serpent, Satan.

31
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,660
Yes, the adversary, the evil one,

32
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,560
was nipping at the heels of the faithful at Exde.

33
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:34,680
But even old Sequa, most monstrous denizen of the watery depths,

34
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:38,000
took only four minor victims.

35
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,720
When we expected a holocaust of many,

36
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,900
including even the most faithful.

37
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:49,220
Perhaps the locals had fed him the sacrifices,

38
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,660
which, according...

39
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:53,520
to Native American tradition, are his due.

40
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,360
But perhaps he, like the holiday itself,

41
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:02,280
decided, for no reason that could be named,

42
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,780
to be kind and forbearing,

43
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,380
and to have the faith,

44
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,600
the faith in Bob.

45
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:13,340
I win my way.

46
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,100
I win my way.

47
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:18,900
Yes, dear friends.

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,760
Well, let me tell you...

49
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:23,560
I am one burned-out sacred scribe.

50
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,780
Despite a weather disaster that threatened to screw up Exde,

51
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,960
I came home with what I most wanted.

52
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,840
A ton of recordings of killer performances.

53
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,840
However, those recordings, and the 2,000 photos and 30 hours of videos,

54
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:43,880
are going to take months to edit.

55
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:49,240
I think last year we got 13 hours of slack out of 14 Exde,

56
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,760
so maybe this year I'll get 40.

57
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,660
14 hours of slack from the 15 Exde drill.

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:59,040
And, you know, Exde is immediately followed by the Starwood Festival

59
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,760
at that same campground,

60
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:03,140
and while that's more Princess Wee's baby,

61
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,740
which she has to babysit for months, incidentally,

62
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:08,400
I'm also very involved,

63
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,200
and we have the runoff from that to deal with also.

64
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,780
So, for this show, number 1,370,

65
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:20,680
I'm going to skip chronologically past Exde,

66
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:21,340
per se,

67
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:30,280
to the live WCSB show Dr. Hal, Dr. Sinister, Lonesome Cowboy, Dave, and I did on July 8th,

68
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,080
immediately after returning from Exde.

69
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:39,520
I'm planning to make one edit, besides the insertion of this blabber here, if that,

70
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:43,700
and, otherwise, just get it online and mailed out.

71
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:50,740
There's still almost three more hours of radio synesthesia to go, too, from WCSB,

72
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:50,740


73
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:50,740


74
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:57,980
before and after X day. But I'm hoping to have time to intercut that with the great, if cuss-filled,

75
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:05,800
location recordings of rants and bans for the upcoming weeks. We'll see. I'm pushing 60,

76
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:14,480
and despite being a major emergentile, I have resolved not to kill myself overworking on a

77
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:20,200
church of slack. That just wouldn't make sense, and also it would send the wrong message.

78
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:26,820
So, praise Bob, and let there be slack. Here's another uncut, non-cussing live show from the

79
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:34,140
studios of WCSB Cleveland. Oh, oh, oh, I almost forgot. Before I run the July 8th show, I want to

80
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:42,880
run a timely rant by Dr. G. Gordon Gordon that he recorded yesterday, right after that Batman

81
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:50,460
theater massacre. We don't usually do current events for numerous reasons, but this is a worthy

82
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:50,720
experience.

83
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,820
So now, Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

84
00:05:53,820 --> 00:06:02,320
Well, you know, we have a bit of a massacre. A few people get killed, and quite a few people get

85
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:12,120
wounded. And we're acting like, oh my God. And yet, if you look outside this benighted, rotting

86
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:21,660
nation, you will see that this kind of internecine happening takes place on a daily, hourly basis.

87
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,620
Good God, look at what's going on.

88
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,680
Look at what's happening in Syria. Look at what's happening in other parts of the world. Africa.

89
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:34,580
People are being slain by the hundreds, by the thousands. Not to mention systematically raped,

90
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:45,040
burned, tortured. And we whine about 12 deaths and a few wounded, because it's white people.

91
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:53,800
Our people. And one of our people did it. Oh my God. It's always the people of the people,

92
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:00,660
that do things to people. People do things. People are basically intrinsically fucked up.

93
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:09,580
They are not evil, not good, just there. And it's not about whether you're good or bad. It's

94
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:15,880
whether you make the right decisions. And often those are trifling decisions that makes the

95
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:22,040
difference between life and death. For some, it's merely a flick of a switch, and a whole army goes

96
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,400
into work, and...

97
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,140
Bluey!

98
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:30,900
Genocide. For others, it's, well, I think I'll go to the midnight movie and, oh I caught a 223.

99
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:38,840
Big deal. Get over it, America. I mean, yeah, they're dead. Nothing's going to bring them back.

100
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:46,520
And all remembering does is hurt you. Get over it. Move on to the next step. Look for the next big

101
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:51,880
slaughter. Find some entertainment in the meaningless and random happenings of your life.

102
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,380
Just don't make a big deal out of it.

103
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,120
deal out of it. Jeez.

104
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,420
Hello,

105
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,540
Mr. and Mrs. America and all the ships

106
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,540
at sea. This is Dr. Howland Owl.

107
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:03,180
I am broadcasting

108
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:05,060
to you now here from

109
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:07,380
Cleveland, city of art and

110
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,960
innovation. And

111
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,400
the hour of slack is a going concern.

112
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,240
We're seriously

113
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,960
concerned if you,

114
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,240
our listener, are not

115
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,140
achieving the slack which is

116
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:20,840
your natural birthright.

117
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,860
You were born with

118
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,720
original slack, but the

119
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,540
conspiracy wants

120
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,820
to take that slack away

121
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,180
from you, my friends.

122
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:32,800
The conspiracy wants to sell you

123
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,720
false slack

124
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,660
and force you to toil

125
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,820
meaninglessly for it.

126
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,620
Meaningless work,

127
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,780
meaningless drudgery,

128
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,220
only to achieve

129
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,380
false slack

130
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,980
and its failed

131
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,060
rewards.

132
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,940
Which only leave you jonesing

133
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,160
and scratching and thirsting and itching

134
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,760
for more false

135
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,780
conspiracy slack.

136
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,060
But here,

137
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,380
here is the true

138
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:05,040
vein. The mother

139
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:06,980
load. The nay

140
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,860
plus ultra. Right

141
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,000
here and now. So we're going to throw it

142
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,680
open to callers. No, we're not.

143
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:13,860
We're not? No.

144
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,300
We never throw it open to callers.

145
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:18,720
We won't do it then. I just

146
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:20,740
called Lonesome Cowboy Day.

147
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,780
I gave to make sure that he got my message

148
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:23,620
and he did.

149
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:26,680
He's a good fellow and it will all

150
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,920
be well. Yes.

151
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,740
We can explain to him what happened.

152
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,860
So I

153
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,400
won't ask how was your

154
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,560
weekend because it was my

155
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,500
weekend too and my week

156
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:39,420
proceeding.

157
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:41,940
And

158
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,560
well, they don't come

159
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,980
much gnarlier than that.

160
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,600
We had the thunderstorms, the lightning

161
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,440
strike as we were doing the

162
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:50,720
hour.

163
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:51,060
We had a lot of slack.

164
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,640
How much room on the saucers?

165
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,580
Holy

166
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:55,980
head.

167
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,060
Don't worry, folks.

168
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:00,540
Lightning never strikes in the same place

169
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:02,760
twice. I saw that lightning bolt

170
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,540
hit. I did it too.

171
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,720
I heard it. That settles it.

172
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,240
Bob paid for it.

173
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,700
Sinners in the hands of an angry

174
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,640
God. Well, but you know, the funny

175
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,260
thing is we were in

176
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,140
the one oasis

177
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,740
that wasn't part of the disaster

178
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,720
area that Ohio became.

179
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,180
During X Day week.

180
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,820
It was like a real rehearsal for X

181
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:26,760
Day. The subgeniuses had

182
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,700
power and light and even

183
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,320
in a few cases air conditioning.

184
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:32,640
But everyone else in Ohio

185
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,040
was dying of heat prostration.

186
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,700
Unto them, the children of

187
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,260
Bob, is it given power.

188
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,380
Power to mold.

189
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,160
Power to murder

190
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,540
and create. Yes,

191
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,520
because the X-ists are

192
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,720
in our corner. Wait, am I hearing Dave

193
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,740
yet? No, I don't.

194
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:52,220
No, I don't know what you're hearing.

195
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,060
Actually, that's a mystery to me.

196
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,660
No, something terrible happened.

197
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,780
Well, that's terrible. Oh, dear.

198
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,240
Well, that is unfortunate. I was

199
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,300
just saying that our X-ist

200
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,220
friends have got

201
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,200
the back, as it were,

202
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,820
of all the subgeniuses.

203
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,540
Watching from afar, they

204
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,840
are able to control,

205
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,480
in some

206
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,640
cases, completely to manage

207
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,900
earthly events.

208
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,560
And it doesn't,

209
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,500
do, to

210
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,580
give short shrift to a

211
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,840
subgenius. When a subgenius

212
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,480
gets the short end of the

213
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,700
stick, a subgenius, once

214
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,020
being short-sheeted,

215
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,620
should never be counted out

216
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:35,460
of the controversy.

217
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,240
Well, when I hear about sticks,

218
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,780
I get very, very nervous and scared.

219
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,040
Oh, sticks was there.

220
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,900
Talking about false drudgery.

221
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,700
There is no such thing as false drudgery.

222
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:48,460
Any more than there is false

223
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:48,840
slack.

224
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:49,780
Dave?

225
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,520
Turn your radio down.

226
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:53,660
Who, me?

227
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,200
Yeah, is your radio on?

228
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,880
I know it seems counterintuitive.

229
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:59,180
When this is radio.

230
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,540
No, when I put you on, I started hearing

231
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,840
a funny little echo.

232
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,940
Well, it's supposed to be a comedy show, so...

233
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,240
No, seriously,

234
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,440
is your computer radio

235
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,980
speaker on or something?

236
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,600
It is on, but it is very, very far away.

237
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,660
Far away or...

238
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,240
Much further away and much quieter

239
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,880
than it usually is, so...

240
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:22,480
Oh, okay.

241
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,020
Well, it's not much further, actually.

242
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,840
I just, I feel like there's this slight odd...

243
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,380
It's like someone else is here.

244
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,320
Someone else is in the room with us.

245
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:33,900
Perhaps.

246
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,740
The room just got bigger and uglier.

247
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,440
Someone bigger and uglier than I?

248
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,260
As soon as you called, yes, as soon as you called in,

249
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:45,920
I felt that some hollowing, sort of a hollow change to the sound.

250
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,780
An alien presence wormed its way into the symposium.

251
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:50,820
Oh, I see.

252
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,240
I'm...

253
00:12:51,820 --> 00:12:53,020
They're always watching.

254
00:12:53,320 --> 00:13:00,820
On the other hand, the phone light device is acting differently than usual, but I'll

255
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:05,700
just proceed as if everything was normal.

256
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:07,720
We're recording.

257
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,800
Everything's under control.

258
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,620
Reasonably under control.

259
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:15,420
Yes, we're going to bring you back some of that green cheese.

260
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,700
So how was your X day at home?

261
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:22,180
It was dry and humid, very moist.

262
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,680
Dry and humid and moist.

263
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,980
Well, that's part of the mystery.

264
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,380
How can something be both dry and moist at once?

265
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,280
But this is nothing to the miracles that Bob can produce.

266
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,340
Amen.

267
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,840
A mental case.

268
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:44,400
It was moist one moment and dry the next, and then it was spontaneously both moist and dry.

269
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,760
If you have an extra case, I'll take that extra case off your hands.

270
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:48,680
And I had a spiritual orgasm.

271
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:48,780
Pardon?

272
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:53,260
If you have an extra case, I'll take that extra case off your hands.

273
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:58,040
We just rolled into town and we're a little bit deprived of certain necessary supplies.

274
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,060
Well, geez, yeah, I got a whole...

275
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:04,460
I got a whole case of beer and everything else.

276
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,060
I got the...

277
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:07,240
A mountain of slack.

278
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,160
I've got Nenge Co's.

279
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,200
I've got the Ex-Park fluids.

280
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,240
All right.

281
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,540
The kind that used to be, you know, not the modern crap.

282
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,840
The good old fashioned Ex-Park.

283
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,660
Do you have Mother Croaker?

284
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:18,660


285
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,260
Mother Croaker's pre-fab orangeade?

286
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,440
Mm-hmm.

287
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:29,560
You can't imagine the thirst, the thirst that one feels out there under the steaming trees.

288
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:36,220
That's what you call in broccoli, steamed trees.

289
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:43,900
Yeah, they do look like broccoli, but unfortunately when you try to eat them, you only end up with a gnarly mouthful of splinters.

290
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,860
And you can take a machete out there...

291
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:45,980
Like any notary.

292
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,340
...and a couple pounds of butter and still.

293
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,560
Mmm.

294
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,300
You're acrimonious and lackadaisical at the same time.

295
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,840
Well, maybe we didn't try hard enough.

296
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:58,920
We needed a master gourmand like you to tell us how to prepare these viands.

297
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:08,680
But that's all right, because now that we're back in the belly of the beast, we can pick up on all sorts of comestibles and consumables.

298
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:09,380
Yeah.

299
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:18,320
In fact, I have my last can of octopus in hot sauce, which I could proceed to devour while on the air.

300
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:18,800
You could.

301
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,840
Which I've been doing for the last several hours.

302
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,500
Go ahead and devour every tentacle.

303
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,580
I don't think I actually...

304
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:23,820
Tip.

305
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,800
That last little, uh, uh, sandwich I had will probably be...

306
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,980
Under the paranormal cloud of extra federal secrecy...

307
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:31,180
Did you even eat the other half?

308
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:31,180


309
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:34,620
...you are not permitted to eat octopus on the air.

310
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:38,620
It's much like imbibing a controlled substance.

311
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:42,120
Do you think we care for society's laws and morals?

312
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:42,820
Yes.

313
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:48,300
Those pathetic things don't apply to the true ordained overman.

314
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:49,880
Or...

315
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,220
Only a fool would live that way.

316
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:56,340
Right. Bob said we could do anything we wanted to. If Bob said it, then that's why it is.

317
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,140
Bob said it, I believe it, that settles it.

318
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,140
Yep, it's true.

319
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:03,580
Bob sold it, I smoked it, that settles it.

320
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,220
Yep.

321
00:16:05,300 --> 00:16:12,420
Uh, Dr. Howell, you know, uh, we came into this show, literally, we just got into town...

322
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:12,760
It's true.

323
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:15,980
...from, uh, from Wisteria Campground in southern Ohio.

324
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,280
Uh, speeding in order to...

325
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,820
...to make it to the show.

326
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:23,180
So I didn't have any, any, uh, tapes or recordings prepared.

327
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,540
We recorded all the bands and ranters at X Day, but of course those aren't set up yet.

328
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,160
But guess what, Dr. Howell?

329
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,200
What is it?

330
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:37,940
I reached into my little bag of tricks and pulled out this, uh, uh, CD that I'd...

331
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,040
...a mix tape I'd made a while back.

332
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:46,880
I'm not necessarily gonna play it, but it's, like, a label, Good X Day Songs and Songs by Others.

333
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:53,220
And it happens to have on it Evolution Control Committee, who played at X Day.

334
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,460
Did a heck of a concert.

335
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,660
A bang-up job.

336
00:16:57,160 --> 00:17:01,840
Uh, Duke, the Duke of Uke is on, happens to be on this.

337
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:02,860
He also played...

338
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:03,940
...and a new song.

339
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,220
...Inarchy in the UK and Communication Breakdown.

340
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,220
Oh, I would have loved to have heard that.

341
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:12,620
And I felt, well, I have those and I could play them.

342
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,880
They're not from this X Day, they're from another X Day.

343
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,860
And the Mutant Mountain Band.

344
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,100
Mutant Mountain Boys.

345
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:17,900
Mutant.

346
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:23,980
Who performed there, handed me a CD, which I just found among my other CDs, so I could play...

347
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:26,700
You know, they aren't all boys, and some of them are quite fetching.

348
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,600
Yeah, that's what I...

349
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,620
Most of them are not boys, and most of them are quite fetching.

350
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,560
Quite fetching.

351
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:36,920
The boy has been taught to fetch, but that's about all.

352
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,760
Stay, stay. Roll over. Roll over.

353
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:45,940
So there are, like, three lusty, lovely women, and only one, uh, uh, hirsute mountain man, one big...

354
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,220
I got to see one of the Mutant Mountain Boys with her shirt off.

355
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,400
Oh, man.

356
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,420
Which one?

357
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,140
Robin.

358
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:52,660
Oh.

359
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,260
Which shirt?

360
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,280
The, the one that's built like a goddess.

361
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:57,440
Yes, she is.

362
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,800
From another planet, and, and, uh...

363
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,880
Well, I didn't get to see that, but, uh, I guess you can't be everywhere at once.

364
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:05,560
Apparently she's a nudist.

365
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:12,240
She was one of the few subgeniuses who actually took her clothes off at the clothing optional campground.

366
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,920
Did you notice that, um, very few subgenius people...

367
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,840
went, uh, nude?

368
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:27,260
Well, yes, but there were some who were so sterling in their nudity, uh, that, uh, I, I mean, you know...

369
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:31,920
Well, uh, Reverend, Reverend Eggplant looked like Santa Claus running around naked.

370
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:34,640
Uh, Reverend Susie the Felucie looked great.

371
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,360
Yes, she was there, and, uh...

372
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,380
She, she likes to strip down naked all the, every chance she gets.

373
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:45,900
And, uh, Bandiera Ivakovich arrived at our show wearing only a, a thin, uh, pair of...

374
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,540
uh, cast-off Galagascans.

375
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:52,940
We tried to get, we tried to get her up on stage with us, but, uh, she...

376
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,080
But she was becomingly shy.

377
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:54,860
Yes.

378
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,640
Were her pumpkins smooth and round?

379
00:18:56,980 --> 00:18:58,180
You know it, brother.

380
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,000
Like windgates from the south?

381
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:04,360
Which reminds me, I would like to ask Dr. Howell an impersonal question.

382
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,460
Well, an impertinent question is always...

383
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,020
Expected from a lonesome cowboy.

384
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,300
And we'll give you an answer.

385
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:15,880
I was wondering if you have figured out, or if you've historically acted...

386
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:21,320
uh, researched, why people in the southern part of the state of Ohio...

387
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,360
talk like this, or those little fools down there...

388
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:28,920
and people from the northern part of the state, especially along the northern tier...

389
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,220
talk kind of like this, and they say,

390
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:34,740
I'm gonna go into the bar and I took my car and...

391
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:40,280
Well, you know, that just shows that regional pronunciation hasn't died out.

392
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,880
The American character is still being forged...

393
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,860
in the linguistic world.

394
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,480
In the linguistic arena.

395
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:51,540
And, no doubt, it all goes back to the war between the states...

396
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:56,560
and the southern Ohio volunteers, as opposed to the northern Ohio volunteers.

397
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,960
But one could always cross the Mason and Dixon line...

398
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:05,300
when that conflict was taking place.

399
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:12,340
Surely, the past is the foundation for this, our understanding of the present.

400
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,680
Well, the...

401
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,040
It's funny, in Texas...

402
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,180
Not just the Civil War.

403
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,180
See, now the people down in south Texas talk real southern-like...

404
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:24,780
and the people in north Texas speak much like I do...

405
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:27,920
trained by the Columbia School of Broadcasting.

406
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,040
I'm cheerful. I'm cheering everything.

407
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,580
But it was the American Revolution because...

408
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,240
them people from the south all came from Virginia...

409
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,400
and the people in north all came from Connecticut and New York State and Massachusetts...

410
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:43,380
and they hated each other until they killed all the Indians...

411
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,540
and then they were like, you know, all happy again.

412
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:50,740
Well, of course, a lot of this is what we call conspiracy history...

413
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:55,280
which suppresses the actual historical currents and eddies...

414
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,680
which have informed our own time.

415
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,440
Just one closer look, sir.

416
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,120
Open the dossier here.

417
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:05,920
It takes a certain amount of digging.

418
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:07,920
Too small a diagram.

419
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,780
Pull out the tooth... the truth.

420
00:21:10,680 --> 00:21:12,920
Just tie a string to the door...

421
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:15,620
and another one around the truth.

422
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:19,100
And let someone fling open the door.

423
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,800
That never worked. Actually, that did work.

424
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,280
It works in comic books.

425
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,720
It did work, you say?

426
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:28,040
Yes, it did work once for me.

427
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,320
But it was a really loose tooth to begin with.

428
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,360
That was quite a long time ago, come to think of it.

429
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:36,360
If I tried to do that now...

430
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,140
You might have to wait for a long time.

431
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,860
Everybody would be tiptoeing around.

432
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,620
Oh, don't open that door.

433
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,120
Reverend Stang needs his rest.

434
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,800
You'd just be sitting up there, waiting and fidgeting.

435
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,560
Don't you think this tooth infected?

436
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,020
Anyway, our teeth are fine.

437
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,200
This was just a figure of speech.

438
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:55,440
Calm down, Dave.

439
00:21:55,460 --> 00:21:58,700
Really, there's no dental difficulty whatsoever.

440
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,880
Then there's the mental difficulty.

441
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,020
Well, there is that.

442
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,460
Let's not dwell on it.

443
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:07,720
We have to acknowledge some things, but perhaps not all.

444
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,360
At any rate, there's no point in dwelling exclusively on the dark.

445
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:17,700
I was wondering if old Bob himself might have a spare set of teeth.

446
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,200
He's got everything else going.

447
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,620
He's got a third nostril.

448
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:27,160
I was wondering if maybe he had a really pronounced underbite from a lack of molars.

449
00:22:27,260 --> 00:22:29,420
That would make him part moray eel.

450
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:39,100
Well, you know, that pipe is not held between his teeth, but rather seems to float right up against his teeth.

451
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,820
His mouth is closed all the way.

452
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,360
While he grins.

453
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:50,000
And yet that pipe is protruding as if it were glued to his teeth.

454
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:51,740
Maybe they're psychic.

455
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,300
You know, some teeth are psychic.

456
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,240
As other organs of the body.

457
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:59,420
I know it's not a real organ like a B12 or something like that.

458
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:07,500
But some organs do have preternatural abilities, instincts.

459
00:23:08,660 --> 00:23:10,460
And not some set of choppers.

460
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:14,260
Everything seems different since July 5th.

461
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:17,500
Maybe it was some partial X-Day.

462
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:24,880
For instance, I don't remember this keyboard in front of me looking like it was this filthy and dirty and dusty.

463
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:29,160
You must be experiencing what we call Jaume Vu.

464
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:37,860
The idea that what is in front of you is something you've never seen before, even though you have actually seen it thousands of times.

465
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:38,660
Hmm.

466
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,340
But things are different.

467
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,640
We drove up to the station and there were a dozen cars parked in front.

468
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,900
Usually there's just Charleston's car.

469
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,280
And we walked in and there were doors open that have never been opened.

470
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,240
There's construction going on in here.

471
00:23:53,440 --> 00:24:01,420
Then we walked up to the radio station and there was a whole dang band in the control room just playing like crazy.

472
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:03,760
I hadn't seen nothing like that.

473
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,860
So everything is different.

474
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,720
I don't know.

475
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,940
I don't know that X-Day didn't happen.

476
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:17,320
It could be that my imagination is just so limited that I can only imagine a slightly different world.

477
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:28,620
Well, it could be that someone has practiced some form of hoodoo on you and you're under the control of a powerful, maybe malignant, hypnotic intelligence.

478
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:30,520
Oh, there's no question about that.

479
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:37,040
That happened when I first joined the church, when I sent in my five dollars.

480
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:39,940
Like the mephitic powers of Dracula.

481
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:40,900
Hmm.

482
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:45,860
Dr. Hall recognizes all this background music.

483
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,160
This is from Dracula, isn't it?

484
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:50,060
It's from the Hammer Dracula.

485
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:53,880
It's James Bernard, which is why it says,

486
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:57,740
Dracula, Dracula, over and over again.

487
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:04,340
It doesn't take a musicologist to understand it's about the fella with the fangs and the cape.

488
00:25:04,760 --> 00:25:05,920
But at any rate.

489
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:25,400
The only bloodsuckers that I encountered, and they were quite enough for me, were legions of mosquitoes and swarms of buzzing night flies to disturb my fitful slumber, to drain the blood of innocence and leave its stains upon the pillow of shame.

490
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,860
Wow.

491
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,580
Well, you can get a pie stain from that.

492
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,940
I already ate the pie.

493
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:34,400
If you lay in one of those old mosquito tents for a long enough time, your body starts to contort.

494
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,780
The tents of wickedness.

495
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:45,580
No, I ripped open that refrigerator door and engulfed that remaining pie in one titanic moment of orgiastic self-satisfaction.

496
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,940
Of splendor.

497
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:51,580
I think she sweetened it with sugar, actually, but I didn't care.

498
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:55,180
No, you know, those mosquitoes weren't the only bugs around X-Day.

499
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:55,480
That's for sure.

500
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,320
There was Tommy Amoeba, for instance.

501
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,380
That's right.

502
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,140
Tommy Amoeba, the so-called lowest form of life.

503
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:04,860
Of course, the amoeba itself is not the lowest form of life.

504
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,900
By no means.

505
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,160
What is?

506
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,400
What is?

507
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,880
Dave, we don't want to answer that question right now.

508
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:13,860
Not like paramecia or different...

509
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:16,700
No, no, those are pretty complex creatures.

510
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,820
Even protists, I think...

511
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:23,040
Well, what would be, like, what is a form of life?

512
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:29,200
You see, you can go so far down the scale that it is debatable whether some things are forms of life.

513
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:34,700
Bacteria would be pretty low, but bacteria can catch a virus.

514
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,660
I'm not sure of that.

515
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,580
I'm making that up.

516
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,140
But viruses are much smaller than bacteria.

517
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:42,880
And what about prions?

518
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:43,700
Prions.

519
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:46,120
What about them, then?

520
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,940
What's a prion?

521
00:26:48,060 --> 00:26:49,380
Is it like a neutron or a...

522
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:52,280
That's the thing you use to open the lid of a stubborn jar.

523
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:53,500
That's right.

524
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,300
Although I managed to bring a church key.

525
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:01,600
I was just looking over the schedule for next day.

526
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,680
What now turns out to have been...

527
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,060
The 17th X-Day drill.

528
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,740
Drill, baby, drill.

529
00:27:09,740 --> 00:27:11,580
Everything we promised happened.

530
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:15,240
And it happened pretty much on time.

531
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:20,260
And yet you sounded disappointed as if no X-Day had happened or it only partially happened.

532
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:27,540
Well, we're not in our palatial saucers servicing sex goddesses at the moment, but we're reasonably happy.

533
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,200
And after all, we survived.

534
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:34,660
Dr. Hal and I recently learned from...

535
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,100
For instance, that we don't have to be at the airport at noon.

536
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:41,360
We can sleep all day if we want to.

537
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:45,380
I'd better check that data, but I'm happy to receive it.

538
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,020
Will you be sharing a cot?

539
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,800
That was actually...

540
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,680
I offered.

541
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,880
I actually offered to share a cot.

542
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:59,520
But Dr. Hal and I, believe it or not, are both known for snoring.

543
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:03,000
Not that either one of us has ever heard it.

544
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:04,100
Well, you can't hear it.

545
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,440
You're asleep at the time.

546
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:06,320
But they complain.

547
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:11,300
They complain and they shake you and wake you up and tell you how terrible your snoring is.

548
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:13,640
My concern is...

549
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:16,080
See, I've got a guest room, but it's not air-conditioned.

550
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:18,380
I have a bedroom, but no wife.

551
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:22,720
And I thought, well, Dr. Hal could snore next to me in the air-conditioned room.

552
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,160
You can get along without her for just this one time.

553
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:27,180
I need a warm body next to me.

554
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:33,860
But what concerns me is that between your snoring and my snoring, which are of different timbers,

555
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:39,700
they might build up some sort of resonating frequency.

556
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,560
Yes, like when you march across a bridge and don't break a step.

557
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:46,820
We could do serious damage to your house.

558
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:47,400
Right.

559
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,500
Is that what you want?

560
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,780
Or some sort of detritus.

561
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:54,140
Cause bricks to vibrate at a different rate than the mortar?

562
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:57,980
Cause the entire thing to come down tapasal tiri?

563
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,880
I almost used an indelicate expression.

564
00:29:00,980 --> 00:29:03,500
But this is, after all, regular folks' radio.

565
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,620
Yes, and it's indelicate indeed.

566
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:13,060
You could probably point your snores at some enemy, or some enemy of the people, or of yourself.

567
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,540
No, uh, you point your snores.

568
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:24,960
No, actually, I don't intend to use this unfortunate thing as a weapon, but only in the service of peace and human...

569
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,040
You can make money.

570
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:28,660
Oh, money. Well, in that case, I might make some revisions.

571
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:33,300
We'll have to work out the details, hammer them out, and bowl sessions.

572
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,440
Extending far into the night.

573
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:47,140
The, um, the head of the American Order of Druids once criticized me in public while I was ranting at Starwood.

574
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:51,380
I asked, after my sermon, I said, are there any questions?

575
00:29:51,540 --> 00:30:01,560
And, uh, Isaac Bonowitz, the head of the Druids, stood up and said, how can you stand to live with yourself snoring so loud?

576
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,280
He'd been lodged in the same place.

577
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,500
He'd been lodged in the same place.

578
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:03,500


579
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:03,500


580
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,800
I was in a pathetic trailer with me.

581
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:07,980
And, uh, and you know what happened?

582
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,280
He died.

583
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:12,460
Well, you see, why don't you go after him?

584
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:18,780
So, that just goes to show, you don't go, you don't, you don't go making fun of Reverend Stang and his unfortunate snoring.

585
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:22,000
Or he'll snore you to death, even if he didn't mean to.

586
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:22,820
You see...

587
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:28,820
I didn't wish death on Isaac, but I also knew better than to make fun of Reverend Stang snoring.

588
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:33,260
To one who lives gigantically, even the, uh, basic upper class...

589
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,260


590
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:44,920
...operations of life are performed with enormous, heroic, noble effort and sound effects in color, sense around, Todd AO, VistaVision, and RumbleRama.

591
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:46,660
Ah, indeed.

592
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:53,980
And if we're all left alone like that, you know, pretty soon, I could imagine thousands and thousands of people's heads exploding.

593
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:57,120
Well, then you wouldn't have to pay back the loan.

594
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,740
But, uh, we'll cross that bridge when we break step.

595
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,120
Like foot soldiers.

596
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,860
Yes, yes.

597
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,440
With thousands, like a centipede.

598
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:11,920
A human centipede? Oh, I didn't want to go there.

599
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:21,960
But, uh, perhaps, um, we will at another time describe some of the quaint, uh, pasture, uh, um, pastimes at Ex Day.

600
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:30,920
We did have, uh, renegade scientist Papa Joe Mama there to, uh, show some unusual things.

601
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,120
He even appeared personally.

602
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,780
In a jack-chick track. I couldn't believe it.

603
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,140
Yeah.

604
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,780
How does this guy get into a jack-chick track?

605
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:42,760
It was his life's dream, and he achieved it.

606
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,680
Unfortunately, it was my life's dream, too, and I didn't achieve it.

607
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:46,980
I didn't know that.

608
00:31:46,980 --> 00:32:01,700
Although the late Isaac Bonowitz, who I just mentioned earlier, is in a jack-chick track, depicted as the evil overlord over a huge army of thugs and mercenaries who are the American Druids.

609
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:03,240
I happen to know that.

610
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:08,980
I knew this guy, and I thought, when I read the jack-chick track, it's like, seems like he'd drive a better car.

611
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:10,360
Or a tank.

612
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:12,960
Yeah, if he, if he had that many minions.

613
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:14,960
Oh, well.

614
00:32:15,020 --> 00:32:24,640
But, so, yeah, I've never appeared in a, in a, uh, Papa Joe did try to get Jack Chick to do an anti-subgenius chick comic.

615
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:31,280
And Jack thought about it, and he said, well, he'd prey on it, which is his polite way of saying, not in this life, Charlie.

616
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,320
Like P-R-E-Y? He was going to somehow default to that?

617
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,400
No, he was going to go in his closet and prey.

618
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:42,240
But he did, he did work a, a caricature of Papa Joe himself into it, although...

619
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,260
As a cop?

620
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:50,480
Granted, he did not know Papa Joe Mama as the subgenius preacher we know him as.

621
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,500
No, of course not.

622
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:54,260
He only knew him as an infiltrator under another name.

623
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,880
Nor has he ever seen him in drag.

624
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,080
Father Joseph Mother.

625
00:32:57,720 --> 00:33:00,960
But he did put him in a black uniform as a cop.

626
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,460
I thought he was doing a sheet of the she-wolf of the S.S. again.

627
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:07,500
Uh, well...

628
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:08,200
But I was not there.

629
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:11,480
I don't know if, uh, Jack is, uh, tracking on that one either.

630
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:18,820
We came up with a couple of, uh, more formal names for subgenius preacher friends of ours.

631
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,680
Philo started calling Papa Joe Mama Father Joseph Mother.

632
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:30,780
And at one point, I, as, as kind of a vocal typo, I referred to Susie the floozy as,

633
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:33,840
as Reverend Susan the floo-son.

634
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:34,940
Hmm.

635
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,900
It was just a slip of...

636
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:36,560
How did she like that?

637
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:38,260
Uh, she, she loved it.

638
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,460
It was a new one.

639
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:41,500
It was like, where, where's that been all our lives?

640
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,480
Why didn't we think of that?

641
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:43,680
Yeah.

642
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,880
Well, let's just let them wear it and let them get the stock out themselves.

643
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:47,480
You know, we, we...

644
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:51,600
Her friends call her Susie the floozy, but of course, you know, on, on her driver's license,

645
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,840
it says Susan the floo-son.

646
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:54,800
Mm-hmm.

647
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:56,160
So...

648
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,500
I don't know such things.

649
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:00,760
I don't know such things.

650
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:00,760


651
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:00,760


652
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:00,760


653
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:05,240
You know, give me mirth, you know, to hear people say things like that about, you know,

654
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,640
if you name was Eyckenstangend or Feggenstangen or Fange-stang...

655
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:12,020
Ay Reverend Eyckenstang.

656
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:15,940
Oh, you know, what really bothers me is when they, they want to show that they're not

657
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,340
ignorant suckers and they know I'm not really a minister, and they'll walk up and go, uh,

658
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:21,420
Mr. Stang.

659
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,640
It's like that, dude, you're proving everything wrong.

660
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:29,020
I really am a minister.

661
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,340
Yeah.

662
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:30,540
Yeah.

663
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:32,200
Not Mr. Stang.

664
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,920
It's Citizen Stang.

665
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:36,360
I'm Reverend Stang, and that's it.

666
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:37,640
Or you can call me Mr. Smith.

667
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:40,940
But half the people in the room will turn around if you yell that.

668
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:43,200
So hooey.

669
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,260
It's a bunch of hooey if you ask me.

670
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:46,540
Let's yell that in a crowded theater and see who gets burned up.

671
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:51,400
It's like certain carny acts which I've seen, and no doubt Reverend Stang has seen,

672
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:57,640
where the guy chews a light bulb and swallows the broken glass

673
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,040
and then wipes his mouth with a napkin and washes it down with Windex out of a bottle.

674
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,880
And people say, well, I know that's just sugar glass, but it looks like he really did drink Windex.

675
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:14,880
Am I mistaken, or did Andrew the Impaled not perform just last night?

676
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,680
He did, but I didn't catch it.

677
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,760
However, I've seen this type of act many times.

678
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,140
I've seen him eat a dozen light bulbs.

679
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:26,260
Well, the fact is, this is what I was getting at, you can eat light bulbs, though I don't recommend it.

680
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:27,620
As long as you chew the broken glass.

681
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:31,000
If you chew the broken glass enough, you can swallow and digest it.

682
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,820
But drinking Windex is something you can't do.

683
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:39,560
So the people who speak knowingly, oh, he just ate fake glass, but he drank a little Windex,

684
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:41,620
have got it completely backwards.

685
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,280
He actually ate glass, but drank no Windex.

686
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,140
Andrew revealed part of his secret.

687
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,640
St. Andrew the Impaled?

688
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:55,100
Yes, Andrew the Impaled eats a banana before he goes on stage.

689
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:55,800
A banana?

690
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:56,600
Yes.

691
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:57,620
A banana.

692
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:57,620


693
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:57,620


694
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:57,620


695
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:57,620


696
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:57,620


697
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:57,620


698
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:57,620


699
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:57,620


700
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:57,620


701
00:35:57,620 --> 00:35:57,620


702
00:35:57,620 --> 00:36:04,980
He does chew the glass into powder, and when he swallows it, it's met by the banana goo that's still down there.

703
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,900
Then he eats another banana real fast.

704
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:07,540
Banana goo.

705
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:16,320
When you're not looking, he shoves another banana down there to kind of help coat the glass or some kind of...

706
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:19,560
And a gallon of methadone doesn't hurt either.

707
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:23,020
I would think that a toilet paper would shred...

708
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,700
Well, let's not go into that.

709
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,200
But we did want...

710
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:27,600
But we did want...

711
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:30,000
Eating the glass is another problem with glass eaters.

712
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,400
Just eating it is the first problem.

713
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,940
Eliminating it is the second problem.

714
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:35,240
He did do the human blockhead last night.

715
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:38,160
He hammered a nail directly into his face.

716
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:46,280
But you see, I'm jaded because I've seen the Reverend David Apocalypse pound nails into his head many times.

717
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:52,020
I'm afraid out on the left coast, this is not such a new thing.

718
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,600
And even in Amsterdam...

719
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,360
Dr. Howell?

720
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:54,980
Yes?

721
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,580
David Apocalypse and Andrew the Impaled...

722
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:01,840
were a touring Yankee freak show.

723
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,800
I know that.

724
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:06,400
Who went on tour with Dr. Legume and me in the 90s.

725
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:06,780
Yes.

726
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:08,560
So we've been...

727
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:15,360
People have been hammering nails into their noses here on the East Coast just as long.

728
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,100
Maybe longer than they have on the West Coast.

729
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:24,040
I don't want to get into some kind of a competition of face, nose, nailing.

730
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,240
Nor should you.

731
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,100
Nor should you.

732
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:26,920
I'm just saying...

733
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:27,580
I will tell you...

734
00:37:27,580 --> 00:37:30,660
I will tell you a funny, true story.

735
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:34,360
This morning, Princess Wee and I were cleaning up the stage

736
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:38,520
so that the Starwood people would not find a big mess.

737
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:42,900
And I, of course, spilled a bunch of crap all over the place.

738
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,020
Some of it fell down between some boards.

739
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:52,160
And we had to find something sharp and pointy to pry these objects out with so that we could throw them away.

740
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:53,360
So you...

741
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,900
Princess Wee...

742
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,560
...noticed a nail...

743
00:37:57,580 --> 00:38:00,060
...nail on the stage and picked it up.

744
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,200
And she looked at it and said,

745
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:06,440
I know that this was inside his nose, but I'm going to use it anyway.

746
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:09,740
And she used the nail that...

747
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:14,300
The Andrew snot-covered nail to pry those things.

748
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,520
They really do hammer those nails in.

749
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,080
It's not a collapsible nail.

750
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:18,780
I know they do.

751
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,820
It's not a fake.

752
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,600
And you could do it, too.

753
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,860
The nose part is the trick.

754
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:24,960
But we don't recommend that anybody do it.

755
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:27,460
Look, as I tried to explain the other night,

756
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:33,880
I've seen so many of those shows that now I'm only concerned that nothing go wrong while it's happening.

757
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,000
Because if it does, if something tears or doesn't work as it's supposed to,

758
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:48,620
then I, as an audience member, will somehow obscurely be blamed for being there and enabling, as they say today, the performance, which sadly...

759
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:48,660
That's true.

760
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,620
Who is that guy we saw in Amsterdam?

761
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,980
Yeah, I was thinking about him.

762
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:54,260
He was another...

763
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:55,820
He was really...

764
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:57,560
That guy was a real man.

765
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:58,320
A masochist.

766
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,460
Who, Jim Rose?

767
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:00,020
No.

768
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:03,260
Someone we saw perform in Amsterdam.

769
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:04,900
I'm trying to think of...

770
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:05,240
Oh, God.

771
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:11,620
He hung all kinds of things by hooks from the most sensitive parts of his body.

772
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,000
Well, I've seen...

773
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,660
I remember Senator Rocknar fainting.

774
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:16,780
He couldn't watch that.

775
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:19,300
It disturbed him so much.

776
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:23,520
I mean, he literally turned even paler than normal and fell off of his chair.

777
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,100
Pale grew his cheek.

778
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,280
I've passed out when I was catheterized one time.

779
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:33,960
They put the tube up there, and just seeing it made me go...

780
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,540
And I passed out on the floor.

781
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,180
They had to be removed with a shovel.

782
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:42,780
Well, I hope you didn't have any tubal litigation to follow.

783
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:54,100
Nestled in a tranquil, wooded setting, the Church of the Subgenius is the center of creativity for wisteria and the surrounding areas.

784
00:39:55,100 --> 00:40:01,660
Making their home in a century-old kingdom adjacent to Old Sequaw's Pond,

785
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:10,720
the Church of the Subgenius offers a perfect environment for making do with whatever is shoveled.

786
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:19,840
The Reverend Ivan Stang, born in a log cabin in Tuberculosis B.T. in the years it was there as he always was there,

787
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,880
leading them on and off.

788
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,280
He was born in a log cabin.

789
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,080
He helped...

790
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,080
He helped construct himself.

791
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,560
Oh, now I see action in the parking lot.

792
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,720
Somebody just pulled in.

793
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,840
It's Big Louie and the boys.

794
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:37,580
They're just at the edge of the screen, Stang, on the very far right of the screen.

795
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:42,280
It's like the Droogs in Clockwork Orange, so you better get out your water pistols.

796
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,140
Oh, well, we're up high on the upper floor.

797
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:50,300
We should be seeing one of our fellow X-Day performers walking in.

798
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,760
You see that long, skinny shadow?

799
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,900
I do.

800
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:54,340
Is it the thing, man?

801
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:54,620
Tall.

802
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:55,860
Thin.

803
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,480
Here he comes.

804
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,840
Sinister-looking fellow.

805
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,940
He doesn't know we're talking about him.

806
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:00,660
No, he doesn't.

807
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,800
But we can see him on the station closed circuit.

808
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:06,620
He might actually know what you're saying about him, you know, with a second sight.

809
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:13,960
Now, when I was a tiny, toddling tot, I used to have a little tinny two-bit transistor radio, which I carried around.

810
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,440
Nobody does that anymore.

811
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:21,880
But if they did, they could hear us while they go shambling down the street.

812
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,920
They could even spin it around with a little...

813
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,320
Little attachment on top that, like, you know, you can hang it from your belt.

814
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,060
You're talking about a tin, an old crystal...

815
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,100
It's about the size of a pack of cigarettes.

816
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,780
They're called smartphones, Dr. Allen.

817
00:41:37,060 --> 00:41:38,920
They can listen to the hour of...

818
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,780
I used to have a little plastic transistor radio.

819
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:42,580
It was this big.

820
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:48,820
It was red, and on it, I was the first in my family to hear John F. Kennedy had been shot in Dallas.

821
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:53,720
I just don't know why I was home that day, because it was a school day.

822
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,520
Nonetheless, I...

823
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,740
I was playing hooky also.

824
00:41:55,740 --> 00:42:02,600
I went down, and I told the mom and dad about this, and they turned on the big TV, which was a new purchase in our household.

825
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:09,160
And for the rest of the next few days, we watched the entire JFK show, including Oswald and everything else.

826
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,500
Did you see Oswald get shot?

827
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,020
We did.

828
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:12,180
We were right there.

829
00:42:12,220 --> 00:42:13,920
My parents did, but I didn't.

830
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,000
Well, we did.

831
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:18,020
Dr. Sinister has entered the room.

832
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:21,480
He has evidently survived X-Day partially.

833
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,980
He felt the temperature drop a few degrees.

834
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,860
That's how you do it, right?

835
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:24,400
But nobody...

836
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:24,500
Nobody...

837
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:24,500


838
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:24,500


839
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:30,800
You're saying he has a transistor radio anymore, and you say the phone, but the phone doesn't pick up radio, does it?

840
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:36,200
Everybody's complicated phone that does everything doesn't pick up radio.

841
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:39,040
They do almost everything except work as a phone.

842
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:42,520
Yes, it can pick up the radio, because it gets the internet.

843
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,580
And everything is streamed on the dang internet.

844
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:52,480
It may be streaming and dripping, but it's not, you know, picking up radio waves.

845
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,840
There's 34 people.

846
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,480
There's 34 people plus one Canadian listening to us right now.

847
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,040
Genuine, battery-free, Calvin Coolidge radio set.

848
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,960
And they're listening to us through a freaking cloud.

849
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:07,440
That's the part that irritates the living bejesus out of me.

850
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,380
You don't believe clouds ought to be computing?

851
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,760
I do not believe clouds should be communicating with people.

852
00:43:13,020 --> 00:43:18,920
I think they should communicate with other clouds or with the little vestiges of nature that might be around it at the time.

853
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:20,860
Next thing you know, we'll be dealing with foglets.

854
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,040
Foglets?

855
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:22,600
That's right.

856
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,820
A foglet.

857
00:43:23,820 --> 00:43:25,520
A fog of fervor.

858
00:43:25,860 --> 00:43:30,240
Blinding us to anything but our love of what we do.

859
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,160
Ah.

860
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,080
I like that phrase, then.

861
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:35,400
Our love of self-love.

862
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,360
Well, one must start somewhere.

863
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:41,220
That would be like the creme brulee out of no way.

864
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:47,520
If you're talking about Five Finger Mary, I'll defend Herd of the Death.

865
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:49,460
Five Finger Mary?

866
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,940
That's also obscene.

867
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:51,820
Well, look.

868
00:43:51,900 --> 00:43:53,020
We can't be...

869
00:43:53,820 --> 00:44:00,340
The straight and narrow, the true pasteurized, homogenous, lily-pure, vanilla show all the time.

870
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,620
Is that what our listeners want?

871
00:44:01,700 --> 00:44:03,260
Is that what you want?

872
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:04,660
Nay, I say nay.

873
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,540
I agree with you.

874
00:44:05,580 --> 00:44:05,760
I...

875
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,520
All righty.

876
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:07,360
Let's get salty.

877
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,400
Like sailors.

878
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,140
All righty.

879
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:14,340
Now, I don't want to start.

880
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,580
I'll let you go first.

881
00:44:15,740 --> 00:44:18,780
I have a hard time with salt these days.

882
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,660
I can't get too salty.

883
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:21,940
I'm watching my blood pressure.

884
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,800
She was round in the...

885
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:26,820
I can't get too salty.

886
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:26,820


887
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:26,840
I can't get too salty.

888
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:26,840


889
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,900
Yo ho, blow the man down.

890
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,920
And yard on, and yard on.

891
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,020
Away we did go.

892
00:44:33,180 --> 00:44:35,720
Give me some time to blow the man down.

893
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,340
Uh, yes.

894
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:44,060
Her looks were free.

895
00:44:44,940 --> 00:44:46,640
Her locks were yellow as gold.

896
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,840
Her skin was white as leprosy.

897
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,480
The nightmare life in death was she who thinks.

898
00:44:53,960 --> 00:44:56,000
Man's blood with cold.

899
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:58,120
Cold?

900
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:02,640
I don't know if I'm going to go in that room.

901
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:03,560
Too late.

902
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,400
Anyway, it's out on the open ocean.

903
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,540
Nothing to worry about.

904
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,900
Yes, the mind's eye is much like a big cloud on the open ocean.

905
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,000
It opens and shuts.

906
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:13,640
It rains.

907
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:16,880
It causes fervor among the damaged units.

908
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,100
We had the...

909
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:18,180
We had the...

910
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,360
More cleverly packed units.

911
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,120
It causes a lot of consternation, too.

912
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:23,620
I was going to say it's helpful, but...

913
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:23,880
It's not.

914
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,040
There was some turbulence of nature at the campground.

915
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:30,800
There's some restiveness of sky and woods and wind and rain.

916
00:45:31,860 --> 00:45:37,520
Yeah, I can't wait to hear the recording of when that lightning struck about 12 feet from us.

917
00:45:37,580 --> 00:45:39,000
Right while we were doing the show.

918
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,720
Yeah, we were doing a radio show.

919
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:42,180
We happened to be facing...

920
00:45:42,180 --> 00:45:43,880
Those of us who were at the...

921
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:46,800
At what we call Tarzan's radio station.

922
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:50,700
We were facing the audience.

923
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,000
So the audience didn't actually see this.

924
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:53,600
They just heard...

925
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,740
They heard this explosion behind them.

926
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,940
But they saw the flash.

927
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:58,400
No, we saw the flash.

928
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:01,060
Like the searing flash that announced the beginning of the atomic age.

929
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,740
Holy head.

930
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:12,400
God was not pleased with the selection of movies at the 24-7 grindhouse.

931
00:46:12,540 --> 00:46:13,400
Apparently not.

932
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,640
And he hurled a thunderbolt.

933
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:19,580
Either that or he wanted more people to go down there and watch.

934
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,020
I saw a number of people running down the hill into the grotto.

935
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:27,520
Out of concern to see if there was anything left of the grindhouse movie theater.

936
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,220
After that display of celestial fire.

937
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:31,420
The floors were very sticky there.

938
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:33,160
Well, Reverend Feitzee Taj ran down there.

939
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:35,220
Like, I've never seen anybody run so fast.

940
00:46:35,340 --> 00:46:36,840
Of course, he owned all the equipment.

941
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:44,220
It could have been infused into a solid lump by the force of millions of megavolts of actinic energy.

942
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,720
But it wasn't.

943
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:47,520
The Betty Boop cartoon was still running.

944
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,200
Well, I'm sure that was worth seeing.

945
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:51,540
My brief...

946
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:53,100
You know, X-Day is...

947
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,700
It's slackful for many people.

948
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:58,200
But for me, it's a job.

949
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,900
It's watching Betty Boop cartoons?

950
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,740
It's a job.

951
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:09,820
And the moments of slack that I personally got were when Princess Wee and I would wander down to the grindhouse.

952
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,600
There'd be nobody else down there.

953
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:16,980
And every time we went down there, he had Warner Brothers cartoons, Betty Boop.

954
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:18,320
Oh, that sounds great.

955
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:20,620
And there were ones we hadn't seen before.

956
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,900
The Betty Boop ones had professors.

957
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:24,740
Professor...

958
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:26,400
Grampy.

959
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,460
Oh, no.

960
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:27,940
Oh, yeah.

961
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,660
Professor Grampy.

962
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,540
I was not familiar with him as a character.

963
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,780
I have seen Professor Grampy.

964
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:38,100
He reminded me of a subgenius.

965
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:45,880
Because in the cartoon we saw, Betty's little nephew was sad because he couldn't go to the carnival.

966
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:46,560
It was raining.

967
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:51,380
So Professor Grampy turned his home into a carnival.

968
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,920
Just as we at X-Day.

969
00:47:53,100 --> 00:48:00,500
Like the Little Rascals, we turned the barn into a theater and make an orchestra out of jugs and combs.

970
00:48:02,420 --> 00:48:10,200
Professor Grampy took a washing machine and turned it into a merry-go-round and all manner of...

971
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,200
He had his whole house like a subgenius carnival.

972
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:18,380
I thought like a carnivore he would have used a machine gun rather than a machine washer.

973
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:21,960
That's a more modern cartoon that you're thinking about.

974
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:22,900
This is...

975
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:23,080
This is a...

976
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,040
Made in the late 30s.

977
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,840
When times were tough.

978
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:37,140
They were tough and the Fleischer cartoons were already losing their edge because of the production code which made Betty Boop matronly instead of sexy.

979
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:40,920
Took her out of her little black mini skirt and put her in a long skirt.

980
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:42,160
Mm-hmm.

981
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:43,020
It was sad.

982
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:52,040
Yeah, I realized when I was watching that cartoon that I don't recall ever seeing a picture of the woman who did Betty Boop's voice.

983
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:52,880
You never...

984
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,360
You never seen a picture of Mae Questel?

985
00:48:54,500 --> 00:48:54,900
No.

986
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,000
Does she look anything like Betty Boop?

987
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:57,380
Well...

988
00:48:57,380 --> 00:49:00,060
With the gigantic skull on the tiny little body?

989
00:49:00,060 --> 00:49:09,760
No, but although she did the voice, that is actually based on Helen Kane who did more resemble Betty as we saw her in the earlier Fleischers.

990
00:49:09,920 --> 00:49:18,640
To the early Fleischer Popeyes, the ones with the two slamming doors and the foc'sle of the ship are the only true Popeye cartoons.

991
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,720
Afterwards, he was emasculated and put in that white suit.

992
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:22,740
Wow.

993
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:23,360
Sailor suit.

994
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:23,960
Oh, my God.

995
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:24,500
Yeah.

996
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:24,980
Yeah.

997
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:26,140
He's been that way ever since.

998
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:31,960
We have helped in whatever way we can to demasculate Popeye.

999
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:32,520
Oh, doctor...

1000
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:43,160
We see as a cultural icon of the Americans that his genitals must be removed and placed in this small package here and kept on ice for weeks after weeks.

1001
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,240
And we in that way can we neuter the American public.

1002
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:48,440
I'm sorry.

1003
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:51,280
I saw a terrible thing done to Popeye.

1004
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:52,680
That's what we're talking about.

1005
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:56,220
I walked into a room where there was a terrible thing called a television.

1006
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:03,280
I tried to avoid those, but I turned it on and there was a CGI Popeye cartoon.

1007
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:05,680
A CGI Popeye.

1008
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:10,500
And he was preaching good behavior to kids.

1009
00:50:11,260 --> 00:50:13,440
Bluto was his friend.

1010
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:21,180
And on top of this, the music for it was done by a subgenius, Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh.

1011
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:22,200
I was never.

1012
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:22,560
Never.

1013
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:22,800
So ashamed.

1014
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,560
So where did Olive Oil fit into all this?

1015
00:50:25,880 --> 00:50:28,160
I don't think she even appeared in it.

1016
00:50:28,300 --> 00:50:31,000
Of course they have to get rid of Olive Oil to make Bluto and Popeye friends.

1017
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:39,580
I saw an updated Yogi Bear cartoon where Yogi was the friend of Ranger Smith.

1018
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,320
This park was no longer a national park.

1019
00:50:43,580 --> 00:50:46,400
Jellystone had been bought by a rich person.

1020
00:50:46,700 --> 00:50:52,540
And Rangers, rather than spending his life stealing picnic baskets...

1021
00:50:52,560 --> 00:51:02,280
from pinks, the formerly subversive Yogi had become this simpering slave to a rich lady.

1022
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:13,100
Yogi and Ranger Smith and Boo Boo were working together to keep the rich lady owner of the property from getting upset.

1023
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:21,860
I don't like to break in, Reverend Stang, but that sounds like the plot of the recent live action Yogi Bear movie.

1024
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:22,180
Yeah.

1025
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:25,820
I tried to avoid even thinking about that, but this was a cartoon I saw.

1026
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,820
Featuring Justin Timberlake as Boo Boo.

1027
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:29,460
It was very, very homogenous.

1028
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,480
Don't try it out.

1029
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:31,920
You don't want to hear any more about it?

1030
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,080
No, I don't want to hear any more about it.

1031
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:33,360
Okay, well, how about the...

1032
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:34,940
And don't mention the Three Stooges movie.

1033
00:51:35,100 --> 00:51:35,780
I don't want to know about that either.

1034
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:36,640
All right, I won't mention that one.

1035
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,700
But what about the Ranger Smith cartoon, Boo Boo Goes Wild?

1036
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:43,000
Now, that I've seen about 20 times.

1037
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:46,220
In fact, I've probably got a copy of it in that briefcase.

1038
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:47,380
I'd love to have a copy of that.

1039
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:48,560
Boo Boo's got boobies.

1040
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:50,860
Philo always has a copy of it.

1041
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:51,320
I know.

1042
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:51,580
I know.

1043
00:51:51,580 --> 00:51:51,920
I know.

1044
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,240
I once watched it at X Day.

1045
00:51:53,420 --> 00:51:53,700
Yeah.

1046
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,320
Over and over again.

1047
00:51:55,340 --> 00:51:59,880
I show cartoons at my live show, and it seems to me that one might be a good one.

1048
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:06,980
You see, Boo Boo and Yogi's in Amaranta, Cindy Bear, decide that they're tired of wearing

1049
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:11,060
anthropomorphic outfits and will just go back to being natural bears.

1050
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:18,560
And so there they sprawl with chiggers and dirt and drool while Yogi is horrified.

1051
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:21,620
Yeah, Yogi doesn't refer.

1052
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:22,400
No.

1053
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:23,740
To his animal nature.

1054
00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:25,560
But Boo Boo and Cindy do.

1055
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:27,960
And in fact, they go off into the woods together.

1056
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:28,600
They do.

1057
00:52:28,760 --> 00:52:29,900
Yes, it's a most interesting story.

1058
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:31,040
I'm just going to show you.

1059
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:31,680
This is a lesson.

1060
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:32,080
It's the end.

1061
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:35,220
But Yogi goes to Ranger Smith.

1062
00:52:35,320 --> 00:52:37,160
He goes, we've got to do something about Boo Boo.

1063
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:43,940
And Ranger Smith is actually, with Yogi's help, about to put Boo Boo down.

1064
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:44,740
Yes.

1065
00:52:44,740 --> 00:52:45,440
At the climax.

1066
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:50,020
They're weeping and crying because they're going to have to shoot Boo Boo, who has turned

1067
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:51,000
into a real bear.

1068
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,200
You know, he's no longer this cute thing with a bow tie.

1069
00:52:54,580 --> 00:52:57,800
And at the end, I think.

1070
00:52:58,540 --> 00:53:00,780
Well, we don't want to give everything away.

1071
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,640
I don't want to spoil it.

1072
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:02,740
We don't want to give everything away.

1073
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,420
But this problem is solved the way problems always are at the end of cartoons.

1074
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:15,940
But then they stage a hilarious buttocks mutilating ceremony where first Ranger Smith slaps Yogi's

1075
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:16,180
butt.

1076
00:53:16,240 --> 00:53:20,980
And then Yogi, with his sharp claws, rips and mutilates Ranger Smith.

1077
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:25,980
And then they turn around and do it again, you know, all in time to the music.

1078
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,240
So this cartoon is heartily recommended.

1079
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:30,720
It gets four stars.

1080
00:53:31,340 --> 00:53:33,220
Yogi's claws are actually a tasty pastry.

1081
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:37,140
It's a Ranger Smith cartoon entitled Boo Boo Goes Wild.

1082
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,380
It was done by John Kay.

1083
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:40,280
John Kay.

1084
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:41,780
Of Ren and Stimpy.

1085
00:53:41,780 --> 00:53:41,900
Right.

1086
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:43,280
He's a great cartoon maker.

1087
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,880
You know, you're always putting down the Internet.

1088
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:50,980
But if you just avoid all the obnoxiousness, you can go to a site where he analyzes.

1089
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:56,040
He analyzes cartoons and shows frame by frame why Clampett's cartoons are so great.

1090
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:57,420
John Kay does.

1091
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,240
I don't have anything against the Internet.

1092
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,220
My problem is with the people on the Internet.

1093
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,860
Yes, but you can research.

1094
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:06,680
My fellow users are my problem.

1095
00:54:06,740 --> 00:54:10,920
You can look and see pictures of the new dinosaurs they ever discovered.

1096
00:54:11,100 --> 00:54:14,360
Like Utah Ceratops that has 15 horns.

1097
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,800
All these great new dinosaurs.

1098
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:17,840
Anyway.

1099
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,200
Great new dinosaurs.

1100
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,500
Don't hang away from the...

1101
00:54:21,580 --> 00:54:23,680
I don't want to know about all that.

1102
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:25,920
When I was a kid, there was only 10 dinosaurs.

1103
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:29,360
They had their names and the length of them printed on their tails.

1104
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:31,600
And that's the way it's always going to be.

1105
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,520
Yeah, well, you had to stand on the right side to read it.

1106
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:36,040
Jesus used to ride a dinosaur.

1107
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:37,740
Yes, I know.

1108
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:40,160
What kind of pterodactyl did Jesus ride?

1109
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:45,300
I just put some new YouTubes up myself.

1110
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:48,040
Just before X Day Week.

1111
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:49,500
Like the night before.

1112
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:56,320
I was up real late putting my micro-bug porn on the RevStan YouTube channel.

1113
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,460
And we watched some of it at X Day.

1114
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:01,000
Yeah, we attempted to make a narration soundtrack.

1115
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,800
I don't know how successful it was.

1116
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,080
Microbial life.

1117
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,040
Yeah, I showed it a lot.

1118
00:55:07,180 --> 00:55:07,760
When the band...

1119
00:55:08,560 --> 00:55:12,200
When Tommy Amoeba was playing, we ran the whole thing again.

1120
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:13,360
Yes, I saw that.

1121
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:17,940
And occasionally people on stage would turn around to look in wonder at the...

1122
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,260
What the hell are they playing behind me?

1123
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:20,580
Oh, my God.

1124
00:55:22,340 --> 00:55:27,600
I like when you play those old 1970s porn movie music behind the...

1125
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,400
Well, we did that, too.

1126
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,160
How did you know?

1127
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:31,260
How did you know? Yes.

1128
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,440
I know you weren't there.

1129
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,620
Did I tell you about that?

1130
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,740
Because I did do that.

1131
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:38,960
Because it had been announced previously.

1132
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,760
And I have the ears with which to sing.

1133
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:44,460
You don't remember anything else.

1134
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,620
Why would you remember that?

1135
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:47,980
Well, I remember a number of things.

1136
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:49,560
It's just the important things I cannot.

1137
00:55:49,560 --> 00:55:50,220
Oh.

1138
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:54,040
For those which are deemed important at the time.

1139
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:57,260
Well, let's be grateful that we can remember anything.

1140
00:55:58,180 --> 00:56:02,420
Because the time may come when oblivion will swallow all.

1141
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:05,640
My brain is starting to look like a little turd.

1142
00:56:06,220 --> 00:56:08,440
Well, I can't do anything about that.

1143
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:09,760
Turn into a piece of lumpage.

1144
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:13,140
But when you wake up each morning, Grasshopper,

1145
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:15,740
is that not the greatest miracle of all?

1146
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,380
No.

1147
00:56:16,500 --> 00:56:17,300
No, actually.

1148
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:18,080
Yeah.

1149
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:19,400
Believe me.

1150
00:56:19,560 --> 00:56:19,880
Believe in yourself.

1151
00:56:20,740 --> 00:56:21,260
God.

1152
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:24,840
But I want to do magic tricks like you.

1153
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:27,560
The greatest magic, my son,

1154
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:31,640
is being able to bend over and tie your shoe.

1155
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,800
Yeah, but that's crap.

1156
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:35,660
I want to know how to do miracles.

1157
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:41,120
The greatest miracle is the moon going through its faces in the sky.

1158
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:42,880
Yeah, you're full of it.

1159
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,280
I want to take a ram it out.

1160
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:45,320
Well, anyway.

1161
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:46,560
Oh, yeah.

1162
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:46,920
You know.

1163
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:48,800
What is wisdom?

1164
00:56:50,140 --> 00:56:50,620
I don't know.

1165
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:50,880
Timmy.

1166
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:52,300
I don't know.

1167
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,500
Wise answer.

1168
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:58,040
That's from the seven faces of Dr. Lowe.

1169
00:56:58,100 --> 00:56:58,420
Yes, really.

1170
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:04,080
You know, that's another one they should remake, except they won't.

1171
00:57:04,220 --> 00:57:05,320
They'd wreck it.

1172
00:57:05,340 --> 00:57:08,620
It would be full of testicle-kicking jokes.

1173
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,940
Yes, they would.

1174
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:11,120
You know, poo jokes.

1175
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:14,500
But you know why they won't make it or why they can't make it at the moment?

1176
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,820
Because the rights were bought by Michael Jackson.

1177
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:18,980
Oh, get out of here.

1178
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:23,660
You had some scheme of playing all the Tony Randall parts himself.

1179
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:27,000
Fortunately for...

1180
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,240
I hope I die soon.

1181
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,160
He died before this could happen.

1182
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,000
All Tony Randall's parts in Dr. Lowe.

1183
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:32,880
Yes, exactly.

1184
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:38,460
I bet it would be every bit as wonderful as The Wiz.

1185
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,820
That remake of Wizard of Oz starring...

1186
00:57:42,660 --> 00:57:43,820
Who's that Supreme's...

1187
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:46,860
It was Diana Ross, if I'm not mistaken.

1188
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,660
The horrible Diana Ross.

1189
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:48,880
Diana Ross.

1190
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:51,060
She's a giant clean...

1191
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:51,520
She's a giant clean...

1192
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:55,060
Close-ups of her wrinkly face as she emotes.

1193
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:56,680
Yes, I remember.

1194
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,680
Michael Jackson as the Scarecrow.

1195
00:57:58,800 --> 00:57:59,740
Yes, I remember.

1196
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:02,100
Is there another Wizard of Oz remake in the works right now?

1197
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:04,100
Andrew Michael Jackson?

1198
00:58:04,360 --> 00:58:05,600
I don't believe so, but...

1199
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,240
I can't believe I've yet done that.

1200
00:58:07,240 --> 00:58:09,680
Let us pray that it's not Tim Burton who's doing it.

1201
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:10,740
That's exactly what I feared.

1202
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,500
I often suspected that this was going to be...

1203
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:18,800
That might happen, but of course it would hew close to his reimagining of the...

1204
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:23,960
MGM Technicolor Judy Garland musical and not go back to the Oz books.

1205
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:28,460
And when that was tried some years ago by Walter Murch,

1206
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:32,320
the great sound editor who directed a version called Return to Oz...

1207
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:32,700
That was good.

1208
00:58:33,060 --> 00:58:33,740
It was good.

1209
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,720
It was right out of the original Oz books,

1210
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:37,760
and it sank like a stone.

1211
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:38,960
Right.

1212
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,140
People didn't like it.

1213
00:58:40,320 --> 00:58:41,740
Where are the munchkins?

1214
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:43,180
Where are the ruby slippers?

1215
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,340
Where's the songs?

1216
00:58:44,640 --> 00:58:46,480
No, it was not a musical.

1217
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,420
It was dark and twisted.

1218
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,480
It was dark.

1219
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:49,160
Dark and twisted.

1220
00:58:49,840 --> 00:58:55,340
And they had Oz characters like The Gump and Tick Tock

1221
00:58:55,340 --> 00:58:57,860
and all these wonderful characters, you know.

1222
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,820
Tick Tock was the person who kept on reminding them of their mortality.

1223
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:02,640
No.

1224
00:59:03,320 --> 00:59:07,020
Tick Tock is an automaton, a mechanical man,

1225
00:59:07,140 --> 00:59:09,180
but entirely operated by clockwork,

1226
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,400
and you have to keep winding him,

1227
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,560
and if his mouth keeps going but his brain winds down,

1228
00:59:13,740 --> 00:59:16,980
he starts spouting gibberish like some I could mention.

1229
00:59:17,100 --> 00:59:18,460
Speaking of clockwork...

1230
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,480
But he's also a Disney crocodile.

1231
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:22,580
Be quiet, everyone.

1232
00:59:23,040 --> 00:59:23,380
Huh?

1233
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:25,520
And with that, friends,

1234
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:30,720
the Hour of Slack is now giving way to the following show.

1235
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:31,280
Get free!

1236
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,440
Insert show name here.

1237
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:33,800
The Hour of Slack.
