1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:04,220
Most young people will continue through life as normal, responsible citizens.

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:11,460
Others, the shunted and unloved, the unguided, the seekers of thrills and kicks, are candidates

3
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,600
for the slave world of lifelong...

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,740
How does it happen?

5
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,020
Where does it start?

6
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,380
What are the signs?

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,240
The pattern is generally the same.

8
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:21,700
Bob?

9
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,900
Take a lack of responsibility, the inability to make right choices, add to it ignorance

10
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,940
and indifference, and top it off with a desire for escapism and kicks.

11
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,900
The sum total is then...

12
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:37,080
The subgenius power of SWAT.

13
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,580
This is the real action.

14
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,260
This is the test.

15
00:00:43,540 --> 00:00:45,700
The time to separate the man from the boy.

16
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:49,960
Dual power, individuality, character are slipping down the drain.

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:52,160
In their place comes Bob.

18
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,780
Don't be chicken.

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,880
Move along.

20
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:12,240
whip the ass who's dead, but who's brave.

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:12,240


22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:13,660
Unselectable.

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,200
McJoe and Tomaki, they wait in line to hide this enjoy capital where as UNO....

24
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:18,200


25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:19,960
That's what you are.

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,000
Look out for that boy.

27
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:26,880
Bread and milk, whoa.

28
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,900
Can't win by far

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,000
Everything we've seen

30
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,500
When it comes to you

31
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,260
Only means

32
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:45,000
That you haven't got a clue

33
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,560
Never before

34
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:54,480
Has someone been wrong

35
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,940
Unelectable

36
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:04,260
In every way

37
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:11,900
And you won't get in

38
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,860
Election day

39
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,200
In all the polls you're playing

40
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,980
Quite undetectable

41
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,300
Dropping out now

42
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,720
Would not be regrettable

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,580
You are such

44
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:38,680
An incredible fool

45
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,860
Who am I?

46
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:46,800
Why am I here?

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,920
I went to a number of women's groups and said,

48
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:50,900
Can you help us find folks?

49
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,480
And they brought us whole binders full of women.

50
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,480
I served in the United States Congress.

51
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,820
I took the initiative in creating the internet.

52
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,860
I would bomb the shit out of them.

53
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:04,060
You know something?

54
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,300
Not only are we going to New Hampshire, Tom Harkin,

55
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,940
We're going to South Carolina, and Oklahoma, and Arizona, and North Dakota, and New Mexico.

56
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,320
We're going to California, and Texas, and New York.

57
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,380
And we're going to South Dakota, and Oregon, and Washington, and Michigan.

58
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,180
And then we're going to Washington, D.C. to take back the world.

59
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:24,660
We're going to White House.

60
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,160
Please clap.

61
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,280
Un-electable

62
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,480
In every way

63
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,300
And you just won't win

64
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,000
Election day

65
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,440
Your stupid words are quite indefensible

66
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,340
And all your deeds beyond reprehensible

67
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:11,940
It's quite fair, you're a most incredible tool

68
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,380
Here's a setup of a real hospital

69
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,200
This is your stalemate

70
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,540
It ain't just your name

71
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:44,020
And there are more to it

72
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,980
And if you least hope for

73
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,740
We won't go away

74
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:57,920
subgenius or subgeniously types of radio shows for decades now. Thank you, Phineas Narco of

75
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:07,660
NationalCynical.com. Okay, friends, so last July at the Starwood Festival in Southern Ohio,

76
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:14,320
which is quite a bit larger than our X-Day drills, though held at the same place, we had two

77
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:20,640
two subgenius devivals. One on the main stage at prime time, which we played last week, and the one

78
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:28,120
I'm about to play, which was held on a Friday midnight in the Puffer Dome. Now, let me describe

79
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:34,980
the scene a bit here, because it's unusual even for a hippie type music and consciousness or

80
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:43,880
whatever festival. The Puffer Dome is a portable giant balloon, basically. It's a

81
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:53,000
huge half dome of thick but somewhat translucent fabric that's kept inflated by a loud exterior

82
00:05:53,000 --> 00:06:00,260
air pump. I had to filter this audio heavily to reduce that air noise. The dome will hold

83
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:07,440
a whole band and an audience with room for dancers to contort or whatnot, and it's also a

84
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:13,380
great venue for projecting videos in, partly because at night,

85
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,460
the video is being projected from both inside and outside the dome, but especially because the

86
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:28,360
videos are being projected by a professional team from New York called Waking Dream. These folks are

87
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:35,440
video artists who really know their stuff when it comes to wildly psychedelic 360-degree projections

88
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:41,880
that cover the entire surface of the dome due to the many synchronized projectors going through

89
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,200
one fancy software system.

90
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:53,740
Our old buddy in Waking Dream is Reverend James Barnes, and we've been wanting to do a show together in the Puffer Dome for some time, and we finally did.

91
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:06,560
Now, you'll just have to imagine the projections, although you can sort of see them by looking at our DVDs of trippies of genius music videos, let's call them,

92
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:13,940
most of which are on YouTube in 10-minute chunks on my YouTube channel, RevStag. One word, RevStag.

93
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:30,320
However, no one's previously seen them in this situation, where the morphing, mutating Dobbs heads and other imagery were splattered all over the entirety of the dome, including the very top, glooping and dripping.

94
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:35,040
The fact that some people in the audience may have been a little extra

95
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:44,300
enhanced by a beer or other things probably made the projections even more interesting.

96
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:56,600
So, I hope this wasn't too much of a you-had-to-have-been-there thing, but here's pretty much the whole Puffer Dome revival recorded.

97
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,920
The music is maybe too loud in the first three or four minutes, but then it calms down.

98
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,300
The music is maybe too loud in the first three or four minutes, but then it calms down.

99
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,320
The music is maybe too loud in the first three or four minutes, but then it calms down.

100
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,420
Hello, hello.

101
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,160
Test, test.

102
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:23,400
Test.

103
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,660
Testing, testing.

104
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:26,680
Am I here?

105
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,800
Where am I?

106
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,820
What the fuck happened?

107
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,380
The last time I remember, I was in elementary school trying marijuana for the first time.

108
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,200
What the hell happened?

109
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:41,560
Who are these people?

110
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
Who are you?

111
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,640
I'm a murderer.

112
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,180
I'm a murderer.

113
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,300


114
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,300


115
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,300


116
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,300


117
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,300


118
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:44,300


119
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,060
I'm a murderer.

120
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,060


121
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,060


122
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,060


123
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,060


124
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,060


125
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:50,280
Elementary school trying marijuana for the first time just a minute ago.

126
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,500
I did not know what was going on.

127
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,480
This makes perfect sense in the Twilight Zone.

128
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,060
Oh, now I remember.

129
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,880
Now I remember it's that church in the front of the music thing.

130
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:12,040
I recognize that guy if there's a pipe anywhere.

131
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,300
Oh, now I remember.

132
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:19,100
I'm careful not to look up, because that makes me want to fall down.

133
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,000
Friends, if you're sitting down, go ahead and look up all you want.

134
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,100
But if you're standing up, look down all you want.

135
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:36,520
Because, uh, who knows, we're all going to fall right down.

136
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:48,080
I guess, uh, I guess this is the subgenie's new final in the Popper Diamond.

137
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,060
This is the first time that's happened in about ten years.

138
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:58,060
Don't get too excited. The last time it happened, half of the fans died.

139
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:05,940
But, uh, well, heck, well, heck, fine, pardon my language.

140
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,580
Let's go ahead and do a Christ Bob. Christ Bob!

141
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,700
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

142
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,240
That wasn't bad.

143
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,660
Let's have another one on three.

144
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,960
A concerted Christ Bob. Keep your pants zipped up, boys.

145
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,840
We're running into the pit park again.

146
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,200
One, two, three, Christ Bob!

147
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,760
Well, that was pathetic, but we'll move on.

148
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,060
That's alright.

149
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,260
I can...

150
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,820
somewhat see in here, but I can't hear.

151
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:46,320
So, that's fine. That's good. I won't hear any hecklers.

152
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,500
How about these kids in here?

153
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,260
You know, everybody except me can hear everything.

154
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:57,820
Everybody else said there are no secrets in the Popper Diamond.

155
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:05,960
On the other hand, what happens at Starwood, let's all agree, stays at Starwood, just in case.

156
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,580
Let's go!

157
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:18,000
I see there are some new people and people who are strangers to me here.

158
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:24,340
And you may not know anything about this bizarre church of a subgenius thing.

159
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:29,620
Or you may possibly not even know who J.R. Bob Dobbs is.

160
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:31,600
Maybe he hasn't sold you anything yet.

161
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:35,080
Well, guess what? I'm not going to explain any of it.

162
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,020
In fact, where's my script?

163
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:43,160
No! I forgot my script!

164
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,600
Oh, Jesus! I'm going to have to do all of this off the top of my head.

165
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:56,860
Oh, how does that go? B-O-B. Yeah, that's what... No. No, it's quote. B-O-B. Unquote.

166
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:01,840
That is how you tell the amateurs from the real subgeniuses.

167
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,700
The real subgeniuses can spell Bob.

168
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,500
And it takes five characters.

169
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:13,200
If you leave the court marks off, it's just any old Bob.

170
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,320
Do we have any Bobs in the house tonight?

171
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:19,380
I'm just curious. It's the most common name in the English language.

172
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,340
I'm not going to do anything to you. Any Roberts?

173
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:25,280
No? That's weird.

174
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,380
Let's find out if they're lying.

175
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:29,980
Any Smiths?

176
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,280
Yes.

177
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:37,700
Goddamn! What is going on here? No, there's no one on the screen named Bob.

178
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:44,400
Thank God! Now, if only I didn't have to look at his face again. This is my boss!

179
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,440
Oh, well. It's kind of demeaning to worship your boss.

180
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,320
But we do worship Bob.

181
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,380
J.R. Bob Dobbs is his name.

182
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:01,360
And he is the Saint of Sales, among many, many other things.

183
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:03,640
He's also kind of a pervert.

184
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,880
I mean, I know he looks like a family guy and everything.

185
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:21,160
Michael Lewis is telling me that he knows some, like, dungeon-owning professional perverts who do S&M and all that kind of fun.

186
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,720
The really fun, damn home-perverted stuff.

187
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:27,140
And they've got a giant dog's head in their dungeon.

188
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,440
And that's the new thing.

189
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,920
And at first, I thought, well, wait a minute. Here's my royalties.

190
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,360
But on the other hand, we did say that Bob was up for any program.

191
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:46,780
He does have a wife at every stage. And he makes some sweet, sweet love to the absolute farm animals.

192
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,440
Which I understand.

193
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,180
Obama just made legal for anybody.

194
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,620
Oh, anybody can marry anything now.

195
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,240
Well, I guess why don't we just all marry each other?

196
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:00,500
I'm a preacher. So let's do a quick one.

197
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:09,420
I now pronounce you all man and wife and man and man and wife and wife and kid and wife and man and wallet and car keys.

198
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:13,240
Wouldn't it be great if you could stay married to your car keys?

199
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,400
Or your camera batteries?

200
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,900
So, yeah.

201
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:25,760
Once again, I'm in a room full of weird music and weird noise.

202
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,420
And everybody's staring at me.

203
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,080
Okay, fine.

204
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,120
Well, I can live with that.

205
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:48,700
I had a friend who told me that we're all being stared at all the time by the nationals and security agents at the NSA.

206
00:14:48,700 --> 00:15:00,080
Because, as she explained to me, all those things that we see in the sky look kinda like birds, hogs, especially.

207
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,000
She said those aren't real hogs.

208
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:02,440
You can tell.

209
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,340
Hogs only travel in pairs.

210
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,680
He's traveling free.

211
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,920
That means they're drones!

212
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,500
Drones are watching us all the time.

213
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:16,160
Don't you feel sorry for the poor sons of bitches monitoring all those thousands of drones?

214
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,100
What a boring sight.

215
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:18,980
Just like that must be.

216
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:25,140
Privacy being a big concern in the United States.

217
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:30,580
Of course, everybody's paranoid about having their information stolen.

218
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,200
At the same time that they're pouring all their information onto Facebook.

219
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,340
With their unpaid 24-7 data entry job for Facebook.

220
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,880
Vying for Big Brother's attention.

221
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,040
Now, I'm kinda glad to see there's...

222
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,780
I don't see anybody punching, texting right now.

223
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,420
And that's reassuring to me.

224
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:01,560
Mainly because I'm jealous that everybody could afford one of those fancy-schmancy new phones.

225
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:04,380
The phones that watch you back.

226
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,580
And who knows where they sound all that information from.

227
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:12,720
Who cares?

228
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,140
Because what the hell can we do about it anyway?

229
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:24,560
So we might as well relax and sink into the word of Bob.

230
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:34,980
And the easiest way to do that, really, is to forget his words and just look at that damn face.

231
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:42,360
If you look at that damn face long enough, oh, you'll see Bob all right.

232
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,060
You'll see right through the dots and...

233
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,160
And you have contrast shadows.

234
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,980
You'll start seeing...

235
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:52,080
Notice the pipe.

236
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:56,740
It's kind of an inverted dome, isn't it?

237
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,580
Now, where are we sinking?

238
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,540
Oh my God! We're in a dome.

239
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,120
Dude, it's not upside down like Bob's pipe.

240
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,500
Or is it? Maybe Bob's pipe is the dome.

241
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,740
It's right side up.

242
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,920
And we're the ones that are upside down.

243
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:27,020
Were this dome the bowl of Bob's pipe, there should be a stem.

244
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,620
We should be able to punch a hole through the top of this thing and run down the stem and escape.

245
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,640
But no.

246
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,960
They've got the bowl of blood.

247
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,840
It must be tamped.

248
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,300
Look at this.

249
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:54,300
If this was Bob's pipe, upside down, and we're in it, then we must have...

250
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,840
And we're not burning up.

251
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:01,000
Well, then it must not be Bob's pipe, because Bob's pipe never goes out.

252
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,400
And you see a turn of flame.

253
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,200
So maybe I'm just high and I just had a weird idea.

254
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,420
Okay, that's happened before. We'll leave it at that.

255
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,940
Actually, I'm not high.

256
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,040
I'm working.

257
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:19,060
The minute, the minute it turns 130, I'm out of here, dude.

258
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,900
Because it's Star Wars, right?

259
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,720
But, um...

260
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:33,840
You know, I like that bowl almost better than the big bowl.

261
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:37,380
This little bowl, for the benefit of the radio audience,

262
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:44,920
we're inside a big inflatable dome, video projected 360 degrees all around,

263
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:48,480
from my old DVDs, mostly.

264
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:54,720
But there's a fish-eyed lens glass bowl in the center of the room,

265
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:57,900
reflecting the bowl above.

266
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,840
As above, so below.

267
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,580
The old occult...

268
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,940
Well, that's from Occult 101.

269
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:11,780
And I suppose I could stand here and teach you all Occult 101.

270
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:14,380
And I will. Here it is.

271
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,760
There is no Occult 102!

272
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,880
You have graduated already!

273
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:26,520
As of this moment, any bullshit you utter to any fellow weirdo or new-ager

274
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,620
is officially basics in Occult 102.

275
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:34,920
You don't really have to have it.

276
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:42,480
You have a degree in the paranormal, the occult, psychedelics, tripping,

277
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:48,800
masturbation, or any of the cool stuff that happens in these hempen festivals.

278
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,900
Isn't that great?

279
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:51,960
You can all go home and go,

280
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,280
Man, I already know Occult 102!

281
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:58,500
And it's whatever you come up with off the top of your head.

282
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:04,080
No offense to those who pay to all the way up through Occult...

283
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,260
But, at 110, you were ripped off. Sorry!

284
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,800
It was all bullshit.

285
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:21,240
I hate to tell you, but the Rosicrucian religion, upon which much of the New Age spin-offs,

286
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:25,420
including Theosophy and Giles Bay, all that stuff,

287
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:33,960
came from a couple of pamphlets written by Christian Rosicrucians, okay?

288
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:39,960
Back in the late 1600s, early 1700s, I don't remember,

289
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:44,240
but the important thing is, these two...

290
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,320
There was no Christian Rosicrucians. It was a made-up character.

291
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:53,120
These two jokers got drunk or high, sat down and made up a bunch of crap

292
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:58,580
that sort of poked fun at the occult beliefs of their day.

293
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,480
Actually, that included the scientific beliefs of their day,

294
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,900
because they were pretty much all the same.

295
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:05,600
Okay, nonsense.

296
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:13,200
But, oddly enough, the intellectuals and the smarty-pants of the time

297
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,820
read those satirical pamphlets and went,

298
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:20,360
This is the truth! They may claim they're joking, but it's really the truth!

299
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:25,220
And from that, the authors of it went on to say,

300
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,760
Look, you guys, we just got high and did this creepy pamphlet.

301
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,520
Why are you forming entire religions based on that?

302
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:34,100
Well, praise Bob!

303
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,260
Anybody can do it! That's what I learned!

304
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:44,360
Anybody can sit down and make up a bunch of satirical stuff

305
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:50,460
about the ridiculous occult and New Age-ish and unscientific beliefs of their time

306
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:52,440
and start a whole religion!

307
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:58,100
Now, in the case of L. Ron Hubbard, he was able to keep a straight face.

308
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,920
Now, what's that?

309
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,760
In the case of Churchill and the subgenius, well,

310
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,940
we didn't have to make up a bunch of bullshit

311
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,380
because we knew Bob!

312
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:10,520
The real Bob Dobbs, and he had the real truth!

313
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,640
So when you read our satirical pamphlet

314
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,660
and start some tyrannical religion off of it,

315
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,320
you're doing the right thing!

316
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,200
As long as you pay it to J. R. Bob Dobbs,

317
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,780
that which is Bob's.

318
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:29,700
Which, in this particular case, is everything.

319
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:32,020
Your wallet, your whole wallet,

320
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,140
not just the money in it,

321
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,940
if you want to get right with Bob,

322
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,520
you've given your damn wallet!

323
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:42,500
With the Social Security card, the library card, driver's license, everything.

324
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,620
You may laugh, but people have actually done that thing!

325
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,780
We've gotten whole wallets in the mail from people.

326
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,860
Those are the true believers!

327
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,520
Okay, I'll admit, only one guy actually did it.

328
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,020
Prove quietly.

329
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,100
And he kind of quit.

330
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:02,000
So he needs to run the diva.

331
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:02,580
You know, the go-do conventions!

332
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:10,440
Why would there be so much cross-over between subgenius and de-evolution?

333
00:23:11,240 --> 00:23:12,800
That's a head-scratcher!

334
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,480
But on the other hand, as the great Dennis Murphy said,

335
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,180
Subgenius. It's a no-brainer!

336
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:29,240
We use that phrase on the back of our third book, the Bobliographon,

337
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:31,220
and when I show it to Dennis,

338
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,380
And he said, hey, you said that.

339
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:35,320
And he went, I did?

340
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:41,560
And then, like I do all the time, he thought of Jamie Hendrix and said,

341
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:45,280
well, if I said that, then you better pick up on it.

342
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,600
I'm down with your product.

343
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,500
You don't have to do anything.

344
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,960
Do you hear the voices?

345
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:53,740
Yes.

346
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,000
I heard something.

347
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,560
What a thing.

348
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:04,940
Of course, you know, out here in the middle of nowhere, Ohio,

349
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:08,500
Ohio's outback, they actually call this area.

350
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:13,560
You know, we're surrounded by cannibal rednecks.

351
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:20,400
My lovely wife, who says we are, doesn't believe that there are such things as cannibal rednecks.

352
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:24,100
But I think that's because she hasn't seen enough horror movies.

353
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:27,060
Well, I know there are cannibal rednecks.

354
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:27,540
There's cannibal rednecks.

355
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:32,480
Hey, remember what happens to the story that stays in the story?

356
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,980
I am one of those cannibal rednecks.

357
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:37,200
Okay.

358
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,600
And, you know, tomorrow I have to do a series of preaching.

359
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:49,100
And that will be, just remember, when I'm making fun of all those rednecks,

360
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,280
I know it.

361
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:55,020
I know where I'm going to speak, because that's where I'm from.

362
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:57,340
They're the down.

363
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,620
I'm going for real people.

364
00:24:58,860 --> 00:24:59,940
They're ignorant.

365
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,820
Plain, ordinary Americans.

366
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:04,700
Most of whom hate everything.

367
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,820
Uh, that's not...

368
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:07,180
Wow.

369
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,200
God damn it.

370
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:08,500
That's true.

371
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:11,880
That's...

372
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:15,880
I was about to start delineating all the software.

373
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,600
That would be cheating.

374
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:21,980
Uh, okay.

375
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:22,680
Uh...

376
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:23,980
Oh!

377
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,100
How many people here are on drugs?

378
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:27,540
Are you ready?

379
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:29,940
Okay, everybody.

380
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,640
Isn't that what I thought?

381
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:32,580
Good.

382
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:33,680
And I can...

383
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,580
I probably should just shut up and lay down on the ground and look at the ceiling.

384
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,060
You know, I mean, really, the music is great.

385
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,900
The visuals are great.

386
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,600
I feel like I'm just kind of muddying the waters here.

387
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:54,800
I guess I should describe what the Church of Subgenius is really all about.

388
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:56,820
And we're serious about this.

389
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,080
We're serious about this.

390
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,180
Splat.

391
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,020
Slap.

392
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:03,440
Yeah, boss.

393
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,200
Just close those doors.

394
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:19,800
And then take them themselves and open the door the whole company gets out there.

395
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,520
And take a list and just go...

396
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,020
And get down on the tree.

397
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,020


398
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:25,200
Yeah.

399
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,000
now, doesn't it?

400
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,760
But I'm keeping Freud and Mr. Boss

401
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,780
at the same time.

402
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,340
And I know you can raise your balls for a time.

403
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,240
I'm glad to see this stuff.

404
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,280
It looks great.

405
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,440
The dots of Bob are raining down.

406
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:43,620
No, Bob!

407
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,480
He's like a pipe!

408
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,900
And now we're being held

409
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,240
in the boss's third eye.

410
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:52,880
No!

411
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:55,740
It's making me disappointed.

412
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,880
Catch me if I fall down.

413
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,940
So this is what it's like

414
00:26:59,940 --> 00:27:01,640
to be smoked by Bob.

415
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:06,460
Just throw yourself into that damn pipe.

416
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,680
Let him smoke you.

417
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:11,540
You'll travel as a little smoke particle

418
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,400
with intelligence or something

419
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,380
down the stem

420
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:18,380
into Bob's mouth

421
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,420
and then down his goozle

422
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,440
into his lungs.

423
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,360
Actually, the goozle leads to the stomach.

424
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:28,260
And then from the lungs,

425
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:30,640
you as the Bob smoke particle.

426
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,820
Oh, no.

427
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:35,320
You get absorbed.

428
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,520
Look at that.

429
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:39,460
Capillary of the lungs

430
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:40,600
and then you're in the blood

431
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,780
and then next thing you know,

432
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,040
you hit Bob's brain.

433
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,100
And then this happens.

434
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,640
And then he knows everything about you.

435
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,220
And then he knows everything about you.

436
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,820
And then he's completely bored

437
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,820
and takes another sip.

438
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,140
And now,

439
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:00,960
this is fabulous.

440
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,580
This really is like being smoked by Bob.

441
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,560
You and your needs.

442
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:05,640
Defeat your code.

443
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:14,040
I'm sorry, I'm flabbergasted myself.

444
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,100
I've seen this footage,

445
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,260
but not like this.

446
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,560
Respecting you and your needs.

447
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,640
I'm quitting charts.

448
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,540
As of this month,

449
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,480
who needs LSD

450
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,280
when you've gotten away?

451
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,360
This is a rather expensive trip.

452
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,580
There's a bumper down

453
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,260
and all that video equipment.

454
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:33,680
The projector's actually

455
00:28:34,280 --> 00:28:36,380
probably cost more than you can get

456
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:37,520
a bad look at your beads.

457
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,060
But why not both?

458
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,440
That is the point.

459
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,660
That is a new message

460
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,820
of the Church of the Sub-G.

461
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:44,560
Why not both?

462
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,500
There's always this duality thing.

463
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,460
Well, you either have a job

464
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,060
or have a life.

465
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,260
You and your needs.

466
00:28:53,260 --> 00:28:55,640
No, you can't actually have both.

467
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,740
Only if you're either a Republican

468
00:28:58,740 --> 00:28:59,860
or you're a Democrat.

469
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:02,980
Why not both and everything else?

470
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,460
Throw in the greens.

471
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:04,920
Hell.

472
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,220
And look, credits.

473
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:10,480
You don't get that with reality often.

474
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,700
But they were less like.

475
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:19,980
Sub-genius, it says.

476
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,520
What does that mean?

477
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:22,220
Oh, they know.

478
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,040
They're smart.

479
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,580
They're geniuses.

480
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,420
No, actually, technically,

481
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,400
sub-genius means anything

482
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:30,900
below a genius.

483
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:34,280
That means most of the people here

484
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:34,760
qualify.

485
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,180
Except you also have to have

486
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:38,780
$35.

487
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,000
$35.

488
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:41,960
$35 to become

489
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,340
an ordained sub-genius minister.

490
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,480
Then you've been noticed by Bob

491
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:49,000
after I put the day in.

492
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,200
Then you have to be

493
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:52,280
a member of the church.

494
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,060
You have access to, oh, what are the benefits

495
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,780
of membership in the church and sub-genius?

496
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,200
A bunch of lame stuff.

497
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,400
Plus, eternal life.

498
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,300
Well, eternal salvation.

499
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,000
I should have put your money back.

500
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:09,740
It's the wellness office.

501
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:16,260
But, you know, eternity is boring.

502
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:18,240
Seriously.

503
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,620
Well, don't take my word for it.

504
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:21,320
Um.

505
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,320
But it's got to be.

506
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:24,780
Eternal life.

507
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:25,560
Eternal.

508
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,980
It's eventually going to get boring.

509
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,400
Unless you're a sub-genius.

510
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,620
Because another benefit is

511
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:35,940
you get to choose to die if you want to.

512
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:38,280
That doesn't happen in the Christian heaven.

513
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,700
You're stuck there.

514
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,280
Or the Christian hell,

515
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,440
which happens to also be the sub-genius heaven.

516
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,460
Only we're the demons.

517
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,380
It's really fun.

518
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,000
Tormenting Red Men.

519
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,760
Not that I have anything, really.

520
00:30:55,880 --> 00:31:01,880
Not that we have anything against Jesus or Muhammad or any of those guys.

521
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:06,500
It's always been the fan club that causes the problems.

522
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:09,160
Well, no, maybe they cause the problems, too.

523
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,920
Show them all what Bob Sawyer did.

524
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:14,080
Bob saw that I smoked at Doc's Salons.

525
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:16,400
Damn straight.

526
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:19,560
God.

527
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:20,740
Okay.

528
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:21,980
I'm going to go to the bathroom.

529
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:21,980


530
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:21,980


531
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:21,980


532
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,040
Okay.

533
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:23,980
Now.

534
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,480
Are we coming down yet?

535
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,220
Oh, no.

536
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:31,420
It's just, we're just in the beginning.

537
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,900
We're still peaking.

538
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:34,720
Uh-oh.

539
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,040
I didn't just smoke that joint.

540
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,460
I was peaking.

541
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:39,660
That's always a mistake.

542
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,300
You're ever the same shit, though.

543
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,260
No, I'm sorry.

544
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:47,320
I've got to accept no responsibility for your bummers or freak-outs.

545
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:51,720
But let's look at it as practice for the real world.

546
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:54,340
Which will get a lot worse.

547
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:58,200
Does anybody here read science fiction and fantasy a lot?

548
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:05,500
Well, if you're into religion, that's covered, too.

549
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,500
Sound different.

550
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:16,280
I kind of got bored with sci-fi and fantasy as I started reading history and science.

551
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:21,200
And they were far more psychedelic, terrifying, and insane.

552
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,700
Yeah.

553
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,720
Than anything, any of the sci-fi writers have come up with.

554
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,600
I've got to avoid looking up, man.

555
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,240
That's really.

556
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:37,260
I wish the radio audience could see what we're seeing now.

557
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:42,780
And if they keep their eyes closed long enough, they would.

558
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,040
Ever try a sensory deprivation game?

559
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,400
Ace used to have one.

560
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:58,660
I tried that a few times, hoping to turn into an Australopithecus or at least a harmless

561
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,560
mob from the beginning of time.

562
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,880
Like in that movie, Altered State.

563
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,820
But I kept falling asleep.

564
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,740
I guess you have to have the cat to meet you.

565
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:12,840
So, um...

566
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:20,140
I feel like I should do something for the audience participation.

567
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,140
I should, but...

568
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,880
But I have no idea what.

569
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,460
Really.

570
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,140
You know, we don't, uh...

571
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,060
I can have everybody get a Christ-Bob, Christ-Bob over and over again.

572
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,740
I did that.

573
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:36,000
You know, every new subgenius does that for 10 years.

574
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,500
Eventually it gets old.

575
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,240
As I was saying, eternity gets old.

576
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,600
So...

577
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:46,500
So, how do you keep eternity from getting boring?

578
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:47,880
Slash.

579
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:51,080
Oh, but then the question comes up.

580
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,960
What is Slash?

581
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,640
Well, when I was younger, I thought, well, Slash would be, you know, getting rich and,

582
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:06,400
um, being able to have any material thing I wanted and, uh, I guess have sex with tons

583
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,640
of whatever it was I wanted to have sex with.

584
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,920
And I tried that and it got old real fast.

585
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,440
Isn't that amazing?

586
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:17,720
So I gave all my money away to, uh, um, just a nothing.

587
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:17,860
Nothing.

588
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,040
Nothing.

589
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,040


590
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,040


591
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,040


592
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:18,080
And I didn't even remember.

593
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:23,240
That's how little, how little that material stuff means and that's why you should go ahead

594
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,380
and give what you have left to the church.

595
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,960
But in the meantime, we did, uh, I...

596
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:31,380
Honestly, uh, it got to where...

597
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:40,200
I personally decided that, uh, Slash really does come first.

598
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:44,880
There's a lot of bullshit, funny bullshit in the Church of Subgenius, but there's a

599
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,040
couple of things that are real.

600
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,860
One is our, our, um, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our,

601
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:47,860


602
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:53,920
only single law which is, pardon my language, fuck them if they can't take a joke.

603
00:34:55,420 --> 00:35:00,800
And a lot of them can't. A lot of them can't even tell a joke.

604
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:11,900
I can't get over this. But then the Slack thing. So I thought, well, if Slack isn't

605
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:16,300
that, it must be something else. I took in Slack from different things.

606
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:26,800
And it sinks in that, okay, the conspiracy of the normal people wants Slack to be the same thing for everybody

607
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:32,580
and it's something they can sell. It might be their brand of beer, their TV show, or both.

608
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:40,280
And of course, we all know, no, man, Slack is my favorite TV show. And a joy.

609
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,880
Not a bit. Or a bit.

610
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:42,560
I don't know what you're pointing out about it.

611
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:50,240
But even then, when you really get down to it, no, Slack is totally different for each person.

612
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:58,440
And there is no way that a real subgenius will ever try to tell anybody else what their Slack is going to be.

613
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:03,360
That is our message of Slack. You have to find it for yourself.

614
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,900
Everything else is false Slack. All the money, the pills, the sex.

615
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,340
Well, as one subgenius said,

616
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,680
False Slack is better than no Slack at all.

617
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:22,980
But as a smarter subgenius said, false Slack is no Slack at all.

618
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:30,420
It might help while away the time, but really, that's just going to distract you.

619
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:41,440
So when somebody else tries to tell you which house you should get Slack and what slacking is and this band or that form of blowing things off, whatever, no.

620
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,820
For a lot of us, Slack is work.

621
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,960
The kind of work we wanted to do.

622
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,500
Wouldn't it be great if that's what they paid us for?

623
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,540
And in some cases, that happens.

624
00:36:53,260 --> 00:37:01,000
Sometimes it takes 20 years before you get paid to teach conspiracy theory to college students.

625
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:03,760
Which a friend of mine actually does.

626
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,140
But it did take her a while, but now she's got what she wanted.

627
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,860
Others of us may go,

628
00:37:10,860 --> 00:37:15,980
Oh yeah, Slack would be if I got this one career I want.

629
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,800
Or this one spouse or whatever I want.

630
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:25,080
But then you get it, and it's not quite really Slack.

631
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,800
And then something terrible happens.

632
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,060
Something really god awful.

633
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:36,760
I mean, somebody dies, or you lose a body part, or whatever.

634
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:40,380
And you're forced to shift gears.

635
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:43,620
You're yanked out of the rut by this so-called disaster.

636
00:37:44,040 --> 00:37:57,080
And once you're out of the rut, all of a sudden, well, by golly, it seems like you found something new that you fell into or forced into because of the so-called disaster that was better.

637
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:00,220
And that's what we call involuntary Slack.

638
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,480
That's why we say, repent, quit your job, and Slack off.

639
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:10,360
Because the worst thing that happens when you quit your job is, in most cases, you get a better job.

640
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:14,440
It's a great idea.

641
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,700
It's true, it's true.

642
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:19,940
I mean, wouldn't it be great if they didn't exactly have to have jobs?

643
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:23,460
But we're still on planet Earth.

644
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,460
That today didn't happen.

645
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,520
It will one of these days.

646
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:30,660
I'm sure.

647
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:36,900
Yes, we say, what's today, Friday?

648
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,280
It was just last Sunday.

649
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:45,020
I was standing in the stone circle down the road there at 7 in the morning.

650
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:49,600
I shouldn't complain because that's only one day a year I have to get up that early.

651
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:52,340
Now, the kids are bright.

652
00:38:52,780 --> 00:39:04,300
But, and we waited for the saucers like we do every single year since the one the conspiracy calls 1998.

653
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:08,820
For those not in the know, our guru, J.R. Bach,

654
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:20,700
predicted that on July 5th, 1998, at 7 in the morning, the saucers from Planet X would come and save all the subgeniuses.

655
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:26,020
Not only that, we'd get our own Death Stars of whatever we wanted to imagine them to be,

656
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:29,600
which we could then use to get revenge on everybody who didn't like.

657
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,480
Except for the ones who also bought $35 of genius membership.

658
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:37,980
That's a whole other question we don't want to take about.

659
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:47,460
And every year for 18 years in a row now, the saucers didn't come.

660
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:50,860
Christ, Bob, that just proves they could come any second!

661
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,940
They could come in the next 5 seconds!

662
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,520
2, 3, 1 second!

663
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,820
Well, they didn't.

664
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,220
But, they could.

665
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:01,380
The important thing is, are you ready?

666
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:04,700
Do you have that little minister's card in your pocket?

667
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:07,540
The $35 minister's card.

668
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:15,280
That's all it takes to achieve achievingness without trying.

669
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:18,520
Because that's what Bob could do.

670
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:22,140
As a subgenius, Bob isn't smart.

671
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:26,540
He doesn't have to know much of anything.

672
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:29,000
He only has to be lucky.

673
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:35,580
Friends, when was the last time being smart got you laid?

674
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:37,340
Actually, I shouldn't ask that.

675
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:40,740
It probably worked several times for a few people.

676
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:45,140
But, you know, when was the last time being smart got you a head in a job?

677
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:46,000
No, sir!

678
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:50,960
Act like a dumb shit and they'll not just treat you as an equal, they'll probably give you a raise!

679
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,280
Act like a dumb shit and they'll give you a raise.

680
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:56,440
There's a new version that Bob's old saying.

681
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,240
But really, it's luck.

682
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,460
More than smart.

683
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:08,240
And that's what Bob has that we don't as much.

684
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,700
On the other hand, have you really counted your blessings, my friend?

685
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,340
Are you going to have to...

686
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:22,100
Is that terrible moment of involuntary slap going to have to happen before you realize,

687
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:27,500
Oh, I actually did have slap before my car was wrecked.

688
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,040
Oh, I actually did have slap before my dog died.

689
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:32,420
You know?

690
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,300
Now, slap is some simple things.

691
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:39,640
Having that dog might be all you needed for true slap.

692
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,280
Helps to have an inheritance, I suppose.

693
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:48,020
But, on the other hand, don't envy the rich.

694
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,620
I know a few of them, but not very well.

695
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:52,100
Or I hate one.

696
00:41:53,420 --> 00:42:02,260
But my experience has been that getting everything given to you so that you never have to...

697
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:06,260
deal with the consequences of your decisions.

698
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,740
That turns you into a moral.

699
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,620
Worse than a moral.

700
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:16,120
Having to deal with the consequences of your decisions is what makes useless.

701
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:20,740
I hesitate to say smarter, but certainly more aware...

702
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:27,320
and appreciative of the slap you had before you made that dumb move.

703
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:30,980
And one head drunk, get ever clear.

704
00:42:30,980 --> 00:42:32,220
Like God.

705
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,020
There was a guy walking around with X-Day.

706
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:38,080
He's a wonderful fellow, vicious stick.

707
00:42:38,560 --> 00:42:44,760
But he made the mistake of forgetting what happened the last time he drank Everclear.

708
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:50,380
And he was walking around with a bottle of Everclear, trying to get people to share it.

709
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:56,800
And I got on the internet after X-Day, and boy, a lot of people had got kind of injured and sick...

710
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,900
just from a little bit of that stuff.

711
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:00,960
And I said to him,

712
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:05,180
Well, you know, when Bishop Stick tried to force that down my throat, I just said no.

713
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:08,500
And the most common reaction was,

714
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,540
You could do that?

715
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:18,060
So don't feel bad, you know, when the next star-worn hippie comes up and goes,

716
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:21,200
Here, put this on your tongue and swallow it.

717
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,600
You don't really have to.

718
00:43:23,260 --> 00:43:25,900
You know, there's no rule, but it's due.

719
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,960
Back in the 70s, of course, you had to take any drug anybody gave you.

720
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:31,920
Just to be cool.

721
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:33,560
But things have changed.

722
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:40,460
It's perfectly cool to not be on drugs and simply stare at that face of Bob up there.

723
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:43,740
Which, by God, I'm only going to have to do for another 15 minutes.

724
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,440
It's great when you first start off, you know.

725
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:54,800
That's one reason why we preach to our...

726
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,040
believers.

727
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,760
And it's kind of, you know,

728
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:03,460
Leave me out of it, is what most of them do.

729
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:11,100
Go ahead and, you know, don't get too into Bob as a religious nut.

730
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:17,340
It's okay to out-coot the Jehovah's Witnesses waiting for the saucers every year.

731
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:22,440
But you don't have to be a complete fanatic forever.

732
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,640
You have to be a complete fanatic for a measured amount of time.

733
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:30,500
Your priest will let you know when to stop saying praise Bob.

734
00:44:30,500 --> 00:44:32,720
Sticking pins in your eyeballs.

735
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:38,580
But, you know, we're trying to encourage people to, well, not exactly think for themselves.

736
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,260
That gets you into trouble.

737
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:45,660
But we're not telling you what to think.

738
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:47,500
Just how to think.

739
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:51,120
Bob isn't the answer and neither is anything else.

740
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:55,280
So in order not to become some kind of a subgenius cougar,

741
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:58,820
and I think we all know one or two of those,

742
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,600
you have to pee on his head.

743
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:04,460
Or else I'll kill him.

744
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,820
You know, the Buddha said,

745
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:09,900
if you leave the Buddha on the highway,

746
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:10,640
kill him!

747
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:14,180
I don't know why he said that,

748
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,280
but I certainly understand why Bob did.

749
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,400
He's invulnerable.

750
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,060
You can blow him up and he's like a cartoon character.

751
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,620
He comes back with a band-aid on his head.

752
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:24,140
Something like that.

753
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,220
But that's not true of you.

754
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,460
And you have to...

755
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:33,480
You have to free yourself from this baleful influence sooner or later.

756
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:35,420
The simplest thing to do,

757
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:38,400
maybe as soon as you get out of this pump or down,

758
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:40,060
find a picture of Bob,

759
00:45:40,820 --> 00:45:42,340
we sell them for $35,

760
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:44,040
and put...

761
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:47,180
Just throw that picture of Bob on the ground

762
00:45:47,820 --> 00:45:49,180
and pee on it!

763
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:51,440
Go ahead and pee on it!

764
00:45:51,660 --> 00:45:53,380
He's got his stock smiling.

765
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,840
He will not drown.

766
00:45:55,160 --> 00:45:56,960
His pipe will not go out.

767
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,680
None of those things will happen.

768
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,820
But you will feel better,

769
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,500
for one thing,

770
00:46:01,560 --> 00:46:01,900
before.

771
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:03,660
For another thing,

772
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:04,500
you peed on Bob!

773
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:08,220
You freed yourself from that crazy...

774
00:46:08,220 --> 00:46:09,000
You know, the...

775
00:46:09,940 --> 00:46:12,420
Actually, I've noticed that it didn't take much

776
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:14,300
for some Catholics to free themselves

777
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,740
from the Pope recently.

778
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:18,580
As soon as he mentioned climate change,

779
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,400
oh, I quit!

780
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:22,520
I'm leaving Catholicism no more.

781
00:46:22,820 --> 00:46:26,120
Because the Pope proved himself to be a libtard.

782
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,660
One of them climate believers.

783
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:29,260
What?

784
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,520
Well, that's just crazy.

785
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,660
I don't believe in the devil.

786
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:31,960
Instead,

787
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:35,100
the devil is a climate change denier,

788
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:35,580
like me!

789
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:37,900
Passed enough already.

790
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:38,740
I...

791
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:38,980
I...

792
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,120
And, uh...

793
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:43,560
That raises to the devil.

794
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,300
I'll go ahead and ask you,

795
00:46:48,360 --> 00:46:49,620
are there any Satanists here?

796
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:51,880
See, not one.

797
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:55,220
Now, at one Starwood,

798
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:57,660
during the afternoon,

799
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,280
and we had a really good turnout,

800
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,460
there must have been,

801
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,560
oh, a couple hundred,

802
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:04,520
maybe twice that many people in the audience,

803
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:09,740
and there had been a flyer going around the little town nearby

804
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:12,820
about signs of Satanism and witchcraft,

805
00:47:13,020 --> 00:47:13,280
you know,

806
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,380
everything from a peace sign to Mickey Mouse,

807
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:18,460
you know, signs of Satanism and witchcraft.

808
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:19,400
And I thought,

809
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,320
well, let's see how we're at this pagan witch druid festival,

810
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,100
let's see how many people are actually believing the devil.

811
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,180
So I said,

812
00:47:27,200 --> 00:47:29,820
is anybody here even a Satanist?

813
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,460
Way in the back,

814
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:33,100
there was one punk kid,

815
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,360
this is from the 90s,

816
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:38,520
kind of hesitantly raised his hand and pulled it back down.

817
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:39,500
Why?

818
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:41,960
Believer in the devil.

819
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,560
Because to believe in the devil,

820
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:47,340
first you have to believe in the Bible!

821
00:47:48,700 --> 00:47:51,240
Or one of those holy books.

822
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:54,680
You kind of have to be a Christian to believe in the devil.

823
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:56,860
In a church of subgenius,

824
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,900
you don't have to believe in the devil,

825
00:47:58,940 --> 00:47:59,480
but you can.

826
00:47:59,720 --> 00:48:01,340
You can believe in anything!

827
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:02,020
Wow!

828
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:05,120
And then form your own heretical schism.

829
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,180
That's kind of what it's all about.

830
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:10,000
My favorite heretical schism was

831
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,540
the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer Wanchus to Satan.

832
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:18,280
Because it made so little sense,

833
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:19,920
it was perfect!

834
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:24,580
I actually had religious feelings during Pentecost,

835
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:28,040
and we weren't really even using the wheel on the palms.

836
00:48:29,020 --> 00:48:32,460
We'd just go find any golfer down at the golf course,

837
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:35,280
kidnap any cat, take it down,

838
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,800
and say it was Arnold Palmer.

839
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,300
But you still got a feeling, you know?

840
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:42,920
Because, bottom line,

841
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,780
POSSEBOS WORK!

842
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:50,260
Unfortunately, any of your POSSEBOS that you score,

843
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,280
as of the time you leave this dome,

844
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:55,680
they won't work anymore.

845
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:02,220
The church of the subgenius destroys all other POSSEBOS.

846
00:49:04,460 --> 00:49:08,260
But hey, you know, if it works,

847
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:11,800
I mean, that's because it replaces all the other POSSEBOS.

848
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:14,640
Man!

849
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:17,980
The normal state of rupture...

850
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:20,000
It's like cobblestones at that end.

851
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:22,520
It's so weird.

852
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:24,260
Every little flash of light,

853
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,040
every little flash of this imagery,

854
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:27,640
I can associate a different artist with it.

855
00:49:28,080 --> 00:49:29,400
Not mostly me.

856
00:49:29,840 --> 00:49:31,700
All I did was run a computer.

857
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,000
We know a lot of artists.

858
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,600
For some reason, the church was so...

859
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:38,820
Well, I can tell you the reason.

860
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,200
Back in the day,

861
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,020
Viola Drummond and me,

862
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:47,520
we were the ones that first made that little pamphlet

863
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:48,840
that turned into this mess.

864
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:53,280
We just wanted to be like our heroes,

865
00:49:53,280 --> 00:49:56,180
the underground comic book artists.

866
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,220
Furry Freak Brothers, Robert Crumb's stuff.

867
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:02,660
Y'all are too...

868
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:03,740
Y'all won't even know.

869
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:06,180
And the Fireside Theater.

870
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,760
We just wanted to be like those...

871
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:10,080
And the Mary Pratchett's.

872
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,140
Who's a Mary Pratchett person?

873
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:18,100
Reverend Ken Kesey was a subgenius.

874
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,040
That's actually true.

875
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,060
Who else?

876
00:50:22,880 --> 00:50:25,020
Philip K. Dick was a subgenius.

877
00:50:25,380 --> 00:50:26,520
Oh, no he wasn't.

878
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:28,740
We tried to recruit him,

879
00:50:28,780 --> 00:50:31,500
and he died the day after he got the pamphlet.

880
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,480
But so did L. Ron Hubbard!

881
00:50:33,660 --> 00:50:35,620
We sent a pamphlet to L. Ron Hubbard.

882
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:37,240
We had a friend,

883
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:40,320
this 80-year-old subgenius in the 80s,

884
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:41,920
Reverend Betsy Curtis.

885
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:47,780
She was an actual old friend of L. Ron Hubbard,

886
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:49,120
founder of Scientology.

887
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,040
She was in the subgenius,

888
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,460
and she was part of the Sci-Fi Room Party

889
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:55,160
when Hubbard made the famous statement.

890
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:56,900
You can't make any...

891
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:58,500
The only way to make money these days

892
00:50:58,500 --> 00:50:59,660
is to start a fake religion.

893
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:00,960
She was...

894
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,400
remained friends with Hubbard over the years,

895
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,160
and she gave me this post office box in Miami

896
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,720
and swore that if I sent a pamphlet

897
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:10,440
with our questionnaire,

898
00:51:10,780 --> 00:51:12,560
which was based loosely on theirs,

899
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:14,120
to this P.O. box,

900
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,580
it would go to L. Ron Hubbard on his yacht,

901
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:17,880
in the seahorse.

902
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:18,700
And I did!

903
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:20,180
We sent him a pamphlet,

904
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,480
and a week later,

905
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,380
we read that he died!

906
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:25,440
So we thought,

907
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,100
okay, it killed Philip Dick,

908
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,260
that was too bad,

909
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:29,540
but it killed L. Ron Hubbard.

910
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:32,180
So we tried sending one to Senator Jesse Helms

911
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,780
to kill him.

912
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,160
It didn't work.

913
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:41,040
We sent one to the great comedian Bill Hicks

914
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:41,920
as the president,

915
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,740
and it didn't.

916
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,380
So, maybe...

917
00:51:47,240 --> 00:51:49,020
I take back everything I said.

918
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:50,160
Maybe y'all shouldn't have done that.

919
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,560
You should buy any subpoenaed stuff.

920
00:51:51,860 --> 00:51:52,720
Or rather, no,

921
00:51:52,860 --> 00:51:53,940
you should buy it.

922
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,240
Don't wait until I send it to you for free,

923
00:51:56,300 --> 00:51:57,120
or you'll die!

924
00:51:57,520 --> 00:51:59,320
If you wait until you're rich and famous,

925
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,840
and we send you stuff

926
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,360
trying to get an endorsement from you,

927
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:05,020
beware, man,

928
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:05,640
that's...

929
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:08,040
that's certain bad luck.

930
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,440
And, uh...

931
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:14,180
But good luck usually comes from that purchase.

932
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:16,860
You'll be glad to know

933
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:19,480
I didn't bring anything down here to sell.

934
00:52:20,200 --> 00:52:21,620
So you're not on the spot,

935
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,500
but tomorrow afternoon we will have the swag table.

936
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:25,720
Oh, look!

937
00:52:25,840 --> 00:52:28,700
Reverend Pickles has his subgenius membership pack.

938
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,560
I guess he's gonna sell it.

939
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:33,280
Yes, but it's not...

940
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,720
For 35 bucks you don't just get your name in the Book of Life.

941
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:40,580
You also get this keen, keen collection of...

942
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:44,040
It's got a frameable doctorate

943
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,500
of the forbidden sciences.

944
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,620
You'll be a doctor.

945
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:48,940
You get...

946
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:51,820
an all-inclusive divine excuse

947
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:56,340
because Bob didn't come to forgive your sins.

948
00:52:56,580 --> 00:52:59,040
He doesn't give a shit about your sins.

949
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,920
He came to bring you an excuse for your sins.

950
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:02,800
That's all you need.

951
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,440
And if you're a subgenius,

952
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:09,700
you probably come up with something up on your shelf.

953
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:11,620
And it's got the decoder pin,

954
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:12,780
and the decals,

955
00:53:12,780 --> 00:53:13,580
and bumper stickers,

956
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,200
and the pledge of the subgenius,

957
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:17,800
the brag of the subgenius,

958
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:20,160
and the pamphlets that started it all,

959
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:24,060
and a bunch of other secret stuff.

960
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:24,780
Oh, good.

961
00:53:25,060 --> 00:53:26,220
That head's gone.

962
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,280
I don't know what that is.

963
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:29,660
I thought it was pretty for a second.

964
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:36,780
No, but really, I've been standing here talking for about 45 minutes now.

965
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:41,820
I feel like it'd be good to just shut up and turn the music up

966
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:43,780
and look at the pictures for a while.

967
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:47,380
So, honestly, I didn't have any...

968
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:52,540
I came here with no more plans than to look at the weird pictures

969
00:53:52,540 --> 00:53:55,760
and yell and cuss a little bit.

970
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:56,720
And I'm out of here.

971
00:53:59,220 --> 00:53:59,700
Somebody...

972
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,400
I can't remember the time of the movie or what it's in.

973
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:10,200
But this guy was asking a preacher,

974
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:12,160
Preacher, come on now.

975
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:14,760
You said all kinds of crazy stuff.

976
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:17,340
What do you really, really, truly believe in?

977
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:18,040
Preacher.

978
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:19,340
And the preacher goes,

979
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:24,720
Well, what I really believe...

980
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,720
I believe I'm a very...

981
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:27,560
It's a dance theater.

982
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:28,960
Play spot!

983
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:34,960
Thank you very much for coming,

984
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,640
and I'll let them sit.

985
00:54:36,700 --> 00:54:39,540
If anybody wants to sit or whatever, that's fine.

986
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:43,580
I'm gonna sit down and stare at the ceiling.

987
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:47,060
I'm suggesting you...

988
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:47,620
Oh, my God.

989
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,180
...return to Bob,

990
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:50,460
Repent, slack off,

991
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:51,700
and quit your job,

992
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,540
or slurp the beastly knob,

993
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:54,100
Congress!

994
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,060
lick the throbbing vein of slavery.

995
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:59,440
Now, you're sleeping like a baby,

996
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:01,020
but Bob woke me up and said,

997
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:01,860
Get out of Dodge!

998
00:55:02,020 --> 00:55:04,420
There's a guy who's dicking top of the UFO in his garage.

999
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:06,960
I ate some bad ham and I got really sick,

1000
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,640
and in a puddle of my puke where the puke was most thick,

1001
00:55:09,660 --> 00:55:12,020
a mouth did appear and it beckoned me near,

1002
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:14,600
and it whispered the following words into my ear.

1003
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:14,920
It said,

1004
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,280
Kill the pink boys.

1005
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,880
Quick your job, mock the world, and praise Bob Dobbs

1006
00:55:19,880 --> 00:55:22,180
You'll build a ship and take a trip

1007
00:55:22,180 --> 00:55:24,400
Go on, go get a pen, write the coordinates

1008
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,300
Six and a half months hold up alone

1009
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:29,840
Circuit boards, duct tape, and turkey bones

1010
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,360
The ship appeared more than disaster prone

1011
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,100
But the vomit assured me that far weirder ships had flown

1012
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,680
The project was finished, the ship would hold twenty

1013
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,220
The power source was anything the crew would think was funny

1014
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,220
We didn't need the slack list or hapless

1015
00:55:42,220 --> 00:55:44,840
Our mirth proved its worth in escaping the star-fist

1016
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:48,060
On our way to Planet X for sex that wrecks necks

1017
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:50,600
A prairie squid in every pot of money shot a coney twine

1018
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,520
It's an all-hoss hour of bonanza

1019
00:55:52,520 --> 00:55:55,100
It's like a world without Tony Danza

1020
00:55:55,100 --> 00:55:57,340
We're fans of the pink shit that hits the charts

1021
00:55:57,340 --> 00:56:00,840
In a world of dead art, simultaneous lobotomy and sodomy

1022
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:03,000
We take a moment and we pause to reflect

1023
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,760
On the pinks that we killed and the planet that they wrecked

1024
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,320
Then we laugh like banshees and howl like comanches

1025
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,120
Do a victory dance in our underoos and panties

1026
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:12,780
Our fantasy is a reality

1027
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:14,500
Earth turns to dust

1028
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,020
It's Planet X or Bustros

1029
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:38,160
Embrace the ache, blood that flows in your veins

1030
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:43,160
When the front pipe clouds breathe slack like rain

1031
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:48,820
Let Bob control what's left of your brain

1032
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:54,020
Oh yes, and all your money to the Reverend Huygens thing

1033
00:57:37,060 --> 00:57:42,140
Embrace the aching blood that flows in your veins

1034
00:57:42,140 --> 00:57:43,140
When the front pipe clouds breathe slack like rain

1035
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:47,280
Slapped my cloud's wings, slapped my brain

1036
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:52,900
With bomb control, what's left of your brain?

1037
00:57:53,220 --> 00:57:57,980
Oh, nesting all your money to the Reverend I can say

1038
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,960
He will not reveal his identity, so for today we're calling him Bob

1039
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:26,300
Apparently Bob came and did something with all of us

1040
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:38,060
This won't make too much sense, but it's not intended to

1041
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:41,360
Ah, yeah

1042
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:50,020
That music at the end was the song Planet X or Bust by the El Queso All Stars

1043
00:58:50,020 --> 00:58:55,300
on the Bob Songs 3 and also Songs of X Day albums.

1044
00:58:55,920 --> 00:59:02,200
There's a fine music video of that one out there on RevStang YouTube.

1045
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:06,680
We'll probably do something like this again next Starwood,

1046
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:12,280
which is held at Wisteria in Southern Ohio starting a week after our X Day festival.

1047
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:19,940
Just Google StarwoodFestival.com or look at the Subgenius.com events page.

1048
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:25,640
I should also mention that Starwood now regularly features multimedia shows

1049
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:30,360
also by our friends the Evolution Control Committee.

1050
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:40,020
Who knows, maybe in 2016 it'll be a jam with Waking Dreams, Subgenius, and Evolution Control Committee.

1051
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:40,800
Who knows?
