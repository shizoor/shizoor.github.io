1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
Some people call the Church of the Subgenius a sex-devil end-of-the-world cult.

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:12,440
And it's not. It's an eco-friendly sex-devil end-of-the-world cult.

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:17,480
You know, you hear a lot of subgeniuses talk about,

4
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:21,860
oh, I can't wait for July 5th, 1998, which has got to be coming up soon,

5
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,320
when we get to destroy the normals and wreak havoc on the earth.

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:36,460
And my ecology-minded friends, of which I'm one, get concerned.

7
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:42,400
You know, why destroy the humans? Yeah, I can see that, but why destroy the planet?

8
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,860
Well, friends, the idea is to leave the earth the way we found it,

9
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,040
the way it was before we even got here.

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,740
Pristine, like long before we even got here.

11
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:57,140
A lifeless planet of poisonous vapor.

12
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,220
Lava.

13
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,160
Lava and ash.

14
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,880
Operation Clean Sweep, we call it.

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,680
Operation More Church, Less Air.

16
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:10,780
The subgenius.

17
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:22,180
All right, people, I'd like to begin with a hearty hail and well-met good fellow to Bob joining us from Business Affairs.

18
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,160
Thanks.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,860
Hi, everybody.

20
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,300
Bob, we have a little baptism by fire.

21
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Fire for you, so to speak.

22
00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:30,680
Poor bastard.

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,220
Let me speak with the manager.

24
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,280
Excuse me.

25
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:33,860
Bob?

26
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,320
That's a, um, a pink.

27
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:37,140
Yeah.

28
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:38,200
Pink.

29
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,740
We're, uh, we're pink.

30
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,480
Yeah.

31
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,180
Yeah.

32
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,140
Yeah.

33
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:48,020
Oh, boy.

34
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:48,460
Yeah.

35
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:49,660
Boy, oh, boy.

36
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:51,240
Uh.

37
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,000
Yeah.

38
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:52,400
Yeah.

39
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,880
Hey, Bobby!

40
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:55,980
Oh, I like this.

41
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,520
And it's pink.

42
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,960
I'll get you a pink wherever you want.

43
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,280
I had a great time.

44
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:01,920
The whole hour just flew by.

45
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,240
I'll get that.

46
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,740
Oh, thanks, Bobby.

47
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,140
You don't want to have any regrets.

48
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,240
I should know.

49
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:08,180
What do you mean?

50
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,520
Well, I had a dream, too.

51
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,900
Gonna call myself Bob.

52
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:14,060
Give me five more minutes on the name, then.

53
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,440
Well, it all worked out fine.

54
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,800
The champion, Bob!

55
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:21,580
Would you please just get on with the stupid Bob story?

56
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:26,220
Well, I'm on the phone with Bob, and I realize right then and there that I need to return this pair of pants.

57
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,560
So I'm off to the store.

58
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,540
What happened to Bob?

59
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,140
Well, nothing.

60
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,320
His part of the story is done.

61
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:37,680
Neighbor, how long has it been since you reached down to your foot, grabbed that old foot gland,

62
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:44,740
caressed it with your thumb and forefinger, and felt that wonderful, ineffable feeling of slack?

63
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,800
Has that been a long time for you, neighbors?

64
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:55,880
Then perhaps you need to ask yourself, am I the kind of person that Bob wants me to be?

65
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:05,520
I mean, it's one thing to be looking funny and acting funny, but are you the kind of person that Bob intended you to be?

66
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,660
Because I'll tell you about Bob, friends.

67
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:12,620
Bob is so high you cannot go over him.

68
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:17,140
Bob is so low you cannot get under him.

69
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:20,580
He's so wide you cannot get around him.

70
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,140
You make your bed in hell, he's there.

71
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,860
You make your bed in Dobbs Town.

72
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:25,860


73
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:26,760
He's there.

74
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:28,540
You make your bed in Cleveland.

75
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,500
He's there.

76
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,100
He's everywhere.

77
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,000
Think about that, friends.

78
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:36,060
Announce away.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,180
Everything on the schedule is moved up earlier.

80
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,240
One hour.

81
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,100
How about that?

82
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:47,000
For the first time ever, a subgenius schedule has been changed.

83
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:48,300
Hail Pisces.

84
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,780
And, well, it's because we got rained out last night.

85
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,740
Two very important things.

86
00:03:53,740 --> 00:04:04,360
Evolution Control Committee and the Slack Black Mass had to be postponed, lest some innocent get electrocuted or electrocated by the...

87
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:04,880
By mistake.

88
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:05,300
Yeah.

89
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,580
Rather than on purpose.

90
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:20,600
Well, it's the 4th of July, 2013 at 16 X Day, and the prophesied torrential downpour is majorly in progress.

91
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,960
It's raining.

92
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,700
The rain is raining all around.

93
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,600
It falls on field and tree.

94
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,880
Oh, well, lovely.

95
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,240
It has started raining here.

96
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,440
It falls on the umbrellas here and on the ships at sea.

97
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:37,240
Tarzan's radio studio is safe here in the treehouse.

98
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,120
Rain, rain, go away.

99
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,340
Come again another day.

100
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,080
Little Susie wants to play.

101
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:45,460
It will force an audience to come to us.

102
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,360
Actually, I think it's stopping.

103
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,780
No, the audience...

104
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,280
There you go.

105
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,940
The wise members of the audience know that I'm here.

106
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:52,940


107
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:53,020
I'm here.

108
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,240
It's a good thing that all of this stuff will be recorded and the good parts will be on an hour of Slack.

109
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:57,860
All is recorded.

110
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,520
They'd just as soon not sit through the, you know, this part.

111
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:02,280
Is this part a good part?

112
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,780
They'd rather be out in the rain than listening to this broadcast indoors.

113
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,280
Is this part a good part?

114
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:15,540
Well, if that's their attitude, they may miss the first phase of the terminally thrilling Bulldada auction.

115
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,840
You know, I now have two pairs of shoes that are really wet.

116
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:20,660
Soaking wet.

117
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,940
I'm wet down to my soles.

118
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,380
Oh, I know you are, but you wanted to be.

119
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,320
I saw you running around in the rain deliberately.

120
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,900
Yeah, who cares anyway?

121
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:30,660
Yeah, right.

122
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,940
I know you don't care.

123
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,340
The insurance company is going to care when they have to pay for your hospitalization for pneumonia.

124
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,700
Oh, bologna and cheese sandwiches.

125
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:41,600
Oh, wait, what am I saying?

126
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,580
The world ends tomorrow and we all may die.

127
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,640
So what am I...

128
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,900
What do you know about any of it anyway?

129
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,120
I don't know nothing.

130
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,060
Everybody's missing anything.

131
00:05:52,080 --> 00:06:02,120
I don't know any kind of big show, but I'm fairly certain that they're probably all so high or drunk that they really are having a great time.

132
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:02,960
Bologna!

133
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,660
You see what I mean?

134
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,400
There's a really good example right there.

135
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,720
Bologna!

136
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:21,080
It may be pouring rain and lightning and thundering and everything cool, but they love it.

137
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,200
I don't know what I mean.

138
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:22,220
All right.

139
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,220


140
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,220


141
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,220


142
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:22,220


143
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,100
My first name is Mr. Smith.

144
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,560
It has two S's in it.

145
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,340
I'll get it.

146
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,660
Hey, Dave.

147
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,780
I've been saying in Princess We Are Doe, and we're here running the...

148
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:46,540
We're using up the last rainy recordings from last X Day Drill and last Starwood 2013 since

149
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:48,820
the next one start in about a week.

150
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,360
Well, a week.

151
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,540
Stang time.

152
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,260
and

153
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,940
we also have some great music coming up

154
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,460
from the Amino Acids, the Psychoskeletons

155
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,340
Research Project

156
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,920
and we have heard some of G. Gordon

157
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,180
Gordon and some large collage

158
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,840
but now we're going to go back to

159
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:08,760
Starwood for

160
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:10,860
I think the opening of the

161
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,780
Starwood Devival section

162
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,940
Friends

163
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,940
open your hearts, close your

164
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,640
minds, unzip your lips

165
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,080
bend over and pull out that wallet

166
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:22,580
because here comes

167
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,100
Bob!

168
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,500
Oh only

169
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,400
that's normally when I can point

170
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,600
to the big screen there

171
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,300
for those of you who don't know

172
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,340
God, am I doing

173
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:35,420
a service without a big picture of Bob?

174
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,260
You'll have to go to our

175
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,180
sales table and see all of the

176
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:40,540
Bobnography

177
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,360
He's the guy with the

178
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,460
pipe that you see tattooed on all those

179
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:47,120
poor deceived

180
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,760
youngsters

181
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,040
Now what was I

182
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,860
supposed to do?

183
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,560
Somebody came up here and said

184
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,900
can you tell me what this next workshop

185
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,620
is and I had to look it up

186
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,380
and here's what it says

187
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,500
a crowd of loners

188
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,900
paradox or marketing niche?

189
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,460
I was actually going to label this

190
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,060
sermon

191
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,980
praying is for sissies

192
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,820
but my wife is nice and she talked me

193
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:17,860
out of using that title because it's

194
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:18,600
kind of mean

195
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,780
Reverend Stang will perform miracles and wonders

196
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,080
before your very eyes

197
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,720
witness this daring evil angelical

198
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,140
emissionary as he demonstrates

199
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,360
fake handling, acubating and

200
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,100
astounding acts of

201
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,360
pyroflatulation

202
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,300
at the very least you'll learn what

203
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,640
not to do. There will be no laughing

204
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,660
allowed during this unusual

205
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:42,300
and possibly dangerous presentation

206
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,380
because of the potential for

207
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:46,040
brain sneeze those

208
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,280
faint of mind or weak

209
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:48,580
of mind will be able to do it.

210
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:01,920
The last thing I want to say is

211
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,680
that I'm not going to be

212
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:04,300
talking about the

213
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:04,300


214
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:04,780
the

215
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,000
the

216
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,020
the

217
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


218
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


219
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


220
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


221
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


222
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


223
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


224
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


225
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


226
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


227
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


228
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


229
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


230
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


231
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


232
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


233
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


234
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


235
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


236
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


237
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,020


238
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:18,920
the

239
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,580
the

240
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:54,660
rain we couldn't do a lot of stage shows and we ended up calling it the X day where the

241
00:09:54,660 --> 00:10:01,680
subgeniuses had to talk to each other. And another good thing about the rain is people

242
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:08,260
are forced to huddle together under shelters and there weren't that many shelters around

243
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:15,660
so they had to huddle very closely. So in about ten months we'll be seeing a new brood

244
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:23,060
of subgenius babies. Not nine months, it's ten months because the subgenius gestation

245
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:30,400
is longer. It takes an extra month for the fetus to develop the gigantic ego of the subgenius.

246
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:36,020
The Martians are coming this way. We must evacuate the city.

247
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:49,840
Music

248
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:49,920
Music

249
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,300
Music

250
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,060
Music

251
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:56,100
Music

252
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,280
Music

253
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,320
Music

254
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:56,340
Music

255
00:10:56,340 --> 00:10:56,360
Music

256
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:56,380
Music

257
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:57,540
Music

258
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:53,740
In case you were wondering, 10 billion years of weirdo evolution culminates right here tonight.

259
00:11:54,060 --> 00:11:55,640
Right this minute.

260
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:02,660
Which may indicate that evolution has indeed ceased and Devo was right about everything.

261
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,680
And they were right about everything.

262
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:13,660
We're surrounded by church folks of the other kind of church.

263
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:13,960
Church.

264
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,680
The rival cult against all the other rival cults that are here.

265
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,360
The steeple people we call them.

266
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,260
Actually, my little sister coined that term.

267
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,740
The steeple people are very confused.

268
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:35,060
They seem to think that the pagans and the subgeniuses and the discordians and so forth are devil worshippers.

269
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:43,640
Well, I think you have to be kind of Judeo-Christian or even a certain kind of Christian to even believe in the devil.

270
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,520
To begin with.

271
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,100
But those folks can stick it.

272
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:53,500
They can take that idea and stick it where the sun of God don't shine.

273
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,060
Know what I'm saying?

274
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,600
So, oddly enough, I seem to see a lot of hippies here.

275
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,100
Old hippies, especially.

276
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:07,980
Especially.

277
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,440
Some of us old hippies say, never trust.

278
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,440
A hippie under 30.

279
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,640
A hippie under 30.

280
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,740
Thank you.

281
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,380
Thank you, the psycho skeletons.

282
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,860
I'm going to do something unusual for me.

283
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,880
I don't usually just read to people at Starwood.

284
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:08,620
I've had the horrible experience of coming to see a speaker who was some kind of hot shot,

285
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:13,520
and supposedly all he did was read from his own book in a monotone.

286
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:17,040
And so I get to do that once.

287
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:23,220
Only this time, I'm going to do a sermon that someone wrote for me.

288
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:29,320
It's the same guy that writes half the stuff I say anyway, Reverend Onan Canobite of Portland.

289
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:37,280
But this was a particularly good one because it helps me build up to get more important statements.

290
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,260
And that's why I'm reading this.

291
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,400
I got an email just last week.

292
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:44,280
That said,

293
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:49,140
Reverend Stagg, I was listening to the Hour Slack radio show,

294
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:52,560
and you played a sermon from last X Day Drill.

295
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,100
Some girl was going on and on, and I didn't like her voice.

296
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,180
That girl wasn't funny at all.

297
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,660
Why did you play that?

298
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,100
There's a simple answer, dear friends.

299
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,300
She showed up!

300
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:12,960
She was there and got on stage and let the tongues of flame burn through her,

301
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:17,140
and yes, she forgot her lines, and the recording was awful,

302
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,560
and Reverend Funny Name kept yelling at her,

303
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,160
but she did something that that email critic didn't do.

304
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,640
She showed up.

305
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:31,260
The Church of the Subgenius is not a democracy,

306
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,000
and it is not a collective.

307
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:40,260
It is a strict hierarchy, and there are three, yeah, three,

308
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,940
immutable means of advancing the church.

309
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,120
The first is advancing up the ladder of sales success.

310
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,920
The first is yours for a mere $35.

311
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,520
I mentioned that earlier.

312
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:55,840
The second avenue to success is you got to be funny,

313
00:16:55,940 --> 00:17:02,280
or smart, or attractive, or some combination of these.

314
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,080
Actually, I'm not sure you have to be any of those.

315
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,200
But the hardest one is this.

316
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:11,120
You have to show up as you did.

317
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,080
And so did I come to think of it.

318
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:17,220
You think all those early doctors, the subgenius leaders,

319
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,820
had it going right from the start?

320
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,960
Does anybody seriously think that Dr. Philodrumon and I

321
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:28,880
were the best choice for running a global mind control mail order cult?

322
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,860
Well, you think funny if you think that.

323
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,240
We showed up!

324
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:34,120
That's it!

325
00:17:34,380 --> 00:17:36,540
That girl at Ex Day showed up.

326
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:40,260
So if you want that date,

327
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,220
or that sales diocese,

328
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:45,780
or to be lifted up in glory,

329
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,820
ass first on the day of Exist Grintervention,

330
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,480
you have to show up.

331
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:56,100
You could be part of the greatest show up on earth

332
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,960
if you just show up.

333
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,140
Now I just mentioned that the day of rupture,

334
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:05,400
all subgeniuses who have paid their $35 to Bob

335
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,020
will be lifted up into the heavens,

336
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,900
ass first!

337
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,100
And that is literally true.

338
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:15,960
When you've seen a comic strip character go feet up in that third panel,

339
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,700
that's what I'm talking about.

340
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,700
It's a big shepherd's crook pulling us off the stage.

341
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:24,100
Not because we showed up and we're no good,

342
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:28,720
but because Riverboat Dobbs got us a better gig uptown.

343
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,680
Can't you just see it, dear friends?

344
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,380
Your hands and feet flapping in front of you

345
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,440
while your keister shoots to the sky.

346
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,020
Bob will save your ass,

347
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,980
and the rest of you will follow.

348
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,260
Now, praise Onan.

349
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,800
As you all know,

350
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:50,880
humans are the internet's way of making more internet.

351
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,380
Thank goodness for the internet.

352
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:54,300
Yay internet.

353
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:57,760
But those rules don't apply to us, not entirely.

354
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,480
Because of that hideous, yet kinda sexy,

355
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:06,280
human yeti miscegenation of so long ago,

356
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,240
we're half-breeds.

357
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:13,160
We, the subgeniuses, are the wolfmen and the mermaids.

358
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,100
The neither here nor there,

359
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:16,800
neither hot nor cold,

360
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:20,300
the circle without center or circumference.

361
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,680
Therefore, both logic and moral hygiene

362
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:26,860
demands that we use the internet,

363
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,480
but nay, not let it use us.

364
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,620
Go the hell outside,

365
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,820
I say to a crowd of loners outside.

366
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,860
Go for a walk, clean your house and cook some food.

367
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:42,720
Go meet your friends, talk to your family.

368
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,560
Show up.

369
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,840
Believe me, your unpaid job doing data entry for Facebook

370
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:52,580
will still be there for you when you get back.

371
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:57,820
Yes, there are pictures of naked ladies online,

372
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:01,520
but you could have sex with a live, beautiful girl.

373
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,280
Or an ugly one.

374
00:20:03,420 --> 00:20:04,940
Or a fellow yetisan.

375
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:08,340
So step away from the computer, put the phone down,

376
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:08,960
and live.

377
00:20:09,380 --> 00:20:11,260
Whichever planet this is,

378
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,260
it's unbelievably big and scary.

379
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:17,140
Bigger and scarier than any screen.

380
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,340
It's nut-wrenching.

381
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:23,120
We stand to receive thee, you who are of but flesh,

382
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:26,380
and understand not the way of the lead-clad ones.

383
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:27,980
Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay.

384
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:31,020
This is it. Time to close the deal.

385
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,280
Eat the hell out of all of those hamburgers.

386
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:38,200
You're the one you've been saving yourself.

387
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:41,520
Living well is the best revenge,

388
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,060
but you have to live well, and you have to live.

389
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,660
When you pass a mad scientist on the street,

390
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,200
does he curl his fingers and shriek,

391
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:52,820
It's alive?

392
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,580
If the answer is no, then you need to get on that.

393
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:58,460
You are good enough, you are clean enough,

394
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:03,580
but if, if and only if, you get right with Bob tonight.

395
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
Good night!

396
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:06,400
Oh wait.

397
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:09,000
Oh well, see, his script wasn't perfect.

398
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,540
Thank you, Onan, for writing that.

399
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,920
We did it, there's a quite разy-sup.

400
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:45,920


401
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:45,920


402
00:21:45,920 --> 00:22:06,120
was��one standing there,

403
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:06,380
giving the first Wikico-ch şeyi.

404
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,140
We'll be right back.

405
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:06,360
We'll be right back.

406
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:06,980
We'll be right back.

407
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,360
We'll be right back.

408
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,080
We'll be right back.

409
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,560
We'll be right back.

410
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:06,960
We'll be right back.

411
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:38,640
Guys, I see the finish line.

412
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:50,420
I would love to stay, experience what real teenage life is like at Monster High, but there is no other way.

413
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,980
What if there were?

414
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,600
Finder, as you wish.

415
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:02,900
Goodbye.

416
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,220
Thank you.

417
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,780
Thank you.

418
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:20,340
The lantern fell into the deep end of the pool, and at Monster High, the deep end goes down forever.

419
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:22,560
Let's hold this, Casbah.

420
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:27,200
Put your hands together for Cat in the Water!

421
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:43,680
We are running at Auerbach Parade.

422
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:44,740
RM and Smith win the used deserted once and for all.

423
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:44,880
brotha tell lives its fate and turn it into a legend.

424
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:44,880


425
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:44,880


426
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:44,880


427
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,380
Close your eyes, cool.

428
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,360
Look inside, cool.

429
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:50,920
Let the wish take you away.

430
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:54,400
Close your eyes, cool.

431
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:56,400
Look inside, cool.

432
00:26:56,540 --> 00:26:59,000
Let the wish take you away.

433
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,080
Close your eyes, cool.

434
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,360
Look inside, cool.

435
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:06,360


436
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:13,520
I'm sorry Gil, I know you really liked me being a freshwater ghoul.

437
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:16,380
No, no, that's what my parents wanted you to be.

438
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,720
I like you just the way you are.

439
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:20,060
Good!

440
00:27:22,020 --> 00:27:25,180
Because I'm going to beat your fins off at the swim meet this weekend.

441
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,700
Friends, there's good news for you here today.

442
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:47,800
Yeah, there's great things a-comin' cause Bob is coming to you.

443
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:55,260
And you'll be coming to Bob if you will just accept his beneficent wisdom and word.

444
00:27:55,380 --> 00:28:03,060
J.R. Bob Dobbs, the high epoped mystical guru and transcendental trickster who has made

445
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,780
those who follow his tenets and beliefs.

446
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:11,660
Slack-filled, happy, and fully, fully realized.

447
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:16,460
So friends, next time somebody asks you, you know about Bob?

448
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,240
Don't turn away.

449
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:19,720
Don't laugh.

450
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,080
Don't sneer.

451
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:27,700
Because if you don't know about Bob, and you have not taken Bob into your heart by tithing

452
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:34,980
to that sacred box number, then friends, you are among the benighted, the uncared for,

453
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,340
the damned, and the ungrateful.

454
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,640
And you are among the damned and the deceived.

455
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,860
Because you are slaving for the conspiracy and have no knowledge of the evil things that

456
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:46,960
will and are befalling you.

457
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:52,280
But you can strip those scales from your eyes, dear friends.

458
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,420
Yes, come to Bob.

459
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:59,820
Let Bob show you the meaning of what Slack truly can be.

460
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,580
You'll only get one chance for Bob.

461
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:05,080
And you better not give it up.

462
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,300
Bob is no nickel-dime-bum-show.

463
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,480
I'm putting it to you, friends.

464
00:29:09,580 --> 00:29:11,740
He's a cork in fine salvation.

465
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,800
Shout hallelujah and fightin' Jesus.

466
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,100
Get on that Dobstown train.

467
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:25,160
We're all Malaysia-bound, blessed in the mighty aura of the great pipe of Dobbs.

468
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,700
So here's your chance.

469
00:29:27,060 --> 00:29:30,380
Get aboard or be left behind, friends.

470
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:49,720
Oh, yes, dear friends.

471
00:29:50,460 --> 00:29:57,580
As the Rudy Schwartz Project tinkles in the background, I can tell you that earlier music

472
00:29:57,580 --> 00:30:02,580
we heard, we had two amino acid tunes and one psycho-skeletoon.

473
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,060
I think it's called the Amino Acid Tune.

474
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:05,060


475
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:11,700
You can probably figure that out, which was which, if you're a recent or regular listener,

476
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:12,060
I mean.

477
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,660
If you're not, who cares?

478
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:22,220
Well, we care about our old friend, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, who has slunk into the station

479
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:22,820
somehow.

480
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:23,780
That's one thing?

481
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,480
That's one thing, all right.

482
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:25,960
Right.

483
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,420
One big ugly thing.

484
00:30:28,940 --> 00:30:30,180
It's not ugly!

485
00:30:31,940 --> 00:30:35,060
Well, it depends on whether you're a big ugly or a big ugly.

486
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,060


487
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,060


488
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,060


489
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,060


490
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,060


491
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:35,060


492
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,760
You're looking at Dave or the double mean baby head on the back.

493
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,960
Well, that's true.

494
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:43,080
Well, things could be a lot worse.

495
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:48,720
I could have the bulbous nose of one of my ancestors, Tatar, who was from the Caucasus

496
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,260
Mountains and lived on a diet of rats and old cheese.

497
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,960
I think it was suspended something.

498
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:57,760
Suspended?

499
00:30:58,900 --> 00:31:04,360
I suspected something was suspended there, deep down in there.

500
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,060
What?

501
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:05,060


502
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:10,240
Yeah, that's because, well, that's because Doctor You-Know-Who is back.

503
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,580
No, I don't really...

504
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:12,960
I don't know who.

505
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:16,020
Which, I know a lot of doctors that could all be back.

506
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:22,380
Did you know that mankind is canned mind spelled sideways?

507
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,960
And then, you know what that means?

508
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:28,620
That means that mankind is meant to be slaves, and that's the doctor I was talking about,

509
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:30,360
your buddy You-Know-Who.

510
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,320
Oh, yeah, mankind was a great wrestler.

511
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,040
Yeah.

512
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,580
Yeah.

513
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,000
The one, he had the reptile mask and everything.

514
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:39,760
I don't, I don't...

515
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,760
And if you loved him, he made like the purring noises and stuff, but that's not the point

516
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:44,000
of it.

517
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:44,440
Oh.

518
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:50,500
It's rather a pointless diatribe anyway, but it had a lot to do with where I intended

519
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,000
to go.

520
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,480
Who the hell wants to go there?

521
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,800
Oh, come on, Dave.

522
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,420
You don't, you didn't even know where you were going, now, did you?

523
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:00,920
No, I did.

524
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:04,520
I even wrote stuff down before I called, and then my mind went blank, as usual.

525
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:05,040
Oh, yeah.

526
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:08,400
And I looked at this stuff, and it was just like, you know, there were a couple ellipses

527
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:10,200
and some, and then, you know...

528
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:14,480
So not only did your mind go blank, but your notes went blank too, huh?

529
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:18,860
But when you can laugh, and it sounds like you're using some kind of electronic synthesizer

530
00:32:18,860 --> 00:32:23,580
in your voice, and you're not even using an electronic synthesizer, well, then you've

531
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,400
really got something, Dave.

532
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,500
Well, does it really sound like that?

533
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,040
Yes.

534
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:30,240
Often.

535
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:30,620
It does.

536
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,280
Yes.

537
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:35,880
So it's the usual ad nauseum phone problem?

538
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,200
No, no, it sounds good.

539
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:41,920
No, she says it sounds, you sound good, like you were, like you had one of those special

540
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:45,240
Darth Vader voice synthesizers going.

541
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:46,160
Exactly.

542
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,780
So, like, if I were to do, like, porn music from the, like, the bass line from the porn

543
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:54,700
music from the, like, late 1970s, like, .

544
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,620
That would create something?

545
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:00,440
Yeah.

546
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:07,080
You know, I, I, there, you can get albums of porn music from the 70s, and I, it goes

547
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:12,720
great with micro photography of little single cell creatures having sex.

548
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:20,360
Well, there are Hipster's Delight, along with really bad corny, corny jingles from the 60s,

549
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:27,060
stuff that's beyond the trans, migration and transformation of elevator music, a la the

550
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,420
Duke of Uke and others, of his, her, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his, his,

551
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:30,640
and the Duke.

552
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:39,240
Well, the more, the more heavier a tune is the better an elevator tune it makes

553
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,460
for subgeniuses anyway.

554
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:46,260
Well, it's like a one, One point—

555
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:50,600
Or something by the, Black Sabbath would make good, be good.

556
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:55,860
Well, but the, the other show, we, we had Rolling Stones' Muzak playing all the way

557
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,760
through in the background.

558
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,320
Black Sabbath, um, elevator music is great, yes.

559
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:00,400
Well.

560
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:01,260
Also, I agree.

561
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:09,980
I had an orgasm with, I forget what it was, but maybe it was an orange.

562
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:14,940
Well, you're easy to please, Dave, aren't you?

563
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,140
Well, when you don't have enough to eat, that's what you think about.

564
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:26,760
Well, I could really go for a chocolate fudge sundae right now covered with human hair and vile other mixtures.

565
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,020
Listers, you know what to do.

566
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,820
You heard Dave.

567
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:35,600
You can email me, stang at subgenius.com for his address.

568
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:38,040
And you can mail all your hair.

569
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,460
It's Thursday again.

570
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,980
Mixed with melted ice cream sundaes.

571
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,780
Oh, there's all kinds of stuff you can do with it.

572
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:51,680
You can make, you know, like little embankments around your house to keep away the werewolves.

573
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:58,420
And you could also use it as a solar implantation device so you can get, you know, all the meaty mess,

574
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,000
all the...

575
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:04,740
All the messages you really, really, really, really need from the great beyond,

576
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,420
as well as solar power your house like they do in Germany sometimes.

577
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:16,220
Dave, did you know that you weren't on a show that I did earlier this week?

578
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,020
I wasn't?

579
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:19,720
Right.

580
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:25,380
Because, you know, it's been a long time since I, well, a few months,

581
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,560
since I sat down and did an all-edited show.

582
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:31,540
Where we didn't come into the station at all.

583
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,600
I just used tapes or whatnot.

584
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:41,760
Well, I did one earlier this week that will never, ever be played on this or any other broadcast station.

585
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,280
Yes, I did.

586
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,440
Whereas this show is Hour of Slack number 1469.

587
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:56,960
Earlier this week, I put one out just on the internet that was number 1469.5XXX.

588
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,400
And it was all the...

589
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:05,060
Naughty, naughty, naughty stuff from Starwood, Last Starwood and Last X Day drill.

590
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,660
And also the Pittsburgh revival.

591
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:15,540
It was all the kind of stuff where, you know, sometimes I cut the cuss words out of things for the broadcast stations.

592
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:19,000
Well, this was all the stuff where you can't...

593
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:19,820
They make you do that.

594
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:23,420
It's like if you were to do that, there wouldn't be anything left.

595
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:28,540
So, listeners, if you...

596
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:35,980
Get on the internet and go to subgenius.com and click on the part that says radio up near the top,

597
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:45,260
you would soon see a link to the 74-minute long Hour of Slack number 1469.5XXXXXXXX.

598
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,020
And it does have some sex in it.

599
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:49,820
It has some real sex.

600
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,300
It has Bob's sex life recorded.

601
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,860
How Bob got that job.

602
00:36:55,020 --> 00:36:55,880
Yeah, but it's not really about sex.

603
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,420
No, it's not.

604
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:57,760
You mean about Bob.

605
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,040
No.

606
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,580
It's mainly about offending normal people.

607
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:07,740
But if it's like those other triple X rated shows, it's really, really, really bad.

608
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:11,640
So that's the orange with the orgasm link?

609
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:12,360
Yeah.

610
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:13,140
On turn.

611
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:20,260
Yeah, when you said that you had an orange orgasm, that's what reminded me that I had done a really awful show.

612
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:23,260
And it was awful partly because it didn't have you in it.

613
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:23,740
Yes.

614
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,000
Sad.

615
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:28,460
Well, no, but it was, you know, abundant with all the filth we love so much.

616
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,160
Oh, yeah.

617
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:37,620
That's the reason why a lot of people go to a subgenius gathering is to hear people just stand up there and swear like a sailor for about half an hour.

618
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:49,180
Reverend Richard Skull had a sermon he used to do almost every year where he would get up and for about one minute just yell one word over and over and over again.

619
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,500
And I bet you can guess.

620
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,940
For unlawful and carnal knowledge.

621
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:53,540
Yeah.

622
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,020
Over and over and over.

623
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:57,940
It was one of those if you can't take a joke type words.

624
00:37:58,040 --> 00:37:58,520
What was it again?

625
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:02,540
His sermon was just yelling a cuss word for about a minute.

626
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:06,520
But he put a lot of feeling into it because he meant it.

627
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:07,380
Yes.

628
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,720
Well, we all mean it when we're doing that.

629
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:15,360
It was the equivalent of saying darn, darn, darn, darn, darn.

630
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,380
Only much, much stronger.

631
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:28,060
That's why those words are made to take us there to the realm beyond where the exclamation point is like.

632
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,080
Oh, darn.

633
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:31,620
And then it becomes, you know, you cube it a couple times.

634
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:32,860
Then you play.

635
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:37,660
What's that game when you thrash around by a garbage can and stuff wearing a mental patient's outfit?

636
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,180
Wilding?

637
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:40,280
No.

638
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,060
Wilding was in Clockwork Orange.

639
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,520
Oh.

640
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:44,780
Hey.

641
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:46,740
Clockwork Orange.

642
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,580
Orgasms.

643
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,440
It all adds up.

644
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,080
Yeah.

645
00:38:50,900 --> 00:38:51,380
Yeah.

646
00:38:54,680 --> 00:38:58,280
It sharpens you up and makes you ready for a bit of the old in-out.

647
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,000
In-out.

648
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,920
Yeah, I could go for some Malachi Plusco right now.

649
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,980
I could go for three bags full.

650
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,480
Margaret Pusko?

651
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,840
Malachi Plus.

652
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,220
Malachi Plus?

653
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:11,780
Malachi.

654
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,220
Yeah, that's one of the drugs they have.

655
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:14,620
Oh, yeah.

656
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,820
Synthamask, Dremkrom.

657
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:19,000
You know, they, yeah.

658
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:19,580
Yeah.

659
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:21,460
From the Kurova Milk Bar.

660
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:26,740
It's all Synthamask and can you spare me some Cutter Me, Brother?

661
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:27,320
Right.

662
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,160
Other pieces of...

663
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:28,680
Of genuine.

664
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,680
Artifacture.

665
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,920
Which makes me want to bark and cry at the same time.

666
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,680
It's no world for an old man any longer.

667
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:42,980
Well, like all the urine-soaked posters I have from the Church of the Subgenius, just

668
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:46,500
sitting here waiting for a collector, you know, these things gotta be worth a couple

669
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:46,780
pounds.

670
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:53,840
I mean, I checked one time on eBay and the one over on the west side where Todd was claimed

671
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:57,900
to be El Morto and stuff appeared on the stage.

672
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:03,360
Much to the chagrin of some of the young ladies and the impoverished people, anyway.

673
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,220
Remember that?

674
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:13,740
Men flying around the moon and there's no attention paid to earthly subgenius collectibles

675
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:14,580
no more.

676
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,640
Yep.

677
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:25,100
It's enough to make you want to pull out your can opener and cut the apes open, every

678
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:25,820
one of them.

679
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,360
And suck the juice out.

680
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,280
And crack their knuckles.

681
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,120
And cut the bones out.

682
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,280
And use them for dice.

683
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:36,900
Arr.

684
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:38,000
Arr.

685
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:38,460
Yep.

686
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,260
Country living.

687
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:43,740
Just the way George Washington had it when he was a brave young lad.

688
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,160
Remember those days when he used to go around scalping Indians and raping African-American

689
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,440
slave ladies and stuff?

690
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:55,580
Well, you know, it was okay to show that on TV as long as it was African-American slave

691
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,040
ladies.

692
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:57,780
Remember that show?

693
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,400
Show Roots?

694
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,660
Yeah.

695
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,500
It was okay as long as they were slave ladies.

696
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:04,000
You could show them topless.

697
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,560
But otherwise, you could not do that.

698
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:08,640
Except on the internet.

699
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,020
And, uh...

700
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:15,920
I've just been unfortunately reading a little bit about American history lady...

701
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:16,740
Uh, lady.

702
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,220
Listen, babe.

703
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,280
No, I've been...

704
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:21,260
I've been hallucinating.

705
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:23,200
You're so...

706
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:24,420
I'm so sick of you.

707
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,760
And then...

708
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,620
And then...

709
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:27,760
And then...

710
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:28,620
And then...

711
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,360
And we're still slaves.

712
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:35,640
And that kind of goes right in with what I forgot.

713
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,960
And what you have been always telling me.

714
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:39,360
No, Dave.

715
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:40,580
We're not slaves.

716
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:41,820
We're not slaves.

717
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:41,820


718
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,000
And...

719
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm sorry.

720
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,620
But really, we're not slaves because we do have a choice.

721
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,060
Slaves do not really have a choice.

722
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:56,160
They can't even die if their, you know, masters are doing it right.

723
00:41:57,660 --> 00:41:59,440
No, seriously, you know

724
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:01,020
That was one of the biggest problems

725
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,340
Yeah, it's

726
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:04,600
I mean, it could be worse

727
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,460
It could actually be worse

728
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,180
Yes, but we must cry out

729
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,380
Against this dystopia which we've created

730
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:11,960
With our

731
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,200
Lack of interest in our apathetic

732
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,400
Or we could turn it

733
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,500
Into a comedy show

734
00:42:18,500 --> 00:42:20,540
A sick one

735
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,440
And kind of trivialize all the important

736
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,020
Problems that America faces

737
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,940
Church is a subgenius

738
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:28,480
It's a better politically way to eat

739
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,380
As a Saturday morning cartoon show

740
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,220
Actually, it was

741
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:34,880
A leftist guy named John Judge

742
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,440
Who said that about us

743
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:37,600
In 1981

744
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:41,160
And I was so buggered, I remembered it

745
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,620
Actually, we used a clip

746
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:44,580
Puzzling Evidence recorded it

747
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,440
Somehow

748
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:48,940
And every now and then we love to

749
00:42:48,940 --> 00:42:50,120
Pop out those clips

750
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:52,260
Of people hating the church

751
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:54,280
People, yeah

752
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:54,900
People, sure

753
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:55,680
But this

754
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,120
But that was also a prediction

755
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:00,600
Of a dystopian future

756
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,920
Because now

757
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,860
The church of the subgenius is as political

758
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:06,500
As a Saturday morning cartoon

759
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,420
And there's nothing more than political

760
00:43:08,420 --> 00:43:10,280
Than the apathetic

761
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,620
What is it?

762
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,320
The observation of Mill

763
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,200
The obsession with

764
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:17,520
Paronculence

765
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:19,300
The stupidity

766
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:20,300
That's what I call it

767
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:24,380
The stupidity of the average

768
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:26,980
Subgenius

769
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,180
Well, that's the thing, you know

770
00:43:30,580 --> 00:43:31,780
As dumb

771
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:34,360
As a subgenius is

772
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,040
Yeah, yeah

773
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:39,500
Look at what we have to deal with

774
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:41,500
I mean, it's like

775
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:45,600
And somewhere there must be

776
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:46,760
People who are smart

777
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:49,420
Of course, we wouldn't be able to recognize that

778
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,440
By definition

779
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,540
If we encountered, say, a radio show

780
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,540
Where people were actually

781
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:55,600
Kind of sharp and clever

782
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:56,420
It would sound like

783
00:43:57,100 --> 00:43:59,020
Blabbering nonsense to us

784
00:43:59,020 --> 00:43:59,860
It would sound just like

785
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,220
Random craziness

786
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:03,620
And we wouldn't be able to comprehend it

787
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:05,100
Yes, how could we discern

788
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:07,880
Any sufficiently advanced science

789
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:08,880
Is like magic

790
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:11,340
Or bad comedy

791
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,200
Whereas to truly

792
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:15,900
If we were really, really geniuses

793
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,500
We'd be able to

794
00:44:18,180 --> 00:44:19,660
Tell the difference between

795
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:21,980
A nonsensical bunch of blabbering

796
00:44:21,980 --> 00:44:23,200
On a college radio station

797
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:23,940
And

798
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:24,260
And

799
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:24,520
And

800
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,520


801
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,520


802
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,520


803
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,520


804
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,520


805
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,520


806
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,520


807
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,520


808
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,520


809
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,520


810
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,520


811
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,520


812
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,520


813
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:54,540


814
00:44:54,540 --> 00:45:24,540


815
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:25,600
, you know,

816
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,860
You could probably get them down to $2 an hour

817
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:28,940
If you talk quick enough

818
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:30,400
They'd go for it, too

819
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:32,240
Come on, Dave

820
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,040
Let's face it

821
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,540
You or me would both jump at a job

822
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,180
That paid $2 an hour

823
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,880
That would be a step up for me

824
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:43,180
We're incapable of

825
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:44,660
Correctly

826
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,540
Storing and using

827
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:49,180
All this information we take on

828
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,600
It's beyond the tactile

829
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,900
And the cybernetic

830
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,060
Oh, is that right?

831
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:54,520
Is that right?

832
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:56,200
Is that right, Reverend McLuhan?

833
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,020
Well, it sure feels like it, man

834
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:00,820
It's just still like you're bombarded

835
00:46:00,820 --> 00:46:01,620
And most of the time

836
00:46:01,620 --> 00:46:02,920
It makes you want to go to the bathroom

837
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:03,780
And it's not just

838
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:06,260
And you say, well, you're getting older now

839
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:07,920
So your body's falling apart

840
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,720
Well, perhaps that's true

841
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:11,900
And your mind

842
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:14,200
Don't forget your mind and your right ear

843
00:46:14,660 --> 00:46:15,580
That's what I forgot

844
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:18,980
You know, I used to come in

845
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,340
Over the last few months

846
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:21,700
I'd come into the station and go

847
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:24,480
Man, the headphones in the station are all bad

848
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:25,100
Like mine

849
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,100
The right side

850
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,780
The right channel is just weak

851
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:30,300
Then one day

852
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:34,700
I lifted my left ear off the pillow

853
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:36,560
And discovered that Princess Wee

854
00:46:36,560 --> 00:46:38,680
Had been talking to me for five minutes

855
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:40,600
And I could hear her

856
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:43,100
As long as my left ear wasn't against the pillow

857
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:46,000
See, now the first time you told me that

858
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:47,240
When you lifted your head

859
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:50,460
A golden tooth fell out of your ear

860
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:52,960
And the Princess Wee was there

861
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,200
In the tutu

862
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:55,580
With a huge wand

863
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:58,060
Ready to grant any wish or command

864
00:46:58,060 --> 00:47:00,380
Well, if I told you that

865
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,420
You better pick up on it

866
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:03,040
Yeah

867
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,340
I don't remember it

868
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,620
But if I said it

869
00:47:05,620 --> 00:47:06,980
Then it must be so

870
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,720
Let it be so

871
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:10,760
You got it, Bosh

872
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:12,940
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be

873
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,360
So let it be moat

874
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:15,780
Whatever the hell moat means

875
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:17,080
And smoke as well

876
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:19,540
So let it be smoked and moated

877
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,200
And bloated and dried

878
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:23,560
And eviscerated and chopped up

879
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:23,720
And

880
00:47:24,540 --> 00:47:24,880
Died and

881
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,580
Eased and

882
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:26,240
And

883
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:27,020
And

884
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:27,240
And

885
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:27,800
And

886
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:28,740
And

887
00:47:28,740 --> 00:47:28,920
And

888
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:28,920


889
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:28,920


890
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:28,920


891
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:28,920


892
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:28,920


893
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:28,920


894
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:28,920


895
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:31,700
He's been hanging out with the moats

896
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,220
I guess so

897
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:35,540
Hazel moats and the rest of them moats

898
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:37,680
They're no better than quaits

899
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,060
No

900
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:40,100
And the quaits ain't no better than monskos

901
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:40,380
No

902
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,840
I'm gonna get them quait brothers

903
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,340
Them quait brothers better watch out

904
00:47:44,340 --> 00:47:45,680
That's all I got to say

905
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:48,680
What do you have against quakers?

906
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:49,600
Quaits

907
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,380
Not quakers

908
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:51,880
Who cares about quakers?

909
00:47:52,060 --> 00:47:52,240
They're

910
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,160
By definition they're harmless

911
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:55,760
Quaits

912
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:57,300
Well except for the one heard in the background

913
00:47:58,240 --> 00:48:00,840
Except for the ones that used to quake so hard

914
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,560
It would make the reverends shiver in their pants

915
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,060
The quaiters of K-par

916
00:48:06,020 --> 00:48:08,520
Hey I have some background music here

917
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:11,220
Instead of this monster hunter game music

918
00:48:11,220 --> 00:48:14,160
I could play you and Reverend Angry Larry

919
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:17,100
At 9X Day I think it was

920
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,380
Yeah 9X Day

921
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:20,880
So that would be like 8 years ago

922
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:22,460
Look that sounds

923
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:23,000
That's you

924
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:25,380
I think

925
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,500
I think that's Dave too

926
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,220
Yeah it's two Daves

927
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:31,300
It's the two Dave band

928
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:31,580
Yeah

929
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:33,520
Dave and Reverend Angry Larry

930
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:34,800
Two Daves

931
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,540
I'd like to hear this

932
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:41,980
And just get back and enjoy it with my children

933
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:43,600
Hey man

934
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,760
What happened to my nose?

935
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:47,140
Yo

936
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,820
Hey wait a minute

937
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:50,120
What has happened to your nose?

938
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,300
What happened

939
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:52,220
What has happened to my nose?

940
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:52,720
Okay then

941
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:54,140
What has happened to my nose?

942
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:54,140


943
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:54,140


944
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:55,400
Hostestias

945
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,280
Hostestias

946
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:57,280
What has happened to your nose?

947
00:48:57,940 --> 00:48:59,820
No I'm asking you

948
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:04,940
What is happening to my nose?

949
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:06,180
You know Dave

950
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:08,940
If we could get you out to X Day

951
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:11,120
We could have another two Dave jam

952
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:11,480
Yeah

953
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:14,920
Because the mean old acids are going to be there

954
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:16,640
And

955
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,480
And

956
00:49:19,220 --> 00:49:22,580
We were even talking about taking two cars

957
00:49:22,580 --> 00:49:23,220
So that

958
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:27,600
that one of us could spend a week taxiing you there and back.

959
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,640
Wouldn't that be exciting?

960
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,060
That would be rather exciting.

961
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,420
Every day?

962
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,180
No, nobody's going to do that.

963
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,260
That would take all day.

964
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:42,880
It takes all day to get from Ashtabula to Wisteria Campground near Athens.

965
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,840
I mean, it really does.

966
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:46,900
It takes like seven hours.

967
00:49:47,120 --> 00:49:48,840
No, it takes five hours.

968
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:53,520
Depends on how you go and how the traffic is.

969
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:58,080
Remember, a whole lot of that is through tiny little headless horseman towns.

970
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:58,980
Well, that is true.

971
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,660
When you get into the headless horseman towns at night, it's not bad,

972
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:08,980
but during the daytime, rush hour in tiny little towns is worse than rush hour in the middle of the big, big, big, big city.

973
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,540
Yeah, that's what I heard.

974
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:17,780
Now that there's all big cities there now where there used to be small little tiny acrimonies,

975
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:18,740
villages.

976
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:24,540
There used to be bearded snakes and they used to whisper baboons increments into their each other's ears, you know,

977
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:27,520
like on city council meetings and stuff like that.

978
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,080
One guy would always be smart and he was a transvestite.

979
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:33,980
They still have those.

980
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:36,060
Yeah, thanks.

981
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,360
Those little towns.

982
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,040
Praise Bob for such small little encumbrances that we get to wear on our necks.

983
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:46,420
Such teeny tiny favors that he does for us.

984
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:51,840
That's not much of a life anymore for a veteran of the great wars.

985
00:50:52,700 --> 00:50:55,020
You know, it's one damn tagging him out.

986
00:50:55,080 --> 00:51:01,300
The wars between the, you know, what war was it again?

987
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,460
I don't know.

988
00:51:02,540 --> 00:51:03,380
I don't know nothing.

989
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,560
I know nothing.

990
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,400
This seems to be going around.

991
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:13,140
The world's worst war.

992
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,300
But I don't even know what verbal command.

993
00:51:16,420 --> 00:51:21,640
I'm responding to in my internal dialogue when I start saying, I know nothing.

994
00:51:22,220 --> 00:51:23,480
I know nothing.

995
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:24,380
I know nothing.

996
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:30,460
That's a Sergeant Schultz from the hilarious concentration camp comedy, Hogan's Heroes.

997
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:35,560
But what's the silent read me that Dave is having to obey?

998
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:37,540
That's what he wonders.

999
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,940
I don't know.

1000
00:51:38,940 --> 00:51:41,840
So I get these commands, you know, and things like that and stuff.

1001
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:43,680
And sometimes they're spelled out.

1002
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,180
It's like really bizarre.

1003
00:51:45,180 --> 00:51:49,540
Like color, full, full, full color.

1004
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,380
What you call it?

1005
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:55,540
You know, whether you shove it in your head real quick and you see colors.

1006
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:56,500
You ever have that one?

1007
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,540
You can't even really make out what the information was.

1008
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,300
You can't slow down.

1009
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,820
I had to quit doing that.

1010
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,960
It's like proto texting from.

1011
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,200
Makes my neck hurt.

1012
00:52:07,320 --> 00:52:09,040
I can't do that anymore.

1013
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:12,180
Well, you're lucky you still have a neck.

1014
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:13,480
Unlike some of us.

1015
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,580
Dave shoves colors.

1016
00:52:14,580 --> 00:52:15,500
Colors into his head.

1017
00:52:16,720 --> 00:52:17,160
Yeah.

1018
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:19,840
Dave can't get the colors out of his head.

1019
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:20,260
Man.

1020
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:23,000
In my head, there's no neck anymore.

1021
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:27,300
My head's just stuck on my shoulders and my arms are getting shorter, too.

1022
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:29,320
Well, one of them shorter than the other one.

1023
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,060
There are atrophy in a different way.

1024
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:33,620
I don't know what that's got to do with.

1025
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:38,600
In my head, there is no neck and in my neck, there is no throat.

1026
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,520
And in my lines, there is no passage of the future.

1027
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:43,700
What could I do?

1028
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:44,180
But become.

1029
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,040
Become a subgenius priest.

1030
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:48,700
What else could I do?

1031
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:53,260
It's like you're swimming in a miasma of synesthesia all the time.

1032
00:52:55,320 --> 00:52:58,320
Well, that sounds like you're trying to set up synesthesia.

1033
00:52:59,340 --> 00:52:59,820
So.

1034
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,740
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1035
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:02,260
Oh, no.

1036
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:06,340
I was just wondering about the colors, you know, and tasting them and everything.

1037
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,980
They're very flashy.

1038
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:09,000
They're very vibrant.

1039
00:53:09,060 --> 00:53:11,360
It's like the television.

1040
00:53:11,440 --> 00:53:12,000
Tell it.

1041
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:13,220
The old television scale.

1042
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:13,920
Was.

1043
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:16,780
Was it red, blue, green, ROYGBIV or something like that?

1044
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:17,180
Mm hmm.

1045
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:19,140
Sure.

1046
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:19,680
Do you remember?

1047
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:19,980
Sure.

1048
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:20,340
Whatever.

1049
00:53:20,680 --> 00:53:24,560
Now it's purple, tangerine, orange.

1050
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:26,100
No.

1051
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:34,460
When you go down to there's, you know, you go to your color bars and one is red and O is orange and Y is yellow.

1052
00:53:34,560 --> 00:53:35,460
So it's ROY.

1053
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:36,960
G is green.

1054
00:53:37,020 --> 00:53:38,120
That's his middle name.

1055
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,900
And his last name is BIV.

1056
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,980
Blue, indigo, violet.

1057
00:53:42,740 --> 00:53:44,140
And that's how you always.

1058
00:53:44,140 --> 00:53:47,640
You always know that there's, you know, different wave frequencies going on that they're biting

1059
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,120
you with.

1060
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,700
What about Abel Baker?

1061
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:58,640
Abel Baker is like part of the tangled foxtrot Charlie syndrome of the shortwave radio listeners

1062
00:53:59,300 --> 00:54:06,180
who are also losing their larynxes and small animals that they can't feed anymore.

1063
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:08,340
Wow.

1064
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:09,540
Yeah.

1065
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:09,800
Wow.

1066
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,300
That's all I can say to that.

1067
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:11,760
That's intense, Dave.

1068
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,140
That's really intense.

1069
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:12,760
Really.

1070
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,640
You know, man, things have just gotten so bad now in this world.

1071
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,620
If you can call it one.

1072
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:21,020
Well, it can be made better.

1073
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:23,560
There's always a way.

1074
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:31,920
And that way, the truth and the light is the bedotted face of our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

1075
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:40,660
who that post office box that G. Gordon Gordon was threatening you with earlier is about

1076
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:41,340
to be given.

1077
00:54:41,340 --> 00:54:43,680
So get your pencil ready, weakling.

1078
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:57,500
It's subgenius at post office box one eight one four one seven Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

1079
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:03,260
Four four one one eight.

1080
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:08,180
Well spoken, Steve.

1081
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:10,500
You know, life doesn't have to be so awful.

1082
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,320
There are ways.

1083
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:14,520
There are wonderful things happening like X Day and Starwood.

1084
00:55:15,040 --> 00:55:16,860
Well, but those cost money to get to.

1085
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:18,420
Yes, that's true.

1086
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,840
But there's good food there and good entertainment, though.

1087
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,020
I mean, you know, well, there's good food.

1088
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:27,100
If you can have a jolly time for five minutes.

1089
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,060
OK, there's food.

1090
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:29,660
Granted, there is food.

1091
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,440
Oh, man, that food is delicious.

1092
00:55:32,540 --> 00:55:33,900
I have tried it.

1093
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:40,180
I thought everybody is some kind of culinary trying to outdo each other, you know, while

1094
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:41,020
they're hanging out.

1095
00:55:42,060 --> 00:55:45,200
Trying to out booty each other, did you say?

1096
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,480
Yes, that's what I said.

1097
00:55:47,600 --> 00:55:48,680
And I meant it, too.

1098
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:54,520
And you and your uncle shock and the rest of the people who own that factory think they

1099
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:55,500
own this town.

1100
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,360
My uncle shop out of this.

1101
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:01,600
I didn't mean that, uncle.

1102
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:06,520
I meant the poor uncle, the nice, sweet one with the plastic tape on his lips.

1103
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,440
He died.

1104
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:11,000
Why do you have to remind me?

1105
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:11,000


1106
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,480
Because the sutures will have to come out sometime another Sunday.

1107
00:56:22,140 --> 00:56:23,440
Don't cry, man.

1108
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,900
Sit down in the barber's chair.

1109
00:56:25,940 --> 00:56:27,320
We're going to give you a little shave.

1110
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:29,980
Now, you know what a shave is.

1111
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:33,660
It's a micro implant somewhere back at the base of the spine, right under the upper

1112
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:33,840
bone.

1113
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:35,320
We have to go now, Dave.

1114
00:56:35,980 --> 00:56:36,800
We have to go.

1115
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,180
I already went.

1116
00:56:37,380 --> 00:56:37,820
OK.

1117
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:38,800
Yeah, me too.

1118
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,780
Once again, you know.

1119
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,000
Dave went.

1120
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1121
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1122
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1123
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1124
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1125
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1126
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1127
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1128
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1129
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1130
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1131
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1132
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1133
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1134
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1135
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,180
He went already?

1136
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:47,880
Yeah, we're going to go back to the mean old acids doing a song called The Satanic

1137
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,220
Rites of Connie Dobbs, which has no lyrics.

1138
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,380
So you can make up your own, everybody.

1139
00:56:54,340 --> 00:56:56,060
It's one hell of a rush, man.

1140
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:56,740
OK.

1141
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:57,800
See you, Dave.

1142
00:56:57,920 --> 00:56:58,400
See you, Dave.

1143
00:56:58,740 --> 00:56:58,920
Bye.

1144
00:56:58,920 --> 00:56:59,240
Bye-bye.

1145
00:56:59,420 --> 00:56:59,900
Bye.

1146
00:57:02,180 --> 00:57:03,620
Hey, groovy cats.

1147
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:04,440
We are back.

1148
00:57:04,540 --> 00:57:09,040
And this is Buster Buttons from CKLW coming live from Thunder Bowl Lanes right here in

1149
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:09,480
Allen Park.

1150
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,060
Now, tonight, we have a very special treat.

1151
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:15,020
These guys, well, they're a long way from home.

1152
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:18,240
And I have to tell you kids that their getup is out of this world.

1153
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:20,880
Now, they call themselves the amino acids.

1154
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:23,320
And they're going to be, oh, I'm sorry, excuse me.

1155
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:25,920
They're the amino acids.

1156
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,260
And tonight, they're going to play a tune for you all called Connie.

1157
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,620
Take it away, fellas.

1158
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:42,340
They're the amino acids.

1159
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:53,040
And I'm Trip-Ssiκ and I will see you tomorrow night.

1160
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:53,060
Bye.

1161
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:53,240
Bye.

1162
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,240
Bye.

1163
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:54,720
Thanks, everyone.

1164
00:57:54,720 --> 00:57:56,580
See you tomorrow, bye.

1165
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,640
It squid be long.

1166
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:00,000
P me more.

1167
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:09,460
How was that, D?

1168
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:09,460


1169
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:09,460
