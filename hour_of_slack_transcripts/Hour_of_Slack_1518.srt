1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
Usually radio announcements merely recommend a product,

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:06,020
but this station provides its clients with a special service.

3
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:07,700
The Subgenius.

4
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:09,340
Our host.

5
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:10,840
Swag.

6
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,800
In the radio studios of Bob,

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,500
the technicians, the entertainers, the commentators,

8
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,140
the administrative personnel

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,400
daily unite their efforts in the creation of programs to please and entertain a vast radio public.

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,280
The wide variety of broadcasts include group discussions,

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,120
political speeches,

12
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,160
and comedy.

13
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,920
On this program, frank opinions are expressed in response to their leaders' questioning.

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,780
Questions of the day are discussed, and opinions and attitudes freely expressed on issues of the moment.

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,860
For there is keen interest in a radio program that invites personal participation by the public.

16
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:53,380
This is the Subgenius.

17
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,220
This is independent radio in a democracy.

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:03,820
From PR News in Washington, I'm calling on other world leaders to join the fight against PR's new report since Sunday.

19
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,340
A massive wild Obama is more than a third contained.

20
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,100
The only language understood is the language of death.

21
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,200
Obama decried the PR News.

22
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,120
On Wall Street, 1922-37,

23
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,660
Missouri Highway Patrol says this is PR News.

24
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,460
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, Bob Bob Bob.

25
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:26,300
Bob Dobbs, Bob Dobbs, Bob Bob Bob.

26
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,040


27
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,360
.

28
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,400
.

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,020
Dubs, bub, dubs, bub, dubs, bub!

30
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,180
Bub, bub, bub, bub, dubs, dubs!

31
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:42,580
Bub, dubs, bub, dubs, bub, dubs, bub!

32
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,220
Bub, dubs, bub, dubs, bub!

33
00:01:45,260 --> 00:01:47,160
Bub, dubs!

34
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,260
Man!

35
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:54,980
Hey!

36
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,300
That's awesome!

37
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,040
Why, it's rising up.

38
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,400
It's floating up.

39
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,960
Uh-oh, Hal's floating in it, man.

40
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:04,440
I thought I was just soaking in it.

41
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:06,800
Well, that's why I wore these special boots.

42
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,040
Clumsy to AI.

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,120
Because I'm standing in it.

44
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,120
Oh, I see.

45
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,520
Oh, you're standing on the collar.

46
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:16,220
Yeah, that's the humble figurine.

47
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:16,980
Get off the collar's toes.

48
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:20,940
Special is under the radio water waves.

49
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,580
Boy, it sure is good to be back on the show.

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:27,940
Yeah, there are always these cover stories flying around about where you went.

51
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,900
I always try to be honest.

52
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,740
You know, you went to Dobstown.

53
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:31,940
Yeah.

54
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:31,940


55
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:31,940


56
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,680
See, there's the airplane now.

57
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:36,200
The cover story was exceptionally clumsy.

58
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,460
Now, look at this footage.

59
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,400
And see how all these guys trying to get him out of there.

60
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,400


61
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,980
Do we have to watch on this old sheet?

62
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,860
Yeah, so what actually happened?

63
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,900
Where was I then?

64
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,880
You went to Dobstown.

65
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,860
Every year this time you go to Dobstown for the medication.

66
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,320
I want to make sure I have my story straight.

67
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:48,900
Yeah.

68
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,300
Yeah.

69
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:49,620
Oh, yeah.

70
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:54,020
I did a little glanscaping and did some minor surgery, you know.

71
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,600
Yeah.

72
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:01,480
Our friends in Daish made extraction from Dobstown a little bit uncomfortable for our own customers.

73
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:06,520
Well, my third nostril was a little clogged and I had to get a polypectomy in my third nostril.

74
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:07,140
Oh, wow.

75
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,700
They cored that baby out.

76
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:11,120
And I'll tell you, it sure works a lot better now.

77
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:12,940
I can whiff read miles away.

78
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,540
Yeah.

79
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:15,500
Is that an expensive procedure?

80
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,080
Oh, it's so expensive.

81
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,320
Paid for by your taxpayer dollars.

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,800
But with my new health care plan, and it works just fine.

83
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,680
I mean, it's excellent.

84
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,520
I didn't have to pay a thing.

85
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,200
I got some rich guy to do it for me.

86
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:29,640
That's right.

87
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:30,560
He paid it for me.

88
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,460
And that's it.

89
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,180
That's the important part.

90
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:32,620
Yeah.

91
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,820
Here as we sail along.

92
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,360
Eccentric billionaire, Ralph Fielding Smith.

93
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,980
The important thing for me was I didn't even care if he was rich or not.

94
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,600
It could have been like a hundred little poor people and I would have been fine with me.

95
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:43,980
But you know, it was Jay Beresford Tipton.

96
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:44,700
A hundred little poor people.

97
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:45,580
Reclusive millionaires.

98
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,900
Carrying you on a palanquin.

99
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,700
Thousands.

100
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,520
Instead, Jay Beresford Tipton comes in like a champ, you know.

101
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:55,320
Yeah, that guy's really the king of philanthropists all right.

102
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:55,680
No kidding.

103
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,740
Because of the sadistic way he deals out his money.

104
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,300
Yeah, you can't tell anybody where the money came from.

105
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:01,300
And I didn't tell anybody.

106
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,920
Dr. Howell did officially.

107
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:03,540
Yeah.

108
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,180
And I just.

109
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:07,200
And here we are talking about it on the radio, but nobody listens to this show.

110
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,280
And you know, they're not going to take the money back.

111
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,920
Yeah, this show was yesterday's newspaper.

112
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:11,800
Nobody cares.

113
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,220
And even if they do, I'm just going to say, you know, they'll send the bills and I'm

114
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,000
just going to say it's.

115
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:16,720
Really?

116
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,060
Yeah.

117
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,640
I'm not paying.

118
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,300
I say, sting it.

119
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,580
Sting it, man.

120
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,580
I'm going to have the people do this and then the people will share.

121
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,200
Hey, did you see where I found that stamp?

122
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,400
Stamp the plant?

123
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,280
Yeah.

124
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,200
I posted it on the.

125
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,040
On the internet waves.

126
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:34,840
The official puzzling evidence show fan page.

127
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,600
There's it's it's there.

128
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,900
It's always been there.

129
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,780
Always been there.

130
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:39,840
I posted it.

131
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,120
It's cramped the stamp.

132
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,220
Stamp the cramp.

133
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:42,540
Stamp the.

134
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
Stamping the cramp.

135
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,380
That's the thing.

136
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:45,340
Uncamp.

137
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:45,640
That's.

138
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,660
But I have to actually provide my own internet connection tonight.

139
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,660
I can't believe it.

140
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:50,840
I know.

141
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:53,460
Isn't that the strangest thing of the internet?

142
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:54,900
Sometimes they're in your.

143
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,140
And the radio.

144
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,580
In your brain.

145
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,520
Sometimes they're not.

146
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:00,540
Sometimes it's like a sight for a sore eye.

147
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,680
You know.

148
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:02,060
Which one?

149
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,080
This one in the middle here.

150
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,440
Now for a moment, let's consider an entirely different type of case.

151
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,760
The case of Bob.

152
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:15,880
One which shows how ambitious men can get ahead under our American system of free enterprise.

153
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:22,360
When Bob graduated from high school, Bob was surprised to learn that this Bob society had

154
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,480
created a special type of life for people of his type.

155
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:26,660
Right, Bob?

156
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,080
Well, life never was a burden.

157
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,960
In the first place.

158
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,180
Bob's flexible.

159
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,040
Bob can expand or contract.

160
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,500
Now, Bob has gone far.

161
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,580
Why not profit by Bob's example?

162
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:44,200
Send the postcard care of this station to the Bob Society.

163
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:48,380
Bob.

164
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,600
Bob.

165
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,320
Bob.

166
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:55,980


167
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:56,500
Bob.

168
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:56,820
Bob.

169
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,360
Bob.

170
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,360


171
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:00,480
Bob.

172
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:00,940
Bob.

173
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:01,240


174
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:02,700
Bob.

175
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,200
Bob.

176
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,720
Bob.

177
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,220
Bob.

178
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,000
Bob.

179
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,060
Bob.

180
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,060


181
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,060


182
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,180
Bob.

183
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,180


184
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,180


185
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,860
You can… if you want to be alone, you can be alone with Bob!

186
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:14,500
Bob.

187
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,120
Yeah!

188
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:17,680
You can be with him and you're still alone!

189
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,600
That's the miracle thing about Bob...

190
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:22,340
Bob.

191
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:23,860
Bob.

192
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:24,580
Bob.

193
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,180
Bob.

194
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:25,820
Bob.

195
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,000
He loves you, but you love Bob.

196
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,360
You have to.

197
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,240
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

198
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,300
He'll kill you.

199
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,060
So Bob, you out.

200
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,160
She's 24 now.

201
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,760
You heard it here first.

202
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:49,520
You heard it.

203
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,260
You don't love Bob.

204
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:50,900
You heard it here first.

205
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,800
Bob, you out.

206
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,180
You out.

207
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:59,400
1-3-0-1-3.

208
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,500
Bob?

209
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:09,420
1-3-0-1-3.

210
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:12,300
Bob?

211
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,420
Bob?

212
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,260
Bob?

213
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,080
Bob likes raw meat.

214
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:18,800
Yeah.

215
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,580
Bob, come now.

216
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,740
You better investigate.

217
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:22,880
You may have got into trouble.

218
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:24,160
Bob, smell food.

219
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:25,840
That man.

220
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:26,460
Yeah.

221
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,480
There's something familiar about him.

222
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:31,820
Bob?

223
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,300
Bob?

224
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:41,020
Bob?

225
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,600
Bob?

226
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,080
Bob?

227
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:44,120
Bob?

228
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:44,980
Bob?

229
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,460
Bob?

230
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,960
Bob?

231
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:46,960


232
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,280
Bob?

233
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:49,740
Bob?

234
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:49,740


235
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:49,740


236
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:49,740


237
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,780
Bob?

238
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:50,780


239
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:50,780


240
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:50,780


241
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:50,780


242
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:50,780


243
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:50,780


244
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:50,780


245
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:50,780


246
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:50,780


247
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:50,780


248
00:07:58,740 --> 00:07:59,340
Bob?

249
00:07:59,400 --> 00:07:59,500
Bob?

250
00:07:59,580 --> 00:07:59,580


251
00:07:59,580 --> 00:07:59,580


252
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,320
Bob won't solve your problems,

253
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,460
but he will help you to blow them off!

254
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,540
You can't use Bob as a crutch,

255
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,380
because he's already using you as a crutch, my friend.

256
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,660
Well, gee, it's Bob.

257
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:30,840
Yeah, Bob. Yeah, but Bob's going to be there. Even if Bob Bob Bob. Yeah, well, no. Yes, if Bob Bob Bob.

258
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,540
You make me sick.

259
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,660
Don't bother.

260
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:31,440
You make me sick.

261
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,860
You make me sick.

262
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,860
It's literally Bob.

263
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,380
I shall go before the United Nations and demand that they accede to our total and absolute control.

264
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,760
I think he rules his own.

265
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,620
Please be serious.

266
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,960
Good morning. This weekend we commemorate Bob Day.

267
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,920
Bob is a proven leader who has served six presidents, four Republicans and two Democrats.

268
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,640
And he has shown that he can do it.

269
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,520
He is an agent of change.

270
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,240
And I am deeply grateful for his service.

271
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,180
Clear, clear.

272
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,740
And I pledge to the party.

273
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:17,060
He doesn't care about your sins.

274
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,300
He comes not to forgive but to rationalize.

275
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,340
He brings not forgiveness but an excuse.

276
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,480
And what did you really need?

277
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,640
If you want your sins forgiven, friends, do it yourself.

278
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:33,940
If you're a subgenius, you're probably already pretty good at that.

279
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:46,220
Jesus may have died for your sins, but Bob Dobbs made a damn fool of himself and of you for your sins.

280
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,440
Hello, Bob.

281
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,280
And I'm so happy to give my personal testimony.

282
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,280


283
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,280


284
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,280


285
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,280


286
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,280


287
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,280


288
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,280


289
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:50,280


290
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:54,980
Fifty years ago, I was a freshman in high school.

291
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,560
And that happened May 10th, 1941.

292
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,920
I accepted Bob as my personal savior and he's never let me down since.

293
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,700
I'm a retired teacher, a widow, I've had cancer and all kinds of stuff.

294
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:07,300
But he's always by my side.

295
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:08,800
Thank you so much.

296
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:09,980
Bob, Bob, Bob.

297
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,740
Do Bob and sex go hand in hand?

298
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:18,160
Well, Bob is a kind of total all-consuming sex.

299
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:19,500
Fuck!

300
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,260
Can you believe that?

301
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,260


302
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,260


303
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,260


304
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,260


305
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,260


306
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,260


307
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,260


308
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,260


309
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,260


310
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,260


311
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:20,260


312
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:25,120
You can come when you throw good money after bad and bad money after Bob!

313
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,860
And you can do that at our lovely sales table down there.

314
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:35,880
Bob?

315
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:47,120
I did that mix with some sounds chopped by Leemur, Norell Preff and The Large.

316
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,080
The titles were by The Bishop.

317
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:52,000
PR News is by Leemur.

318
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,960
Good King Bob was Psychoskeletons.

319
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:00,120
And later, we'll hear songs by Max Slack and Reverend Ed Fred.

320
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:06,260
But the rest of this show is all puzzling evidence from the KPFA Berkeley show featuring

321
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,780
Dr. Howell, Dr. Philo Drummond and host Puzzling Evidence.

322
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:14,940
All of this is from the April 10, 2015 episode.

323
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:20,240
And I think listeners will agree that it's a great excuse for me to talk about my life

324
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:20,340
as a male.

325
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:20,720
So, let's take a break.

326
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,100
Price Bob.

327
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:31,460
Someday they'll just transplant your head on an orangutan's body.

328
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,540
So that explains it.

329
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:41,760
If you have enough money, that is, you know, the rest of your body will be worn out.

330
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,520
They'll be looking for something.

331
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,160
They'll clone some orangutans.

332
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:49,980
You know, you can take an orangutan or maybe a gorilla.

333
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,080
You might want a gorilla.

334
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:54,320
They're a little bit more rough, you know, in their bodies.

335
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:58,300
I don't do well in a domestic situation.

336
00:13:58,300 --> 00:13:59,560
We're just the orangutan.

337
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,960
Look what happened to Mighty Joe Young.

338
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,620
They go haywire.

339
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,960
They do property damage.

340
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,840
You've got to be careful, you know, when you just wander around in the jungle

341
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,360
and they have those experimentation stations with those crazy scientists here.

342
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:14,900
They're a jungle.

343
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:21,780
Yes, we've got Pella Lugosi out there and Charles Lawton and Albert Decker.

344
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,280
Here, I'm trying to get this all down.

345
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:27,800
I want to make sure that we take everything into context here.

346
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:33,320
But we ultimately have the various jungle animals crossing with humans

347
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:38,260
at various stages of completion, you know, and the hideosity.

348
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:43,940
Well, not in the case of Dr. Moreau or the leopard creature in Terror is a Man.

349
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,520
Because those guys are humanoids made from the flesh of animals

350
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:53,360
through a diabolical scientific procedure.

351
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,320
But they aren't crossing with humans.

352
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,740
Well, they should.

353
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:58,720
I mean, I'm just saying.

354
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,640
They're artificially bringing out humanoid features in them.

355
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:08,060
The point of the whole thing is that there's no real difference between them and us.

356
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,200
It's just a molding of flesh.

357
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:14,080
But it's more weird and gruesome to cross the species.

358
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,860
It's in an hideous way.

359
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,860
You don't have to do it except in test tubes.

360
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,020
You don't actually have to have a dog.

361
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:21,300
Well, Pella Lugosi was always doing that with an ape.

362
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,260
Wasn't he?

363
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,220
Pella Lugosi.

364
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,040
Remember that on Atlantis, the Lost Convent?

365
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:28,180
All right, here we are.

366
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:28,720
I do.

367
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,360
Well, those were the evil scientists of Atlantis.

368
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:37,200
And they would turn you into a pig man or a dog man or something like that.

369
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,200
Just for the heck of it.

370
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,400
They were sadistic, aristocratic.

371
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,280
The George Powell version with that giant crystal device that folks use.

372
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:50,140
Yeah, and then it goes haywire and it turns people into skeletons as it swings around at random.

373
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:50,980
Yeah, that was great.

374
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,980
I hate that show.

375

That's what the show does to you.

You hated that show?

377
00:15:55,360 --> 00:16:01,340
Well, then I was just doing a show and suddenly the laser turned around and it was square in the face.

378
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,940
That's why you're so skeleton-like now.

You gave the truth to the bird.

479
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:52,720

Oh, I mean, it's really awfully good that he would come to X Day.

494

Well, that'll probably go through.

00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:22,760

I'm real curious about Athens and Columbus.

511
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:43,520
And the one place I will go before I die, Wright-Patt Air Museum, because they have the most amazing airplane parking museum.

512
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:46,260
Sort of like that place in, you know, arrivals.

514
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,500
The one in Tucson.

515
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,740

516
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,320

519
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:54,460
They gave me a free lunch.

520
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,220
A free lunch, yeah.

521
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:55,900
When I got there.

522
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:56,920
There was no free lunch.

523
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,560
Not even a mention of free lunch.

524
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,600

Where's my lunch?

526
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,380
And Bishop Joey forgot to say, where's my lunch?

527
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,000
To induct everybody in at the beginning.

528
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:07,920
And tell them about the...

529
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,340
He's slipping.

530
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,540
He did later along the trail.

531
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:10,920
Yes.

532
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:11,940
What's wrong with him?

533
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,680
I don't know, man.

534
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,260
Well, you can't always keep that stuff in there.

535
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:18,180
I was really hoping he'd be here so I could chastise him mercifully, and now he can't.

536
00:21:18,180 --> 00:21:19,600
I'm going to have to do it another occasion.

537
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:21,160
Just keep that indignation fresh.

538
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:22,640
Keep it fresh and hot.

539
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,160
And the next time you see him, you're going to...

540
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:30,400
He is, by the way, going out to give a speak about mime troupe-like things on Sunday in England.

541
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:31,400
What does he know about that?

542
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,340
It's a terrible thing to do.

543
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:32,940
He read some books.

544
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,160
It's not like a free job.

545
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:34,880
Listen to...

546
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:35,200
With a free lunch.

547
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,060
He listened to an album once about it.

548
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:39,840
Somebody's going to give him a free lunch when he gets there, I'll bet.

549
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,100
His own other poems are no longer available in any store.

550
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:43,720
He'd drive anywhere for a free lunch.

Dow is 34254.

565
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,500
4241.

566
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:39,820
Mortgage giant Freddie Mortgage Rate says this is PR News.

567
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:48,120
And then she said, I can't believe that that whole thing is that color.

568
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,820
It's just amazing and horrible.

569
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:50,380
Yeah.

570
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,020
And everybody laughed really hard.

571
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,400
I couldn't look.

572
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,980
I could not look at what I saw.

573
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:58,140
It's just so sickening and yet hilariously funny.

574
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:58,680
Yeah.

575
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,000
Like most painful episodes are.

576
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,620
But it had that bright white kind of...

577
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,960
Minkish smell about it, you know.

578
00:23:06,020 --> 00:23:06,320
Yeah.

579
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,640
That electric smell.

580
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,220
Yeah.

581
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:17,920
So interesting the things that happen on the show that get intruded upon by that commercial break.

582
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,380
Some people would think it was...

583
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,900
Seems like that's when the show's apex is.

584
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,300
The hand of providence.

585
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:28,140
The show's apex happens and then all of a sudden the commercial break just jumps on it.

586
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,280
An apex novel.

587
00:23:29,380 --> 00:23:30,300
A hideous little ape.

588
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,840
A little funny little ape with its...

589
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:34,380
Funny little ape.

590
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,560
Got pants on.

591
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,880
Somebody's put pants on this.

592
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,460
Yes, with those yellow buttons.

593
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,920
That's really in bad taste.

594
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:40,060
Yeah.

595
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,640
It's kind of a chimpanzee-like ape.

596
00:23:41,740 --> 00:23:41,880
Yeah, exactly.

597
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,760
Jumping up and down on the show.

598
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,600
Very uneasy making.

599
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:49,280
That's what that commercial break is like.

600
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:51,180
A chimpanzee with pants on.

601
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,680
Jumping on the show.

602
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,280
A chimpanzee.

603
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,480
A pantsy, that is to say.

604
00:23:57,580 --> 00:24:02,520
He's been forced to assume trousers against his natural...

605
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,960
Trying to make him into a man.

606
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:04,380
Yeah.

607
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,340
He's been forced to assume trousers against his natural.

608
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:06,780
But that can never happen.

609
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:10,600
Just as in Revenge of the Creature.

610
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,840
You know, they try to humanize the creature from the Black Lagoon.

611
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,080
No amount of pants.

612
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,540
You remember that?

613
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,260
Well, yeah.

614
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,980
That was a bio-crime.

615
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,140
They tried to change him.

616
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:18,960
Yeah, tried to cut him up and stuff.

617
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,820
Because you'll never get him that manly, but you'll just make him less creature-y.

618
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:24,860
Exactly.

619
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,420
So what?

620
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,400
What do you want?

621
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,020
Taxi Bob number three here.

622
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,280
Hey, Taxi Bob.

623
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:32,540
I'll go down to the marina.

624
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:33,240
You made it.

625
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:34,380
Yes, I will.

626
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:40,240
It's going to blow your mind that Neanderthals had intimate relations with modern humans.

627
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,360
Oh, yeah.

628
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,180
I think it's a show.

629
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,100
But I knew that all along.

630
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:46,240
I mean, they were for a long time considered a different species.

631
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,200
Exactly.

632
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,180
That's why they couldn't...

633
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:48,920
It made the most sense.

634
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,860
They couldn't accept that for a long time because of their preconceptions.

635
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,920
But it's rather obvious that we loved them to death.

636
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,380
That's why they're not around anymore.

637
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:02,980
We absorbed them into the human genome.

638
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,980
You know what I'm saying?

639
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:04,860
They weren't exterminated.

640
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:17,260
In a more recent time, there's a lot of Indian or Native American blood that's in the genome as well.

641
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:21,980
That's spread out a lot because of the forced...

642
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:22,620
Yeah.

643
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:23,960
Forced on the...

644
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,340
Who was that guy?

645
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:29,060
He's a Spanish biologist.

646
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:31,640
God.

647
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:32,780
God did it.

648
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,740
He got DNA.

649
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,420
He got DNA from ancient Neanderthal bones.

650
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,200
God did it.

651
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,060
Well, now you're starting to sound a little bit...

652
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:42,640
Scary.

653
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:43,420
Yeah.

654
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,300
I mean, they got DNA from Neanderthal bones.

655
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,980
I wish I had a Neanderthal.

656
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,680
Just a friend.

657
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,360
DNA, he talks to you rapidly.

658
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,160
And those things are...

659
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,280
Yes, just a friend.

660
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,660
Go down to the club with...

661
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,120
Four or five percent DNA.

662
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:54,860
Neanderthal.

663
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,900
Yeah, and you know how it varied across...

664
00:25:56,900 --> 00:26:00,100
Some were as high as eight and some had zero.

665
00:26:00,180 --> 00:26:03,220
Like, nobody in Japan had any Neanderthal.

666
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:04,300
Neanderthal DNA.

667
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,420
The Ainu or the guys we know now?

668
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,380
The Ainu do, but the standard Japanese do not.

669
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:10,720
Do not have it.

670
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:14,980
Because they also come from the mainland, ultimately.

671
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:15,640
Right.

672
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:16,960
Going back far.

673
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,220
But they didn't go through.

674
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:22,600
They didn't do that little mixing action that mostly occurred in Western Europe.

675
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:27,920
Not any invasions that were comparable.

676
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:28,900
Oh, there we go.

677
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:30,840
I knew it was going to get back to the subs.

678
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,020
The same way.

679
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,220
Sublimation.

680
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:39,880
Peoples except for Native Africans have some Neanderthal in them.

681
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,240
Oh, that's what it was.

682
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,580
Can you see that in the DNA?

683
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,860
Can you get that in a little report card?

684
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,940
And then the Denisovans.

685
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,160
I heard there were gorillas running around San Francisco and ministry.

686
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,060
That's what I heard.

687
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,580
Looks like wild gorillas.

688
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,540
Refugees from the Golden Will of Love.

689
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,380
You know, and everything?

690
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,000
Yeah.

691
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,740
Yeah, and then a couple of hogsheads.

692
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,220
Yeah, yeah.

693
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,720
I mean, Anthony Quinn.

694
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,380
Dry out the sheets and we're on our way.

695
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,740
Wild gorillas.

696
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,120
And I was just reading.

697
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:14,560
Sorry.

698
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:15,500
So sad.

699
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:21,100
A French frigate was given lots of wonderful Incan Peruvian things.

700
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,620
And then the British showed up and firebombed the town and killed all the little French guys on the ships.

701
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:31,300
And all that nice Inca statuary went to the bottom of somebody's bay.

702
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,460
Can you imagine that first generation?

703
00:27:33,980 --> 00:27:37,720
The Neanderthal-Chromanian mix where they had mixed together.

704
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:44,860
And so now you have this half Neanderthal, half human.

705
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,420
They must have seen very...

706
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:49,380
Can you imagine the rejection they got?

707
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:55,760
The Neanderthal gene was considered status.

708
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:56,740
High status.

709
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,380
And, you know, if you could...

710
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:02,140
Sure, to the Neanderthals it was.

711
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:03,440
No, to the humans.

712
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,460
To the humans because there were more of them than there were Neanderthals.

713
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,380
I mean, Cro-Magnon or what have you.

714
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:12,320
The modern ones.

715
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:15,620
No, I think they served as their, you know, like their...

716
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:17,500
Servant class?

717
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,540
Yeah, their servant class for a while.

718
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,920
No, I think they just wanted to have...

719
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,820
Yeah, I don't think so.

720
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,540
The sachet that they were in.

721
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,960
They just did with them what they wanted to do.

722
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,860
There are differing theories.

723
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,080
William Golding's novel, The Inheritors, is about...

724
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:38,440
Cro-Magnon coming in as horrible killers and killing off the Neanderthals.

725
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:41,860
And the story is from their point of view, the Neanderthal.

726
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:48,280
I thought it was interesting that some of the genetic variants known to be associated with specific traits

727
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:51,980
likely came from Neanderthals, such as...

728
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:52,460
Red hair?

729
00:28:52,620 --> 00:29:01,520
Such as lupus, biliary cirrhosis, Crohn's disease, optic disc size, and type 2 diabetes.

730
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:03,380
And also some behavior such as...

731
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:05,120
Which is the ability to stop smoking.

732
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,620
Any good things?

733
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:11,340
I guess these Neanderthals had a problem stopping smoking.

734
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:12,840
Yes, they...

735
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:15,600
Well, you know how chimps go for cigars and so on.

736
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,680
It's the same thing with that variety of primate as well.

737
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,700
Oh, man.

738
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:31,840
Yeah, apparently some of the Neanderthal genes affected keratin filaments, which produced more fibrous protein.

739
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:32,740
Hey, Al, is there a quiz on this?

740
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:36,040
No, it sounds awfully speculative to me.

741
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:40,180
No, and the other thing is, I don't believe it unless I hear it as a question.

742
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:47,200
Yeah, if anyone was interested, but it'd be the usual questions about farts and Jesus and so forth.

743
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,500
That's going to be there tonight, right?

744
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,620
Yes, that is tonight.

745
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,900
It's going to happen.

746
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,260
Abortions and biking.

747
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:56,760
Actually, you know what's sad is there's not enough of that.

748
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:57,500
We can't really...

749
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:00,680
People aren't eating enough chips and grease and salt and...

750
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,060
Lead.

751
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:01,880
...vitamin, sugar.

752
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,060
They drink lead.

753
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:03,800
They drink.

754
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,640
Now, they don't even eat the chips anymore.

755
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:04,660
They drink.

756
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:07,560
I was touching on the one thing that even an X-Day works.

757
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,120
They drink.

758
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,680
They do drink.

759
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:11,240
They drink all sorts of things.

760
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:16,840
And it's like this bourgeois barbecue coming on an X-Day in Egypt.

761
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,080
It's just a bunch of...

762
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:29,180
You know, the X-Day is on what used to be the Western Interior Seaway, the vast, shallow sea that went from the Arctic all the way down to the Gulf of Mexico.

763
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,260
And why'd you have to bring that up?

764
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,280
There were dinosaurs and huge crocodiles.

765
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:34,840
And dinosaurs and roe.

766
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,900
Well, plesiosaurs, ichthyosaurs, and so forth.

767
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:44,120
Now, that depression is still there and could still be filled with water.

768
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:55,560
All we need is a sufficient rise in the global water level to turn that same basin, now a major part of our country, into another ocean.

769
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,220
Yeah, that'd be cool.

770
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,140
Well, I'm glad you think so.

771
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:03,200
Yes.

772
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:05,060
Look, you said it on the radio and it happened.

773
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:28,220
The fact that they have these predetermined characteristics that are these negative aspects of the Neanderthal genome suggests that there was quite a bit of difficulty in early 500,000 years ago, whenever this interaction occurred, that the challenges for interbreeding were much more dramatic at that point.

774
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,980
Well, you know, it wasn't even that long ago.

775
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:33,000
From what my understanding is, it was as recent as...

776
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:37,600
30,000, maybe even more recent than that.

777
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:38,940
30,000 years ago.

778
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:39,720
Right.

779
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:42,280
I mean, in terms of their development, they'd been separated.

780
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,800
Oh, yeah, yeah.

781
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,220
In terms of the Earth, that isn't long, but in terms of humans, it is long.

782
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:54,320
They had not had interbreeding with each other for at least 500,000 years.

783
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,940
That was the point there.

784
00:31:56,180 --> 00:32:01,900
So, when they did first begin intermingling, there was quite a bit of genetic challenge.

785
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,320
At that point...

786
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,940
There was a certain time that, you know, over time, as they were...

787
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,040
Some of those negative traits were selected out, but some of them still remain.

788
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:17,680
There was like a punctuated equilibrium...

789
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:18,840
A punctuated...

790
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:19,780
Eardrum.

791
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,040
Thing that...

792
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:21,560
Evolution.

793
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,940
What's that word?

794
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,520
You are on it.

795
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:25,580
Punctuated equilibrium.

796
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,340
Yeah.

797
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,640
Right.

798
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,660
And there was geographic separation.

799
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,600
So, they were on the verge of becoming different species.

800
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,360
But they had...

801
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,660
They hadn't quite gotten there yet.

802
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,060
Well, not just that, too.

803
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:42,320
During their commingling, there were several different waves of commingling that happened

804
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,940
with large amounts of time between them.

805
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:52,760
So that the variance of the subsequent commingling had already had, you know, a great amount

806
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:53,200
of mixture in it.

807
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:58,140
I think the common ancestral stock was a lineage of Homo erectus.

808
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,300
And don't forget the Denisovians...

809
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:01,300
That's right.

810
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:02,460
...influenced it as well.

811
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,360
The Denisovians...

812
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,000
The Denisovians are quite interesting to me.

813
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:06,580
You never hear about them.

814
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:08,020
Nobody ever writes about them.

815
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,900
But they are that other group that is unaccounted for.

816
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,540
The other, the third, not Neanderthal, not human population.

817
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,780
Yeah, they're not the Cro-Magnon, they're not the Neanderthal, but they're out there.

818
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,340
Not that much is known about them.

819
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:23,520
The Denisovians.

820
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:26,520
But they did provide a different genetic stock.

821
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:29,840
Yeah, they had some variety to the old human mix.

822
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,920
They're one of the 58 varieties?

823
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:38,480
Well, you remember, according to subgenius theory, we subgeniuses are the inheritors of

824
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,420
the Yeti genetic...

825
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:45,340
And the Denisovians may be explained by that subsequent commingling that produced the...

826
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,120
Commingling.

827
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:46,900
420.

828
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,080
That variant.

829
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:48,800
420.

830
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,420
No, it's 419 according to the laser clock here.

831
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,840
419.50, 419.51.

832
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:56,060
Some laser is going to blast you.

833
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:59,080
This is straight from the pipe that's connected to the sun.

834
00:33:59,160 --> 00:34:00,480
That's what my Hopi friend told me.

835
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,900
The pipe that rocks the crypt.

836
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,940
Now, 420.01, 02.

837
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,540
Okay, begin your 420 experiments.

838
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:10,020
You guys know more about this than I do.

839
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,500
I'm going to bow out and absorb what you had to say.

840
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:14,680
Thanks for calling.

841
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,420
Thanks, yeah.

842
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,160
Thanks for listening.

843
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:19,140
Thanks for helping this promotion day.

844
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:20,320
Keep your eyes on the road.

845
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,860
Veering wildly all about...

846
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,980
Taxi Bob number three.

847
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:26,960
Thank you.

848
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,040
There he goes.

849
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:29,580
Signing out.

850
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,520
Well, he seemed to have provided...

851
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,900
To pick up another dubious...

852
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,260
Good morning.

853
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:32,940
Some kind of...

854
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:33,280
Good morning.

855
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:33,980
Good morning.

856
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,940
Customer satisfaction...

857
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,580
Good morning.

858
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,480
That we aim for on the show.

859
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:38,680
You, yeah.

860
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,980
Good morning.

861
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:41,320
We aim for the customers.

862
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,200
Out the window.

863
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:42,660
Yeah.

864
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,380
They're down there in the parking lot and we...

865
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:47,980
Well, the bathroom window is open and...

866
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:49,920
You know.

867
00:34:51,940 --> 00:35:00,480
Anyway, so we're always happy to take your calls and receive your heart onto whatever the god of the week is here.

868
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,980
Jesus, whatever, Bob.

869
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:06,760
Jesus, Bob.

870
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,620
Jesus, Bob.

871
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,000
Do you have to bring that up again?

872
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:10,940
Well, I...

873
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:12,260
It's...

874
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:22,380
Interesting, you know, that there was a lot of speculation as far as whether Neanderthals could speak or if they had to develop a complicated language and...

875
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:31,700
Did you read those gene awful novels about the blonde bombshell brought up among the Neanderthals and they don't entirely speak but they...

876
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:31,900
Right.

877
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:34,940
They just pluck and click and they gesticulate and that's part of their language.

878
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:35,360
Right.

879
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:36,360
They make these gestures.

880
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,100
But they also...

881
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:50,400
The point being as far as when they matched up the DNA sequences, they found long sections in the area that were important to the role in human speech that were completely depleted in the Neanderthal DNA.

882
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,380
I, for one, have found this particular episode of show to be fascinating and it's just...

883
00:35:56,380 --> 00:36:01,600
There's no way I could contribute anything of any more...

884
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,640
Value.

885
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,280
Well, you don't have any memories...

886
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:05,620
Really?

887
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:08,740
...in the drunk caveman times?

888
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:09,600
He's trying to...

889
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,260
Well, you could probably find something of value.

890
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:14,500
Well, you remember Luana and Newton.

891
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,220
It's all I can.

892
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:15,860
Luana?

893
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:16,440
Me, me, me.

894
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:16,880
The...

895
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:23,660
Between them, there was great enmity because they were both fond of the same guy, Tumat.

896
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,600
Some areas of modern non-African human DNA...

897
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:31,580
...are...

898
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:41,680
...were rich in Neanderthal matches, which may have indicated that they were helpful for human survival during those periods when there was great difficulty.

899
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:46,140
Well, this is certainly Monday morning quarterbacking on a grand geological scale.

900
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:50,120
Naturally, it helped survival because the survivors are writing this account.

901
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:50,860
Exactly.

902
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,640
Well, that's the important thing is that...

903
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:59,280
...that the evidence itself is proof of its ability to be selected for a future generation, right?

904
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:01,580
The evidence is always puzzling.

905
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:03,940
I had the same thing experience with the Toy Fair.

906
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:06,940
Everything is known and everyone has consensus about it.

907
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:11,620
I've got this new toy called the Ball of Wax and that's...

908
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,220
Ball of Wax?

909
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,800
Just like the weather string.

910
00:37:15,580 --> 00:37:16,420
...pretty puzzling.

911
00:37:17,160 --> 00:37:17,600
Yeah.

912
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:19,840
And it's sort of a...

913
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,240
Did someone say that?

914
00:37:20,420 --> 00:37:21,660
Yeah, somebody said that.

915
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,680
Can you believe it?

916
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,380
...and what you're actually that same guy.

917
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:25,160
Oh, it might have been you.

918
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,480
I'll check this out.

919
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:27,660
The evidence is pretty puzzling.

920
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,600
The designer of this toy discusses the way that...

921
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:34,100
...the brain and the hand...

922
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,700
You said brain.

923
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:38,480
...developed around the same time, about 500,000 years ago.

924
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:39,900
And I was...

925
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:43,420
At the Toy Fair, I was pitching it to this guy and...

926
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:44,740
A brain or a hand?

927
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:47,380
He was pitching the brain at the guy.

928
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:51,040
And you're pitching a brain at the hand and the hand catches the brain.

929
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,400
Yeah, 5,000 years ago.

930
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,520
...how human beings evolved 500,000 years ago.

931
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:56,360
500,000 years ago.

932
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,700
And as soon as I said that, he sneered at me and said,

933
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:00,040
Oh, that's just your opinion.

934
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,100
Whoa!

935
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:03,100
Yeah.

936
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,420
This toy is not for you.

937
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,200
You just made that up right there, to sell me something.

938
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:08,820
That's just your opinion.

939
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:12,180
I'm pretty sure this guy was from Tennessee, from his accent.

940
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:14,140
I'm not betting on myself.

941
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:15,060
Yeah, he's...

942
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:15,420
Wow.

943
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:16,180
Wow.

944
00:38:16,180 --> 00:38:20,880
Some of those people still think the Earth is only like 6,000 years old.

945
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,480
6,000 years.

946
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:26,580
Yeah, that makes sense, because there was 1,000 years, and then 5,000 years ago, he said,

947
00:38:26,620 --> 00:38:27,780
the brain and the hand developed.

948
00:38:27,820 --> 00:38:29,320
I've heard a preacher tell me that...

949
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,400
I've heard a preacher tell me that...

950
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:30,520
...that...

951
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:35,260
...that God put the dinosaurs in the Earth to confound the mind of man.

952
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:38,980
But there's this Christian group called God Hates Dinosaurs.

953
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:39,740
And it works, right?

954
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,600
To make mind...

955
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:42,340
I like that.

956
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:42,640
...to make people question.

957
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,500
Yeah, yeah.

958
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:48,260
I think that's why John Kennedy was shown, to make people question.

959
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,360
...the human hand and the brain...

960
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,340
This would be the most difficult part I have about moving into the South.

961
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,000
Why?

962
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:57,840
Yeah.

963
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,140
Because we're encountering more of that type of thinking.

964
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,420
Just by accident.

965
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,340
Wonderful people.

966
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:02,760
Just by accident.

967
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,780
Great people, and all of a sudden, it's like, boom, the curtain just goes down.

968
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,500
Human beings suddenly work.

969
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:09,980
Yeah, I'll have to insulate myself.

970
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,120
Well, you know, I was in...

971
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:18,280
I went to a southern town, and I went to a military school with Nora, and we're in the

972
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:23,660
car, and it was light winter, and I was doing a controlled skid off the highway at this

973
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,880
point, into the mud, thinking, you know, it's not going to be bad.

974
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,120
We'll get out of this pretty fast.

975
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:27,820
And then I got out of the car, and I was in the car, and I was in the car, and I was

976
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:27,940
in the car, and I was in the car.

977
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,480
And my next thought was, somebody's going to stop and help us, because that's the Shenandoah

978
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:31,700
Valley.

979
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:38,940
But you cannot talk about religion, or birth control, or the president, you know, or stuff

980
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:39,960
like that, because they'll just...

981
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:45,840
And sure enough, right behind us was a car, guys in their best white loafers got out,

982
00:39:45,900 --> 00:39:46,960
helped us in the snowstorm.

983
00:39:47,060 --> 00:39:47,760
Amazing people.

984
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,300
And then they probably wanted to pray, right?

985
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:52,060
Probably.

986
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,220
That happens, too.

987
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,680
Sometimes you have to pray.

988
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:55,060
Yeah.

989
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,440
Thank Jesus and stuff.

990
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:57,380
Yeah, and stuff.

991
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:57,620
Faith.

992
00:39:57,620 --> 00:39:57,800
Faith.

993
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:57,960
Faith.

994
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,460
Thank you, Jesus.

995
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,020
That's tough.

996
00:39:59,100 --> 00:39:59,960
I had to do that one time.

997
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:00,700
I sold a...

998
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:06,800
I was working as a Yellow Pages rep in East Texas, and I called on a church.

999
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,900
It was a Baptist church.

1000
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:08,900
Wow, yeah.

1001
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:13,760
And I was trying to convince the preacher that they should buy an ad for the Yellow

1002
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,220
Pages.

1003
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,440
Yeah, of course.

1004
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:21,700
And so I said, you know, one of my questions I asked was, I said, well...

1005
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:26,520
He was asking, he didn't know if it would be worth it, you know, the price.

1006
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:29,680
And I said, well, you know, how much is the price of a soul?

1007
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:35,800
And he looked at me like, wow, that was really a good thing.

1008
00:40:35,900 --> 00:40:38,200
You know, I was like, that was the thing that clinched the sale.

1009
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,800
That's the thing you put outside on the street.

1010
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,580
That was the thing that clinched the sale.

1011
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,420
Yeah, and it's the thing you put on the little board.

1012
00:40:43,560 --> 00:40:43,740
And he said, okay, I'll do it.

1013
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,200
You put on the little board with the letters outside, how much is the price of a soul?

1014
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:47,720
Right.

1015
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:50,020
And so he said, okay, I'll do it.

1016
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:50,500
Yeah.

1017
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:51,520
Oh, excellent.

1018
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,860
And he said, all right, now let's get down.

1019
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:54,720
We have to get down on our knees and pray now.

1020
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,500
So we had to pray over the ad to pray.

1021
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:56,500


1022
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:58,100
And he said, you know, we have to make the ad, you know, super nice.

1023
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:58,740
Yeah.

1024
00:40:58,860 --> 00:40:59,300
Yeah.

1025
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:03,040
And just out of curiosity, how much did the ad cost?

1026
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:07,760
Oh, back then it was probably no more than $25 a month or something like that.

1027
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:08,360
It was really.

1028
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,780
No, it's a bargain.

1029
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,120
It was relatively cheap.

1030
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:18,340
But, you know, this was back when $25 was probably more like $250 now, you know, or

1031
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:24,220
maybe $200 or maybe $175, $178, $179, something like that.

1032
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:26,480
Do we have to work this out before the other show?

1033
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:31,620
I've got this little spreadsheet here that if I'm going to give you each a copy on this

1034
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,820
disc, I want you to take this home and I want you to study it.

1035
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:35,280
Yeah.

1036
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,160
It's Excel.

1037
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,540
And I hope you have the new version.

1038
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:41,000
If you don't, then you're going to have to go to the expense to download that.

1039
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,140
Get a new flash drive.

1040
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:43,640
Yeah.

1041
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,900
You got to get new drives.

1042
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,600
I got to get a new flash mob.

1043
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,000
Flash everything.

1044
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,500
Flash driving out there.

1045
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,360
Yeah.

1046
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:50,760
Yeah.

1047
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:51,000
Yeah.

1048
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,760
Get a ride with flash.

1049
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:53,020
Here we go.

1050
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,100
Boopie.

1051
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:58,860
And so flash took the entire show to the desert.

1052
00:41:59,020 --> 00:41:59,380
Wow.

1053
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:00,380
In a flash.

1054
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:05,380
And then of course the cops stopped us and we all were all in a mess two hours later.

1055
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:18,120
Have you seen a guy driving a pickup truck, pulling a trailer with a UFO on it with a beard

1056
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:20,780
and a ... Hold on there, officer.

1057
00:42:20,860 --> 00:42:22,400
The UFO has a beard?

1058
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:24,080
I don't wait for it.

1059
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:25,080
It's a helmet.

1060
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:46,840
It was cap and check друзья, You you stay here.

1061
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:54,060
In the course of the process, we had nine falando da vida, he was

1062
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:54,060


1063
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:54,060


1064
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:56,280
and so that would have caused

1065
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,740
Where is this occasioning?

1066
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,940
In the genome

1067
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,880
No, but I mean physically

1068
00:43:01,880 --> 00:43:02,680
where are the little

1069
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:06,660
Neanderthals and others

1070
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,080
meeting?

1071
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:09,260
Oh, it's like in the Iberian Peninsula

1072
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,960
You know, on northern Africa

1073
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,460
and the Iberian Peninsula

1074
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,600
Back when that was all green

1075
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,640
and not desert

1076
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,460
And the Mediterranean for a long time

1077
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,520
was dry

1078
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:23,480
When there was a period of time

1079
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,900
when the Mediterranean was dry

1080
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,860
you could walk across the Mediterranean

1081
00:43:26,860 --> 00:43:29,460
And you couldn't walk to Berlin

1082
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:30,140
and the Ichthyosaur

1083
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:33,000
No, but there was a deep, deep chasm

1084
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:33,960
Everything was all backwards

1085
00:43:33,960 --> 00:43:35,580
in the olden days

1086
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,960
Back when we used to feed

1087
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:42,300
on Ichthyosaur steaks

1088
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:45,140
sitting by the side of old Pangea

1089
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:46,700
cooking them up

1090
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:49,180
I can't wait till Pangea comes back again

1091
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,040
We'll have to wait a while

1092
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:51,480
for that

1093
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,480
Okay, we'll just sit down here and rest then

1094
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,100
I'm writing a song

1095
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,540
It's called Pangea, We'll Meet Again

1096
00:43:58,540 --> 00:44:00,620
In the far, far future

1097
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,720
there will only be one continent

1098
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,660
The continent of Zothique

1099
00:44:04,660 --> 00:44:07,580
That's happened about five times overall

1100
00:44:07,580 --> 00:44:09,160
You know, we talk about Pangea

1101
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:10,980
It only happened once

1102
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,840
There were several of them

1103
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:14,000
before that as well

1104
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,540
In those latter days

1105
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,720
On the giant continent of Zothique

1106
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,600
comprised of what's left of the

1107
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,200
continent of Pangea

1108
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,600
And don't forget Rodinia

1109
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:25,640
was even prior to that

1110
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:29,140
an even more ancient, archaic

1111
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,420
supercontinent

1112
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,480
Talking about the far future

1113
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,700
but as far back as you go

1114
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,880
Yes, of course

1115
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,940
Until the continents themselves

1116
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:39,940
were just bubbling masses

1117
00:44:39,940 --> 00:44:41,440
floating on a magnum ocean

1118
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,320
Like a scum

1119
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,320
Like a scummy surface pond scum

1120
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:47,200
floating around

1121
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,680
Moving around on a current

1122
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:50,760
and colliding back

1123
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,500
and gathering

1124
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:51,500


1125
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,680
and gathering back into a

1126
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:53,560
bobbing around

1127
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,960
into a mass again

1128
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,460
and then splitting up again

1129
00:44:56,460 --> 00:44:59,420
More scum surfacing

1130
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:01,620
Then these giant rock groups

1131
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,840
surrounded the land masses

1132
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,120
Fraud scares

1133
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:09,260
and only the strongest scum

1134
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:09,820
would survive

1135
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:11,100
Well, of course

1136
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:12,980
That's Darwinian, my boy

1137
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:14,180
I think some of the face genes

1138
00:45:14,180 --> 00:45:17,360
of Neanderthals

1139
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,400
manage to express themselves

1140
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:22,600
and some modern humans as well

1141
00:45:22,600 --> 00:45:25,500
Who have a Neanderthal-like face

1142
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:26,200
You know

1143
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,560
They have little place cards too

1144
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,980
You know, you meet all these vegetarians

1145
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,780
and they say

1146
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:32,860
Oh, I just can't eat anything with a face

1147
00:45:32,860 --> 00:45:33,800
Really?

1148
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,760
It's because something resembles a human

1149
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,200
that you can't do it?

1150
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:39,760
That has eyes and a nose

1151
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,080
Where's your biophilia?

1152
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:43,080
Why don't you have love for the rest of creation?

1153
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,560
For everything to live

1154
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,800
something has to die

1155
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:47,920
and vegetarians

1156
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:50,380
are the most destructive thing the planet knows about

1157
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:52,220
since they depend on agriculture

1158
00:45:52,220 --> 00:45:55,100
which is destroying the biosphere

1159
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:55,880
Yeah

1160
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:58,840
And if they were hunter-gatherers

1161
00:45:58,840 --> 00:45:59,620
that ate meat

1162
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:01,100
things would be a lot better

1163
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:03,060
but especially vegans are

1164
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:03,740
Of course, they would run

1165
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,780
The holy thing is

1166
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:05,780
that one came

1167
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:07,360
It's like the chicken and the egg

1168
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,740
It was because of the rise of agriculture

1169
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,640
that the population was able to grow

1170
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,440
as much as they had

1171
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:12,760
That's right

1172
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:17,360
It's a toxic blight spreading across the poor old planet

1173
00:46:17,940 --> 00:46:20,360
But for, you know, two years

1174
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,340
to grow a monoculture of whatever

1175
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:24,480
corn or wheat

1176
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:26,980
you kill everything else that's on the land

1177
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,060
and you kill the soil

1178
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,680
and the soil used to be six feet deep

1179
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:32,280
and now it's only a few inches deep

1180
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,500
and every time you irrigate it

1181
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,800
salt is left

1182
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,480
which is deadly and destroys the land

1183
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:41,200
That's why the ancient world is desertified

1184
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:45,080
and why nothing will grow in Greece and so forth

1185
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,840
So you see it's all supposed to be

1186
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,420
Vitamin grease, vitamin salt, vitamin sugar

1187
00:46:48,420 --> 00:46:51,860
It's supposed to be a vast primordial

1188
00:46:51,860 --> 00:46:53,240
People worry about that stuff too much

1189
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,100
dinosaur-filled forest

1190
00:46:54,100 --> 00:46:55,620
You know, here's one thing we know

1191
00:46:55,620 --> 00:46:56,820
We're here today

1192
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:58,780
They're out hunting with their bow and arrow

1193
00:46:58,780 --> 00:47:02,560
We've adapted to every natural and unnatural change

1194
00:47:02,560 --> 00:47:05,780
that's occurred from the beginning of our existence

1195
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,540
Do you have an iPhone?

1196
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,740
We're still here

1197
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,180
No, you don't get an iPhone

1198
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,640
Somehow or another we've managed to survive

1199
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:14,160
Not only that, we've managed to flourish

1200
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,360
You nap flints a lot in this world

1201
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:17,620
Things that flourish eventually

1202
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:19,340
Everybody knows how to nap flints

1203
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,100
With or away as well

1204
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,100
Apple iPhone!

1205
00:47:22,300 --> 00:47:23,620
There's always a circle there

1206
00:47:23,620 --> 00:47:24,880
No, there's no iPhone, I tell you

1207
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:27,660
If thy iPhone offends thee, pluck it out

1208
00:47:27,660 --> 00:47:33,120
I have a feeling that we're one of the most adaptable types of animals on the planet

1209
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,160
We can adapt to almost anything

1210
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,580
Yes, but even this show

1211
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,500
The planet can also adapt to us

1212
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,180
The show, as much as it wants to kill its listeners

1213
00:47:43,140 --> 00:47:47,540
still manages to provide the listeners with an adaptable life

1214
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,600
The big square thing, if I got the right movie

1215
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,760
With the four legs that stomps along the Mexican glue

1216
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,600
Is that Kronos?

1217
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,460
Oh yeah, that was Kronos

1218
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:59,440
They are inviolate

1219
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,200
Do you think that a human would have looked at a Neanderthal and said

1220
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,720
Oh, that thing is ugly

1221
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,360
Maybe they looked at a Neanderthal and thought they were hot

1222
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,000
They did think they were hot eventually

1223
00:48:09,540 --> 00:48:13,560
But at first they thought they were strange and should be opposed

1224
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:17,520
Like the history of all assimilation in the story of the Neanderthals

1225
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,720
The history of human groups that meet

1226
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:22,880
What at first is opposed eventually

1227
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:27,040
After a long enough period of time becomes a fashionable trait

1228
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:30,060
Which you would like to show

1229
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,380
But that's not to say this is a principle of justice

1230
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,960
If you look at Mexico

1231
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:46,440
They traditionally think anything of the Amerindian side of their genome

1232
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,940
Is to be suppressed

1233
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:49,660
It's Indio, it's bad

1234
00:48:49,660 --> 00:48:51,820
But what's Spanish is good

1235
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:55,400
And to be culturally sought after

1236
00:48:56,440 --> 00:49:00,440
But perhaps they're behind the times

1237
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,280
Because we've all got in our ancestry

1238
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,380
Thousands of years of essentially Indians

1239
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:09,460
Pre-techno humans

1240
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:13,440
Stretch into the far past

1241
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,180
And only recently have we had can openers

1242
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:17,240
And screwdrivers

1243
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:22,780
But before then we were all beating on drums and logs and things like that

1244
00:49:22,780 --> 00:49:24,780
I wish I had a log to beat on right now

1245
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,600
Thousands upon thousands of years

1246
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,000
Don't you wish that sometimes here on the show

1247
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:30,800
That they would just bring a log in and we could just beat on it?

1248
00:49:30,860 --> 00:49:35,400
Did you ever read Mark Twain's Captain Stormfield's Visit to Heaven?

1249
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,740
It's a sea captain who goes to heaven and reports everything there

1250
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:41,620
And when he first gets there he goes out

1251
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:43,800
Because he thinks he should have a

1252
00:49:43,800 --> 00:49:44,660
A liar?

1253
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:46,680
And a liar and a palm branch

1254
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:47,820
And go out and sit on a cloud

1255
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:49,800
And so they let you do whatever you want in heaven

1256
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,360
So he goes out and there's this huge mass of clouds

1257
00:49:52,360 --> 00:49:53,540
And everybody's playing the lyre

1258
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:55,200
But the music isn't that good

1259
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:55,560
It's really crummy

1260
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:59,020
For one thing, where are all those Indians coming from beating drums?

1261
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:03,220
Well they are the previous generations going back into

1262
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:04,520
Yeah, they didn't want to

1263
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,120
Dim theory

1264
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:07,800
And the horrible racket of the hollering

1265
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,040
And I got tired of playing my harp

1266
00:50:10,040 --> 00:50:10,500
No kidding

1267
00:50:11,180 --> 00:50:12,720
It makes a lot of sense

1268
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:14,240
He was such a sensible guy

1269
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:14,500
Yeah

1270
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,520
That's kind of what I thought

1271
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,820
All that fanning right there

1272
00:50:16,820 --> 00:50:18,240
So when he's on his way to the clouds

1273
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:20,120
He meets people coming back and they're saying

1274
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,560
Would you hold my harp a minute?

1275
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:22,540
I've just got to do something

1276
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:26,180
And so he's now getting piled up with this stuff that they're throwing away

1277
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,520
They don't want to get tired of it now

1278
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:27,900
Yes

1279
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:31,180
He's discarding these huge piles of harps

1280
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:31,840
Liars and harps

1281
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:34,760
And palm branches and halos and things that

1282
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:37,980
Somehow or another he needs to get that back to the first part

1283
00:50:37,980 --> 00:50:41,220
Where the guy can sell them big time when they come in the door, you know

1284
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:42,200
And recycle them

1285
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:44,320
At the beginning of the story

1286
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,240
He's racing through space

1287
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,100
He's dead and his soul is racing toward heaven

1288
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:50,920
And he gets in a race with a comet

1289
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:54,060
And he gets off course by just a few degrees

1290
00:50:54,060 --> 00:50:57,300
And so he gets to the huge glittering gates of heaven

1291
00:50:57,300 --> 00:50:59,940
But when he lands he finds it's an alien heaven

1292
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:02,740
And these grotesque creatures are coming in, you know

1293
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,500
Because he got off course

1294
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:06,580
He didn't get to human heaven

1295
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,060
Yeah, he can't get to human heaven

1296
00:51:12,060 --> 00:51:13,180
Because you know what?

1297
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:13,520
The...

1298
00:51:13,520 --> 00:51:13,940
The...

1299
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:14,400
The...

1300
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,880
The problem with human heaven is that the road is very, very narrow

1301
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,960
And the gate is very tiny and small

1302
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,020
And it's hard to get through

1303
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:28,860
But the road to perdition is wide

1304
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:29,660
Exactly

1305
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,540
And it's so wide

1306
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,040
It's like a superhighway

1307
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:33,500
It's easy

1308
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,460
It's with a 17 lane superhighway

1309
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,660
Although it's impossible to go back up it

1310
00:51:37,660 --> 00:51:39,040
That's super hard

1311
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,620
No, it's downhill

1312
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:41,560
Downhill

1313
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:42,200
It's so downhill

1314
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,520
Downhill is the easy way

1315
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:46,100
You can just lay on it and roll downhill into the...

1316
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:47,180
Anywhere in the cars

1317
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,260
It's so wide the cars won't even hit you

1318
00:51:49,260 --> 00:51:51,780
As they speed their way into the...

1319
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:54,940
The hellish hellhole of...

1320
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:58,900
More people have written about trips to hell than trips to heaven

1321
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:00,560
But there are some interesting...

1322
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,420
And it is a highway to hell, you know

1323
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:02,660
The...

1324
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:03,180
The...

1325
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:04,300
The bands...

1326
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:07,640
Some bands have taught us that years ago

1327
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:08,780
There's even a movie...

1328
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:10,000
ACDC, you know

1329
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,880
Some...

1330
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:14,180
Some sort of grade B movie where...

1331
00:52:14,180 --> 00:52:14,980
About...

1332
00:52:14,980 --> 00:52:16,920
Cop rides to hell, remember that one with...

1333
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:18,280
Well, that was Dana Andrews

1334
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:18,680
Dana Andrews

1335
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,300
But there's a movie, I think it was made in the 80s

1336
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:24,880
Where they are in the supernatural highway in the afterworld

1337
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,540
And the evil cop is coming after you, you know

1338
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:31,180
He's this horrible death cop and...

1339
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:34,820
And they go through the desert and so on

1340
00:52:34,820 --> 00:52:35,800
But it's all the afterlife

1341
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:37,500
Did you ever see that one?

1342
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:39,420
I really don't know the name of it

1343
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,780
But it might be Highway to Hell

1344
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:45,940
Dr. Howell, this is going to be a question for tonight's show

1345
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:48,640
Can you tell me the quickest way to hell?

1346
00:52:50,580 --> 00:52:51,820
Faculus descensus...

1347
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:55,020
What is the quickest way to hell, Dr. Howell?

1348
00:52:55,620 --> 00:52:56,780
Do nothing

1349
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:59,880
And you go there on your own

1350
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:01,800
What about sex, drugs and rock and roll?

1351
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:04,800
Oh, they are irrelevant distractions

1352
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:08,880
Don't they help speed the trip to hell?

1353
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,860
Well, maybe for some reason...

1354
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:12,760
If you just sit there and do nothing...

1355
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:14,160
For others, they provide...

1356
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,220
That's going to take longer...

1357
00:53:15,220 --> 00:53:16,500
Welcome refreshment...

1358
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:17,980
Don't you need something to keep you busy?

1359
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,020
...hugger mugger, we call life

1360
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:24,060
On your way to hell, don't you want to keep busy and do something fun, though?

1361
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,000
What do you want, sex, drugs and rock and roll?

1362
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:29,080
If you're on your way to hell, you're not interested in having fun

1363
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:32,700
No, fun is not for that side of the magic...

1364
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:34,580
You think fun is on your way to heaven?

1365
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:37,280
Uh, fun is...

1366
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:38,220
Where do you find it?

1367
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:38,700
Yes, the fun...

1368
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,520
Fun is just a concept, right?

1369
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,560
Fun is my Chinese neighbor's middle name

1370
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:47,720
They're going to outlaw everything eventually

1371
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,860
Here's an obit for Stan Freeburg, I guess he just died

1372
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:51,920
Oh, no...

1373
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,400
Man, all those people will have to stop yelling now at concerts

1374
00:53:55,740 --> 00:53:56,220
Freeburg!

1375
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:03,040
He was known for his comic genius in parodying cultural touchstones of the 50s and 60s

1376
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,060
How old was Stan Freebug, by the way?

1377
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:07,080
Uh, he was 88

1378
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:08,680
Hmm, I don't know

1379
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:08,680


1380
00:54:08,680 --> 00:54:11,820
I'm gonna go to live in a state where you can still have a fire

1381
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:13,060
Wow, old Stan Freeburg picture, that's cool

1382
00:54:13,060 --> 00:54:14,140
What weird looking hair he's got

1383
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:18,020
I just remember he was very, yeah, very young, Stan Freeburg on Hollywood Palace

1384
00:54:18,020 --> 00:54:22,860
Yeah, when he was back in the Mad Men type days, you know, he was one of those slick 60s guys

1385
00:54:22,860 --> 00:54:24,600
Well, Mort saw that whole era of...

1386
00:54:24,600 --> 00:54:28,020
Yeah, but now he's, in this picture, he's...

1387
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:29,960
Yeah, Stan Freeburg, he was a genius, definitely

1388
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:34,840
He was a GDQQ bach, an influential master of the lampoon

1389
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:38,660
Philo said he was gonna go as soon as he heard that other famous guy's name

1390
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:39,980
So he went, he said, I'm gonna go too

1391
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:51,060
He channeled his off-the-wall sensibility into groundbreaking radio shows, comedy albums, and hundreds of humorous television commercials for products such as chow mein and prunes

1392
00:54:52,500 --> 00:54:56,780
Died of natural causes Tuesday at UCLA Medical Center in San Diego

1393
00:54:56,780 --> 00:54:58,080
Is that like natural flavoring?

1394
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:03,640
You know, he started out doing voice work for Warner Brothers cartoons

1395
00:55:04,660 --> 00:55:05,080
Freeburg did?

1396
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:05,480
Yeah

1397
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,000
What year?

1398
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:09,100
He had Junior Bear and Goofy Gophers

1399
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:13,260
Well, I heard his records, I didn't know he was responsible

1400
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,680
He was also, you know, did bit parts on the Jack Benny show

1401
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,580
Oh yes, yes

1402
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:20,860
That's probably why I saw him as a kid

1403
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:21,760
Yeah, because...

1404
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:24,220
My grandmother watched, I loved watching Jack Benny

1405
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:28,360
But did you have the comedy albums like A Child's Garden of Freeburg and so on?

1406
00:55:28,560 --> 00:55:35,980
Bob Plampet worked with Freeburg to develop Time for Beanie, the puppet, the original puppet show that inspired him

1407
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:36,200
Yeah, yeah

1408
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,080
And then he started being Cecil

1409
00:55:37,080 --> 00:55:37,720
Yeah

1410
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:43,660
Yeah, Clampet never gave up trying to do something new, some new variation on...

1411
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:47,000
Because it was about Clampet Cartoon

1412
00:55:47,000 --> 00:55:49,200
About Clampet Cartoon

1413
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:53,700
So come on kids, let's slip your lips high or so

1414
00:55:53,700 --> 00:56:02,640
He was the voice of the syndicated radio program, Quinn Radio Was, from 1995 until October 6, 2006

1415
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:04,160
When?

1416
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:17,520
In the 1950s, a 1953 spoof of Jack Webb's Dragnet called St. George and the Dragonnet captured the cop show's famously staccato monotone delivery and was widely considered his finest work as a mimic and parodist

1417
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:22,600
I do remember that, I would cut it up with... I, me, me

1418
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:24,220
You have heard that one?

1419
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:34,140
Yeah, I would record it off the speaker with a microphone and cut it up with my mom's sewing scissors and tape and make show with all kinds of stuff like that

1420
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:35,200
Back when I was a teen

1421
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:41,800
The legend you are about to hear is true, only the needle should be changed to protect the record

1422
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,540
It is funny

1423
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:46,140
Yeah

1424
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:50,660
And then the people loved it, the people still for years called at concerts Free Bird

1425
00:56:51,220 --> 00:56:53,600
You'd hear his name, you'd only know the teenager

1426
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,020
Free Bird

1427
00:56:55,020 --> 00:57:00,360
This is the countryside, my name is St. George, I'm a knight

1428
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:01,760
Saturday, July 10th

1429
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:02,840
Oh right, that was my favorite

1430
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,120
8.05 a.m.

1431
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,360
It was my favorite

1432
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:09,380
I was working out of the castle on the night watch when the call came in from the chief

1433
00:57:09,380 --> 00:57:12,460
A dragon had been devouring maidens, homicide

1434
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,800
You did it very dry

1435
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,540
My job, slay him

1436
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,080
Take Trevor

1437
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:18,760
What?

1438
00:57:34,140 --> 00:58:04,140


1439
00:58:04,140 --> 00:58:08,320
Starved and scared, with voices in their underwear

1440
00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:11,200
There's a thing about Bob

1441
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:14,640
There's a thing about Bob

1442
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:17,760
There's a thing about Bob

1443
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:21,060
There's a thing about Bob

1444
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:24,120
There's a thing about Bob

1445
00:58:24,120 --> 00:58:27,120
Bob has a big new spring of confidence

1446
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,920
A generous swelling of pride

1447
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,780
And one thing every man deserves

1448
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:35,780
A little well-earned respect from the neighborhood

1449
00:58:37,460 --> 00:58:40,880
It puts a glimmer into his eyes

1450
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,100
It puts a spring into his stomach

1451
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:47,240
It has given him a rise

1452
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:49,640

Hey Bob!

1460
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:08,560
Can you get him a new haircut?

1461
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:09,160
No

1462
00:59:09,920 --> 00:59:11,480

Hey Bob!

1464

It's your sweet

Bob is living life

1470
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:27,700
Bob here's been having a bit too much sex

1471
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:28,160
Bob

1472
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:37,640

1473
00:59:44,060 --> 00:59:45,740
There's a woman here

00:59:48,560 --> 00:59:48,560


1480
00:59:50,260 --> 00:59:51,100
Jobless

1481
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:51,100

music

1484
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:56,120
Everything is done

1485
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:56,780
with the beginning

1486
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:56,780


1487
00:59:56,780 --> 00:59:56,780

All is played

1489
00:59:56,940 --> 00:59:57,760
with the help of balls

1490
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,820
but my attitude is

1491
00:59:58,820 --> 00:59:59,080
the esse Hernandez
