They should all drown in lakes of blood.
Now they will know why they are afraid of the dark.
Now they will learn why they fear the night.
Our...

Friends! I wanna hear a praise for the hog!
I wanna hear a praise for the damn hog!
I wanna hear a damn praise for the god hog!
Praise God! Praise God! Praise God!
What are you?
What are you?
Stop it!
Come on!
My research!
Research!
You call fooling around with superstitions and voodoo rights research?
Well, it's a cult. We have to do this.
But the work I'm doing is very important.
Look, they're over the bridge now. They're on the other side of the...
Get down!
Oh, darn.
Doctor!
Well, that couldn't be avoided.
He just wiggled around and...
Oh, I see.
All right.
That'll work. That'll work. We'll just use that scene then.
...to alarm them. Tie him down securely.
Doctor!
Here he is.
Your friend!
Quickly!
Oh!
I guess when the doctor begins to lose faith when he's...
I think he's leaning on his computer. I mean, his keyboard.
Forever.
Forever?
I'd like to try it.
That's a heck of a moment, huh?
You know, Doc...
He says he wants to listen to the show forever?
I made an amazing scientific discovery in this laboratory of yours.
Looks like he's coming around.
All right. All right.
It's Ivan Stang. We're resuscitating Ivan Stang now.
There's only one way to go.
He's over.
He's stabbing...
I just stabbed a scalpel into his...
That's just a stupid superstition.
No, no, no. You're a real guy. Come on.
Yes, you are right.
Come on. Come on. Come on, Ivan. You can do it.
Come on. Come on. Come on.
There's a queen of UFOs. She's outside trying to get in the studio.
Come on, Ivan. Come on.
Come on. Come on.
We're attaching the... Okay.
There we go.
I thought you were having a flashback or a daydream.
You're having a deja vu or something.
Your thumb is all the way in your eye.
Look at him. He's so pensive.
It's so a flashback.
Andrew the Impale could do that.
Oh, man.
Thumb all the way up into the sinus cavities.
Don't worry about me.
He's tugging on his goatee now.
And he just pulled off the old Aurora.
I had a piece of spinach up there in my sinus.
I had to get it out.
So disgusting.
He's not kidding.
I had to wipe off the inside of his glasses.
Now the feces are building up.
I'm not...
This is...
I'm not sure what the spinach that is.
...the concepts we express here.
And I think most of the people in these short, short live tape programs we present aboard
Sibian Broadcasting Neck...
Sib...

Neckworks.
I have to remember to say that right.
The Sibian Neckwork is proud to present...

But let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this
brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
This is Reverend Ivan Stagg and I'm afraid that our time has already run out, because,
friends, a minute of slack is aaaall of slack.
So, I'll see you next time.
the conspiracy is going to give you.
That's right.
In this world, you'll get a minute of slack
and almost 24 hours of false slack.
And how do you know the difference?
Because friends, the real slack is free,
even if it isn't always legal.
So it's sad that we only have one minute,
but it balances out in one great religious urge,
one great religious evacuation of the senses.
And I would recommend reading
Prescription 1714 and 3691.
And friends, we need blankets and contraceptives
for those boys and girls
in the home for slackless children.
Your contributions also keep those we hate
starving to death.
I command you to spill your gift seed pledge
of 100 pounds of dollar bills on my lap,
as this will buy so much for those poor children.
Bob Dobbs will bless you for planting this seed faith,
and now our announcer won't give you
the mailing address of the Church of the Subgenius.
Thank you, and let there be slack.
Reminds me of a, uh,
false,
real,
flying along here with us now,
early in the morning,
on a happy,
happy,
sort of,
new political wind.
I'm all there.
I'm all for it.
Yeah, we're all over it.
I'm, um,
at lockstep.
I'm right with you.
Yeah, the Homeland Security people will, uh,
be by in the morning.
And they'll check out your house and your life, and...
Can you...
I do not want to check out my house.
FM radio waves to me?
They have to check out everything.
Yeah, we use all radio waves.
But can you explain how they work?
How radio waves work?
Yes.
Yes.
We have the overman here tonight.
Tough question.
Yeah, Philo Drummond,
who in a moment after being, uh,
in the...
You can hear the conference in the background.
What do you think, you know,
is that...
We'll explain that.
How does radio work?
Dr. Drummond,
we have, uh,
a young lady who wanted to know about
how, uh,
radio waves work.
So do you have, like,
or do we have...
You've got headphones on?
Yeah, you can know.
Radio waves.
I do have headphones on.
Radio waves.
Okay, yeah.
Radio waves.
Well, they just...
I am the show.
They're these little things.
They sort of float out there.
They've got, like,
little tentacles on them
that kind of hang in space
but have, uh,
their own modified cilia
that are constantly flowing in the breeze.
And as the breeze passes by,
the cilia, uh,
sort of undulates.
They drive the organism,
the sound wave,
uh,
on its, uh,
journey to your ears.
Does that help?
It helps.
And this music always plays
when radio waves are...
You know,
even if you're listening
to a discussion show
about atomic waste,
this music would be playing
in the background.
You just can't hear it.
But music like this
is always controlling
your emotional reaction.
That's true.
Music like this, uh,
is hanging around
along with the radio waves.
Or music like this.

Radio waves have an affinity
for music like this.
They just kind of hang together
in a symbiotic relationship.
There were a few producers
who were involved
with the kind of, uh,
underworld.
But then,
if you do it,
if you accept, uh,
the money from them,
you must be ready
for the guns as well.
Well, you accept it, uh,
you accept it for what it is.
It could be money,
it could be guns,
or it could be butter.
You know, depending on your,
your state.
And, uh,

the state that you're in.
So, if you...
You know, I want to get back
to some of the magic
about Pangea and, uh,
Lemuria and Mondana.
Oh, yeah, back in the old days.
The old, when we were
just hanging out.
The old ways.
Because I've seen, uh,
video from that time.
Yeah, we were like
just a pack of amoebas,
you know, like running wild.
Hanging around.
It's like,
let's extend our protoplasm
over into that area
for a while.
Wild zygotes.
You know, the next thing
we know, there was like,
I had a twin there.
Looked just like me.
And, you know,
like, what's going on here?
So, we started hanging
around together for a while.
Next thing we knew,
we were like a
symbiotic organism
of individual cells
that was all together
with their own, uh,
their own collective purpose.
Slathering and slithering
until one day
we had a flagella.
And we stuck the flagella out
and started manipulating
our environment.
We decided, you know,
maybe we should,
maybe we should think about it.
We should leave this, you know,
crawling out into that
other atmosphere.
You know, we should leave this
sweaty, liquid environment
and move beyond it
and move over into that dry area.
Of course, we'd need some legs.
We need to, we need to

Looks like a ghost town.
No, it does look like a ghost town.
It's too new.
So, we did.
And there we are.
And so, that's how it happened.
Okay.
Any, any more, uh,
to help you with any other questions?
Well, there's a bad ball,
but there's a good ball.
There's a real ball,
but there's a pseudo ball.
You better watch out.
Better watch out.
Better watch out.
All the roads you'll know.
Attention, all biotech personnel.
This is a biohazard alert.
Until further notice,
containment protocols are in effect.
Bob!
Bob!
Bobby!
Dana, what's going on?
Sheriff Morse, they locked the doors.
Bob's inside.
Why lock the doors?
I don't know.
Who else is in there?
Just about everybody, I guess.
I'm sorry.
Bob!
Bob!
I found the problem,
and there is no biohazard.
It was a false alarm.
You can unlock the doors
and let everyone go home.
This is a non-biotech problem.










This is a non-event event.
And do you know what happened?
Again.
And do you know what happened?
Again, that big, bad, ferocious
world of the future!
Follow me!
All the signs point to serious health damage.
There are no winners in a nuclear war.
The minute you have another war,
there's not going to be any world left,
I don't think.
Because we're going to blow one another's faces.
Because in this day and time,
we don't know what we're going to come to.
There's not going to be anything left for the kids.
I mean, there's not going to be a world left.
And we're all going to end up
digging our own holes.
And as soon as we dig them,
they're going to fall in on us.
I don't think anybody would know what to do.
Even possibly the president.
The only true religion is guns!
I would listen to television and watch it.
And I would confess,
and Cinderella lives.
Happily ever after?
Yes.
How did you know?
Because good little girls like Cinderella
always live happily ever after.
I like to be in America.
Okay by me in America.
Everything free in America.
For us most, be in America.
Okay, America.
Okay, world.
You are violent.
You are pushing all this murder on us.
So here it comes right back at you.
And we'll use murder to sell deodorant.
So that you'll just get bored with murder.
Right?
Say that last week.
I can smell those...
Am I hallucinating the echo?
I can smell those hellish teeth.
No, you did.
And it's true.
Those hellish teeth are ready to snap around all our orifices
and gobble us up and spit us out.
The end is nigh or near.
Whichever, you know, you choose.
You know, I had been thinking,
oh, well, I'm up here in Ohio.
I'm safe.
Everything's cool here.
They're not warlike.
Ohio is...
It was an Ohio National Guard guy
that zapped those Canadians.
Yeah, boy, did I have another thing coming.
Who was it?
That figures.
It was probably a Texas guy, really.
Yee-haw!
Probably a Cleveland State student.
Yeah, probably a Cleveland State guy.
I could get a medal for this.
And then everybody would like me in Cleveland.
Everybody in Cleveland hates you now,
especially those people from Windsor, you know,
they hate you a lot.
And they're starting to reexamine their prosthetic devices,
or I mean their prostology.
The Canadians are starting to reexamine,
hey, any time they say get a gun and we jump in there,
why don't we do something different, et cetera?
Well...
No.
War is heck.
Yes, that's right.
War is heck.
And, uh...
Here, here's a guy who knows General Katahdin.
Yeah.
You are correct.
The Mexicans, the Canadians,
their days of thinking,
finger-banging Mary Jane Rottenkrotch
through her pretty pink panties
are over!
Over!
Join the Lake County Coast Watchers'
guard against Canadian attack.
Yeah, we got us a militia watch there.
We better watch it tonight.
The Canadians are about to...
This is my church.
There are many others like it,
but this one is mine.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
The line is a never-locked-in embrace.
You won't get it till it's in your face.
Oh, get me out of deep red.
Go back.
Die!
In the night!
In the night!
That's where I wanna be.
Die!
Yeah!
No, die!
Die!
A useful member of society.
Die!
In the...
I just need a little love that only
makes me feel good.








money
Yeah
I can't
shake it off of my back
God damn
thank you
It's too tight
It's too tight

I love them all
Set aside
I don't want to die




And I've got her
Her son
I love
I thought the bomb
Yeah
Yeah you come down here
and mess with us
You're gonna burn
for sure
Yeah that's what
they used to say
Why don't we just
you know I mean
Bush said
if you're not with us
you're against us
and he is proving it
even if you're with us
you're
we're gonna
we're gonna be
uh
Yeah even if you're with us
we're against you
We've got a gun
at your back
at all times.
That's a new strategy.
Even if you're with us,
we're against you.
Yeah.
And that goes for American citizens, too.
They're killing us,
and they have guns pointed at us all the time.
That's been going on for a long time.
It's not political megalomania.
You've got to learn how to live.
It's the 21st century, baby.
I'm not freaking out.
I'm okay with it.
I'm not advocating any kind of argument
or in any way.
Any seditious or treasonous
or even complaining.
I wouldn't gripe about the government.
We're proud to be owned in a free country.
We accept the yoke.
The security is...
The lack of security
was due to too much freedom
and abuse of the freedoms
we, our forefathers, fought for.
The yoke is soft and warm.
We must earn back
the rights of freedom of speech
and gun ownership and things like that.
Those are old-fashioned things.
We have to prove we're responsible enough.
Every child is a village,
and the government is your friend.
That 25-pound pack is your yoke.
That gun is your yoke,
and you are the egg,
and you're ready to get pumped.
Look at them little canucks down there.
This is your brain on a frying pan.
The Rainmaker
came to town
and the people got what they wanted.
The Rainmaker
came to town
and everybody got what they need.
Hey, hey, hey!
Well, the people wanted power
and reputation galore.
So they became a bunch of bullies
in the assorted sizes war.
And they sailed around the global block
looking for some heads to knock.
And most of them came home heroes,
heroes in a box.
And the Rainmaker came to town
and the people got what they wanted.
The Rainmaker came to town
and everybody got what they need.
The Rain came falling down
cats and dogs and buckets.
And the Rainmaker sailed away
on a flood of relief.
Hey, hey, hey!
Well, the people wanted beauty
and prettiness and all.
So they stretched and they dressed
and they made up
and put mirrors on every wall.
Till they all went blind from ice cream
from the thing they wanted most.
Now everybody's so isolated.
A good-looking bunch of ghosts.
And the Rainmaker came
to town
and the people got what they wanted.
The Rainmaker came to town
and everybody got what they need.
The Rain came falling down
cats and dogs and buckets.
And the Rainmaker sailed away
on a flood of relief.
Hey, hey, hey!
Well, the women just wanted their food to keep.
Instant potatoes and rubber meat.
The kids just wanted to watch TV.
Now the girls can't spell
and the boys can't read.
The men just wanted a steady job.
Now they got to pay the union mob.
And everybody wanted to be free.
Laws and rules should keep it that way.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey, hey, hey!
Well, everybody wants to be happy.
Everybody wants to be warm.
And be loved and liked and wanted.
And have some kind of home.
But getting it is work.
And keeping it is tough.
But destroying it's the easiest.
And the rainmaker came to town.
And the people got what they wanted.
The Rainmaker came to town.
And everybody got what they need.
The Rain came falling down.
Cats and dogs and buckets.
And the Rainmaker sailed away
on a flood of relief.
Hey, hey, hey!


A flood of relief.
Now sail away.
Sail away.
And the Rainmaker came to town.
What is anybody going to do about any of it?
Well, the first thing we'd like you to do here at Camp Slaughter is put your hands on your feet.
Put your hands behind your back for the manacles and chains.
How long before we start seeing the images of Canadians protesting in the streets and burning effigies of George Bush?
Well, they're already burning effigies of George Bush.
Well, how long before we see them is the question.
There's somebody seeing them right now, I'm sure.
Seeing the Canadians? They do have invisibility powers, which is one of the reasons we had to slaughter them.
The jump had to be ours. We had to get the tech first.
So if they're invisible, they could be in this room right now.
They could be outside waiting for us with their Mountie hats.
Oh, man.
Oh, man.
Oh, man. The stars.
Where's my goat?
Ah, you in the tub.
Where am I?
Is this Afghanistan?
Oh, no, man. No.
Ah, is it Iran?
No, man. This is the Marines.
Marines? Move over.
Oh, oh, oh.
I really like the way you wear your towel on your head.
Put your hands on me. I live here, man. Leave me alone.
Hey, Dad, I quit the band again.
Got any lutes?
No, just paint the house, okay?
Oh, come on.
Dear animals!
Oh, come on.
Okay.
Everybody out of the hot tub. There's gonna be a nuclear war.
Oh, did he say it was too hot in the hot tub, man?
Oh, I think he said everybody out of the icebox.
Oh.
Is this beer?
Oh, no. That's seaweed shampoo, man.
I don't believe this. Did you say nuclear war?
You got it.
We'll be boiled like sausages with ice.
Hey, look. There's no time left. We're gonna have to do it the Navy way.
Wrap the towels around your head so you won't be blinded by the blast.
Oh, that's hot. I'm gonna be nuked to death. That's what I'm gonna do.
Then all I've got on is Pam Jergensen's extra towel.
Hey, don't you dipsticks get it? They're gonna take us in a ball. I mean, this is Ground Zero, heroes.
Hey, don't any of you duds want to escape?
Escape? Oh, man. If this isn't escape, what is?
Really?
For sure.
Whatever.
The Fire Sign Theater, dear friends, from Fighting Couch.
That's like a ten-year-old album, believe it or not.
Before that, lots of Einstein's Secret Orchestra ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB in Cleveland with Professor Chaz and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
And yours truly, Princess Wee.
And we also heard lots of bits and pieces from Media Barrage Number Five, the old subgenius type.
Being remixed in progress.
And bits and pieces of puzzling evidence and Dr. Philodruman from KPFA in Berkeley, the subgenius show that's been on for 18 million years.
And there's more coming up, dear friends.
Including Hale Pope Huey, Dr. LeCume, Dr. Lémure and Leibach.
And Glass Madness and m-m-m-more.
Einstein's Secret Orchestra at Crazy.
crazy stuff from that wonderful news group called alt.binaries.slack.
Thank you.
If you would like to become a member of the Canadian Armed Forces
and serve your queen, whoever she might be, and your country poundly,
please step through this magnetic door.
Pew, pew, pew.
There's the bohunks.
There's the nornax.
There's the hate-boing-boing-dingers.
There's the hate-date-boing-boing-dingers.
Go on back to your frozen wasteland and leave the fight to us, you pussies.
You know, if they were serious about the war on terrorism,
wouldn't they have sent more troops in there immediately?
Yeah, well, that's true of everybody.
Who's?
Well, I mean, who's been in there getting their butts shot up?
The Northern Alliance.
I mean, the Americans.
Good afternoon.
On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes
against our staunch friend, Canada,
more than 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and across the...
Codini is a mystic seer.
Mystic Codini.
Codini.
Dr. Codini.
All hail Dr. Codini.
For he is a...
Mystic seer of future events.
Listen to this thing he made...
Good afternoon.
...two months ago.
On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes
against our staunch friend, Great Britain,
Australia, Germany, and France, Canada,
more than 40 countries in the Middle East.
He just got the order wrong, that's all.
They killed Flipper.
Great Britain's next.
Australia.
They killed that little white dog with the brown spot on his eye.
And then they killed everybody in the whole town.
Well, the people in Canada are queen worshippers, too, aren't they?
Aren't they idolaters?
Yeah.
They're a bunch of monogamous quips.
They worship the mother instead of the son of...
The king of...
The son of God.
Yeah, man.
Think of it that way.
And you spend a long time thinking over the...
See what happens to your eyeball.
And their women are real loose, too.
And they don't have...
That's why they deserve it.
They have loose women morals.
Yeah, their limbs are all like...
Their women are morally loose.
Like when they're off at their lives.
Yeah.
Their limbs go...
Don't they have some kind of prime ministers or parliaments or something like...
And he talks much like this.
The prime minister of Canada.
I am deeply regretful of the incidents which happened today.
And their minorities speak French.
What kind of a minority speaks French?
I know.
That doesn't make any sense.
An Asian minority.
If you're speaking French, you're supposed to be in the majority over somebody else.
If you're any kind of a real Frenchman.
Well, is there?
I mean, give...
You're not supposed to be playing hockey.
You're not supposed to...
But they're not Frenchmen, right?
They're Canadians.
So...
So they don't say...
We're all targets now, man.
We're all targets now.
Everybody.
I'd be careful next time I went on the RTA, man.
I'd be careful.
Well, this signal skips right over the lake.
The Canadians can hear us.
We're targets of them.
Borders are shut down tonight.
In...
Really?
Yeah.
In memory of George Bush.
Oh, George is doing a lockdown now.
We're on the...
Lockdown of Canadians?
Canadian border?
Yeah.
Didn't they close the internet, too?
And...
But Bush declared that MP3 pirates were terrorists.
Yeah.
I mean, you know, people who download stuff from those Napster-like things.
Yeah, Grokster.
Yeah, that's terrorism now.
They have synthesized some of these psychotic genes in his head now.
Dope smokers.
Oh, that was...
Definitely terrorists.
And, you know, I see those commercials.
David Lockdown for weeks now.
Buy American.
Yeah, my God, if you're going to smoke dope, buy that great Humboldt County stuff.
The object in constructing me was to prevent war.
This object is a tank.
I will not permit war.
It is wasteful and pointless.
I've been helpless so long.
My eyes are confused.
My brain all full of junk.
I don't know what I should do.
Maybe go up on a mountain and become a monk.
I'm a screaming...
Bob Dallas!
Won't you help me?
Bob Dallas!
See me through!
Bob Dallas!
Can't you see my problems?
Bob Dallas!
What am I gonna do?
I searched on the mountains.
I searched on the beaches.
I searched on the deserts.
I searched in the woods.
I searched in the rocks.
I searched on the treetops.
Hoping, hoping that I could find...
Bob Dallas!
Won't you help me?
Bob Dallas!
See me through!
Bob Dallas!
Can't make it.
Bob Dallas!
Without help from you.
I need help.
Bob Dallas!
I need help.
Bob Dallas!
I need help.
Help me.
Bob Dallas!
My friend.


I need the help.
Ah!



I need help.
Bob Dallas!
Bo hamb!
Bob dollars!
Bob gal!




Bobpping in area inана Riverацию.
Man, I'm glad you guys are explaining all this because, you know, I'm from Texas and we don't...
Yeah, be careful of people you drink.
We don't cotton to no Canadians.
We never saw anybody from Canada.
So if you see someone drinking a Molson's or a Moosehead at a bar, feel free to execute them military style.
Or if you see some fat guy with a .50, you've got to go right there.
You've got to do them right on the spot.
But are the Canadians our enemies?
Everybody's our enemy.
If you're with us, we're against you.
They're confused, Dave.
They don't know what they're doing.
They don't see the true light or even the purple one there on the left.
They're just confused about everything and they need to be shown.
My friend's friends is my enemy.
They be shown the yoke.
Step in, please.
Mr. Kenock, you're going to like this yoke.
It's got a freeze compartment right here and there's little pucks hanging from it.
Can't we just enslave the Canadians?
People of Canada, this is a message from the United States.
The United States of America, prepare to take on the shackles of slavery.
We will march through your country.
We will destroy your armies.
Your streets will run red with your blood.
We shall rape your women and your caribou.
Not to mention your moose.
And that will be the fun part.
And your moose.
And actually, another thing.
Your beer is our beer.
Each individual Canadian family has...
Dudley B. Wright cannot save you.
Abandon your work.
The worship of the hawk gods of the sky.
Prepare as we shall melt your cities of ice.
And so...
Legium's voice will be the only voice they can hear over the lake.
And we'll put all kinds of reverb on it.
Yeah, at that moment, at that very moment, the weather was just perfect and the signal skipped over the clouds.
The most paranoid guy with his hand on the button of their one little nuclear-tipped warhead.
Their secret one.
Canada, Asia, nuclear.
I'll have you know that Canada is a nuclear-free zone.
I kind of take a little regress to that remark.
Oh, yeah, everybody's got a nuclear-free zone, right?
Sure, everybody's got a nuke in their pocket.
Everybody's got one in the basement.
I had to have my air conditioner recharged and they used the nuclear-free zone on that.
Oh, they used nuclear energy to clean your air conditioner?
No, that's nuclear energy.
That's different.
Nuclear.
Oh, nuclear.
Yeah, there's nuclear and nuclear.
Well, what is nuclear?
Those are two different things.
What is nuclear?
Well, one is really dangerous and poisons everything for 90,000 years.
And the other one is just, it's not that bad.
The other one makes your popcorn.
Any friend in need is an enemy, indeed.
It's the sign that your world is coming apart.
You're sitting in front of your table having your same old lackluster sandwich.
And who flies in through the window?
The world is ending, that's who.
And you're sitting on a stump by yourself.
Those Canadian soldiers.
Beware of the Canadian soldiers.
It's their season.
One tin soldier rides away.
They're well-armed, man.
They got all this stuff, man.
They got the funny hats.
They're well-armed, man.
Don't mess with them.
We just ran about five minutes.
We're really sorry, Canada.
Coming in from Windsor, Detroit.
This is a sick humor show.
You shouldn't take anything we say.
Seriously, this is all just...
Please don't.
Yeah, we don't...
Because there are people in London.
I've gotten letters and emails from people in London, Ontario,
that they do get this station.
We see it.
And we are sorry.
It was a Canadian that went into Janine today.
You know how those guys are.
There are good Canadians.
There are some good Canadians.
There's a few.
Mostly up in Toronto.
They must be judged individually on their merits,
and they must stand trial.
Stanley Kuhn-Hartner.
They're good Canadians.
They really should.
He's the guy that puts the hour of slack on the internet.
Well, they probably should nuke Vancouver.
God bless America.
My home, sweet home.
God bless America.
My home, sweet home.
My home, sweet home.
My home, sweet home.




We're climbing to the top of that mountain, boys.
Just because it's there.
And we're jumping off the edge of the Western world.
Just because we've been there.
And we're digging a hole deep in the ground.
Oil goes to Chinatown.
And the party's starting when the sun goes down.
On the other side...
Out of the world
The people in England
Are standing in line
Killing up to see the queen
Between the royal weddings
And the kids on the door
The sun sets comfortably
And back in the States
It's we three kings
Of greed, guns, and gasoline
And a racial chase
Through Georgia streets
On the other side of the world
So around and around
And around we go
We are here
That's the law I know
We might as well like it
That's the gospel, oh
The other side of the world
Well, there's young people
Falling in love
There's young people
Falling in love
There's young people
Falling in love
Falling in love
There's young people
Falling in love
Everywhere I go
Old hides behind
Those angry eyes
Denim collars against the cold
I got a letter today
From Tokyo
A little Japanese girl
That I'll never know
She's eating pizza
And singing
Let my people go
On the other side of the world
Oh, yeah
So around and around
And around we go
We are here
That's the law I know
We might as well like it
That's the gospel, oh
The other side of the world
Yeah, yeah
Well, around and around
And around we go
We are here
That's the gospel, oh
We might as well like it
That's the gospel, oh
The other side of the world
The other side of the world
Let's get out of here
Where is the present time

Let's go
See you in the netherworld
You'll see

You see
You see
You see
Your stupid minds
Stupid
Stupid
They're stupid
Stupid humans
Nothing is more delicate or complex
Than the human brain
Sorry
It didn't mean anything to me
I will remove the skull and reveal to you what happened.
Well, it's just a frozen dead, so you can do that.
And I can study the brains.
You are going to be all right, Doctor.
No!
Doctor, we'll put your brain back in. You'll be fine.
Everything is confusing.
I tell you I know.
I know!
Well, it was that I know dot com or something.
I know, I know. What you know you never know.
That's right.
I've got to get back to work.
We're going back to work now.
If I don't see you again, this is like seeing a prosthesis.
Good luck to you, too. Take the Popeye spinach with you.
You.
I'll take C.
Bitch!
What you gonna do?
I'm gonna make you a brother!
You want too much?
You want your neck wiped?
I'm a damn good one!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
Bitch!
You don't cut!
You don't clean!
Bitch, you're in the world!
I'm pregnant!
So am I!
I'm pregnant, okay?
I don't care!
I don't care!
I've been with this man for a year and a half.
I don't care!
I've known him for a year and a half.
I don't care!
I don't see no ring on your finger!
I don't see no ring on your finger!
It don't make no difference!
It don't make no difference!
I don't see no ring on your finger!
He don't walk over there!
You take hoes to a hotel where you take hoes!
I found an old national lampoon with a great story in it called Amish in Space.
Oh, that dress.
It was a weird concept.
Oh, a good perp seminar.
I mean, the first people to make it here were a bunch of religious, you know...
Folk?
Amish in space.
So the Yoders landed here some five billion years ago.
The first people that came here got wiped out because they were a bunch of drunks and stuff.
Married the Lizards.
But the second group, the ones that did make it, were the Puritans.
And they were the religious fanatics.
And they were the Sunshine Boopers.
The Haters of Hats.
But using a ship made of wood was within the...
They didn't use wood in their religion, right?
But would making an airtight, heat-shielded spacecraft be within Amish tradition?
Or would you have to hire the English to do everything?
Sheesh, that tiny little brain of yours.
Why not?
Or trade out your daughters with some English scientists.
Yeah, they're making big strides. They use some technology.
Who, the Amish?
They use Mennonite drivers and they pimp their women as horse.
They make their sons grow drugs for the people amongst them.
The Yankee crew who cannot make drugs ourself.
And they get in car accidents when they're not supposed to drive.
That Amish crystal meth is about as good as it gets.
I do not believe in gossip and I will not put part in this conversation.
I shall always stop along the farm roads there when I'm heading to...
Buy a little butter?
A little cheese?
Some eggs?
Yeah, when I'm out in the country.
And some pure crystal meth, man.
Are thee feeling sleepy, pilgrim?
Nah, nah, no sleep, nah.
Yeah, yeah, no sleep in here.
No, I don't need to sleep.
Amphetamine lab.
No, no, no.
The cows have all been given pretty good milk since we keep feeding them that stuff and they're...
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
They chirp, you know, when they get to the ends of things.
They're not like us, you know, with their beards and their funny hats and those bitch forks.
And the bonnets and the blue jumper suits.
I met a comedian once called the Amish comic.
Hey.
Now there's some swinging music.
Ah, there you go.
I feel like I'm in Chi-Chi's.
I feel like I'm in my parents' living room.
With the gold hanging lamps.
Yes.
I fell asleep under the matador statue.
And of course there was a little weeping Jesus and one of them clowns with a blood tear coming out of his eye.
Jesus is always weeping.
Mary's always weeping.
What's he got to cry about?
He can come back from the dead.
I mean.
Why?
I believe it's because Jesus was taken to the weeping post before he shed his blood.
They stripped him naked to the waist.
And the man who carried the whip brought the whip down across his back.
This is what I remember hundreds of years before the manifestation of Christ when he said,
Who hath believed our report and to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?
For he was wounded for our transgressions.
He was bruised.
He was tortured.
Yes.
Yes.
They took Jesus.
They taxed him.
Oh.
They made him a work of 80 hour a week?
Yes.
Yes.
You think they let Jesus off easy?
Wait till you see what they're going to do to you my friend.
Oh.
You think Jesus got it hard?
When are they going to nail you up there with electrified nails.
They'll put you on a cross made out of old death.







and fish and you have to eat that or die. Oh, they're gonna, oh, I can feel it. Oh,
the pain, the pain of my religious spirit. Oh, I love, I love to be nailed and beaten
and flogged, oh yes, by the nuns and the altered boys. Oh, oh, bring them into me and I'll
just, they can tie me up. You think I'm, ah, they can't tie me up because I'll bust loose
my bonds. I'll preach, I'll preach pain and death and torment. I'll preach iniquity and
evil. Oh, they can't, they can't hold me down. They can talk about me all over Dallas County.
They can blacklist me from the film business. They can send me out into the streets to squint
my blood out, but hell, I'll keep preaching damnation. I'll preach,
I'll preach about the heaven that's gonna kill everybody. Oh, oh yes, I'm gonna.
You were on marijuana, spends the dreams, sleeping pills for a few years. But on LSD,
on LSD, you begin to die a little.
And that's the way you get this extraordinary sense of revelation.
We always have something very funny happens when we start that number.
These mean shoes, hope you guess my name. Oh yeah, what, what, what, what, what do I give you?
It's the nature of my game. Oh yeah.
The Mennonites are really what...
We're having a pirate radio tower raising.
Tower raising.
Yeah, a tower.
A ship raising.
A microwave tower raising.
That's right.
A nuclear death ray raising.
Simple folk, but their heads are in the right...
Oh, they're not letting anybody...
They're not letting anybody in on what they're really all about.
They got Nike sites out there.
They've got ICBMs built up.
They really do have silos.
The silos, believe me, those silos, they don't hold corn.
Now, Janet Reno was around.
She'd Branch David-y in their asses.
That's right.
She'd lay some Branch David-y on their ass.
Yeah, you can't do that.
They'd show them Mormon...
They got the deal.
See, the Mormon...
The Mennonites, they got the deal, though.
The government knows.
They got the nuke.
They can watch cable TV, too.
You bug us, we push the button.
That's as simple as that.
Don't set us on fire.
You go find your Dave...
Right.
Whatever.
Out in Texas, Waco, and you burn him alive, you're fine.
Go ahead.
He just got guns.
You come after us.
We're pushing the damn red button, buddy.
They leave them alone out in farmland, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York.
I only knew what they had to fear, these rural cults.
Actually, the Mennonites are really what...
They're the deterrent because the Canadians know about them.
Why?
They balance them.
The Canadians will never invade us because they know about the Mennonite silos.
Right.
Yeah.
That's a problem.
Wife, aren't the smallpox germs intact in thy fruit cellar?
They've still got germs that we wiped out a lot.
We thought we'd wiped out.
But they've been cultivating these long-lost...
I got this one anthrax cow named Bill.
So what they have to do before they launch the rocket is piss on it.
They just fill the warhead with urine or crap in it or something.
Something to spread their bodily functions over a wide area.
Which reminds me, have you ever...
Masters of the planet through bacteriological warfare.
Yeah.
And hexing, too.
Right.
All of them brave nuclear warheads bore emblems of the hexes they had shown on the silos down below.
Satellites were able to target the enemy with hexes.
Oh, what's the deal with that?
Come on.
You have me.
Sub-G's got their own credit cards, their own car, and their own oil company.
Oh, you never would have thought so.
Just a few years ago, they were all broke, deadbeat art bums.
And now, look at them.
They're just like some poor little armor dealer on the road.
All little bodies get hit by cars and knocked off the front bumpers of the famous Stang.
What?
Stang is responsible for this auto carnage?
Of course.
He has a fleet of limos now that carry him all over the country.
Mm-hmm.
And those damn hillbillies who work for him just love to crush little creatures on the road.
Yep, that's what they do down there.
They don't have any room to work for Stang and crush little creatures on the road.
Yee-haw!
That's what we say here.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Who is this?
Well, I don't know.
You're playing the record.
I was asking the trailer brides.
Yeah.
Oh, great.
Oh, my God.
Those little trailer twists certainly turn me to one of those beach events this evening.
They will?
Of course.
Well, that's a different, puts a different complexion on the matter of...
Uh-oh.
Oh, my God.
Nice foundation.
Other black tie with my suit on.
And now we have a slow dance for you, those of you that are couples.
Yes, with that slow-eyed...
This is the mop-up, the motor oil on the dance floor.
We'll mop up the motor oil with these dancers.
God bless them.
In a 72-hour dance marathon for the Subgenius Youth Outreach Program.
103rd Street.
All right.
Ah, such boys.
I shot him up first.
And such pretty girls, too.
Busy rapping together.
So much to do, so much to see.
He didn't want his arms bathed in alcohol.
And not just in Soma, or Overtown.
What part of the week?
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
It's pretty slow.
Yep, just like in the springtime back in Arizona.
The lights are going out in the city.
The long day wanes, the slow moon climbs.
The lights are going out all across this country.
Our freedom in chains, slowly suffocating.
The end.
Keep running, keep running.
Who are those?
I've heard the Mennonite mafia around Cleveland Heights is running everything.
The Russians are running scared.
Nobody messes with them.
Nobody.
The brothers, the Puerto Ricans, nobody messes with the Mennonite dudes, man.
Hey, can you grab the door?
But extinguish that.
Face of yours.
Put out that face.
Would someone put the Dave face out, please?
It's shedding all over.
Oh, look.
The Dave brain out.
The Dave face keeps pushing its snout into my flat.
It's like putting the cat out.
Let the Dave face out.
No, no, keep the body in.
Don't let the body go out.
God knows what it'll do.
All right.
You can stop that hissing and waving of claws, my friend.
The game is up.
Did you hear me?
You're not fooling anyone.
You're not a cat.
You're a man.
A man disguised as a cat.
I thought I would be able to find my way home.
But now it seems I'm just wandering these places again.
Is that really you or is that like a space suit in your inside someplace?
Maybe just your brain, a little jar, something like that?
Here it is, straight.
One of the sides.
One of the sides.
The scientist in the last polar test claims he saw a monster.
Well, don't look at me like that.
These scientists claim that this monster, beast, whatever it is, it's a prehistoric thing.
And if you laugh, I'll bring you.
It's romping somewhere around the North Atlantic.
A monster.
How can she love a monster?
Let's get that through your head.
You dried up monster.
We've been hearing this sexual stuff for years.
You know, the five day orgasm.
It all happens without physical contact.
It's only the beginning.
Why should this reality be public domain?
What's so great about it?
Maybe, maybe they gave you some drugs.
Maybe none of this is real at all.
He's going into shock.
Yep, this is the one thing you don't think about on the show.
Maybe this is not real at all.
Get him the allergen.
Get him the allergen.
Lower down those plastic curtains.
You can't tell what's real and what isn't.
Lower ourselves into the caller's brain.
Okay, speak now.
Or forever hold the little pieces that are left on the floor.
That's about your shattered heart.
My pain.
On the surface.
In casual conversation.
Yes.
That beard is all gray.
Yeah, yeah.
It just seemed like normal guys.
Wanna trade me the rest of this banana?
Sure, we can trade the whole show for a couple bananas.
We've done it before.
I'm giving you great input.
Thanks for the input.
Yeah.
We have to put it in somewhere.
Might as well be here.
Doctorsors taught me a lot about dealing with tension.
Yeah, here we go.
No, not tense, are you?
Much better.
Now I can see that you really are a clever doctor.
I gotta go to the doctor!
I gotta go to the doctor!
I gotta go to the doctor!
Oh, Slack.
P.O. Box 204206.
Austin, Texas 787.
I'm Dr. Slack.
2- 0.
That's a box 204-206.
Austin, Texas 787.
2- 0.
And it's so calm at www.subgenius.com.
Praise Bob.
