00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:21,200
You know someday you'll make it smart

192
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:27,420
Man, I'll let you remember

193
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,260
How foolish I used to be

194
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,400
The way I used to love you, baby

195
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,660
How bad you tried

196
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,920
I used to cry about you, baby

197
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,700
Tryin' to walk the streets late at night

198
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,500
I used to cry about you

199
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,940
Walk the streets late at night

200
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,640
If you love me just a little bit, baby

201
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,840
Wind the world

202
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,720
Don't you treat me right

203
00:12:34,140 --> 00:12:35,300
Ah yeah

216
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,880
If you were always so unkind

217
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:19,720
You'd color my多!"

218
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:19,940

guitar solo

225
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,080
That's the fun of the thing

226
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,860
Oh, I believe

227
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,580

guitar solo

229
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:12,440
I want you to tell my baby

00:26:53,020 --> 00:27:03,540
To forgive me for my sins

256
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:09,500
To forgive me for my sins

257
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:21,940
This guy doesn't.

258
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,980
And that's as simple as it needs to be.

259
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,540
So thanks for your question.

260
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,420
And yes, in the next Dark Fist,

261
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,100
they're going to continue the adventure stories that I wrote.

262
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:35,180
I would talk to you more, but I've got some interviews to do.

263
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:37,520
So I'm just going to give you a little preview treat.

264
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:42,680
The next issue has a continuation with the subtitle,

265
00:27:43,280 --> 00:27:45,040
The One Bar Jail.

266
00:27:57,700 --> 00:28:21,100
The One Bar Jail.

267
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:31,720
The One Bar Jail.

268
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:02,320
The One Bar Jail.

269
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,240
The One Bar Jail.

270
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,240


271
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,540
The One Bar Jail.

272
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,800
The One Bar Jail.

273
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,180
The One Bar Jail.

274
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,740
The slot rods did that.

275
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:35,640
Reverend Angry Larry, the guitar player,

276
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:41,360
the instrument called Herman's Headers from Surf and Glue, the album.

277
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:47,560
Detroit hot rod monster surf punk at its absolute best.

278
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,780
Reverend Angry Larry runs a store in,

279
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:55,360
Mount Clemens called Weirdsville Records.

280
00:29:56,260 --> 00:30:00,260
And my old LPs are for sale there.

281
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,540
Shut up, buddy.

282
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:08,620
But now I'd like to share a personal phone message

283
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,420
I got from my old, old, old friend,

284
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,120
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy,

285
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,100
whose voice is the only one besides Buddy's

286
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,060
that you always hear on every,

287
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,980
every episode of this show.

288
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,580
Testing, testing.

289
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,340
Is this on?

290
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,200
Reverend Stang, this is the Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

291
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:35,660
Some of you out there may be saying,

292
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:38,040
now Bleepo doesn't sound like that.

293
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,520
And it's true.

294
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:42,600
I'm not, I'm not talking in my real voice.

295
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:47,680
This voice is a synthesis of several subgenius voices,

296
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,100
including my own,

297
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,640
but also, uh,

298
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,540
containing elements of, of the Reverend Ivan Stang,

299
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,620
uh, the late Chaz Smith,

300
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,620
lonesome cowboy Dave.

301
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,820
Um, that's all I can think of at the moment,

302
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,800
but there's others that are peppered in there.

303
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:08,840
As you may be able to hear from the sort of faux Texas,

304
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Ohio twang that is contained within my speech.

305
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:20,520
Uh, you might call it an impediment because normally you'd hear me talk,

306
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:31,300
like the subgenius hour of slack but I'm not gonna talk like that now cuz see

307
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:38,700
it's real late at night and I've been thinking I've been thinking about need

308
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:46,340
we all need see staying in yeah now somebody else's be I think a little John

309
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,080
Houston's creeping into my voice I just want to mention that at this moment here

310
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:56,360
because I am a voice over artist actually I think of myself more as a

311
00:31:56,360 --> 00:32:01,460
voice over man artist but that's that's beside the point that's because of my

312
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:10,480
subgenius training that enables me to be a voice over man but back to need I'm

313
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,680
rambling you'll have to excuse me because I drive a rambler

314
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,100
66

315
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:25,620
rambler sedan sort of low-key but anyway what I need now is gas and then I

316
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:31,080
need a new toaster oven I need a lot of dry cleaning there's a whole lot of dry

317
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:35,340
cleaning you got to do they don't tell you this when you move to Hollywood but

318
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:41,580
if you move to Hollywood you have got to do dry cleaning like nobody's business

319
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:46,100
so you find the dry cleaner that has the most cute funny animals and it's

320
00:32:46,100 --> 00:32:52,800
logo and then you you make sure they have lots of coupons and that's a trick

321
00:32:52,800 --> 00:33:02,060
so what I'm saying here is everybody's got a need but Bob will know he won't

322
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:09,280
stood he doesn't really steer you but look the point is I forgot what the

323
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:16,080
point was but but Bob Bob has inspired me as have all the great subgenius

324
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:27,380
ministers and the ones with radio shows the ones without them all of them can be

325
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:38,360
said to be masters of I forget what why this cat is bothering me now she the cat

326
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:44,100
is poking its little feet through the back of my chair and tickling my backside

327
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,820
now that's just wrong

328
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:52,360
cat it don't let your cat do that even if you enjoy it I don't enjoy it that

329
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:58,080
much except when this one cat does it but you know it's not it's not that sort

330
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:03,900
of relationship don't get the wrong idea that's what's going on now too many

331
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:13,300
people walking around with wrong ideas my point is not now I sort of sense the

332
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,080
actor who played the character in the movie is a character who is really good but it's not a good character

333
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,080


334
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:46,060
that Mel Blanc later based foghorn leghorn on I forget what that actor's name was but he was he was actually a senator claghorn was the character's name on the radio show and I realize he's sort of sneaking in here so the older elements sneak in to the voice the older influences and mine was of course Warner Brothers cartoons yeah am I rambling well it's about time to wrap up the show I'll see you next time on the show

335
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:46,060


336
00:34:46,080 --> 00:35:16,060
I'll see you next time on the show

337
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:46,060
I'll see you next time on the show

338
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,220
now

339
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,520
you're going to die...

340
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,240
fish

341
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,120
good totems for you

342
00:36:41,120 --> 00:36:43,020
good totems for you

343
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,820
good totems for you

344
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,180
I don't know.

345
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:17,200
Jets.

346
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,840
Jets.

347
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:19,760
Jets.

348
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:55,240
Jets.

349
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:16,460
Jets.

350
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:16,520
Jets.

351
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,880
Jets.

352
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:29,040
Somebody has an oogly.

353
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:38,000
I recognize many of those giggles and crepitation sounds used in that crazy mix of Dr. Musique,

354
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:42,400
which is by something called Rad Lab,

355
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,820
or someone who is apparently,

356
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:47,140
an admirer,

357
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,760
and now,

358
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:49,060
a contributor,

359
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,440
and one of the gang.

360
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:52,480
Thanks, Rad Lab.

361
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:53,900
And also,

362
00:38:54,320 --> 00:38:55,060
now,

363
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,100
I mean,

364
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:56,920
and now,

365
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,560
15 minutes from last X Day Drill,

366
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,180
first day,

367
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,000
fourth show,

368
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:05,000
with Dr. Hal and Philo Drummond,

369
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:13,080
after I got tired and asked the sole remaining audience member to replace me on mic one.

370
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:15,240
That was the subgenius,

371
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:17,020
known as X.

372
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,140
But he did a really good job.

373
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:25,300
But the recording that I got after I left was horrible,

374
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,580
extremely bassy,

375
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,980
especially on Dr. Hal and X.

376
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:36,680
And I've filtered this very heavily to make it perfectly audible,

377
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,240
albeit not at all resonant.

378
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:45,200
The music in the background is by CyberChump,

379
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:45,780
and,

380
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,020
I'm sorry,

381
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,960
I keep promising to leave.

382
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:52,740
Hey,

383
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,880
somebody else come up here and grab this mic.

384
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:55,860
Hey you, wake up!

385
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,740
Yeah, yeah, go, just do it.

386
00:39:58,820 --> 00:39:59,660
I don't care.

387
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:01,420
You can even use these headphones.

388
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,640
Uh, what, oh, but, oops.

389
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:08,180
Oh, I forgot the headphones are, uh,

390
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,440
these are subgenius headphones.

391
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,080
You just have to hold it there.

392
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,000
Once it's clamped on, it's fine.

393
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:19,680
I don't think I have any ear infections today.

394
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,500
Did you get a ride down here, Father?

395
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:24,540
I just have to stand up, walk around for a minute.

396
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,120
You better be funny, or we'll just, we got this big hook.

397
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:31,600
That shouldn't be left.

398
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:33,840
Where is the big hook?

399
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,080
It must be that close.

400
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:39,120
It must be this high to ride this, uh, ride.

401
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:41,360
And it must be this close to be audible.

402
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:43,500
You can barely hear Hal hunkering over it.

403
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,580
Remember you talk to Michael Pepe and you tell him,

404
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,060
hey man, you're spitting in my face.

405
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,960
It's just like saying, hey, would you spit in my face?

406
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:55,200
God himself had buried but one.

407
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,140
He turns the faucet on full blast.

408
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,500
...content to make use of this way,

409
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,940
collectible from Scripture expressions.

410
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:06,180
So the spewing saliva, Michael Pepe spray,

411
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,360
the Pepe spray is all over you.

412
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,140
...about recovering the body of Moses.

413
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,980
Not that I didn't have any other mistakes.

414
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:15,180
Have we driven him away yet?

415
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:19,520
But the practice of burning was also of great antiquity

416
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:21,220
and of no slender extent.

417
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,700
...district of Caledonia.

418
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:23,960
Are they gone yet?

419
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,680
...to derive the same from Hercules.

420
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,180
Manlius the consul burned the body of his, uh, son.

421
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:35,920
And the ashes were kept in an urn on the Capitoline Hill.

422
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,140
And then...

423
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,440
...suddenly...

424
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:43,380
...there was silence.

425
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,040
The silence after cremation.

426
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:47,980
Mm-hmm.

427
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:52,320
The ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

428
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,600
If my blues don't get you, then my jazzin' must.

429
00:41:57,140 --> 00:42:00,860
So, Philo, you've been walking up and down inside the world,

430
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:04,320
uh, and in it, and seen many...

431
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,860
I walked all the way up, completely back up there,

432
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,400
and then all the way back...

433
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,460
...up to that lone...

434
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,160
...lorn...

435
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:14,080
...except for the time when Princess Wee took me up there...

436
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:14,640
...on the ridge.

437
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:17,960
...and I didn't really walk up there, but I just said I did.

438
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:19,500
Well, you had a help.

439
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,360
Your mic is much louder than mine.

440
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,560
You had a, uh, guide...

441
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:25,620
Well, I've always had the ability to project my voice.

442
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:26,920
...from a guiding spirit.

443
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,980
...extra loud, hooked up to your doohickey.

444
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:32,360
Uh, my voice control is going through your doohickey.

445
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,560
...my doohickey.

446
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:36,520
You've got my mic turned up hot, hot.

447
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:37,900
No, I have your mic half way down.

448
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,440
See...

449
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:41,680
...that's because I'm just so awesome, though.

450
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,200
My voice has...

451
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:43,700
Oh, see, we have a...

452
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,460
...I turned my voice on to awesome.

453
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,740
...stereo presentation, full fidelity, uh, rich, uh...

454
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,100
I've got my awesome switch turned on.

455
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:52,660
...switch...

456
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:53,940
...switched.

457
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,160
You know, it's true that you're one of the few people I can always understand with my deafness.

458
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:58,600
Really?

459
00:42:58,760 --> 00:42:59,020
Yeah.

460
00:42:59,040 --> 00:42:59,780
Well, there you go.

461
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,840
That's because of years of sales training.

462
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:06,180
The authoritative, uh, southern white man, Exile.

463
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:06,840
I love drama.

464
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:08,020
Years of training.

465
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:08,540
...determined.

466
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:09,960
Salesman supreme.

467
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,840
To get my voice to carry across a crowd of...

468
00:43:13,840 --> 00:43:14,280
...offers.

469
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:15,400
...unruly customers.

470
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:15,940
...this master class.

471
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:18,000
The swing line stapler of sales.

472
00:43:18,060 --> 00:43:18,380
You can buy this.

473
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:21,520
...have to beat those customers into submission from time to time.

474
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,520
Or you can buy this.

475
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,760
...back slapping hail fellow...

476
00:43:24,760 --> 00:43:28,500
They don't know what they want to buy until you let them...until you tell them what they want.

477
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:29,800
Always be closing.

478
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:35,240
Customers are constantly wanting things, but they don't know what they are until they require salesmen to...

479
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,500
Don't give them time to make up their mind.

480
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,000
...imbue them with the very best of their abilities.

481
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,000


482
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,000


483
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,000


484
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,000


485
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,720
...the values and benefits of getting...

486
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,560
Push for that sale.

487
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,360
...product or service.

488
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:43,640
Push, push, push for that big sale.

489
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:46,740
Now everything's too loud.

490
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:52,640
Okay, uh, they say it's all too much of a crowd, too much, too, much too lush and loud.

491
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,840
What's wrong, Reverend Stang?

492
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:55,040
It's distorting.

493
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:56,300
Everything's a little loud?

494
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,420
Is it hurting your little pity ears?

495
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,540
Now, now, I know where.

496
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:02,900
Perhaps not to everybody's taste.

497
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:03,320
No, wait.

498
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:04,040
You wouldn't know.

499
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,160
If I would wear headphones, I wouldn't know.

500
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:07,980
Well, I'm just a...

501
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:07,980


502
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:08,420
Excuse me.

503
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:10,840
I'm gonna talk a lot more gentle now.

504
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,440
There you go.

505
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:12,740
See?

506
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,380
You have tamed his fiery spirit.

507
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:16,760
I hear the voices.

508
00:44:17,100 --> 00:44:19,120
Even when I'm talking gentle, I'm loud.

509
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:21,500
Yes, he's a loud gentleman.

510
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,500
It's like hurting the cats.

511
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:26,540
I'm a loud motherfucker.

512
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:29,920
You're a loud many things on this program.

513
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:31,220
But I'm not a dirty motherfucker.

514
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,980
I'm a clean motherfucker.

515
00:44:33,100 --> 00:44:34,220
Of course.

516
00:44:35,660 --> 00:44:36,260
Shy.

517
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:37,940
We hew to a certain standard.

518
00:44:37,940 --> 00:44:37,980
I'm a clean motherfucker.

519
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,600
You're a clean motherfucker.

520
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:44,060
I realize one day that almost all the women I ever had sex with were mothers.

521
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:45,760
What?

522
00:44:45,900 --> 00:44:47,020
Afterwards, you mean?

523
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,780
At some point in time in their lives.

524
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:53,180
Well, coincidence or conspiracy.

525
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:54,960
Might have been afterwards.

526
00:44:55,560 --> 00:44:56,620
You motherfucker.

527
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:58,760
That's what I mean.

528
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,320
I'd say it proudly.

529
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:06,560
You see, he populated the Earth and the land of Gihon, where there is bdellium and the

530
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:07,340
onyx stone.

531
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:07,800
There's a...

532
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,720
We had an audience and we scared them away and now they're driving off.

533
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,240
At a high rate of speed.

534
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:15,920
They paid their fee.

535
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,680
They're highly indignant at the results of this.

536
00:45:18,680 --> 00:45:19,140
They're mad.

537
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:20,100
They're really mad.

538
00:45:21,180 --> 00:45:22,080
They're in a silver car.

539
00:45:23,380 --> 00:45:25,300
Shifting into iambic gear.

540
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:27,140
They wasted their silver.

541
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,580
They cast their seed money on the car.

542
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,940
The show is riveting them.

543
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,680
Away riveting them away.

544
00:45:35,680 --> 00:45:38,180
They bought it from somebody else.

545
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:42,640
It's riveting them against a steel girder that's a long ways away from here.

546
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:44,460
They have to get there fast now.

547
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:45,900
Four stars riveting.

548
00:45:45,940 --> 00:45:47,500
I was riveted to my seat.

549
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:48,360
There they are.

550
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:49,200
There they go.

551
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:49,940
There they go.

552
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:55,420
Our former audience is now either on stage.

553
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:59,340
Departing silver car sets the standard for all cars.

554
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,560
Our former audience is either on stage or rejecting us.

555
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:06,260
They're ears.

556
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:10,000
The only guy that was actually sitting there listening is now.

557
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,860
You had to hijack the audience.

558
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,840
You were so tired.

559
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:18,400
You were just so worn out from yakking for hours on end.

560
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:18,760
Tired.

561
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:21,160
That you had to hijack the audience.

562
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:22,240
And now.

563
00:46:22,440 --> 00:46:23,780
So you could have slack.

564
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:24,500
Yes.

565
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:26,780
So we could trade everything.

566
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,040
Your birthright for a mess of potty.

567
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:30,980
I need to hijack somebody.

568
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,740
Who do you think you go from?

569
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,420
And then you go.

570
00:46:33,420 --> 00:46:33,540
Well, I'm going to go.

571
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:33,540


572
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,620
I could just put on a tape of me talking about hijacking somebody.

573
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,760
I think I'm no longer needed here.

574
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:43,360
Oh.

575
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,720
Oh, I'm going to find it.

576
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:46,880
So awesome.

577
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,700
What are you going to find?

578
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,400
Your destiny.

579
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:53,520
Find and fulfill your destiny.

580
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:56,440
I got the perfect filler.

581
00:46:56,660 --> 00:46:58,440
There's no need for filler anymore.

582
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,800
All filler, no killer.

583
00:47:01,220 --> 00:47:03,160
The filler has been filled.

584
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:06,760
It's stretched.

585
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,960
What is your name again?

586
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:11,520
Bob Hope Phyllis Diller, golf classic.

587
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:12,540
Which reverend are you?

588
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:13,200
X.

589
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:16,160
He's Reverend X, or just X for short.

590
00:47:16,380 --> 00:47:17,440
X the unknown.

591
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,240
Yeah, we still have a Rev X.

592
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,740
He's like another Rev X.

593
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:23,840
Our book, Revelation X.

594
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,580
So, Philo, you were going to spin a platter you were seeing.

595
00:47:27,940 --> 00:47:29,480
It's going to take me a minute to find it.

596
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,020
But when I do, I'll wind it up for a bit.

597
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:32,860
Check that out.

598
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:33,240
It's real funny.

599
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:38,200
It's approximately 45 revolutions per microsecond,

600
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:42,900
which causes 60th or 70th birthday.

601
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:45,780
Fabric of time itself.

602
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,640
And that's what you got.

603
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:48,920
And it's funny.

604
00:47:49,100 --> 00:47:51,600
And you can use Febreze on this fabric,

605
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,540
and it will smell karma clean.

606
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:55,680
Febreze.

607
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:59,120
When you add the fabric softener,

608
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,460
does it soften the time-space fabric?

609
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,360
It does.

610
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:08,060
What about the elasticity of the continuum?

611
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:09,820
Oh, no.

612
00:48:09,860 --> 00:48:12,080
The elasticity is very rigid.

613
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:12,880
Hmm.

614
00:48:13,060 --> 00:48:13,820
That's it.

615
00:48:13,860 --> 00:48:15,260
For her, it's a pleasure.

616
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,700
Yeah, it's got to remain.

617
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,280
It's got to remain stretchable.

618
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:24,480
Got to remain unanimous.

619
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,340
And April fresh.

620
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:28,220
That's right.

621
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:29,440
Everyone can do this.

622
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:31,280
Ever being born.

623
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,920
Ever being greeted.

624
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:33,540
Come in.

625
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:39,840
Coming into being with the smell of that special scent

626
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:44,280
they put in every package of fabric softener.

627
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:49,600
And the day after tomorrow is Independence Day 1998.

628
00:48:51,060 --> 00:48:54,240
And the day after that will be independent from them.

629
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:59,380
The eternal recurrence of X-Day.

630
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:02,880
All old and all dared before.

631
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,320
All having happened before will happen again.

632
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:14,320
But there is no eternal recurrence because things are bigger on the inside than they are on the outside.

633
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:20,560
Space-time is everywhere locally.

634
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:23,800
I'm looking.

635
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:29,980
Well, um, I guess that wraps that up in a...

636
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,460
Anthropomorphic.

637
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,500
Yes, exactly.

638
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:38,320
It's a lovable personality seen on your screen.

639
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,400
Beckoning you down further to further adventures.

640
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,800
Down in the medicine fish hole.

641
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:50,420
Going down.

642
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,600
The tardigrade.

643
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:57,420
Part six.

644
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:06,060
We left our intrepid heroes of Stace...

645
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:13,060
Yes, Dr. Drummond is still connecting to his...

646
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:13,720
Planet X.

647
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:20,040
...intablature, which is going to add the necessary dimension to this presentation.

648
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:22,140
X being mysterious.

649
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:24,400
It will happen.

650
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,900
It causes things to equal.

651
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:26,520
I tell you.

652
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,840
X equals...

653
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:31,040
But nobody knows what X equals.

654
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:37,120
They try to look for a solution, but they're part of the solvent.

655
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,040
That's right.

656
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:43,060
They're liquid.

657
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:45,580
Flowing.

658
00:50:47,560 --> 00:50:49,980
And it may take thousands of years.

659
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:53,660
But they all fall down.

660
00:50:56,520 --> 00:51:01,500
And you push and push and push.

661
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,000
Yes.

662
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:08,380
Huge mountains that were ground down to tiny pebbles.

663
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,080
To tiny stones.

664
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:18,000
But each stone having the kinetic form, purpose, and potential of the mountain, supposedly.

665
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,740
Still, there you go.

666
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:24,020
The high become low.

667
00:51:24,020 --> 00:51:26,520
And the mighty and great becoming insignificant.

668
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,160
The pebbles float.

669
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:31,760
But the avalanche is already beginning.

670
00:51:34,220 --> 00:51:37,880
Does anybody know the Wi-Fi password around here?

671
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:39,980
Oh, it is?

672
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:40,380
Okay.

673
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,780
No Wi-Fi for you.

674
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:44,100
Bummer.

675
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,640
Yeah, it's too bad.

676
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:51,460
Because I know you were planning to hook into an award-winning Bobcast.

677
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:51,940
Damn it.

678
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,000
Which would have seized us out.

679
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,060
We were just sitting underneath the deepest depths of the Bering Sea.

680
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,700
Lost our bearings.

681
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:05,080
And now friction brings us to a fault.

682
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:07,180
And that's right.

683
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,800
It's the Marianas fault.

684
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,260
And then there was the Gingers fault.

685
00:52:14,740 --> 00:52:18,240
But they always blame their headheads for these things.

686
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:23,400
It just doesn't make sense.

687
00:52:24,660 --> 00:52:25,640
That's right.

688
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:28,900
It's free here now.

689
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:32,200
The present.

690
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:34,780
The opening.

691
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:38,180
The last.

692
00:52:38,300 --> 00:52:39,920
One of my best ideas.

693
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,680
I can't do stuff with them.

694
00:52:41,740 --> 00:52:42,740
The final.

695
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:45,200
The ultimate.

696
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:47,100
The final outrage.

697
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:49,800
Outrage.

698
00:52:51,220 --> 00:52:52,760
They were outraged.

699
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:55,060
They didn't know why they were outraged.

700
00:52:55,140 --> 00:52:56,940
But they were pretty damn upset.

701
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,020
They were indignant.

702
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,340
Yeah, they were indignant.

703
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,260
They didn't have no money.

704
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,040
So they just wanted some help.

705
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,060
They wanted some food.

706
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:09,100
They wanted some place to live.

707
00:53:10,060 --> 00:53:11,080
A place to breathe.

708
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:12,960
Just a place to urinate.

709
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:16,440
All they needed was 60 million dollars.

710
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,280
some seal skin to protect them from the cold,

711
00:53:19,420 --> 00:53:22,300
to know how stocks would go on Wall Street,

712
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,480
and to be living in a mansion built of gold.

713
00:53:27,560 --> 00:53:30,240
And then, I don't know, they was going to get greedy.

714
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:38,860
I said, honey, you know, two mansions is all we need,

715
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:41,300
one for you, one for me.

716
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,120
And she said, well, what about it?

717
00:53:43,160 --> 00:53:45,500
Yeah, how many mansions do you need to skate behind?

718
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:51,060
And that was Greedy, the eighth dwarf, intractable,

719
00:53:51,820 --> 00:53:52,780
could not be convinced.

720
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,020
And then along came Sleazy and Sneaky.

721
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:59,140
Yeah, a fine bunch.

722
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,420
The runts of the litter, certainly.

723
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:06,320
And now, what's...

724
00:54:07,840 --> 00:54:12,760
Yeah, the other seven of the original 14 dwarves,

725
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,900
because you had...

726
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,140
You did.

727
00:54:15,260 --> 00:54:15,480
You had...

728
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:15,480


729
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,060
You had Sleazy and Sneaky,

730
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:19,420
Sharty.

731
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,580
They didn't all live together.

732
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:22,500
Yeah, that one.

733
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:24,060
Yeah, Shorty.

734
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:24,540
Yeah.

735
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,080
Shorty, the dwarf.

736
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,120
Don't forget.

737
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,980
He was mad, because even he was short to the other dwarves.

738
00:54:30,300 --> 00:54:32,420
Well, someone had to be, I mean,

739
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:35,760
given the slight variation of height among them all.

740
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:41,540
Yeah, the lesser known dwarves didn't get any traction.

741
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,820
Nobody wanted to pick up their options.

742
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:50,000
Shorty was kind of an infra dwarf, a dwarf unto dwarfs,

743
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:53,840
and that was one of the reasons that he had the personality difficulties

744
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,240
that he later exhibited.

745
00:54:56,700 --> 00:54:57,840
There was High Pockets.

746
00:54:57,840 --> 00:54:59,760
He was the tallest, world's tallest dwarf.

747
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:00,580
Mm-hmm.

748
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,800
He was like six feet tall.

749
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:06,220
He used to hunch over, but didn't fool his brethren,

750
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:09,440
who considered themselves genuine dwarfs.

751
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:10,620
Who you calling little people?

752
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:14,800
We're doing popular music ordained by world's tallest dwarves.

753
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:15,220
The world's midget.

754
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:19,660
Yes, that was, well, probably Billy Barty, but...

755
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,460
World's smartest retard.

756
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,060
That would be Bob.

757
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:26,520
Versus the world's dumbest genius.

758
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,460
And who would win?

759
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:34,100
Press button one.

760
00:55:39,300 --> 00:55:40,100
Press button two.

761
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:48,860
Then press button three to deactivate and open the trap

762
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:50,400
and remove the prey.

763
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:53,400
To introduce the trap to the general public,

764
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:56,040
we are giving you this model absolutely free.

765
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:27,960
You will

766
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:28,120
They

767
00:56:48,320 --> 00:56:50,320
I am on a set of things

768
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:56,220
I am on a set of things

769
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:57,040
I am on a set of things

770
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:59,300
He's coming from the conservatory, so I stop by.

771
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,140
What are you playing?

772
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:06,240
Just a simple melody of my own.

773
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,760
So weird.

774
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:10,100
Hey, you don't stop playing.

775
00:57:21,120 --> 00:57:22,200
Don't stop playing.

776
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,260
Don't stop playing.

777
00:57:32,980 --> 00:57:33,860
Have a drink.

778
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,120
Well, it's awfully early in the morning.

779
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,460
We'll look upon it as an extension of last night.

780
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:40,600
Your eyes, what's happening?

781
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,080
All right.

782
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,560
They're very bloodshot.

783
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,600
Can't you see?

784
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:44,900
Hey, lad.

785
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:46,520
Can't you see?

786
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,920
I know I'm blind.

787
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:50,400
I can't harbour this anymore.

788
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,420
Don't stop playing.

789
00:57:52,420 --> 00:57:56,240
I'm still strong.

790
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:56,500
I'm still strong.

791
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:59,100
I'm still strong.

792
00:58:03,400 --> 00:58:04,080
Don't stop playing.

793
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,500
Don't stop playing.

794
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:42,600
Well, this episode certainly got weirder and weirder, didn't it?

795
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:44,580
That was a Dr. Banter.

796
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:51,020
anti-music collaboration between Dr. Philodrummond and the new guy, Reverend Richard Negative,

797
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:56,900
from his subgenius CD, Welcome to Dobbs.Town.

798
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:04,680
Personally, I don't really like any anti-music that I'm not performing at the moment.

799
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:09,660
And as you can tell by Buddy's howling in the background, he doesn't like it either.

800
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:17,620
But, you know, it's a subgenius tradition, and I know a lot of you folks are on drugs and will listen to anything.

801
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:24,780
And what you're listening to now is the Hour of Slack from the Church of the Subgenius,

802
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:36,500
specifically the Subgenius Foundation, located at P.O. Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

803
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:38,900
Subgenius.com.

804
00:59:39,660 --> 00:59:41,440
Oh, Price Bob.

805
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,980
And thank you, Buddy.

806
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:52,980
From PR News in Washington, I'm barred from kneeling during the national anthem while on the field.

807
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:58,880
Then, last night, thousands of documents in central Iowa yesterday reported to be without power today,

808
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,300
and China and Russia blocked it.

809
01:00:02,580 --> 01:00:05,880
But Trump says he's ready to impose tariffs on all PR reports.

810
01:00:06,980 --> 01:00:09,200
The Trump is urging all members of the United Nations,

811
01:00:09,660 --> 01:00:12,180
to fully support the sanctions imposed on PR.

812
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,900
I don't like it, and I haven't liked it for many years.

813
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:17,040
The Trump Is Here

814
01:00:17,040 --> 01:00:17,700
The Trump Is Here

815
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:18,580
you
