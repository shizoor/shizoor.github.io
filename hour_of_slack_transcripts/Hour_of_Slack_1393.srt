1
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:20,620
I know you don't have time to talk to your plants. Don't worry. You can go on about your business, whether that's to class or the office, or fixing dinner, or making love. They'll listen to the self-genius, our old swag.

2
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:25,800
Let's begin.

3
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:34,940
We're rolling. This is the good one. Take five.

4
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:46,600
Most folks have heard about it.

5
00:00:46,620 --> 00:00:47,720
All right, that's good, Bob.

6
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,200
That's why folks call it finger.

7
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,620
That's why folks call it finger.

8
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:54,720
Sounds good, Bob.

9
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,000
That's why folks call it.

10
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,980
The self-genius.

11
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:59,980
Our old swag.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,600
Swag.

13
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,720
Perfect.

14
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,980
The self-genius.

15
00:01:30,980 --> 00:01:33,280
Our old swag.

16
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:38,860
Oh, that's not true.

17
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:52,920
Tonight, radio's distinguished series dedicated to man's imagination.

18
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:55,820
The self-genius.

19
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:58,300
Our old swag.

20
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:01,860
The self-genius.

21
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:01,860


22
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,840
It's our way of acknowledging our American heroes.

23
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,020
That's what you say.

24
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:14,440
We say you could act like a jackrabbit with frazzled nerves and a heart pounding like a trip hammer.

25
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,120
You gotta keep jumping.

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,220
You gotta keep punching.

27
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,260
Punch.

28
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,860
Punch.

29
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,340
Punch that grandfather.

30
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,300
Ugh.

31
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,820
Ugh.

32
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:28,800
The victim can stand only so much abuse.

33
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,700
The victim can stand only so much abuse.

34
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,100
The victim can stand only so much abuse.

35
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,020
Too many people die because they couldn't live.

36
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:39,860
The grandfather's journey is ending.

37
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:40,200


38
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,380
He swam from the Pacific Ocean all the way up to Mount Fuji.

39
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:46,680
That's impossible, isn't it?

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:46,880


41
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,420
This is beyond our present knowledge or understanding.

42
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:51,920
Bob?

43
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:52,760
Bob?

44
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,640
Bob?

45
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,420
Bob?

46
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,080
Bob?

47
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:55,660
Bob?

48
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,140
Bob?

49
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,300
Bob?

50
00:02:58,300 --> 00:02:58,320
Bob?

51
00:02:59,240 --> 00:02:59,940
Bob?

52
00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,940


53
00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,940


54
00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,940


55
00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,940


56
00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,940


57
00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,940


58
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,400
Bob?

59
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:01,400


60
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,060
What are you talking about?

61
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,540
Yes dear friend.

62
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,980
This is the hour offfata ghosts.

63
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,420
And this is the hour offlata.

64
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:48,980
Yes, dear friends, and we barely made it to 1,000 hours of slack, but that's what this is.

65
00:03:48,980 --> 00:04:03,080
We just barely made it because when we jumped into the new I-Van to drive down here to the station for the most important show ever since the first one on October of 1985 in Dallas, the car wouldn't start.

66
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,420
A dead battery, friends, with about half an hour until showtime.

67
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:18,720
But luckily our jumper cables and the WeMobile exist together with the I-Van in the same dimension, and thus here we are just in time for the world to end and to read and play.

68
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:24,800
All the submissions from our beloved listeners, contributors, and supporters.

69
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:47,120
And so, dear friends, with this new El Queso All-Stars intro music,

70
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:56,300
we'll be listening to the commemorative commentations on this, our 1,000th hour.

71
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:01,400
Now we introduce you to the host with the most Jesus-shamanically Marvin with a side of toes,

72
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,740
like a psychic Burt Reynolds jumping his car through your neighbor's curly hair spreading slack everywhere.

73
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,040
That's me, dear friends.

74
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,580
And this is the hour of slack.

75
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,020
And this is the hour of slack.

76
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,120
But this is the hour of slack.

77
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,920
And Dave and we are here to...

78
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,600
We don't...

79
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,360
Oh, now we have some head fuzz.

80
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,320
Lay your hands on the radio.

81
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:36,020
Lay your hands on the radio band at home, and we're gonna look to God.

82
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,000
1,000.

83
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,480
1,000.

84
00:05:40,980 --> 00:05:42,100
1,000.

85
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,300
1,000.

86
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,120
1,000.

87
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,560
1,000.

88
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:45,980
1,000.

89
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,100
1,000.

90
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,160
1,000.

91
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:49,120
1,000.

92
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:49,760
1,000.

93
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:50,200
1,000.

94
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,480
Stop all the way.

95
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:58,320
The hour of slack.

96
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,900
That marvelous fleeting interlude,

97
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:06,660
like the moment between each wave and a mighty ocean,

98
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,260
where everything is suspended,

99
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,260
every string of the conspiracy's powered neatly nipped away

100
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,700
by its unique shearin' vibrations.

101
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:23,960
allowing you to drift and float in the flippity-floppity-zing-zang of Slack.

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,780
Ah, how sad that there can only be one a week.

103
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,540
But nay, no, that is not so.

104
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,480
For all these 1,000 hours of Slack have been carefully and dutifully recorded

105
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,980
by our obedient sacred scribe, number 273,

106
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,880
and can be gotten in so many different ways.

107
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:49,540
Read up in subgenius.com for the many and sundry ways.

108
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,160
Why, you could listen to nothing but the hour of Slack if that was your desire.

109
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,480
The hour of Slack.

110
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:04,160
A confounding yet cunning confluence of fractious fragments of brilliant madness

111
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,140
woven together weekly for 19 years

112
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:14,240
by a word wrangler the likes of which, well, there are no likes of which.

113
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:21,640
Bob inspires crazily talented artistes of every kind you never heard of

114
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:27,160
to spring forth with endless precious audio offerings of puzzling wonder.

115
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,440
And Reverend Stang has been queuing it up for all of us all of these years.

116
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,100
Purely for the glorifying and pious preservation of it all.

117
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:39,160
And for our listening pleasure,

118
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:43,380
creating an easily attainable, soothing form

119
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:44,860
of Slack.

120
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,040
The hour of Slack.

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,500
1,000 hours of Slack.

122
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,500
Listened to continuously.

123
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:55,140
One show on the heels of another.

124
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:01,400
That would be a little more than 41 and a half solid days of audio Slack.

125
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,280
What would that do?

126
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:06,180
A thought that gives one pause.

127
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,920
Perhaps there will be a radio marathon and someone actually will do this.

128
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:14,100
Of course, maintaining a 19...

129
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:22,200
year continuous archive of this weekly show would be no small feat.

130
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,560
But 41 days of Slack is, at the very least, conceivable.

131
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,280
The hour of Slack.

132
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:36,100
Where everybody is a star, no matter who you are.

133
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,780
Whether from near or whether far.

134
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:41,140
Everybody is a star.

135
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,840
And we're packaged, processed stars.

136
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,820
Our nobody.

137
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,400
The hour of Slack.

138
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:57,080
Each week I hear my beloved Stang in his sacred studio above lovingly whittling the profanity

139
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:02,800
from the flagrant flowings of the preachers, plucking the unallowable from what would otherwise

140
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,840
never be heard.

141
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:12,000
I hear the ceaseless tinkerings of sound as he hones the show into the slippery seal of

142
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,420
cosmic cacophony that it is.

143
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,960
Truly a labor of love.

144
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,980
The hour of Slack.

145
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,080
Here's to the next thousand hours.

146
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:27,360
May they be as rapturous and rambunctious as the first thou.

147
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:34,160
Nay, may X day come and then all of the hours we live will become...

148
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,220
Hours of Slack.

149
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,240
This is Pat Paulson.

150
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,860
I just want to say that I endorse Bob as my running coach.

151
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,860


152
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,860


153
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,860


154
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,860


155
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,860


156
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,860


157
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,860


158
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,860


159
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,860


160
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,860


161
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,860


162
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,860


163
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,860


164
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:44,860


165
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:45,940
mate in this year's election.

166
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,840
And this is the hour of slack in Dallas,

167
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,100
Texas. You know, I know where that is.

168
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,620
The hour of slack has brought

169
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,500
lymph node, pleasure, joy,

170
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,700
sex, sex hurt, sex dirt,

171
00:09:57,280 --> 00:09:58,480
excremeditation, hours and hours

172
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,860
with a chick, hermaphroditic

173
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:02,260
frogs, stinky,

174
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,480
stank, stench, psychic readings

175
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,900
from all of my best

176
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:09,160
psychic friends. By watching bad television

177
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,000
with the sound turned off and the hour of slack

178
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,140
on loudly, terrible earthy

179
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:15,260
smells on my index and middle

180
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:17,000
fingers, terrible paranoia,

181
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:19,380
the soundtrack to a psychotic breakdown,

182
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:20,660
bunions, canyons,

183
00:10:20,660 --> 00:10:22,920
and funnies, the night sweats,

184
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,500
grunting reddies,

185
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,340
tantalizing powerfully religions,

186
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,900
the grievous geese

187
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,760
versus robots, and monkeys

188
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,240
versus robots. More slack

189
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,900
than I can shake his dick at.

190
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,960
And all for the price

191
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,020
of my mortal soul.

192
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,020
Or triple my money back.

193
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:41,900
Thanks, Bob.

194
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:46,020
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay,

195
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,100
ay, ay, ay, ay, ay,

196
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:48,380
ay, ay, ay.

197
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,220
Oh, damn. Thanks, Ivan.

198
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,040
At last I have control of your radio tubes.

199
00:10:59,220 --> 00:11:00,520
Uh, and I do too.

200
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,980
Good. This is Ren Huat.

201
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:06,000
And this is Stimson J. Catt of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

202
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,340
And you're listening to

203
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,480
the hour of slack.

204
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,280
Keep listening, you idiots.

205
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

206
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:12,820
Else I shall...

207
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:13,560
Kill you!

208
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,060
Ah, the hour of slack.

209
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,240
All I can say is thank Dobbs,

210
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,100
we've got it.

211
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,520
It was the reliable, cheap laughs

212
00:11:22,520 --> 00:11:24,380
that made me first tune in, but

213
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,560
I soon found out that it was

214
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,680
so much more than just a radio show.

215
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,940
In between the gut-splitting

216
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,320
yawks were solid nuggets

217
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,120
of bright subgenius wisdom

218
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,360
to which I clung like an ant

219
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,460
hanging desperately onto a floating

220
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:41,200
matchstick in a clogged,

221
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,000
overflowing, stinking,

222
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,780
crapper.

223
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,360
Oh, with this silly little dog

224
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,560
and prairie squid show,

225
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,040
Stang has taught the Yeti sport

226
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,760
to blow it out our ass.

227
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,360
He gave us the recipe to take

228
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,280
the environmental psycho-venom

229
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,360
of normal life, top it with

230
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,300
our own spew, and hurl that

231
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,260
toxic pie right back into the

232
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,200
face of the con.

233
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,340
And for a thousand times out of the gate,

234
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,720
he has fulfilled his insidious

235
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,060
agenda of keeping

236
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,100
the Einsteins alive.

237
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,580
And every week when we hear that

238
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,680
agglomeration of ranting voices

239
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,340
echoing through the ether,

240
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,620
we know with unassailable

241
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:23,780
certainty that we are

242
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,140
not alone.

243
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,000
And I, for one,

244
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,700
can't thank him enough

245
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,440
for it.

246
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,020
Try getting a laugh out of him after that,

247
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,640
you Dallas street mime.

248
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,520
Friends,

249
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,340
is your day-to-day ridiculous existence

250
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,640
existence at the hands of squealing

251
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:45,960
self-important normals wearing out your stink

252
00:12:45,960 --> 00:12:47,720
dirt? Has the endless stream of

253
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:49,680
Guero, Pander, and Pablum on your TV set

254
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,500
contaminated your precious bodily fluids?

255
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,660
Well, stew no longer in your own bile

256
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,780
because the Church of the Subgenius brings you

257
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,780
the hour of slack self-improvement

258
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,800
course. This series of 1,000

259
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,800
cassettes and compact discs will allow you to

260
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,740
maximize your abnormality potential, eliminating

261
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,840
wasteful guilt from your life and changing you

262
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,380
into a spinning, rampaging example of self-actualization

263
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,760
at the expense of the normie

264
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,400
worms who ruled your life while you

265
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,140
were away.

266
00:13:12,340 --> 00:13:14,300
Let's just see what a few happy users of the

267
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,220
hour of slack self-improvement course have to say.

268
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,540
My brain looks sort of like a smoker's lung.

269
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:20,520
It's not healthy for the children.

270
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:22,560
Would you like another lucky stroke?

271
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:23,660
Don't cry!

272
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,260
All this can be

273
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:28,780
yours today. Just send $13,013

274
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,200
to the hour of slack

275
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,260
self-improvement course.

280
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,520
This is Bugsy

281
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,220
from the Lymphsode Institute in Atlanta.

282
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,080
For the first time I heard the hour of slack

283
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,000
like many was on ass

284
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
and trying to drive a car.

285
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:50,080
Later, while building a large mural out of waffles,

286
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:52,220
the individual, the waffle holes

287
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:54,400
became pixels and the sear

288
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,260
dripped to make Bob's hair

289
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:58,000
and with the insertion of

290
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,120
what I'll call a pipe, but was really more

291
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,880
of an elephant's house.

292
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,920
I said, Bob, and Bob turned to me and said

293
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,220
nothing, because he was really

294
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,040
made of waffles, but thank you Ivan.

295
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,580
I've enjoyed the hour of slack for these many years

296
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:12,260
and I hope to come for years.

297
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,040
This is Doc from the Lymphnode Institute

298
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,140
and the first time I encountered the hour of slack

299
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,400
I smelled like pizza

300
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,280
and I was looking at God

301
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,800
and realized that he had a pipe in his mouth

302
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,720
and I became intensely panicked

303
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,540
and realized that I must

304
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:27,880
surrender to this force

305
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,360
or it would surely kill me

306
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,120
and that's when I knew

307
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,700
I was listening to the hour of slack

308
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,860
on WREK Atlanta.

309
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,140
I like Sheen Ross Buddhism

310
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,320
because it's the world's

311
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,160
kindest religion.

312
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:45,840
It's a branch of Amida Buddhism.

313
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:48,740
Amida was the Buddha of boundless compassion

314
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,320
who refused to enter Nirvana

315
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,980
until all sentient beings could enter with him.

316
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:55,500
So the teaching arose that if you called on him

317
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,900
in Japanese, the name is

318
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,480
Namu Amida Butsu

319
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:00,880
in the name of Amida Buddha,

320
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,060
with true faith you will eventually,

321
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,440
no matter how many incarnations it takes,

322
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:07,160
you'll eventually get rid of all the negativity

323
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,320
and become pure, enlightened.

324
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,560
And Sheen Ron was a reformer who said

325
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,180
that's asking too much of people.

326
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:15,200
Some people are just not capable of true faith.

327
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,160
They have a constantly skeptical and questioning mind.

328
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,260
They should not be banned from release.

329
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,320
He taught that if you say Namu Amida Butsu

330
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,220
whether you believe in it or not, it will work.

331
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,280
I like that.

332
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,560
That's my idea of a religion

333
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,360
that doesn't give anybody a bum trip.

334
00:15:29,520 --> 00:15:30,740
Most religions seem to concentrate

335
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:33,180
on putting people on bum trips, you know.

336
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,160
That's the only religion in the world I know

337
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,800
that never puts you on a bum trip.

338
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,640
If you've said it just once,

339
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,900
and I've said it three times I think in the last,

340
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:41,540
Namu Amida Butsu,

341
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,640
I guarantee, he's like a finance company in reverse.

342
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,360
He wants to give you something for nothing.

343
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:51,600
How can you reject a short-term, interim savior like that?

344
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,340
His only real competition is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

345
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:59,160
Hello brothers and sisters in Slack.

346
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,300
This is Reverend Salatia.

347
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:05,320
And I tune into the Hour of Slack every week,

348
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:08,820
mostly just to hear Reverend Stang say,

349
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,760
Ah, yes.

350
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,340
Dear friends.

351
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:15,420
But in addition to that,

352
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,260
I also like to subscribe to the show

353
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:24,420
because every shit and fuck are sacred in this church,

354
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,480
and to not have those included in my Hour of Slack

355
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,080
just doesn't get me there, you know what I mean?

356
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,060
Bob.

357
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,120
Bob Bob.

358
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:38,780
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob.

359
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:39,840
Bob Bob.

360
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:40,000
Bob.

361
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,040
Bob.

362
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,880
Bob.

363
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,180
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob.

364
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,200
Bob Bob Bob.

365
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,260
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob.

366
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,740
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob.

367
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,100
For over twenty years,

368
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,320
a bastion of idiocy,

369
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,480
a bastion of,

370
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,500
what is that, wax, behind your head?

371
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,980
A bastion of brainiacs.

372
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:03,880
Oh, I see what it is.

373
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,020
It's a little device.

374
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:09,400
I thought it was a piece of candle wax stuck there by some errant being.

375
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:11,740
Oh, yes.

376
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,780
Well, we're going to break here for a minute.

377
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:23,460
There's actually more of those recorded commentations from the Cabbage Gallery.

378
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:33,040
We heard there, we actually, the last person we heard from just before Reverend Salacia was Robert Anton Wilson, Pope Bob.

379
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:39,820
We heard Doc Ellis, O. Rex, Reverend Susie the Flusie, Ren and Stimpy.

380
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:48,880
Lymph Note Institute, St. Pat Paulson, Princess We Are Doe, Norrell Preff, more and all of everything.

381
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:53,200
Father Guido Sarducci coming up, actually, and Dr. Timothy Leary.

382
00:17:53,240 --> 00:18:00,780
But we have letters here, friends, from people who have, oh, an ego plum did the music behind Princess We.

383
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:01,840
I should mention that.

384
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,520
We used to play a lot of ego plum.

385
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,480
We've got, our egos are very plum, aren't they?

386
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:09,820
Your ego is like.

387
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:21,520
Like a big fleshy vegetable that can be plucked off of some sort of two-toed tree that wanders hither and yon, spreading lies and innuendo for 20 years.

388
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:22,580
For 25 years.

389
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:27,400
Saturating the airwaves with Piskama and Wendabar.

390
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,700
Another, with collusion.

391
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:39,360
Collusion with the powers that aren't and confusion with J.R. Slon Dodds.

392
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,840
I mean, the king, the god, the godman, man.

393
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,760
The man with the.

394
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:44,480
Get with it, dude.

395
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,160
Twisted DNA.

396
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,900
Man, woman, man, man, woman.

397
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:50,100
Into more rubber band-like shakes than anyone could imagine.

398
00:18:50,580 --> 00:19:03,900
I want to, I want to read, as we promised, I'm going to read some, we're all going to read some of the mail that came in when we asked for commentations on the hour of a thousand slacks.

399
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:09,820
And this fellow here, this is, we don't know this person, nor is he employed by our members.

400
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,580
Jared, Jared, the lone Yeti in Canada says,

401
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:20,660
I just have to thank, congratulate, and praise you all on the 1,000 episode.

402
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:27,120
I found out about the church when I downloaded and listened to a Frank Zappa interview with Larry King.

403
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:32,840
They mentioned the church for that interview, and the rest is history.

404
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:37,760
I looked up subgenius on the web and found my new faith.

405
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,460
I can't begin to explain how much.

406
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:42,280
Heck, the church brings me in a day.

407
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:51,140
I was unemployed when Bob found me, and wasting away in a slump of bad pills and bad sex.

408
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:57,100
I have since then found a new job where I use Bob's teachings daily.

409
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:04,120
My job is to motivate and teach people how to sell, and we are selling some total crap.

410
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:09,460
And praise Bob, without forcing and trying, I'm making all these pink boys selling.

411
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:13,060
And into it, and I can get the best results out of my peers.

412
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,600
I am fooling those pink boys into thinking I am some sales guru.

413
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:21,160
And all praise due to Bob and the Haas.

414
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,460
Hour of Slack.

415
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:23,500
Hail the Hour of Slack.

416
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:33,140
I want to touch and feel every episode until Wotan takes me away, or the exists come for us.

417
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:39,560
Well, that is quite a fine alacrity, a piece of abnormal growth that is coming right out of the side of you again.

418
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,060
Very much so.

419
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,280
I mean, within your own sight, of course.

420
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:48,240
But this man that, is it a woman, or is it a, what is it that sent this letter in?

421
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,440
That you just read?

422
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:51,220
Oh, that, I won't make it.

423
00:20:51,420 --> 00:20:52,180
I won't make it.

424
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,800
We know only that it was a Yeti.

425
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:54,920
Only as a Yeti.

426
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,480
Okay, shall I read this letter from Ree Stang?

427
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,280
You asked for our comments at the end of the Hour of Slack.

428
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,820
I didn't know, is the Hour of Slack ending?

429
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,040
Oh, anyway, okay.

430
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:07,840
No, no, it's not.

431
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:08,420
Oh, yeah.

432
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,280
Ree Stang.

433
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:09,840


434
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:13,760
You asked for our comments at the end of the Hour of Slack.

435
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,040
I joined the church a few years ago after I knew who I was.

436
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:18,580
No, I'm sorry.

437
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,720
After I knew what it was.

438
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:29,960
But it was clear Bob was TikTok-ing me, talking to me like art through Devo whenever I was asleep or in a cabin.

439
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,680
I'm not going to give away my age or how old I am right now.

440
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,720
I'll wait until later.

441
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,000
We need Bob now more than ever.

442
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:43,500
Mark Mothersbaugh once said that he's an enema for a constipated society.

443
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:53,480
I'm alarmed at the use and the, well, the lack of use and the care of the conspiracy religion are destroying our planet.

444
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:56,600
Those exes can't arrive one minute too soon.

445
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:01,340
I believe the exeans, he calls them the exeans, not the exes.

446
00:22:01,380 --> 00:22:02,440
Oh, that might mean Christians.

447
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,520
That might be shortened.

448
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,500
Yeah, that's the way we shorten, like in Xmas.

449
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,980
The wearers of the crossed hockey shoes.

450
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:20,060
The stick stand to particularly procreate at a deliberately slow rate using only the germs and the vibration method ordained by the Church of Gnome.

451
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,520
I guess they're talking about the Eskimos again.

452
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,140
I hope I'm not reading this wrong.

453
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:30,200
Our ardor grows stronger with each glimpse at his naked thighs.

454
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:37,580
Bob, although we know he's a plastered, white-faced mannequin, is more than an icon.

455
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:43,720
But we're all going to have a last laugh when the saucers come from planet X.

456
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,540
He thinks they're coming from planet X.

457
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,580
That's so cute.

458
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,080
Coming from planet X.

459
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:49,500
They are.

460
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,260
Well, in a fashion, they're coming from there.

461
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,860
There's no location involved in this evacuation.

462
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,700
Right. That's what the news media calls it.

463
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:59,720
Just clear in this place and you're going to be a part of it if you want to.

464
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:02,000
Anyway, can you dig it?

465
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:07,320
In case the saucers and the Church don't have any new address since I moved,

466
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,720
they'll be moved from, shall I say, the state or could he be found there?

467
00:23:11,380 --> 00:23:13,340
Move from pessimania...

468
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,680
Pessimism...

469
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,620
Here it is.

470
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:21,200
Deranged X-Barq, 23-1 Hogan Avenue.

471
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,400
No, you don't need to give the entire...

472
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,720
No, we can move on.

473
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:25,360
New Halcyon and...

474
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,860
We can move on to the next one there.

475
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,420
Yes! Let's move on to the next one.

476
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,340
He's getting clogged up in the internet jargon there.

477
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:31,200
Anyway, keep it up.

478
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:34,220
I guess they're talking about the erectile dysfunction problem there.

479
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,720
Keep it up and keep it happening.

480
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,800
He said it. Close it.

481
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:47,260
And now, here's a letter from Reverend Yukon Jack of WICA in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

482
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,220
All right.

483
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:50,420
Oh, this is a touching one.

484
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:57,760
He says he first heard the word of Bob in December of 1986,

485
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:07,340
when my friend Charles in Garland, Texas, started sending me tapes of the Hour of Slack from KNON.

486
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,880
That's garlic tennis.

487
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:14,080
I started broadcasting it on my station in Pasadena every Sunday afternoon.

488
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:21,340
I began tape correspondence with the Reverend Eris Pagana in summer 1991.

489
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,400
After gaining inspiration from the shows,

490
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,720
I began sending them to...

491
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:31,640
She saw the wisdom of Bob,

492
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,260
and for a brief time, she aired them on WMSE,

493
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,920
a local college station in Milwaukee.

494
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,000
Bob then brought me and Eris together in 1996,

495
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:48,260
and the broadcasts on WICA began and continue to this day.

496
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:53,480
Eris and I shared several great times at X-Day Drills in Brushwood,

497
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,200
where we ran WBOB radio.

498
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,680
At the drill,

499
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,500
in 2000,

500
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,180
Bob brought Eris and Reverend DJ together,

501
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:07,200
and they were married by the Reverend Stang himself in May 2002.

502
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,120
Although Eris is no longer on this plane,

503
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:14,860
I know that she has achieved eternal slack with Bob and Connie.

504
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,840
Bob helped all three of us realize our life's long-term dreams.

505
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,200
It can surely be said that anything is possible with Bob.

506
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,840
Have mercy and praise Bob and hail Connie!

507
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:26,940
Oh, yes, yes.

508
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,420
It's amazing that these people who have donated so much of their extra sweat

509
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:35,360
and any other glandular juices they can create...

510
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:35,580
People, yeah, people, sure.

511
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,080
That's right.

512
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,900
I was just going to say, are they as such,

513
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,120
or are they just perhaps a projection of you know what?

514
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,700
But, you know, they do sweat,

515
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:46,760
and they put a lot of it into sending their feelings, their thoughts, their doubts...

516
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:47,460
I can whiff it.

517
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:47,820
Perhaps...

518
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,800
I can whiff it from here.

519
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,960
You've been down with it for at least four...

520
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:51,400
I've been whiffing it.

521
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:56,620
And you've been indeed without it for quite some time.

522
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,260
Anyway...

523
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:57,740
Okay.

524
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,160
Oh, that's enough of these letters.

525
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,600
Let's skip over to these.

526
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,120
We'll come back to the letters in a minute.

527
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,760
We'll go back to the tapes.

528
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:07,500
I believe this is the hideous, deformed Artemia Salina.

529
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,900
I'd just like to thank her for vibrating so hard.

530
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:10,980
That's all.

531
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,200
Slimy peck.

532
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:13,620
Oh, there we go.

533
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:13,940
Okay.

534
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:18,060
Hello, Reverend Stang and listeners of Hour of Slack.

535
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,280
This is Artemia Salina.

536
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:24,840
I just wanted to say congratulations on your 1,000th show.

537
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,740
And to those who have been listening since...

538
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,000
the first show, I wish you a swift recovery.

539
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,820
And now a word of explanation about my voice,

540
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,920
which some of you may have found to be a bit unusual.

541
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:41,400
You see, several years ago, I was involved in an unfortunate accident

542
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:45,760
in which a large quantity of hydrocarboplast-geoclase acid

543
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,220
was spilled into a container of sulfurodiglaic dimethylhydrobromocrustoside.

544
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,580
The combination of these two otherwise inert chemicals caused a reaction,

545
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,320
which was quite violent indeed.

546
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:02,240
Though I am a man of science, the accident not only destroyed my voice books,

547
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:07,780
but it also damaged the part of my brain that makes me want to seek qualified medical attention.

548
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:12,620
Instead I sought the services of Dr. Newmonet, who has a recurring advert

549
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:15,080
from the local bargain hunter's periodical.

550
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:20,320
Dr. Newmonet offered to cobble together a cheaply made electronic voice books for me,

551
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:23,720
in exchange for my eternal soul and the cost of materials.

552
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,960
This offer was too irresistible to refuse,

553
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:27,740
and too expensive.

554
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,080
To this day it is my only means of audible speech.

555
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,080
Once again however, I wish to extend my congratulations

556
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:37,780
to you for not fucking burning out after all this time.

557
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:39,580
Bob?

558
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,120
Hello Bob, this is Father Guido Saraducci,

559
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,580
formerly Pope Maurice of the People's Catholic Church,

560
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,640
and all of my fellow popes from the People's Catholic Church.

561
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,680
Salute to the Church of the Sabbath Genius.

562
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:52,760
Carry on.

563
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,340
The hour of life will ha-

564
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,260
over your own eyes

565
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,800
so that if you expected the hour of life

566
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:57,720
your mind would be on a-

567
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:57,940
slide

568
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,580
so that you never shut

569
00:27:58,580 --> 00:27:59,160
the hour of slack

570
00:27:59,160 --> 00:27:59,780
is a deadly danger

571
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,240
so that it's absolutely

572
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:00,460
un-

573
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:00,800
getting there

574
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:01,140
to violently

575
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:01,600
with us

576
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,180
the hour of slack

577
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,780
may cause your toddler

578
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:03,280
who never before

579
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,060
to suddenly disrobe

580
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:04,680
and run down the street

581
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:04,860
screaming

582
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:05,440
locust locust

583
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,100
the hour of slack

584
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,420
is the response

585
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:06,840
for the time you pay

586
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:07,340
all your head

587
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:07,820
for all share

588
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,500
the hour of slack

589
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,040
is fully open

590
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,640
white lab rat

591
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:10,120
the hour of slack

592
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:10,820
is no longer for you

593
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,700
just running your goody

594
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,400
Hello, this is Timothy Larry,

595
00:28:15,660 --> 00:28:18,340
reminding you that just as you need slack,

596
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:21,740
KNON needs your help.

597
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,420
Send in those pledges,

598
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,060
and praise Bob.

599
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:25,920
Hey!

600
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:38,620
Bob?

601
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:42,600
Bob?

602
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:42,900


603
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:43,300


604
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:44,360
Bob?

605
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:44,360


606
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:44,360


607
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:44,360


608
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:44,360


609
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:44,360


610
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,860
The message is now part of

611
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,080
and registered in your

612
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,220
subconscious mind.

613
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,400
This is Mr.

614
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:55,900
This is Mr.

615
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:55,900


616
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:08,440
So this is my previews to let white folks and followers watch Chris Paul and watch them

617
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:16,040
on the spot themselves if they can't find a person free.

618
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,400
Hello brothers and sisters in Slack, this is Reverend Salatia.

619
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:32,640
Tune into the Hour of Slack every week, mostly just to hear Fernanda Dandy-Lemur say,

620
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,020
You rang?

621
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,040
Don't cry.

622
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:36,500
Okay, girl.

623
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:37,560
Don't cry.

624
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,700
Free baseball.

625
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:45,820
Oh yes, dear friends.

626
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,660
This is Li Liqing, the Chinese subgenius.

627
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,760
And you are listening to the Hour of Slack.

628
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,240
Remember.

629
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:57,300
Bob is a comrade of all people.

630
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:03,280
Here in China, just like in America, people need Slack.

631
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,580
In Chinese, we call Slack Liu Tian Tai.

632
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:13,320
But it must be true Slack, not the bad Slack of the conspirators.

633
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,760
Hi, this is Pat Paulson.

634
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,760
I'd like to endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election.

635
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:20,620
Bob's a lot of, well, he's not fun.

636
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:23,640
But anyway, this is the Hour of Slack in Dallas, Texas.

637
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,580
And I'm wearing my shoes.

638
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:28,000
I've got cow stuff on them.

639
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,560
J.R. Dobbs.

640
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,740
Bob Dobbs.

641
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:35,340
J.R. Bob Dobbs was on the number one list of frauds and phonies for Time Magazine.

642
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:36,680
And I didn't know who he was.

643
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,100
Exactly.

644
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:41,060
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is the creator of the Church of the Subgenius.

645
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,100
This guy, the Reverend Ivan Stang, is one of their...

646
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,580
Disciples.

647
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:46,580
Disciples.

648
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:47,360
Disciples.

649
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:48,280
Yeah.

650
00:30:48,460 --> 00:30:49,040
All right.

651
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:49,700
You know, it's funny.

652
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,440
I don't think Jesus had a disciple named Dopey.

653
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,640
Poor Bob.

654
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,360
Hi, this is Bob from Hack House.

655
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,040
Greeting you in the name of Bob.

656
00:30:58,080 --> 00:30:59,940
Partly on behalf of Voice of Bob.

657
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:07,560
I'd like to share with you a little bit of the story of how I got involved with Bob the Communist against the Nazis.

658
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:09,560
And that's exactly what happened.

659
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,540
And that's Bob.

660
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:16,220
He marks the beginning of something in my heart.

661
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,660
When he stripped in front of all these men red-hot pokers, put in his body for me.

662
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,860
And I would certainly like to come.

663
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:23,960
And I would certainly like to come.

664
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,600
Just go to persecution.com.

665
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:28,960
Persecution.com.

666
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,360
Let them know you're coming.

667
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,200
For I was hungry and you gave me pot.

668
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,500
I was thirsty and you gave me a hole.

669
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,800
I was a stranger.

670
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,920
I was naked and you did it to me.

671
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,420
Persecution.com.

672
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,700
It's a vital form of physical relief.

673
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,080
I'm normally here to sell you.

674
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,740
The government wanting to get even.

675
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,960
Well, that's all for today, my friends.

676
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:50,360
Reverend Shane Smoker.

677
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,800
And quite frankly, the only reason why I listen to this show,

678
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,280
is to hear the,

679
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,540
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah.

680
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,200
See, I can't even bloody do it.

681
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,900
But hell, I think it's bloody funny.

682
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,680
Um, a thousand shows.

683
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,260
Well, stangy.

684
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:05,680
Stang.

685
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:08,300
Dave and Princess Wee.

686
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:09,920
Congratulations.

687
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,200
Bloody, con-gradu- bloody-lations.

688
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,160
And, uh, praise Bob.

689
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,300
And, uh,

690
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:24,320
I really couldn't put my thought into this, did I?

691
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:27,600
I mean, this is quite a, um, a milestone.

692
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,200
Um,

693
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:37,940
Still not a minute, though.

694
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,240
So, I'm just gonna, uh,

695
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,180
Oh, man.

696
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,740
Oh yeah, oh yeah.

697
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,140
I'm such an idiot.

698
00:32:49,140 --> 00:32:49,360
I'm such an idiot.

699
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,900
Hello, brothers and sisters in Slack.

700
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,920
This is Reverend Salacia.

701
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,140
And I tune into the Hour of Slack every week.

702
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:03,660
Mostly, just to hear Reverend Stang say,

703
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,920
Superior mutants,

704
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,960
repent, quit your job, Slack.

705
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:14,520
The world ends tomorrow, and you may die.

706
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,800
But in addition to that,

707
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,420
I also like to subscribe to the

708
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:19,880
PR News

709
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:20,800
because, um,

710
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:22,180

711
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:23,220

Cowboy

714
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,860
are sacred in this church.

715
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:31,940
And to not have those included in my Hour of Slack

716
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:34,540
just doesn't get me there, if you know what I mean.

717
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,120
So, uh,

718
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:39,800
Sit down, don't sit down, but at least set your dogs to find them.

719
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,120
I'm finding it difficult to breathe.

720
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:46,620
There's a subgenius Saturday night for ya.

721
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,460
And I say, as long as you're alive,

722
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:54,840
shout, make noise, or whatever,

723
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:57,660
because we're dead.

724
00:33:57,940 --> 00:34:00,440
You shut up like hell.

725
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,740
Just a while, that's probably far.

726
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:04,800
The oozing sauce,

727
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:07,520
the minions of the Hour of Slack

728
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:09,940
luring their way towards the moss.

729
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,060
Hoping against hope,

730
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:15,180
they can get one fatal glimpse of the man himself,

731
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:16,900
the resin f-

732
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:17,500
the rev-

733
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,580
Let me get this right.

734
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,160
The Reverend Horace Smith-

735
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
Oh, no, Ivan Sting

736
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:25,600
of the Church of the Subgenius,

737
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,420
the Procreative Cultmeister

738
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:30,780
of the Religion of Bob.

739
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:32,120
J.R.

740
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:33,580
Robert.

741
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,100
J.R.

742
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:35,800
Bob.

743
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:37,680
Dobbs.

744
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,360
A man who

745
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,200
is more than a man, he's

746
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:43,260
part humor, part

747
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:45,000
boomer, part boomer,

748
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,100
and part s-

749
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,320
s-

750
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:46,540
t-

751
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:47,220
boomer,

752
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:47,900
a-

753
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:47,940
m-

754
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:48,200
ah.

755
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,820
and all the peoples of the world

756
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,480
shall someday rise up and

757
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,060
shout his name and

758
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:54,780
be as

759
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,140
disappointed as that little slack-luster girl laying in the gucker.

760
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,080
Now I can tell things are gonna change.

761
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,060
But hey,

762
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:05,020
enough of that.

763
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:05,960
Yeah.

764
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,180
I'd like to read another now if I may,

765
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:12,360
should I not now.

766
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:22,800
This singing in the background, this is the voice of Mr. Fernanda Nande Lee Murr.

767
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,680
This is him actually singing the...

768
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:35,760
When you listen to a man like this, you know he's more than a softie.

769
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,560
He is a true...

770
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,180
Man, that is really, that's just amazing, friends.

771
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:45,000
Made the skin on my crawls go off.

772
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:46,720
Bob just wants to have fun.

773
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,800
Like dog fun.

774
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:51,540
That's Mark Mothersbaugh plays here in the background.

775
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,720
Duck fat.

776
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,420
Bob's just want to have fun.

777
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:04,260
Bob's just want to have fun.

778
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:09,600
These are offerings of, not worship, what should we call them? Offerings of...

779
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,540
Offerings...

780
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,840
Of humility.

781
00:36:13,180 --> 00:36:13,600
Of what?

782
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,720
Towards what has...

783
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,600
Of offing.

784
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,520
Offing might be in the offing.

785
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:20,180
Offing of all pinks of the planet Earth.

786
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:22,500
But with love in our hearts, you know.

787
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:28,220
We're not like blind milkmen wearing pancake makeup looking like so many mannequins packing out,

788
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,980
passing a little carnations for Bob.

789
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,500
No, we are...

790
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:31,460
Well, we're sort of like that.

791
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:33,180
We are the red carnation for Bob.

792
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:36,940
And as we raise our fist in the air, we're usually clutching at our own foreskins.

793
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,240
And we're not convinced yet, but we still believe in slack.

794
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,900
Any form of slack, given or...

795
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:44,420
Misgiven-ish.

796
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,040
The best thing there is.

797
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:46,700
I'm sorry, I...

798
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:47,560
That's beautiful.

799
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,620
I could go on for...

800
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:48,840
That's beautiful.

801
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,600
I thought you were reading that from some letter that I'd handed you.

802
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:55,600
I thought you wanted me to cut it short as like a bad bowel movement, and so I did.

803
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,080
I was cutting it short?

804
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,280
Well, you looked at me and I thought, Dave, will you wrap it up, please?

805
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:01,320
We've got to get on to...

806
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,860
Oh, no, I just looked at you.

807
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,300
I was looking at you in puzzlement, like, where'd that all come from?

808
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:05,920
Well, first...

809
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:09,900
Don't you have a letter there from another reverend?

810
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:11,100
They get a different reverend?

811
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:11,680
Yeah, right.

812
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,420
It's a piece of...

813
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:14,180
Gaggies comes all the way from Sydney.

814
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,540
No, that sounds too cocky, doesn't it?

815
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,280
Anyway, I'll try it.

816
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:18,620
I'll try it.

817
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:19,260
Sounds good.

818
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:19,840
Good.

819
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:26,680
Lamer Cabo Dave, Princess Wee, Susie the Floozy, and all the dry web cockamamie bleebers

820
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,360
down at WCSB.

821
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:32,500
Thank you for all the slack.

822
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,400
No, that's...

823
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,640
I've gone to all the way...

824
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:35,860
It's fine, it's fine.

825
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,260
Keep going, keep going.

826
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:37,920
Keep going, keep going.

827
00:37:38,020 --> 00:37:38,240
Hold on.

828
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,380
His name's Reverend Chain Smacker.

829
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,160
And he's a dildo do-rangy from Down Ender.

830
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,420
You sure talk funny.

831
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:55,780
The Hour of Slack ministry is probably one of the best places to hear some of the best collages,

832
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,980
stunning satire.

833
00:37:58,360 --> 00:37:59,600
Can you believe it?

834
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,000
Stunning satire.

835
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:05,560
And sound hilarity.

836
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,760
Sound hilarity.

837
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,600
Okay.

838
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:11,560
The Hour of Slack is something to behold.

839
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,240
I don't know how he's ever seen it before.

840
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:17,460
It takes place on the audio frequencies of your inner ear.

841
00:38:18,820 --> 00:38:21,760
It has hidden messages and meanings.

842
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,540
No commercialism.

843
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,420
Any heyday anky-panky of the right-wing enlighteners.

844
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,680
And what's this?

845
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:31,600
The Akashic Records.

846
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,520
To anyone.

847
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:37,220
And it's perfect with white wine and a bag of cheese.

848
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,540
Well, I guess that's more of a newsreel.

849
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:43,820
New Zealand is somewhere on in there.

850
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:45,640
Boy, you got me.

851
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:46,900
That's beautiful.

852
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:47,520
Well, I have many times before.

853
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,600
Well, Princess, do you have another letter from a reader?

854
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,460
Well, yes, I do.

855
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,400
I have another letter.

856
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:55,320
It's from a Charlie Fulton.

857
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,980
I'm going to pull the so-so daughter down in the background.

858
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,240
This letter says,

859
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:02,340
Greetings, Reverend Stang.

860
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:08,460
Just wanted to say that I've been listening to and enjoying The Hour of Slack

861
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:10,200
since episode 836.

862
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:11,140
Thank you.

863
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:11,540
Thank you.

864
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:11,540


865
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:11,540


866
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:11,540


867
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:11,540


868
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:11,540


869
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:11,540


870
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:11,540


871
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:11,540


872
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:11,540


873
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:11,540


874
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:11,540


875
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:11,540


876
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,180
I always enjoy listening to LeMire's cut-ups,

877
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,540
the banter of ESO Swamp Radio,

878
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,500
while I miss hearing Professor Chaz Smith.

879
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,440
It's always great to hear Lonesome Cowboy Dave

880
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,520
and great segments from Reverend Susie the Floozy

881
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:27,520
and the Puzzling Evidence Show.

882
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,800
The Hour of Slack is one of the biggest reasons that I have DSL,

883
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:36,380
since none of the pink stations where I live carry the show.

884
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:41,140
Happily, my job allows me to keep a picture of Bob at my cubicle.

885
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,540
Thank you.

886
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:45,140
So I can keep some small semblance of slack in the office.

887
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,860
Praise Bob.

888
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:50,660
That's from Charlie Fulton in Chico, California.

889
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:52,060
Thanks, Charlie.

890
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,500
Especially from a guy with a disease, you know,

891
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,540
wasting all his hard urine, squids, and his urine,

892
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:03,020
to send a letter through all the problems that you can get through sending a letter.

893
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:04,400
Just to express that.

894
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,860
I mean, the guy's got DSL for cripes almighty.

895
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,500
And you know, that can be nearly so flashy.

896
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,540
Anyway, I was going to say,

897
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:14,560
that this is not an anti-local phenomenon.

898
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:18,700
It's a post-procreative inclusive web phenomenon,

899
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,920
meaning that you could catch it on your foot.

900
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:24,320
You could see it somewhere, like on the back gangly,

901
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,880
that are connected to your inner eye and so forth.

902
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,340
When we talk about the web, we're talking about the webbing in your body.

903
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:34,520
So I just want to say that Don Velo is not the real name of Dr.

904
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,320
I mean, Father Guido Sarducci,

905
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:39,940
but he was actually born in Ashtabula.

906
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,540
And he was born in Ashtabula.

907
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:43,360
He was a graduate of Lorraine High School.

908
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:46,260
And he was a friend of Dave Sheridan,

909
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,940
who was a fabulous furry,

910
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,480
her shoot brothers.

911
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,160
History, friends.

912
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,000
Yes, history.

913
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:56,140
Long years of ancient, deadly history.

914
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,240
And for all those times and years,

915
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,860
everyone has been a defletchly for your beloved cockamamie organism.

916
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:05,920
Cockamamie.

917
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:07,960
Cockamamie.

918
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:08,600
Cockamamie.

919
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:10,940
Cockamamie.

920
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:12,600
Cockamamie.

921
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:13,900
Cockamamie.

922
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:14,680
Cockamamie.

923
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:15,640
Cockamamie.

924
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:20,420
That's Mark Mothersbaugh jamming away in the background in the early 80s

925
00:41:20,420 --> 00:41:24,220
when he first got his Fairlight synthesizer, friends.

926
00:41:24,340 --> 00:41:25,220
And maybe I should...

927
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:30,540
I do have another letter and some more tapes to play,

928
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:35,880
but, you know, I should do the shout-out, as we planned,

929
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,560
to all the station's friends that play the hour of slack,

930
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,700
that make this possible,

931
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:47,960
that make us do this, that force us to devolve into this every week.

932
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,860
Like a bleeding goat.

933
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:55,760
We have, first, the ones that keep us on the internet, friends,

934
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:02,280
sensoryresearch.com or .net or .org.

935
00:42:02,320 --> 00:42:05,780
Sensory Research is how it keeps us going.

936
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,380
Radio For All is another group.

937
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:14,140
And, you know, Reverend Prostata Kontata was the person who first set us up

938
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:17,680
streaming MP3s to begin with.

939
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,120
And, friends, I don't know what we would have done without the great

940
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:24,620
Saint David Bachner up there in Canada.

941
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:30,160
Bachner was the one who turned it into internet streaming for years and years and years.

942
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:33,160
Only recently have I taken that job upon myself.

943
00:42:33,220 --> 00:42:37,560
Before David Bachner, there was the great Reverend Juan Derrer.

944
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:43,240
And, friends, in the early days, of course,

945
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:47,500
who was it that first gazed at that picture of Bob with me and said,

946
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,380
let's work for this guy?

947
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:51,960
Dr. Philo Drummond, friends.

948
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:59,700
The overman, the original overman for whom we owe our knowledge of the Boblige-ness.

949
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:05,460
We must thank Mr. Opinion and George Nolan of the ancient KFJZ stations in Dallas

950
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:07,660
who were the first people to put us on the radio.

951
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:08,360
Actually, it was Philo.

952
00:43:08,380 --> 00:43:13,000
And where would the Hour of Slack be without Puzzling Evidence?

953
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:18,420
Puzzling Evidence, who had actually the first subgenius radio show predating Hour of Slack,

954
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:24,520
started in like 1982 with Bob Nelson's show, which Puzzling Evidence took over.

955
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:29,620
And, friends, Puzzling Evidence is where we learned how to do the weird editing that we do, many of us.

956
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:33,980
Glass Madness was the friend of Puzzling Evidence who had singing talent.

957
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,120
Lies.

958
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:38,160
St. Palmer Vreedys was a part of the show.

959
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:43,240
And big part then, as was the great St. Gary Gubrode friend.

960
00:43:43,360 --> 00:43:50,200
And, of course, to this day, where would any hour of anything be without Dr. Howell?

961
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:51,860
Yes, Dr. Howell Robbins.

962
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:59,160
And, lately, the good K-Rob, all together with Philo and Wellman on the KPFA show.

963
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:05,620
And, friends, Reverend Susie the Flucy, the woman who invented sex.

964
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,400
Uh, on WREK.

965
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:08,200
WREK.

966
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:08,740
Atlanta.

967
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,400
Byron Werner.

968
00:44:10,420 --> 00:44:11,720
St. Byron Werner.

969
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,180
He was the first media barrages.

970
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:18,640
And he actually invented the phrase Space Age Bachelor Pad.

971
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:22,580
Doctors for Bob from Little Rock, Arkansas,

972
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:30,720
seminally inseminated the very concept of doctor music and head launchings.

973
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:38,220
Hell, Pope Huey was the first person to play our horrible tapes on the radio and contributed to them.

974
00:44:38,380 --> 00:44:42,360
K-N-O-N in Dallas, at one time, was a great station.

975
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,980
And that's where we started in October 1985.

976
00:44:48,020 --> 00:44:49,540
With Ranger Rita.

977
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:52,580
And even the help of Buck Naked.

978
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:59,140
The title, Hour of Slack, is based on a little one-half-sheet newsletter called Hour of Slack.

979
00:44:59,260 --> 00:44:59,520
Actually.

980
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:03,780
That Buck Naked once did before he was saved by a different religion.

981
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:05,660
Written on a chestmark then, wasn't it?

982
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:07,600
It was entirely written on a chestmark then.

983
00:45:07,660 --> 00:45:08,180
I've heard.

984
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:16,940
Friends, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy is the voice you hear saying the title of the show almost every week.

985
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:19,260
And he's actually the source of the celebrities.

986
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:21,540
He gave us those celebrities.

987
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:28,260
Reverend Erwin Chusid had us on WFMU in New Jersey for so long.

988
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:28,840
It was important.

989
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:36,360
Dr. Phineas Narco has always been a huge contributor and help to this show and the California show.

990
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:37,160
Jesus!

991
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:38,160
Jesus!

992
00:45:38,380 --> 00:45:43,440
Devil Aqua has kept the subgenius foundation going in our darkest days.

993
00:45:43,620 --> 00:45:50,820
And Mr. Fernanda Nandy Lee Murr is what makes the Hour of Slack sound like the Hour of Slack these days.

994
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:56,080
As somewhat similarly does the work of the great Norrell Preff.

995
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,940
And other old doc binary slack great men.

996
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:05,060
Such as Artemia Salina, Heart Ignition, and New Monet.

997
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,960
Can we forget Dr. Sinister?

998
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:10,520
Of WCSB in Cleveland.

999
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,020
The great station.

1000
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,640
Who lets us call in and wreck his show.

1001
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:17,620
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1002
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:19,680
The ESO show with Chaz Smith.

1003
00:46:19,940 --> 00:46:22,700
Put us on the air all through the 90s.

1004
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,780
And let us do the sloppy stuff.

1005
00:46:25,180 --> 00:46:27,840
How else would we know of the Oye Man?

1006
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:30,660
Friends, we must thank so many contributors.

1007
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:32,240
The El Queso All Stars.

1008
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,980
Dr. Onan Canabite in the old days.

1009
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,600
Pope David N. Meyer.

1010
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:37,800
Brother Cleve Duncan.

1011
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:39,180
Michael Pepe.

1012
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:40,840
Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

1013
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:41,900
D.K. Jones.

1014
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:43,440
Papa Joe Mama.

1015
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:44,720
Dr. Legume.

1016
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:47,540
Ed Strange had a subgenius show and helped a lot.

1017
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:49,280
Craig Roll also did.

1018
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,280
Friends, Deet and the bands.

1019
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:53,740
The great bands of the Hour of Slack.

1020
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:57,180
Starting with Doctors for Bob and Doctors for Wotan.

1021
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:58,860
Followed shortly by Devo.

1022
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,540
The Amino Acids.

1023
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:01,400
Negative Land.

1024
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,700
Little Theodore.

1025
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:04,780
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1026
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:07,680
The great King of Slack, Bill T. Miller.

1027
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:08,840
Saint Anne.

1028
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,320
And friends, the Swingin' Love Corpses.

1029
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:16,680
And Dave, I think that you might remember an old comedy group that's probably we might

1030
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,900
want to give a tip of the hat to while we're doing our Slack credits by the name of the

1031
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:21,740
Firesign Theatre.

1032
00:47:21,860 --> 00:47:22,480
Indeed, indeed.

1033
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:24,700
The Firesign Theatre has pointed the way.

1034
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:28,040
I don't think you and me would be in this room right now if it wasn't for the Firesign

1035
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:28,320
Theatre.

1036
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,740
I don't think we could have an erection if it wasn't for the Firesign Theatre, which

1037
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:35,360
is taking up all the spaces on this bus there are.

1038
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:37,860
And so that's why we're kind of just...

1039
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:37,940
Friends.

1040
00:47:37,940 --> 00:47:41,300
Some of you think, oh, they must have heard some Monty Python.

1041
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,560
No, no, no.

1042
00:47:42,600 --> 00:47:44,360
Monty Python was much, much, much later.

1043
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:46,040
They might have heard some Goon Show.

1044
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:47,440
Well, we might have, but we didn't.

1045
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,560
I had the Goon Show.

1046
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,160
What we heard was the Firesign Theatre.

1047
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:53,320
Praise Reverend David Ostman.

1048
00:47:53,400 --> 00:47:53,960
Yes, dear friend.

1049
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:59,820
Phil Proctor, Phil Austin, and Peter Bergman.

1050
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:02,740
David Ostman.

1051
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,800
Oh, that was Devo doing the music in the background.

1052
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:07,560
And before that, I think it was Onan Canobite.

1053
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:07,720
No.

1054
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,560
Now it's Onan Canobite.

1055
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,120
Friends, the stations, the stations who's helped us out.

1056
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:18,420
Did I get around to the new station, WQFS in Greensboro, North Carolina.

1057
00:48:18,580 --> 00:48:26,060
The great longtime players, WEFT in Champaign, Illinois.

1058
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:28,880
Gotta teach you how to make a lot of money on real estate.

1059
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:35,640
Friends, believe it or not, in deep in Connecticut, WHUS plays the show because they dare.

1060
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:40,380
WICA, WICA in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

1061
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:49,100
WMPG in Portland, Maine has played the hour of slack for nigh on to as long as WCSB here in Cleveland has.

1062
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:49,840
And they keep on going.

1063
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,360
For like 10, 15 years.

1064
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,420
On that MPG, they keep going.

1065
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,300
And thanks to Reverend Mike Townsend who put us on there.

1066
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:01,640
In WCSB, I think it was originally first Reverend Toth Wilder got us on to that other WRUH.

1067
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:03,920
And then Mike Cole.

1068
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:05,620
Reverend Mike Cole.

1069
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:06,900
Mike Cole helped keep us on.

1070
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,800
And Reverend Craig Callender.

1071
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:09,340
Yes.

1072
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:11,340
We must thank all of these folks.

1073
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,360
Praise Toth Wilder, Mike Cole, and Craig Callender.

1074
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:22,400
Out in Madison, Wisconsin, Sister Velveteen Sly on WORT has kept this show going.

1075
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:28,700
And friends, WREK at Georgia Tech in Atlanta not only plays the hour of slack,

1076
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:33,480
has the Susie the Floozy Show, the Lymph Note Institute Show.

1077
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:34,880
Friends, let us.

1078
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:35,500
We won.

1079
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:36,100
Would we be?

1080
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:43,600
The South shall rise again with the help of WREK as well as WUTS in Sewanee, Tennessee.

1081
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,420
The fig tree's burning, Earl.

1082
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:49,000
WXEY in Kendallville, Indiana.

1083
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:53,040
And friends, let's not leave out KPFA in Berkeley.

1084
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,300
They don't play the hour of slack.

1085
00:49:54,420 --> 00:49:56,540
They play the Puzzling Evidence Show.

1086
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,140
And we love them.

1087
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:04,960
And we love our subscribers who get the cuss-filled uncensored internet shows.

1088
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:06,580
We love you all.

1089
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:07,400
We love you all.

1090
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:07,400


1091
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:07,400


1092
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:13,760
Reverend Crossin, Reverend Penton, Salacia, Cindy, Reverend Bill, Ely.

1093
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,480
Friends, the hour of slack thanks you all.

1094
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:23,560
We have done 1,000 billion years of hours because of you and this.

1095
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,660
This Dave.

1096
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:30,440
Think how many seconds have gone by since you first listened to the hour of slack.

1097
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:34,800
Now relax the cinctar muscle slowly, starting with the windpipe,

1098
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:35,620
moving down.

1099
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,220
Down through the navel, our sculata.

1100
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:40,500
Up to the furniture and out the window.

1101
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:47,440
Think of yourself as a magnificent pigeon willing to fit your fortune and pit your willingness

1102
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:51,080
and your fortune against odds and their self.

1103
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:52,700
Did I say that right?

1104
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:53,180
Odds.

1105
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:54,760
It's against the odds.

1106
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:56,860
Think of yourself that way.

1107
00:50:56,980 --> 00:50:59,600
Now drift slowly into a dream.

1108
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:01,780
A dream of your own creation.

1109
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,240
A huge...

1110
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:05,620
Man, that flying saucy.

1111
00:51:05,640 --> 00:51:06,220
Those figures I'd call the

1112
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:06,480
barrel.

1113
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:19,360
It was a dramatic dream.

1114
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:32,280
Think how many seconds you have coffee to wait a minute.

1115
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,400
thought. Yeah, when you think of it, nanoseconds,

1116
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,200
how long have we been...

1117
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,400
We never got out of here, man.

1118
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,240
I mean, you know, relatively.

1119
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:41,440
It's the show that refused

1120
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,080
to die.

1121
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,160
That's about it. You about got that right.

1122
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:48,120
Friends, let me

1123
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:49,700
read this one last...

1124
00:51:49,700 --> 00:51:52,340
Actually, we have all kinds of filthy commentary

1125
00:51:52,340 --> 00:51:53,920
that I could read. We got letters

1126
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:56,120
that weren't exactly about the hour of

1127
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:58,040
slack. Well, you can just indicate the word

1128
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,040
without actually slurring out the dirty word

1129
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,480
for the bad seven thing.

1130
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,600
This guy really gave me

1131
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,280
a reach around.

1132
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:07,560
This is someone named

1133
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:08,700
Mathael.

1134
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,420
Mathael? Yes, who said...

1135
00:52:11,420 --> 00:52:13,620
I think the M and the R on his

1136
00:52:13,620 --> 00:52:15,020
keyboard were screwed up.

1137
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:17,780
Maybe. You're like the famous painter Mathael.

1138
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,480
With the swinging love

1139
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,340
corpses in the background, Mathael

1140
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,000
typed,

1141
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:25,220
I appreciate that the subgenius church

1142
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:27,140
makes a point of having people

1143
00:52:27,140 --> 00:52:29,420
own their own truth.

1144
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,200
Congratulations!

1145
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,020
Congratulations on creating language

1146
00:52:33,020 --> 00:52:35,040
that bypasses the filters

1147
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:37,240
people have that fool them into

1148
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,820
thinking they understand something

1149
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:41,280
just because they know a word

1150
00:52:41,280 --> 00:52:42,000
for it.

1151
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:44,880
Bob, slack, the conspiracy,

1152
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,480
yakutism, these are all useful terms

1153
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,140
because although people may not

1154
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:51,260
understand them, then they at least

1155
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,000
know that they don't.

1156
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:55,340
Unlike God, grace,

1157
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:57,260
etc., which most people have been fooled

1158
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,340
into thinking they understand,

1159
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,620
fresh terms help

1160
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:01,460
with a new...

1161
00:53:01,480 --> 00:53:03,300
view of ancient concepts.

1162
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:04,980
And, uh,

1163
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,100
he happens to like the...

1164
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:08,660
his favorite ones are the ones where

1165
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:10,400
Stang rants and reads

1166
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,440
from other tripped out writings.

1167
00:53:13,740 --> 00:53:15,300
I have Revelation X

1168
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,980
and find it amazingly insightful

1169
00:53:16,980 --> 00:53:18,480
and well articulated.

1170
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,020
Um, let's see.

1171
00:53:22,020 --> 00:53:23,460
I like the old

1172
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:25,300
subgenius recordings where it sounds

1173
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,400
like the terminology has been freshly

1174
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:29,220
created and I can hear the

1175
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:31,040
tenderness and love in the

1176
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,700
subgenius apostles' voices.

1177
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,780
Those would be the old tapes, I guess.

1178
00:53:34,860 --> 00:53:36,900
I would like to learn more about the

1179
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:39,060
experiences, group trips, etc.,

1180
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,660
that led to the articulation

1181
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,560
of church doctrine.

1182
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,080
What would he want to know?

1183
00:53:45,740 --> 00:53:46,880
Mainstream religions

1184
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,000
preach love but practice hate,

1185
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:50,940
worship bohemian prophets

1186
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,580
but enforce dress codes,

1187
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:54,820
and claim to own the whole truth

1188
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,780
but have virtually no living truth

1189
00:53:56,780 --> 00:53:59,020
remaining. The subgenius church

1190
00:53:59,020 --> 00:54:00,780
preaches hate, worships a

1191
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,820
clean-shaven idiot, and gives

1192
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,560
the surface appearance of nonsense

1193
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,760
yet triggers loving

1194
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:08,960
truth to arise from within.

1195
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:10,760
It's amazing

1196
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,840
to me the cleverness with which

1197
00:54:12,840 --> 00:54:15,160
sensitive souls have learned to thrive

1198
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:16,900
in a hostile world.

1199
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,960
Thanks for providing

1200
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,000
and exemplifying true slack.

1201
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,900
Oh, P.S. I had a dream that

1202
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:24,900
Ivan Stang is a reincarnation

1203
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:27,040
of an early influential Gnostic

1204
00:54:27,040 --> 00:54:29,000
and a truly profound

1205
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:29,840
soul.

1206
00:54:30,860 --> 00:54:32,480
Oh, that's a good note.

1207
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:33,380
Oh, boy.

1208
00:54:34,720 --> 00:54:36,560
I told you. I told you.

1209
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:38,180
That guy gave me quite a reach around.

1210
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:40,620
Stan, what is that dripping from

1211
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:41,040
your...

1212
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:44,420
Is that blood dripping

1213
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:45,140
from your goatee?

1214
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:48,240
You said it was a reach around.

1215
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,020
You said you didn't have to actually

1216
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:52,520
chew on his organs for crying out

1217
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:54,440
loud. What a strange man,

1218
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:56,540
too. I offer him kudos for his

1219
00:54:56,540 --> 00:54:58,540
praise of the church and his 20 years in

1220
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:59,560
business.

1221
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:00,520
How ridiculous.

1222
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:03,460
This one I had assigned for you to read

1223
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:04,620
when I first read the hour's...

1224
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:06,520
Oh, I don't go for the uterine devices.

1225
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:08,940
Only the gonococcal

1226
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:11,600
devibrators can be used

1227
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,600
this time. Anyway, at least until the 4th.

1228
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:15,500
Not of July, of course,

1229
00:55:15,580 --> 00:55:17,620
but, you know, the 4th of encumbrance,

1230
00:55:17,900 --> 00:55:19,660
which is coming for all of us pretty soon.

1231
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:21,560
Here's

1232
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:23,340
the gesticles.

1233
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:25,620
Oh, this was done by the gesticles

1234
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:26,700
in Australia.

1235
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:29,260
There's a bobby on the clothesline

1236
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:30,760
and a kitten on the grill.

1237
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:33,240
There's dog poop on the table,

1238
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,300
but I cannot eat my fill.

1239
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,540
There's a blank spot in my

1240
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,240
stink tank that says

1241
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,940
reserved for pamphlet one.

1242
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:43,600
I'd love to shove it in there verily

1243
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:45,360
because it sure does sound like fun.

1244
00:55:46,020 --> 00:55:47,420
Send me slack or

1245
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,340
plonk me. It's the only thing to do.

1246
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:51,260
I do not own a credit card,

1247
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:52,900
but I want to join with you.

1248
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,280
I've lived with Bob for years now,

1249
00:55:55,380 --> 00:55:56,760
had a picture on my dash.

1250
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,840
It was there until it faded and my

1251
00:55:58,840 --> 00:56:00,080
car was not but trash.

1252
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,500
I've touched myself to Connie

1253
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:04,680
and received a nasty rash.

1254
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,840
Now I've finally gotten around to it

1255
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,060
and offered up some cash.

1256
00:56:08,460 --> 00:56:10,600
And he did. He did, in fact.

1257
00:56:10,860 --> 00:56:12,080
Was it currency

1258
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:14,220
that you can actually use?

1259
00:56:14,420 --> 00:56:15,920
I mean, the coin of the realm,

1260
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,720
a lot of times you like to send

1261
00:56:18,740 --> 00:56:20,840
monopolistic money, poetry money.

1262
00:56:21,180 --> 00:56:22,860
Sometimes they'll just send like a

1263
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:24,160
zygote on a tissue.

1264
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:26,300
Well, not a real zygote, a bloody zygote.

1265
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,680
Here's a good one. This one comes from a different...

1266
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:30,640
This guy writes, sends stuff from a different...

1267
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:31,940
A different address each time.

1268
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,640
...excluded inflation, perhaps. I don't know.

1269
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:35,360
This comes from a person that says,

1270
00:56:35,580 --> 00:56:37,020
you know I know you.

1271
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,060
Dear Bob.

1272
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:39,940
Now listen to this.

1273
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:40,700
Okay, I'm listening.

1274
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,740
Dear Bob, you broke my leg.

1275
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:44,260
You gave me hype.

1276
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,920
After the restaurant tantrum went down,

1277
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:49,860
you gave me an address, told me to meet you there.

1278
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,160
I came to meet you. There were two guys,

1279
00:56:52,300 --> 00:56:55,580
one girl looking over I-5

1280
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,000
south of Beacon Hill.

1281
00:56:57,180 --> 00:56:59,100
The same two guys from the restaurant.

1282
00:56:59,180 --> 00:57:00,180
One girl.

1283
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:00,760
They asked me...

1284
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:00,760


1285
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:01,560
They asked me into the house.

1286
00:57:01,680 --> 00:57:02,500
I said, no thanks.

1287
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,360
The tall guy looked like an altar boy.

1288
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,600
Said, nice bike, 66 BMW.

1289
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:07,700
Let me take a ride.

1290
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:08,400
I said, no.

1291
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,660
He then said, well, give me a ride.

1292
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,640
He was six foot three inches tall.

1293
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,380
Jumped on my bike, grabbed my...

1294
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:16,280
and squeezed hard as he could.

1295
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:18,240
Humped me five or six times.

1296
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,180
I had let him try on my jacket.

1297
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:20,980
It was too small.

1298
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,520
He stretched himself into it.

1299
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,920
After the ride, the three of them were around me.

1300
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:25,840
I said I had to go.

1301
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:29,320
When I got home, I had black and blue marks on me for a week.

1302
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:34,980
I lost my father at 16 years old.

1303
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,520
And I know you have no children.

1304
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,360
I'm adopting you as my father, Bob.

1305
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,020
And I will be your son.

1306
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,520
The son you always wanted.

1307
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,940
When you were a little boy,

1308
00:57:44,020 --> 00:57:46,500
did some red-haired guy screw you over?

1309
00:57:46,580 --> 00:57:49,000
I forgive you, Reverend James Doyle.

1310
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,320
Boy, that sounds...

1311
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:52,020
They call it Beacon Hill

1312
00:57:52,020 --> 00:57:54,840
because of the strange beaming beacons

1313
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,760
that are going into the minds of the people

1314
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,360
in the restaurants.

1315
00:57:57,460 --> 00:57:58,880
And we actually know,

1316
00:57:59,320 --> 00:58:00,460
some of the subhumans,

1317
00:58:00,460 --> 00:58:02,020
we're not going to call them subgeniuses

1318
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,680
in this particular instance,

1319
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,020
who were at the bottom of Beacon Hill

1320
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:07,940
waiting to spank him and torture him

1321
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:10,500
with a 1966 tricycle.

1322
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:12,080
It was not really even a bike.

1323
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,020
If only we could stop, Bob.

1324
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:14,920
My mind is going.

1325
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:16,720
Well, this guy is so far gone.

1326
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:19,460
The actual tissue in his brain,

1327
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:20,460
near the corpus callosum,

1328
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:21,780
is decomposing.

1329
00:58:21,900 --> 00:58:24,100
And it's, you know, like practically brain dead

1330
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,600
and nobody told him yet.

1331
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:26,280
Yeah, no, no, no.

1332
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:28,200
I'm not saying it's not great stuff.

1333
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:29,860
And we love his appurtenance

1334
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,100
and also his apertures,

1335
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,360
but we can't fit in there.

1336
00:58:32,540 --> 00:58:33,460
You know what I'm saying?

1337
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,440
You got to send your...

1338
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,700
You got to pay your pledge money, friends.

1339
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:37,320
That's all it is.

1340
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:39,880
Now, friends, we got to move on and move out.

1341
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:43,260
So I'm going to go back to the tape recordings

1342
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,920
of the live subgeniuses

1343
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:47,140
as they tell us their love, love, love.

1344
00:58:47,740 --> 00:58:50,060
Because their mind is going,

1345
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:53,120
a swinging love corpse goes out in the background.

1346
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:55,460
And it is the...

1347
00:58:55,960 --> 00:58:57,520
Lee Murr will help us.

1348
00:58:57,620 --> 00:58:58,080
Thank you.

1349
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,540
The Church of the Subgenius

1350
00:58:59,540 --> 00:59:02,740
for 20 years of misdirection,

1351
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,180
lies, squandering,

1352
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:07,360
insominance,

1353
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:08,420
insomniac,

1354
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:09,880
insomniac.

1355
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,460
Stop.

1356
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:16,420
My mind is going.

1357
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:20,240
My mind is going.

1358
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:21,140
Stop.

1359
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,860
My mind is going.

1360
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,700
My mind is going.

1361
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:52,840
Yes.

1362
00:59:52,840 --> 00:59:59,920
Now, take notes for 20 seconds.

1363
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,520
You're wasting your time.

1364
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:00,720


1365
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:04,520
And I was trying to record during theierten 2 hours

1366
01:00:04,520 --> 01:00:05,140
performance every day of each week like a child.

1367
01:00:05,140 --> 01:00:06,240
You added switch,

1368
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:09,660
did you lit the switch for two minutes of each week?

1369
01:00:09,680 --> 01:00:11,820
Do you want to request your rights collected?

1370
01:00:11,820 --> 01:00:14,340
I don't like it.

1371
01:00:17,640 --> 01:00:19,140
What should we do.

1372
01:00:19,140 --> 01:00:22,680
Why don't you put each number и the power of the church down?

1373
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:22,680


1374
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:22,680


1375
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:38,160
听到一个起来小时,我就可以过一个星期的生活,在粉红色的世界保存我的精神。

1376
01:00:41,620 --> 01:00:44,420
谢谢我们的美国装置朋友,谢谢。

1377
01:01:11,720 --> 01:01:14,520
谢谢我们的美国装置朋友,谢谢。
