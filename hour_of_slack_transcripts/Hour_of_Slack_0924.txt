Remember, people watch the line of drinking to make sure you have alcohol and fire on every level of your home.
Remember, if someone in your household smokes or is under the influence of fire, you must be aware of Ontario.
Remember, I'm a dangerous drinker.
Remember, there's more to responsible drinking than alcohol and fire on every level of your home.
Remember.
Hour of Slack.
Uh, yes dear friends, for about six months I've been collecting sounds for an Hour of Slack special on the subject of pagans and also the Starwood Neopagan Festival.
This is not that show.
For I swear.
I'm not done with it.
Yet it must be perfect.
And also I'm working on some videos.
And so this Hour of Slack number 924 will be a rerun, but not of an Hour of Slack, but of Bob's Slacktime Funhouse from Lymphnode Institute on WREK Atlanta.
Greatest of all college stations.
Press company excluded.
Oh.
Oh.
And so on from there, on the subject, which relates to pagans and the Neopagan festivals, which is fire...
Lymphnode Institute does fire.
By the way, the music in the background here is by Automattic Robot Fish.
Also known as Rev. Angry Larry.
And now, Lymphnode Institute.
Institute.
This time it really is Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.
The Lymphnode Institute Edition.
You are listening to 91.1 FM, WREK Atlanta.
The student voice of Georgia Tech.
Fire.
You can't yell fire in a movie theater.
Well, you can, but people will be upset with you and possibly take you to jail.
They had big fires in the country recently.
Yes, they did.
And we don't call that terrorism.
I'm a lot more afraid of a 100,000 acre forest fire than I am of airplanes getting me.
Really?
Yeah.
That's not what the media would have us believe.
No, it's not.
They certainly downplay the natural disasters and upplay the external invaders.
And who's to say who sparked that up?
It's fairly easy to start a fire.
Fire wants to live.
Now, which fire?
Any of them.
Well, there's the Indian who set one, and then there's the brokenhearted gal who set the other.
Right.
But then there was a fire in South Georgia.
There was one going in Oregon.
I think one in Utah.
In your frock of yellow.
I look swell, but you look sweller, setting the woods on fire.
We're taking all the honky-tonks.
Tonight we're having fun.
We'll show the folks a brand new dance that never has been done.
I don't care who thinks we're silly.
You be daffy and I'll be dilly.
We'll order up two bowls of chili, setting the woods on fire.
Soed room or table fun for me.



Oh do I in the fang, try it.

In a wood plane.
Bring the


Eat that piece of wheat.
Almost.
Well, that's about enough.

I'll gas up my hot rod stoker
We'll get hotter than a poker
You'll be broke but I'll be broker
Tonight they're setting the woods on fire
We'll set close to one another
Up one street and down the other
We'll have a time, old brother
Setting the woods on fire
We'll put aside a little time
To fix a flat or two
My tires and cubes are doing fine
But the air is showing through
You clap hands and I'll start bowing
We'll do all the laws allowing
Tomorrow I'll be right back plowing
Setting the woods on fire
So if there's no fire in space
because it's a vacuum,
what's the deal with stars?
I know it's a big nuclear furnace,
but it's not strictly fire then, is it?
Well, yeah, it's a nuclear fire.
But it's in the middle of a vacuum.
Which is odd.
That's pretty damn weird.
It's pretty damn weird.
They're engines, I guess, of a sort.
Chemical.
A combustion engine.
Sure.
They're burning their own resources.
Mm-hmm.
That's why they would have
a vacuum.
They would eventually deplete
and become a red dwarf,
which is a funny show.
I want to start a fire
on the space station.
Think of the news stories.
Hey, well, those pure oxygen environments
are made for fire.
It's not pure oxygen.
No, but it was
when those crispy critters
got cooked up in that capsule.
Gus Grissom, I think,
and a couple other guys
got a million miles of wire
or whatever running through
a space capsule
and they were in a pressurized
100% oxygen thing.
What were they doing in there?
You don't hang out in a...
It seemed like a good idea
at the time.
Well, yeah, for a buzz.
Well, no, but they were
in their suitcases.
What's the point?
Why would they do that?
It's so volatile.
That's an excellent question.
The variety of the
therapeutic experience.
Colleagues, let us ponder
the nature of fire.
It is the cleanest animal
and it is one of the least wasteful,
consuming everything that it touches
and reducing it to its elements.
It is an altruistic creature,
releasing atoms and molecules
back to their basic forms,
free and orderly,
floating through existence.
Of course, there are some
who would argue that fire
does not live.
I believe you should all
at this point know
how I feel about arguing.
But does it not move,
crawling inexorably
towards its next meal?
Does it not breathe air,
hungrily lapping
at the gases that sustain it?
Given the right circumstances,
a flame can manifest
a sort of spontaneous generation,
growing from a minuscule hot spot
to a giant conflagration.
And there is no denying
that this voracious predator
reproduces as its first order of existence.
Anyone who has ever seen
a beautiful specimen feed
on some inanimate matter
knows this.
Fire is the first animal
that Homo Saps ever trapped and contained
in a symbiotic relationship.
The Homo Saps got plenty of warmth
and the fire got plenty to eat.
The prestige of such an audacious animal

was that it was able to







This act, taming the untameable fire,
secured Homo Sap's position
of central maw in the food web.
The other creatures respected this
and many of Homo Sap's main competitors
soon entered into similar contracts.
Fire is one of the few animals
that exists on every continent,
even Antarctica.
Especially Antarctica.
One can assume,
without his best buddy fire in tow,
Homo Sap wouldn't have made much of a run of it
out on the ice caps.
Have I mentioned that it cleans as it eats?
Sadly,
even a noble strain
such as this
has its one fatal flaw.
Much like the pink scum,
it cannot or will not
control its own growth.
A single flame,
given enough to breathe and enough to eat,
will soon expand to consume
all available resources as quickly as possible,
leading to, of course, burnout.
Ah,
but twice as bright lives half as long.
There's almost a parable here.
Ha ha ha ha ha!

They're good, they're mad.
T-k-t-c-i-e-p-r.
There's something psychological,
psychologically wrong with you.
I mean, nobody I ever knew
in my entire life dreams about fire
practically every night.
Why not?
Fun!
Ha ha ha!
I just don't want anything to happen to the doorbell transformer.
Well, take it off.
Then everybody could knock on the door.
I've been meaning to go up there and get that thing.
The week might come along.
The darn thing is on all the time.
There are a lot of household fires on Christmas from those stupid damn lights.
Some ridiculous amount of household fires begin in your dryer, your clothes dryer,
when you don't clean the lint trap.
I didn't know that.
Well, you have to clean your lint trap, and it's right there when you get your clothes out.
Go ahead and people, clean your lint trap.
Clean the lint trap.
Live forever.
And I was lying in the grass by a river.
And as I lay, the grass turned to sand, and the river turned to a sea.
And suddenly the sea burst into flames, and the sand was burning.
And I breathed in, and there was smoke in my lungs, and there was fire in my brain.
And I looked around me, and there were all these shapes being sucked into the flames.
And they were writhing and trying to escape.
And I knew.
And I knew that I had to get out.
And I looked above me, and I saw a shape that was smiling down at me and beckoning, saying,
Come on home!
And I raised myself, and I tried to get out of the flames.
And I was getting higher, and higher, and higher, and higher.
And I reached out.
I reached out towards the shape.
And as I reached out, the shape shattered.
And my hands were empty.
And I was falling.
I was falling, falling, falling.
And I was falling.
I was falling into the flames.
And I knew that I was going to burn.
I was going to burn.
Oh, it's so hot in here.
Let me out.
Please.
I am the God of Hellfire.
And I bring you...
Fire!

You've been living like a little girl
In the middle of your little world
Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you
You've been a piece of luck
Now's your time to burn
You're like a fallen fortune for me
Like you
I'm gonna find a true world
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire
Let's get the fire, get the fire, get the fire
And you'll be in the middle
You're gonna burn
Liar, liar, pants on.
Whoa.
A traveling salesman is driving through a rural area between stops when his car breaks down just as night is falling.
The only sign of humanity for miles is an old farmhouse.
The salesman wearily lugs his briefcase to the front door and knocks.
The door is answered by an old farmer who eyes the salesman suspiciously.
The salesman explains his situation and the farmer warms to him, telling him that the only garage in the area is already closed, but he's welcome to stay the night.
Upon entering the small house, the man is bombarded by the smell of delicious food.
The farmer mentions that they are about to eat and tells the salesman to have a seat at the table.
Assuming that the farmer lives with his old wife, he is flabbergasted when dinner is brought in by the farmer's three beautiful daughters, all dressed like Daisy Duke.
They eat in silence, the salesman eyeing the daughters as they get up every few minutes and return with another course of the scrumptious meal.
After everyone is stuffed, the farmer pulls out his pipe and, lighting it, asks the salesman just exactly what he wants.



The farmer says exactly what it is he sells.
The salesman leans forward with a wolfish grin on his face.
Well, I'm glad you asked that, he says.
I am selling that which is your birthright, but which you deny yourself.
And I'd love to give you all a sample.
Well that I have to see, says the farmer as he leans forward.
The salesman opens his briefcase, whips out a pistol, and shoots the farmer and his daughters dead before they know what's happening.
Thumbing the bulge in his pants, the salesman eyes the three fresh, nubile corpses and says,
And now, my darlings, we shall all taste of the sour fruit of true love.
And promptly drops dead from the poison in this food.
The embers of tobacco in the farmer's pipe ignite the carpet on fire, which soon catches to the rest of the house, and the five of them all return to the commons together.
So what's the deal with the devil being a wolf?
The devil is a man associated with fire.
It's not the way the Norse had it.
They had hell with one L, and it was really cold.
Because they were Vikings, and it's really cold there.
And Dante took a page out of that when he wrote the Inferno.
The ninth circle where the real baddy-bads go.
It's really true.
Like Warhead, the sowers of discord.
It's very cold. Frozen.
And the worse you were, the further in ice you're frozen.
And then the devil's in the middle, like a three-headed cake topping.
They must all crave oblivion.
What's done with it? What's done with it?
Thirty families are homeless in fires.
Alarm fire.
Police said...
Come on, open the soap ducats.
Sure, who cares when you are through?
How do you know this?
Total twenty-three.
Fire. Factory that he was nowhere near.
It smoldered.
But it's now total...

Twenty-three are killed. Five...
I was in the toilet.

The White House got burned down.
Yes, it did. Don't try this
at home, but apparently somebody
burned the White House. The British. The Brits burned
the White House. Our good friends, the British.
But what about British humans? I don't see us bombing
them. Well, no, we're not going to bomb the Brits
because we've already seen that they can withstand
the best that bombing has to offer. Back then.
We're not going to nuke the Brits.
We love their comedy.
All of our men secretly pine for their
attractive women because the voices
make them that much better.
It's a fire in the heart.
It's a fire in the heart.

My old flame
My new lovers all seem so tame
They won't even let me strangle them
For I haven't met a girl
So magnificent or elegant
As my old flame
I've met so many who had fascinating ways
A fascinating gaze in their eye
I saw this eye
So I removed the other eye
That eye that kept winking and blinking at other men
It was me
Some who took me up to the skies
But their attempts at love
Were only imitations of
My old flame
My new lovers all seem so tame

I can't even think of her name
What was her name?
Doris, Laura, Chloe, Manny, Moe, Jack
No, it couldn't have been Moe
I can't stand it, I tell you
This is driving me sane
She would always treat me mean
So I poured a can of gasoline
And struck a match to
Woo!

It ended in the fire
That started with a look
I fell for you, baby
Like a bomb
Now my love's gone
Up in flames
Up in flames
My head is full of smoke
Heart full of pain
That tender love is gone
Gone up in flames
You should have shot me, baby
My life is gone
My life is done
You could have shot me, baby
Shot me with a gun
I hear those sirens
Scream my name
I know that I'm not alone
Now my love is gone
Gone up in flames

And even Revelation X,
the cover of Revelation X,
which is the second real subgenius book
that wasn't short stories,
is covered in fire.
Computer-generated fire,
which is, I think,
hard for people to do.
Fire and water seem to be
really difficult for computers to fake.
Well, to make them look natural, yeah,
because they behave randomly
and computers just can't
dig on that.
Technically, a computer
wouldn't be able to see fire, I guess.
You know, it would see
the different fluctuations
in temperature.
It's all light waves
or whatever to it.
Right.
Infrared fire kicks ass.
I've never seen infrared fire.
Well, me neither.
It's impossible to see,
but apparently it kicks ass.
Really?
Who said?
You know.
They.
People.
Yeah, people.
The voices.
Billy Joel didn't start the fire.
It was always burning
since the world's been turning.
That sounds like a lame alibi to me.
Well, he went to treatment,
so maybe he's got
a better excuse now.
Well, there's smoke.
There's fire.
Whoa.
You can't smoke your frap
without a little fire, people,
so get down and worship
the fire like everyone else used to.
I could worship fire.
Yeah.
The sun.
No hot meals unless I pay tribute
to the burning red stuff.
Fire good.
So, fire good?
Fire good.
Fire good.
And even a Viking funeral,
the final respect you can pay
to the Viking's corpse,
its leavings,
is to burn it away.
Watch the smoke rise
up to the gods.
Fire may be good,
but human beings
and even, you know,
Yeti hybrids
are made of mostly water,
which doesn't tend to go so well
with fire.

And it is a firing
Bound by love's desire
I've been to a ring of fire
And I went down, down, down
Into a burning ring of fire

And the flames are skinning iron
And it burned, burned, burned

Of love is sweet
And it burns, burns, burns

When hearts

Fire is the devil's only friend.
Who said that?
Don McLean.
I think it's pretty significant that many hell situations are imagined as being fiery,
brimstone-y, burning, volcano-y.
We really fear volcanoes.
One is moral, one is not.
It's super ego and it bought.
Well, it bought.
Now that we're in Hawaii, I hope you don't choose to embarrass me here, too.
Come on, get out of my way.
I need to get laid.
That wasn't funny at the airport, either.
Now, are you going to sit down and enjoy the luau or not?
You know very well that I can't sit.
Are you making fun of me?
Don't put a chip on your shoulder there.
Get it, chip robot.
I think you are making fun of me.
Of course I'm not.
I'm just happy.
I want the pig.
The pig is for everyone.
I will not share.
The pig will be mine.
I'm cutting you off.
I'm sick of this.
I can't take you anywhere.
Move these damn foreigners out of my way.
Move, move, move.
Now, it bought.
This is a foreign country.
We're all foreigners here.
Nom, nom, nom.
It bought.
Nom, nom, nom.
That's it.
This is the last time.
You, me, edge of the volcano, now.
All right, super ego, have it your way.
Just carry me safely to the lip of the volcano.
Meanwhile, the top of the volcano.
Ah, you have had this coming for years.
Mom always liked you better.
I'm sick of this.
I'm a robot personification of your id.
You made me vomit all over my prom date.
You turned me into a cybernetic organism.
You made me gain 50 pounds when I broke my leg and started smoking pot.
Ah, ah, you never lubricate me properly.
I built you.
You have a point.
I do.
Let's not fight.
No.
Ah, I tricked you.
Oh.
Ah.
One is moral, one is not.
It's super ego and it bought.
You know, you can get fired from your job.
Why do they call it that?
Do they?
Because it's like getting executed and when you get executed, they take fire.
Those bastards.
Do you think that's like an old nautical thing?
When you get kicked off the ship, they stuffed you in the cannon and fired you off?
No.
No?
Those pirates could be pretty frisky.
Yeah, I know, but if you're on a boat in the middle of the ocean and somebody says anything
about fire, it better be heating beans and that's about it.
I mean, you're at a wood boat.
Yeah, but you're surrounded by water.
What's the problem?
The lack of the boat after it's consumed by the fire?
Well, then you can just ride the fire to safety.
You know, if you could solidify fire, much like you solidify water into ice.
Uh-huh.
If you could freeze fire.
Yes.
But have it maintain its molecular thing.
Well, it would have to stop moving.
Fire is sort of an illusion.
Well, it's light play, but it's heat slash light play.
Yeah, which is kick ass.
Mm-hmm.
You'd have to freeze it instantaneously and I mean, no give or take because it would go
out.
But, you know, the fire is sort of defined by...
By the chemical reaction of what happens to carbon when it heats up or what happens
to anything when it heats up too much.
Sure, sure.
It starts to disintegrate.
Fire is pure anarchy.
