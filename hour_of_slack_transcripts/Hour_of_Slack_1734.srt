1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:06,980
Vomit and then retchings.

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,260
At first that seemed like soul fun.

3
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:14,480
The self genius power of smirk.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,860
The agony will continue for one hour.

5
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:23,640
Oh, who would have believed it?

6
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:27,960
Who would have dreamed that the aliens live right next door in the next trailer?

7
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:29,900
What will they be talking about?

8
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:31,760
What plans for the future of mankind?

9
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,200
Will it be conspiracy or brotherhood?

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,760
Well, seeker, we're about to find out.

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,760
This is the weirdest thing I've ever seen.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:40,920
Oh, my God.

13
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,620
They've gone into the bedroom.

14
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:44,560
They've been screwing us for a long time.

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,800
Hey, look, I'm a super intelligent being.

16
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,960
My understanding is I have an IQ of 1600.

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,200
And I can't even understand what you expected from that relationship.

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,720
I'm so young.

19
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,460
Not from around.

20
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:02,040
Here, but a real square little fella.

21
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,800
Oh, come now.

22
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,040
We've been through so much together.

23
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,220
Just call me Bob.

24
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,080
Bob!

25
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:16,060
On July 12th, I took a trip in a flying saucer, which I am pointing right here.

26
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:23,780
The saucer was well equipped with rooms, bedrooms, bathroom, toilets.

27
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,000
And this saucer.

28
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,860
This saucer.

29
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:35,800
I went up into Mars, over the moon, Venus, Clarion, and Orion.

30
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,000
When I say Orion, I do not mean Orion.

31
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:43,760
It is a planet outside of our galaxy.

32
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:46,300
So I thought I saw a UFO once.

33
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:46,640
Really?

34
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,820
Yeah, but I had taken a lot of mescal at the time, so I don't know.

35
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,220
Well, that will do it to you.

36
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,420
Yeah, I was down in Mexico.

37
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:53,760
I was with my English professor.

38
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,580
We were having an affair and he was married.

39
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,860
It was really terrible.

40
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:57,840
You thought you saw a UFO?

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,740
Yeah, we both, we really thought we did.

42
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,440
Well, I mean, it's just, it's a delusion.

43
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,760
Well, I won't go into any further details, but she had a very interesting experience

44
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,900
that she'd never remembered before.

45
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,140
The numbers who have had contacts with these aliens, how has it affected their lives?

46
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:19,160
They very often have a religious kind of conversion, although not of a formal sort.

47
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,700
They're good people and they've generally been influenced in good ways, maybe.

48
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:24,640
So naive.

49
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,400
And there are some people who've got glimpses of it, perhaps.

50
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,960
And they yin for something like that.

51
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,960
They're looking for the family that maybe in some vague way they've known about.

52
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:37,200
They join cult groups.

53
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,700
Friends, there's a force that runs through the universe.

54
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,760
We used to call that force God.

55
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,900
We now call it the Church of the Subgenius.

56
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,840
And Bob.

57
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,020
And Bob.

58
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:57,380
They check the systems through and they read the books.

59
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,380


60
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:57,380


61
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,240
And they find

62
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,240


63
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:11,660
It's got some really crazy dividends, shut-eye readings, like, text messages.

64
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:11,660


65
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,100
Some days it takes a week, a week, five days and not long enough to call the police.

66
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,100


67
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:14,100


68
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:16,100
Like, stick your teeth to it and see that cow.

69
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,720
When one takes a step back, another takes another.

70
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:21,780
You see things have happened several times.

71
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,180
There's this idea of gravity helping you.

72
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:23,860
You see it taking turns and jumping around.

73
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:26,440
You can hear vision, worried as the range of the expected people with you cannot turn

74
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:26,980
forward, not only your memory, seeing welcome's like the spectrum's likes, this kind of

75
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:30,500
system economy. Excuse me? I'm an occult nutritionist.

76
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,780
I think mind control has been over-emphasized.

77
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,860
See, if you were a truly benevolent alien and didn't want to invade Earth,

78
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:42,820
you'd also hold off delving into a person and making them do things that

79
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,460
they're supposed to do.

80
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,720
Sort of like the crime directors in Star Trek. Stupid!

81
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:51,320
Stupid! You humans. You've mentioned that there are many people who have been influenced

82
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,760
by the extraterrestrials and are not even aware

83
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:59,240
of it, but some things like the movies we see, the TV shows,

84
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:01,640
you think there may be some influences there?

85
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:05,840
I have a friend who's a writer in Hollywood. He told me when he was 21 years old,

86
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,540
he was crossing an outed desert, and a UFO swooped down over his car and saw it zooming

87
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,960
away into the sky and kept on driving. Nothing happened.

88
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,440
After that, his life took a different turn.

89
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,400
He became more serious, and he had a goal in life.

90
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,320
And that little boy, whom nobody liked,

91
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,080
grew up to be Roy Cohn.

92
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:27,500
Wow!

93
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,920
And now you know the rest of the story.

94
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,440
You've identified at least two distinct groups of aliens.

95
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,180
There's not more than two groups, but you could put them in two camps.

96
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:37,580
Okay.

97
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,840
Now, Camp One have just recently arrived, doing their investigations from Square One.

98
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,620
So, Camp Two have been around a long time.

99
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:52,320
They're also the ones that induce a feeling of friendliness in the part of the people they pick up.

100
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:52,760
Mm-hmm.

101
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,740
We were picked up on a desert, in California desert, and I was taken to the mothership,

102
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:01,960
and they were flowing around, not too close to the moon, but with instruments.

103
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,880
Similarly, you might say, except it wasn't a camera, it was really sort of a telescopic instrument,

104
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:11,320
that we were able to see what was on the moon on the other side of us. See?

105
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,400
It looked like this.

106
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,940
Burn it! Get it to hell!

107
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:19,560
The people think of themselves as being picked up by old friends.

108
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,660
Came crawling out of a well, wearing ladies shoes.

109
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,720
Didn't know what milk was.

110
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:29,720
Real little, smooth like baby's feet, with big friendly eyes.

111
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,880
He sounds like a real nice guy.

112
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,400
Took him to the Swiss picnic for a good time, and he choked to death on a piece of cheese.

113
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:37,600
Yeah.

114
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,280
Yeah.

115
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,680
Right.

116
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,460
Now, of course, this may be a psychological manipulation, but so what?

117
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:45,620
It's nice to have them do that kind of psychological manipulation.

118
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,080
Yeah.

119
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:49,960
There are three extraterrestrials of humanoid Caucasian appearance.

120
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,400
The leader is male, about 31, 62.

121
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:52,640
Ooh!

122
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:56,320
190 pounds, pallid complexion, lank, greasy hair.

123
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:04,160
The second is of indeterminate sex, 28, 5'10, 145 pounds, short, dark hair, pale skin.

124
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,320
The female is 26, looks younger.

125
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:10,820
She has a delicate complexion and excellent bone structure.

126
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,920
Her eyes are hazel, flecked with gray, and sometimes a little sag.

127
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,760
Her voice is throaty, hands exquisite, and she's said to have a certain indefinable something.

128
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:21,420
Ah!

129
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,600
They were highly intelligent.

130
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,940
Highly intelligent and potentially dangerous.

131
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,520
Highly intelligent!

132
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:26,460
We'll be going back to England for on-the-spot interviews.

133
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,240
Highly intelligent!

134
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:27,900
And continuous...

135
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:28,560
You've got it wrong!

136
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,140
Throughout the night.

137
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:29,700
They've got it wrong!

138
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,640
They've got it wrong!

139
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,280
They've got it wrong!

140
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:31,360
They've got it wrong!

141
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,400
They have been dealing with the, what you would call, the real smart aliens, not the ones who have just been here recently and are kind of bum-dling.

142
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,700
Here comes something.

143
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,600
Remember the story when newlyweds on our way to Earth capital...

144
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:48,980
No, Shazbut.

145
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:51,420
I don't wish to dwell on technical matters.

146
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:58,780
But these visitors from outer space, they are what we scientists call brainless.

147
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,380
Brainless?

148
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:00,560
Brainless.

149
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,200
They're thick, stupid, dumb-dumbs, crubs, twits, morons...

150
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,980
...who don't invoke a very good amnesia.

151
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:11,500
Graduate students from Alpha Centauri on their first mission, isn't it?

152
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:11,920
That's right.

153
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,500
They're still doing their PhD thesis on planet Earth.

154
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,000
Uh-huh.

155
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:18,160
No one could have guessed what was inside.

156
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,440
Hey, look, they're drinking tea.

157
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,980
Hey, look, it's on TV.

158
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,480
Turn on and see, two worlds collide.

159
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,300
We're morons.

160
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,040
Welcome to our pressure dome.

161
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,920
Welcome to our mobile home.

162
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:32,080
Up in the sky.

163
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,520
We're morons.

164
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,040
People say we've gone too far.

165
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,100
But we don't know where we are and we don't know why.

166
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,900
We're not far away.

167
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,440
The really smart ones, you'll never know.

168
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,340
They dreaded anything to do with them.

169
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,140
Perhaps there are some people who've heard them.

170
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,440
They have this kind of contact themselves and may or may not know about it.

171
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,580
What would be some of the characteristics?

172
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,700
Well, a person who has been fascinated with no particularly good reason.

173
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:01,360
Been fascinated with UFOs, science fiction, Star Trek.

174
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,880
Has a psychic streak in him.

175
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,700
And has fallen in love absolutely without any good reason with someone.

176
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,460
And then finds afterwards he has also had an interest in UFOs and psychic things.

177
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:16,240
Now, not any one of these things, or not all of them are necessary.

178
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,080
But you can find a little profile there.

179
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,500
Vwing, vwing, vwing.

180
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,780
Stateless wonders.

181
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:31,640
UFO and its followers, perverts, monomaniacs, dipsomaniacs, artists of the fast buck.

182
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:38,140
True believers, objective believers, new age believers, kiho believers.

183
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:43,300
Shushed by the three men or masturbated by spacemen.

184
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,700
UFO is a bucket of shit.

185
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,160
That's the title.

186
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:53,740
And I sit here writing while it drips down my face in great rivulet.

187
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,200
I'm going to be very disappointed if UFOs turn out to be nothing more than visitors from another planet.

188
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,140
Because I think they could be something much more interesting.

189
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:07,420
Something from another dimension of space or time.

190
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:14,380
I think what the UFO phenomenon is teaching us is that we don't understand time and space.

191
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:19,900
I think we have to call them objects that are physical, that interact with the environment,

192
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:24,960
that cause effects on the witnesses, on the psychology and the physiology of the witnesses,

193
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:30,500
and leave traces on the ground, and yet are capable of, appear to be capable of manipulating

194
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:35,160
time and space in ways that go beyond what our physics understands today.

195
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:43,260
The Air Force investigated UFOs and issued a report, couched in polite language, which translated,

196
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,300
means...

197
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,500
Now, let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover-up.

198
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,880
We'd like to ask you some questions, if that's all right.

199
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,620
Be my guest.

200
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,340
Good.

201
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,940
Let's start with this idea of light travel, shall we?

202
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:58,540
What can you tell us about that?

203
00:09:59,120 --> 00:09:59,860
Absolutely nothing.

204
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:05,140
If I told you you'd blow yourselves up, or worse, someone else, you'd be surprised how

205
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,400
much energy is in a beam of light.

206
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:11,680
Well then, maybe you could show us how this light travel works.

207
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,420
You humans.

208
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:13,900
I travel light.

209
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,420
Don't believe it?

210
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,160
Well, listen to this.

211
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:22,400
Come here, now.

212
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:22,960
Right now.

213
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,020
Watch the lights here.

214
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:30,700
Well, first I thought it was a big old dog, of course, the way it howled and how it had

215
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:31,800
them big friendly eyes.

216
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:38,520
But I had to ask myself what the hell it was doing up in the graveyard, digging up the

217
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:39,940
ground with a shovel.

218
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,480
I thought I was crazy.

219
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:42,400
I'm not a drinking man, I'm not a drinker.

220
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,400


221
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,400


222
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,400


223
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,400


224
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,400


225
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,400


226
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,400


227
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,400


228
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,400


229
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,400


230
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:42,400


231
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,780
I'm a man on duty, Mr. Cox, not me.

232
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,860
You know, I figured it was one of them werewolves or something, so I slipped a wooden load in

233
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,000
my shotgun, and then all of a sudden, now this is going to sound crazy, a big dark thing

234
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:57,760
with flashing lights come up over the top of the hill.

235
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:58,760
That one right over there.

236
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,400
It was about 100 miles an hour.

237
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:05,080
This dog or wolf or whatever it was, it took off like a bug wrap in that dry hump over

238
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,320
there.

239
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,380
Hey, just a minute, will you?

240
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,900
I'm not a drinking man, Mr. Cox.

241
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,980
I swear to hell I saw it.

242
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,380
That was no crazy thing.

243
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:16,920
I'm not a crazy, raised sterno bum, but a respected law enforcement officer, Sheriff

244
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,460
Luger, axe handle of Heater County, California.

245
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:26,360
Crumbling remnant of the old west, or could it be the final resting place of a little

246
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,600
guy from outer space?

247
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,860
Could be, could be.

248
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,280
All I know is everything you know is wrong.

249
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,200
Oh, Christ.

250
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:38,480
God, you're dumb.

251
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,840
Dumb, dumb, dumb.

252
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:42,360
Dumb, dumb, dumb.

253
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:42,360


254
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,220
Enough of this deception and trickery.

255
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,580
I admit it.

256
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:51,280
I was taken in too by clever fakes like this.

257
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:54,540
My name is Dr. Onan Kenowight.

258
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:59,820
I am great at interpreting the languages and words of subgeniuses to others.

259
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I am a smart guy and very friendly to most everyone I meet.

260
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:05,660
Spadoinkle.

261
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,500
Uh, what's your name?

262
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:12,340
My name is Dr. Kenowight.

263
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:12,820
I am a good friend of Reverend Onan.

264
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,440
Could you come back here for a moment, please?

265
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:24,640
You can continue to keep talking, but Reverend Onan and I, we need to translate this into

266
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,040
sign language for Hindu gods.

267
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,260
Should I read from the book again?

268
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:30,880
Please do.

269
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,240
Children of the Chronotron.

270
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:42,320
The trail of the captives led them gradually upward toward the summit of the mountain.

271
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,400
They were on the edge of the low range of hills.

272
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:48,580
They soon discovered that the nature of the jungle near the seashore was much less spectacular

273
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,260
than the aspect of it inland.

274
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:56,220
It began to appear as though nature had dumped all her experiments into one bottle and mixed

275
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:56,740
them together.

276
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,660
They passed through groves of trees that were mostly roots, all intertwined like some giant

277
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,060
vine.

278
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:09,180
Their bark was like shaggy hair, and their fine, web-like branches sprouted foliage that

279
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:10,220
looked like feathers.

280
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:16,860
Among these feathered branches crawled brilliant orange and red land crabs, some of them as

281
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:20,800
much as two feet in diameter, emerging from the tent of Reverend Pease.

282
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,340
That's a nice flourish that you did at the end.

283
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:25,840
It's good.

284
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,120
Yeah, that's improv.

285
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,300
I ad-libbed.

286
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,220
That was a really nice story.

287
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,480
It was beautiful.

288
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,020
No.

289
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,220
I'm swapping out.

290
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,640
No.

291
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,520
I've read.

292
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,580
Here, add them all.

293
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,200
Take a book.

294
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,200
I'm not going to read.

295
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,700
Oh, I don't read books.

296
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,560
All right, who's tagging out with Dr. Fox?

297
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,360
Dr. Fox, I think Shaga.

298
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:47,820
Shaga.

299
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:52,260
Are they receiving Reverend Dr. Miller?

300
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,480
You need to come up and do some stuff.

301
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:55,720
What am I going to say?

302
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:58,900
I have no idea about running things to say myself.

303
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:01,380
All right, I'll sit there and laugh.

304
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:07,100
I hope we're going to make it really funny now, because as we've all said in the past,

305
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:11,000
every lady subgenius is worth 12 of us.

306
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:15,800
And now I'm going to have two of them up here, and we'll get some balance.

307
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,160
Bring it.

308
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,760
The ladies in the house.

309
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,760
The ladies are in the house.

310
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,740
Oh my God, welcome to the show.

311
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,340
It's so good to see you.

312
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,920
You look fabulous.

313
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:31,880
Oh my God, that ensemble with the lights and the bells that you have on, it's amazing.

314
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,900
What type of music do we have loaded into the CD player?

315
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,100
I have no idea.

316
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,080
It's some rare selection that's still in the works.

317
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:43,360
I think Robot Stang might have had, but apparently Robot Stang prefers this German trance music.

318
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,940
I think we should change that.

319
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:45,960
I think we need some music.

320
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,800
Oh yes, I've known Space Ghosts.

321
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,820
Now I'll be one.

322
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:55,220
All right, I see something called iGasm Stang tunes.

323
00:14:55,520 --> 00:15:01,380
I see the amino acids, and then something called Great Songs 1, beginning with Go Monkey Go.

324
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,320
Put that on.

325
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:02,860
All right.

326
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:04,700
Heh heh.

327
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:05,660
Heh heh.

328
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:06,480
Heh heh.

329
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,940
We're going to do a little bit of a

330
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,880
I'm linking the satellite in now.

331
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:18,960
And as we're working to get the technical difficulties done, now we seem to have got the uplink,

332
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:22,420
and we are communicating with sub-satellite 4.

333
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,520
And disk inserted.

334
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,960
Oh those long nights in Purgatory, I tell ya.

335
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,380
But I'm not.

336
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,220
And yeah, I'm not sure if that's a good thing to say.

337
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,120
You're a good reader.

338
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,000
I'm not irreprochably damned.

339
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,960
There's still gold you see.

340
00:15:32,020 --> 00:15:33,020
You talk good words.

341
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:33,540
Gold pour.

342
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,800
Oh those are actual song songs.

343
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,020
Those will have lyrics.

344
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,280
Oh is this something bad?

345
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:41,160
Oh, Reload!

346
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:43,520
All right, what do we have that's just noisy?

347
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,800
The show is moving along very smoothly.

348
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:49,060
No one should be disturbed by the iceberg in front of us.

349
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:51,120
It is a normal feature of the show.

350
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,920
Sorry, I just tossed Stang's cookies.

351
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,780
I'm so sorry.

352
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,420
Can the orchestra continue to play?

353
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:57,360
Wow, this has been an epic.

354
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,360


355
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,360


356
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:57,360


357
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,340
Next day of surprises.

358
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,680
Bad, bad Dr. Reverend Miller Miller.

359
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:07,080
What madcap are you going to read to us now, Anna Mama?

360
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,080
I can't explain it either.

361
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,340
Look at that figure.

362
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:12,560
Okay.

363
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,640
What one?

364
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,940
How about monster movie soundtracks?

365
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,980
I hate you so much.

366
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:22,620
Perfect.

367
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,380
Why are you stuck on reading the book?

368
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,920
That was just, that was Argus messing with you.

369
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,900
Reverend Stang will tell us what we're about to hear.

370
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,620
You got to jump in.

371
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,000
Okay.

372
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:31,760
Yes, yes.

373
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:32,360
Stay back.

374
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:40,060
Curse of the, it does have Conan the Destroyer, which we've heard every hour this year.

375
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:46,020
Curse of the Werewolf, Dark City, Dark Man, Dracula, Dracula, Elephant Man, Fly, Frankenstein,

376
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:50,100
Godzilla, Golden Voyage of Sinbad, Hannibal, Hollow Man, Horror of Dracula.

377
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,940
What track is the Golden Voyage of Sinbad?

378
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,940
Can we queue it up?

379
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:53,620
15.

380
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:54,680
15.

381
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:55,940
We have technology.

382
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,240
We can do whatever we want.

383
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:59,520
We are, after all, subgeniuses.

384
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:00,480
Literally.

385
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:01,240
All right.

386
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,800
You want to go to Golden Voyage?

387
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,540
I have the whole soundtrack of Golden Voyage.

388
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:07,840
The entire soundtrack is available to us for a minimum price.

389
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,100
You two could own it.

390
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,100
Oh, well.

391
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,760
Yeah.

392
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,240
Oh, remote control.

393
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,560
Yeah, and the listeners heard it five weeks ago.

394
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,280
Unchain him.

395
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,120
He's my friend.

396
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:17,940
Why is this?

397
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,540
No, he's to remain my captain.

398
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,240
What are you reading?

399
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,120
Please proceed during the intermission.

400
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:26,360
You better crawl.

401
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,320
You better crawl back in that bunk, boy.

402
00:17:27,460 --> 00:17:28,100
You're raving.

403
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,100
I had the fever.

404
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,020
Let me be, ma.

405
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,180
Let's just let it play.

406
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:33,500
Thank you.

407
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,180
It's aliens in the background.

408
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,260
Thank you, sir.

409
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:36,980
Yes.

410
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,400
But it's quiet.

411
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,820
It could be hard to hear.

412
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:39,740
Oh.

413
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:40,660
Aliens.

414
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:43,740
So just some of this ambience in the background.

415
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:44,960
Here is just a mythical place.

416
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,380
Yeah.

417
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,340
You can't.

418
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,600
In an alternate dimension.

419
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,120
I've heard that about London, too.

420
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,580
Thank you, sir.

421
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,440
Yes, I can.

422
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,520
No.

423
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,480
Jesus.

424
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:54,320
Yes.

425
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:55,720
Oh, wait.

426
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:55,920
Oh, wait.

427
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,360
Oh, wait.

428
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,360


429
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,360


430
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,360


431
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,360


432
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:56,360


433
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,320
There's a level four biohazard in the studio.

434
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,640
Just a little checkup.

435
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,960
Dr. Howell, this would never happen under the stern guidance of Pete Goldie, I think.

436
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,180
This would not happen.

437
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,520
It would be foreboughten.

438
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:16,300
In order to maintain this process on an automatic level, the special people, those persons who

439
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:20,700
could read silky minds, were maneuvering into being in charge of it.

440
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,460
Blenders are $9.18 on sale this week only.

441
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,500
Blenders?

442
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:27,300
Here, I just made one.

443
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:27,840
I'll give it to you.

444
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:28,360
$9.

445
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:29,580
And how much was that?

446
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,180
An 18?

447
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,280
18 cents.

448
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:32,460
18 cents.

449
00:18:32,620 --> 00:18:33,060
All right.

450
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:33,580
Here you go.

451
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:33,860
It's quite the bargain.

452
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:34,760
God, highway robbery.

453
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,260
Highway robbery?

454
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,680
I think it's a very economical entry point for a subgenius blender.

455
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,820
Yes.

456
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,600
Truth be told, man, because when we blunder, we blunder well.

457
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:45,060
Right?

458
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:53,360
You got to mash the bones and the gruel and apparently Argus Fox's man stuff into some

459
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:54,200
kind of paste.

460
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,440
That takes a lot of work.

461
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,440


462
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,440


463
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,440


464
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,440


465
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,440


466
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:55,440


467
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,800
It's a high quality blender to do that.

468
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,040
The mortar and pestle process.

469
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,980
It's disgusting.

470
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:05,240
Now, Princess Wee is picking the rare beer plant that has just sprung from the ground.

471
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,720
Apparently, some beer has grown in her feet.

472
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:09,220
I thought there were weeds.

473
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,000
I pulled three of them from the table earlier today.

474
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:17,820
We planted two beers here three weeks ago and all the beers that you see are from those

475
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,540
two beers.

476
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,300
I'm sorry, guys.

477
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:20,460
I salted the earth.

478
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:22,080
I thought we were done with this place.

479
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,440
Do you have any pepper?

480
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,340
I do.

481
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:24,960
Praise.

482
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,080
Mr. Animal for salting the earth because the men were previously seeding the earth

483
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,220
and bragging and rather boastful about it.

484
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:34,800
It is a medical necessity to avoid government interference.

485
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:35,400
No, but we can salt.

486
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:35,900
We can salt.

487
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:38,400
Salting the earth, I think, is better than seeding the earth.

488
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,480
Salt, piss, and vinegar.

489
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,260
In this case, absolutely so.

490
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:43,500
What's that?

491
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,460
I don't know.

492
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,660
You tell me.

493
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:53,880
Well, if the alien women are all plain in human form and look like one person, then

494
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,420
I'm not going to.

495
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:55,620
Don't worry.

496
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,560
That sounds like you've got a good plan.

497
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,480
Don't worry, the happy man.

498
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,200
They all look the same, huh?

499
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,260
Can we get 15 or 20 of them in here?

500
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,400
Oh my god, I'm dying.

501
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:22,100
As Fat B drone cast, bumbled ineffectually into a flower and hunted nearsightedly for

502
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,980
a drop of honey.

503
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,400
I love it when you read erotic poems.

504
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,400


505
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:25,400


506
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:25,760
I love it when you read erotic poems.

507
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:26,740
I love it when you read erotic poems.

508
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,140
Is this turning into bug porn, Sister Animal?

509
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,100
I mean, nearsighted bumblebees, that's starting to get a little steamy for me.

510
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,040
I had to get all close and feely with it.

511
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,900
Animal is very wavy today.

512
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:39,040
Is he going to use his stamen?

513
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,680
Did my father look like this?

514
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,660
Many times, but only after drinking.

515
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,060
This is supposed to be science fiction.

516
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,980
It's science facts.

517
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,600
That's right.

518
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,020
Of course it is.

519
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,900
And only the uber femme has got it really figured out.

520
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,260
I did like the whole uber concert.

521
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:58,600
Except for just you and uber for a bunch of parasites in your body.

522
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:00,680
Sister Animal.

523
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,560
I make the homage to you.

524
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,060
You're whispering.

525
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,180
Am I?

526
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:06,820
I have lost my voice.

527
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:09,660
It's your turn.

528
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,580
Oh, it's a search.

529
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,260
Stop mumbling.

530
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,460
Get that dick out of your mouth.

531
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,060
It's a search.

532
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:16,940
The chimp will raise the trapped leg clear of the ground and dash me down.

533
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,820
He's hurt.

534
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,020
I'm hurt.

535
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:22,720
Man down.

536
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,360
Man down.

537
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:24,720
Man down.

538
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,060
We need another comic on the stage.

539
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,240
It's all he can do to hold on.

540
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:28,600
Man down.

541
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,020
I'm so sorry.

542
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,960
That was a harsh embrace of roasting.

543
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,760
Danny Chagat.

544
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,160
Danny Chagat to save the peas, man.

545
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:37,320
As least his teeth aren't hurting.

546
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:37,960
Come up to the stage.

547
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,300
Thank you, my brother.

548
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,040
Did he just say a shout out to hamburger buns?

549
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,120
If you don't got buns, hon, I don't want none.

550
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:49,860
So, do you have hamburger buns?

551
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,300
We need hamburger buns over there.

552
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:53,700
All right.

553
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,400
Less peas.

554
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,220
For the listeners at home.

555
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,880
More hamburger buns.

556
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:56,900
I'm pointing that way.

557
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,020
Well, I'll stay on unless Barat.

558
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:02,480
That's right.

559
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:09,840
A third voice is necessary for the continuation of this sort of auditory torture experience

560
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:15,460
that we're going to inflict on all you poor little so-and-sos right now.

561
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:17,580
Let's begin to organize for a fantastic future.

562
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:18,340
I'm ready.

563
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:20,540
Come on, Susie.

564
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,180
It'll be great.

565
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,840
The future's bright because it's only destruction.

566
00:22:24,020 --> 00:22:25,060
There's nothing left.

567
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,640
There's nothing left but fire.

568
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,220
Yeah!

569
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,300
Destruction.

570
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,400
We have sewn the cigarette butts and we shall reap the win.

571
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,500
Do all of your drugs today because tomorrow will not come.

572
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:38,880
The frog sticks are a little fatter here at X-Day on the last day as people prepare to

573
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:45,360
board their airplanes and go through security measures enforced by the Frankenstein monster

574
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:46,660
computer government.

575
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:49,520
Yes, sir, but it's the only thing they listen to.

576
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:53,540
Well, let them listen because it's the last chance they're going to get.

577
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:54,280
Enjoy.

578
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:54,620
Enjoy.

579
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:54,760
Enjoy.

580
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:55,040
Enjoy.

581
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,040


582
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,040


583
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:55,440
Enjoy.

584
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:57,440
Enjoy.

585
00:22:57,620 --> 00:22:58,780
Enjoy.

586
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,080
Enjoy.

587
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,080


588
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,080


589
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,080


590
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:01,080


591
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,860
Here have a drink.

592
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:05,440
Here have a drink.

593
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,080
Enjoy.

594
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:09,540
Enjoy.

595
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:09,540


596
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:09,540


597
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:09,540


598
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:09,560


599
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,580


600
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,580


601
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,580


602
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,580


603
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,580


604
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,580


605
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,580


606
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,580


607
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,580


608
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,580


609
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:09,580


610
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,400
Enjoy.

611
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,040
Enjoy.

612
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,040


613
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,040


614
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,040


615
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,040


616
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,040


617
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,040


618
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,040


619
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,040


620
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,040


621
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,040


622
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:12,480
Enjoy.

623
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:12,480


624
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:12,480


625
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:12,480


626
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:14,960
Carol J. Clems, the historian.

627
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:15,720
Oh.

628
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:20,080
Are these books from the Bull Data auction there?

629
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:20,800
Is that what's...

630
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,360
Books purchased by some geniuses

631
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,200
that just left up on stage

632
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,160
because they don't really care.

633
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,260
May I recite a passage from this book?

634
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,080
Would that be all right?

635
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:32,660
No, but please continue.

636
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:33,560
I don't do it anyway.

637
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,360
This is something from December 1952.

638
00:23:37,100 --> 00:23:39,700
Imaginations, stories of science and fantasy.

639
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,020
Children of the chronotron.

640
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,820
It was decided that to trek aimlessly through the jungle

641
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:49,520
unaware of what they were looking for would be futile.

642
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,980
Instead, they chose to follow

643
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,060
the well-delineated trail of the captives

644
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,760
in order to determine where the alien was taking them.

645
00:23:56,920 --> 00:23:57,980
I always follow that trail.

646
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,820
We all want to know where the aliens are going to take us,

647
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:02,980
but we're going to find out tomorrow.

648
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,800
They all looked at each other in shocked silence,

649
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,720
except for Henry.

650
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:11,400
He merely experimented.

651
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,460
Henry's a scientist.

652
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,560
We all experimented in college.

653
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,220
With some of the drugs.

654
00:24:17,260 --> 00:24:18,220
Especially that.

655
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:19,980
Last day.

656
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,800
All your drugs.

657
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:21,220
Bring them.

658
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:22,900
Bring them down here.

659
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,720
Them big ol' fat frop sticks you all rolling up.

660
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:29,500
Them big boys ain't going down without a fight.

661
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:35,160
Bring them up in the suboxone, thorazine, urine, blood, piss, pod crust.

662
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:40,260
We'll do our best to help you fight those frop demons.

663
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:41,920
That's the royal we, right?

664
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:42,660
Mmm.

665
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,760
And it was at that moment that fate cut the cord.

666
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,460
An eye-searing light filled the cabin,

667
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,980
and Kennedy shrieked,

668
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:53,300
The reaction sphere!

669
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:58,140
The planet once known as Earth burst into a minor nova,

670
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:01,600
blasting its quick-fling into spiraling shreds

671
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,960
and tatters of celestial tinsel.

672
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:05,520
Hell yeah, read that part again.

673
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:07,380
And we'll do it again, and then we'll continue,

674
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,880
because it's even hotter after that.

675
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,460
This is just Earth destruction, peak porn.

676
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,020
Start over.

677
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:12,260
We're in space.

678
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:12,900
Yes.

679
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:17,580
The planet once known as Earth burst into a minor nova,

680
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:24,040
blasting its great ring into spiraling shreds and tatters of celestial tinsel.

681
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,100
Shaggith, get your hand out of your pants.

682
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:26,340
Oh.

683
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,160
In the face of that.

684
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:28,800
I prefer not to.

685
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:31,160
All right, keep them there, all three of them.

686
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,040
In the face of that swiftly advancing flame,

687
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:37,980
the starships that had survived the rocket's first onslaught

688
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,520
flicked safely into hyperspace, which was us,

689
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:42,000
and came to the surface of the planet.

690
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,580
Kennedy tried to stand enough Gs of acceleration to keep up ahead of it.

691
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:48,680
Oh yeah, how much Gs did he get on him?

692
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:49,720
Not enough.

693
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:55,980
He had no sub-Gs, and he, along with the rest of the pinks, perished.

694
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,060
And so it was.

695
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:01,780
An airlock sealed the gun compartments off from the rocket's cabin,

696
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:05,540
but the remains of the two gunners drifted into the turbulent ethers.

697
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,240
And so it was.

698
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:11,420
You know, I'm a little concerned, because I don't think that the space would be so hyper if it was just medicated.

699
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:11,940
Right?

700
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
Properly medicated.

701
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,120
Oh, you're just coming here from Big Pharma.

702
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,380
You know, this is again part of the Disneyfication of the church.

703
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:25,220
Now the sponsors are coming in, and you're gonna try and push your conspiracy pills on us.

704
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:25,920
Yeah.

705
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,640
No, no, no, more them kind pills.

706
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,300
They aren't even trying to hide it anymore, folks.

707
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,260
The robot Stang walks around glitching and malfunctioning inside the animals up here.

708
00:26:34,260 --> 00:26:37,020
I can hear him squeaking and whirring and clicking, clicks and beeps.

709
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,680
Making an advertisement for some kind of anti-herpes medication.

710
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,140
Now he's pressing buttons.

711
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,040
He's probably got experience in the matter, though, and I take her advice.

712
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:46,720
He's some type of android scribe.

713
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,380
I mean, robots can type faster than hippies.

714
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,260
Oh, well then for sure he's a hippie.

715
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:59,440
I mean, he's not even typing. He's just standing there like some kind of an ape, you know, holy...

716
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,400
What kind of madman would build a hippie robot?

717
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,200
Stumbling like a mummy.

718
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,980
You know, that's a good question.

719
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:06,060
It's not.

720
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,360
Because I'd like to meet that person.

721
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,680
Oh, you know what? It must have been J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.

722
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,020
He's trying to sell shit.

723
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:13,720
And he suckered me in. My wallet belongs to Bob.

724
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,220
I'm just a little concerned that my money's going to robots now.

725
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:21,000
Hal, I'm wearing headphones. I can't hear you. Don't talk to me.

726
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,360
Your money is going to robots. And there's nothing to do but wait for the aliens. Tomorrow, 7 AM.

727
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:30,060
But think about what pinks do when you send them things.

728
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,360
I don't want to think about pinks.

729
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,640
Wouldn't you rather send it to a robot? One thing I know about robots...

730
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:35,980
They ain't pink.

731
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:39,780
How do you know? You been inside one? Don't answer that question.

732
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:40,900
Eggplant.

733
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,320
Never mind.

734
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:47,140
For those listening at home, never mind.

735
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,440
I'm running out of breath telling all of you...

736
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,760
For those listening at home, enjoy what little time you have left, suckers.

737
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,280
Because it ends tomorrow.

738
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,880
And you may die.

739
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,700
Less than 24 hours to get here.

740
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,700
I have one thing I have to say.

741
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,760
The sales table will close at the end of time, which is pretty soon.

742
00:28:09,780 --> 00:28:10,460
He was built by a robot.

743
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:13,340
Considering today's date, July 4th.

744
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:18,380
So friends, everything must go by 1998.

745
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:20,920
Hit that sales table.

746
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:34,800
And when you are eating the food and fishes and loaves, we shall do the final auction of the final bulldada for the final time.

747
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,380
That is all.

748
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,980
Bring your money, bring your money.

749
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,120
Open your wallets to Bob.

750
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:44,300
Open your wallets.

751
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:48,480
Open them wide because you ain't spending any money after 7 a.m. tomorrow.

752
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,680
Thanks, Janebot5000, with your salesmanship upgrade.

753
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,540
I told you he was built by Bob.

754
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,260
Sales swag.

755
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,260
Reverend Eggplant, would you like to represent the mitten state?

756
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,060
The mitten state?

757
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:01,580
Yeah.

758
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:05,700
A whole state based on not being able to use all your fingers.

759
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,960
That's absolutely correct.

760
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,560
We hail from the...

761
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,560
A fine thing to call yourself.

762
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,700
Little nipper claw shaped.

763
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:12,980
Peninsular.

764
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,000
With all their appendages exposed.

765
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,760
That's probably true.

766
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,300
They do have big, weird looking fingers.

767
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,220
I like this song.

768
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:28,340
We're changing out staff here.

769
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,080
We have to...

770
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:29,600
Hang on.

771
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:33,460
We're inserting Eggplant into the Tarzan radio station console.

772
00:29:33,700 --> 00:29:36,400
We might have to take him out and blow on him first.

773
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,580
Give me a minute for my meat.

774
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,220
But he's going to have to pay us for that.

775
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:50,620
I'm going to power up my kazoo.

776
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,800
I took the battery out of your kazoo.

777
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:55,420
I noticed.

778
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,360
I was just looking for the batteries.

779
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,520
I need to recharge them.

780
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:01,700
Yeah, these are stupid little watch batteries that you can't find anywhere.

781
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:03,740
They use like four different names.

782
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:04,480
I dropped one and it's gone.

783
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:04,600
They were impossible.

784
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,860
Gone forever in the grass.

785
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,720
We'd also like to note that we need hamburger buns.

786
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:18,500
If you want to eat hamburgers, bring any buns you got left.

787
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,140
Because you can't take those buns on the plane with you back.

788
00:30:21,180 --> 00:30:21,680
Can't take those with you actually.

789
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,760
Can't take them on the bus.

790
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:26,080
And if the cops pull you over, you don't want them to see you with those buns.

791
00:30:26,260 --> 00:30:31,520
So bring all of your buns up to the stage here and we'll help you dispose.

792
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,920
Keep all of your appendages within view of the arresting officer.

793
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,080
Pease isn't the only one with problems.

794
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,420
Hey eggplant, I'm glad you could join us.

795
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:38,600
Hi.

796
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,340
I was wondering, what's your favorite kind of apocalypse?

797
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:48,640
My favorite kind of apocalypse would be where we just totally incinerate the whole god damn planet from orbit and say, yeah, we're done.

798
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,380
I like the way this guy thinks.

799
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,900
What are we orbiting?

800
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,280
Incinerate them.

801
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,200
Yes, it's still counting.

802
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,360
We actually do orbit a giant incinerator called the sun.

803
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:01,160
The counting.

804
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:03,520
And one day, like the trash it is.

805
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:03,900
The earth is going to be a mess.

806
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,580
The earth will be thrown into it.

807
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:09,580
The countdown has begun.

808
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:11,400
We are watching the clocks.

809
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,160
Hoping that the calendars do sync up.

810
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:22,420
The two subgeniuses who actually wear watches are watching the clocks here at Wisteria where you can't really get reception.

811
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:23,460
Mine's just drawn on.

812
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,000
That or masturbate furiously.

813
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:26,840
We don't know what we want to do.

814
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,860
Masturbate furiously.

815
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,220
Or watch the clocks.

816
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,060
Masturbate furiously or else.

817
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,900
You don't actually know how to work a digital clock.

818
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,020
You don't have to be a digital watch.

819
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,280
That's before your time.

820
00:31:35,540 --> 00:31:40,460
No, it has three buttons and they're, as far as I'm concerned, it's written in, there

821
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,040
are three buttons written in Egyptian.

822
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,200
There are three buttons.

823
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:43,680
No, five?

824
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,820
Written in the secret tongues of the exes.

825
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:48,020
What happens if I push this one?

826
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:49,720
I have no idea.

827
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,460
Oh, that's not the right number.

828
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:55,840
Did you make different numbers show up on my watch?

829
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:57,040
Different numbers?

830
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:57,760
You might have.

831
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:01,220
Oh, RoboStang would love that.

832
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,140
It's going to happen sooner than we thought.

833
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:04,080
Different numbers, alternate facts.

834
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:04,760
Ow.

835
00:32:05,320 --> 00:32:05,720
Oh man.

836
00:32:05,780 --> 00:32:07,500
You got a time machine on your wrist?

837
00:32:07,760 --> 00:32:08,140
Yeah.

838
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:11,040
How does it work?

839
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,580
I'm not, I don't know.

840
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:17,500
The instructions was like six, giant page and half of it was written in Japanese.

841
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,540
Stop it.

842
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:21,560
It only goes in one direction.

843
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,840
You cannot go back.

844
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,060
Oh, that's not good.

845
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:23,600
Stop.

846
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,460
I'm just going to touch this other button over here.

847
00:32:25,460 --> 00:32:25,900
He's not trying to play side two.

848
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,580
Listeners at home, animals being really obnoxious.

849
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,100
I'm just touching the buttons on the one of the three.

850
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:33,100
Almost as obnoxious as evil genius, man.

851
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,120


852
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:33,120


853
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:36,200
Mastermind to the stars, Fid Shuley.

854
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,520
That man is missing.

855
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:39,840
I'm so glad he's here.

856
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,120
We need to find him.

857
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,400
I mean, missing.

858
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,480
Why are you glad he's missing?

859
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:45,360
Nothing.

860
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:46,920
Because it means something.

861
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:47,540
Nothing.

862
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:50,240
Because it means eventually he's going to show up.

863
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,400
Because I don't have a cover under the stage here.

864
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:52,140
Uh huh.

865
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:55,560
There's not a space under the stage.

866
00:32:55,580 --> 00:32:57,660
There is a door under this stage actually.

867
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,300
There is a door.

868
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,840
It leads to his commands.

869
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,460
Not anymore.

870
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,920
I threw a rug on top of it.

871
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:03,120
I'm sorry.

872
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,120


873
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,120


874
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,120


875
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,120


876
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,120


877
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:04,720
Oh, that fixed it.

878
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:06,600
Great job, you sub genius.

879
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,920
I want to give you this penny.

880
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:17,120
You seem like the kind of person who'd pay $35 to a bit mapped image you can print off

881
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:17,660
the internet.

882
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:19,680
It's a dirty penny.

883
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,340
It's a dirty, dirty penny.

884
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:21,980
What do you got?

885
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:26,760
Stop laundering money in front of my face without paying me to watch.

886
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,580
I'm going to put batteries back in them.

887
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,020
Hey, watch all you like, son.

888
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:32,840
You know, that's what gets your rocks off.

889
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,120
You know?

890
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:35,380
These are double A. I need triple A for the kazoo.

891
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,160
Dude, I don't have any rocks left to get off.

892
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:40,680
Not after this.

893
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,560
You have the third rock to get off.

894
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:43,180
Nope.

895
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,100
It's gone too.

896
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:49,200
I'm going to have to wait at least six weeks after I get back to recuperate and regrow

897
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,580
my lizard parts.

898
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,360
1932.

899
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:55,240
I'm so glad I'm not the only lizard person here.

900
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:56,140
I was so alone.

901
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,300
Actually, it was misread.

902
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,860
It's 1923.

903
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:01,740
Oh no.

904
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:02,960
That number.

905
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:06,800
That other religion's stupid number.

906
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,000
Read the numbers on this one.

907
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,860
I've just been handed some counterfeited currency and I'm going to examine it.

908
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:16,360
We only counterfeit pennies here.

909
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,120
Yeah, it's...

910
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,000
Easier to pass.

911
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,800
The margins are more difficult.

912
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:25,600
Okay, I'm holding a highly oxidized 1972.

913
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:27,640
Is it 1972?

914
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:28,720
1972.

915
00:34:29,660 --> 00:34:30,280
Okay.

916
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:31,420
Common currency.

917
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:31,880
Common.

918
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:33,240
Nothing special about it.

919
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,640
Common.

920
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:38,180
Legal tender for all debts, public and private, for approximately...

921
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,020
Three, two, one.

922
00:34:40,060 --> 00:34:41,200
Fourteen hours.

923
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,160
Less than 14 hours.

924
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:43,820
Less than.

925
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:44,560
Indeed.

926
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:46,960
The end approaches quickly, friends.

927
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,860
And we couldn't be more glad for it.

928
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:52,440
You never know when it will come up and bite you right in the behind.

929
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:56,560
I know it's going to come and bite you right in the behind because I paid it $20 to do

930
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:56,780
so.

931
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:00,040
Why would you do that?

932
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:01,860
Fuck you.

933
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:01,860


934
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:01,860


935
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:01,860


936
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:01,860


937
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:01,860


938
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:01,860


939
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:01,860


940
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:01,860


941
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:01,860


942
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,280
Fuck you if you can't take a joke.

943
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,700
Well, I'm right here in the joke.

944
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:08,700
It's even better when they're in on the joke.

945
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,340
We're in on the joke at this point.

946
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:11,620
We're all in on the joke.

947
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:11,980
It's hysteria.

948
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:15,900
When you walk up to another subgenius and you punch them right in the face, it's because

949
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,440
you know they're in on the joke.

950
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:20,060
A cigar shoved deep into his mouth.

951
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,020
Mm-hmm.

952
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,800
Keep going.

953
00:35:23,200 --> 00:35:24,340
Lit on fire and explode.

954
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,580
Don't tease our listeners.

955
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,840
You don't do something like that, that would be the equivalent of saying that you're in

956
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:31,840


957
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:31,840


958
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:31,840


959
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:31,840


960
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:31,840


961
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:31,840


962
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:31,840


963
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,060
on the joke.

964
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:48,540
But still, all이�hhh...

965
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:54,580
Do you sleep on these casse etc🤭 where you're thinking, holy shit what's going on

966
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:54,580


967
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:54,740
I don't know.

968
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:55,940
I don't see it, bet you do.

969
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:55,940


970
00:35:55,940 --> 00:36:01,560
I'm not sure what the exact answer is.

971
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:02,320
story about bureaucracy.

972
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,220
Okay. It's layers deep.

973
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,440
Yeah. You know, that's

974
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,440
the thing about science fiction. You take something boring

975
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,100
and then you put it in space.

976
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,340
Nope. Not in space. It's

977
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,040
on a planet that is...

978
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,860
Where our planet's animal.

979
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:18,980
Here's the science fiction

980
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,940
to read. Yeah.

981
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,360
But this guy's having to request

982
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,060
If you like the concept of taking something

983
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,560
boring and turning it into

984
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:29,100
a fantastic concept, what

985
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,160
you need to do is get on the

986
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:32,920
internet and look up, probably

987
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,960
on subgenius.com, how to purchase

988
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,980
Neighbor World by lonesome cowboy

989
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:37,840
Dave

990
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,520
DeLuca.

991
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,680
It's a great book.

992
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,940
You know, they asked

993
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:46,980
me to write a blurb for the cover, but I

994
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,840
didn't want to sound unrealistic in my

995
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,780
praise, so I said, why don't you get

996
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,700
somebody else to do it,

997
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:53,780
you big dummy.

998
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,820
But I

999
00:36:56,820 --> 00:36:58,840
read it. I received a preview copy.

1000
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:00,940
It was so good, I threw it

1001
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,540
against the wall twice.

1002
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,820
Fantastic universe. And then I put it in a blender

1003
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,800
because I said, if I'm gonna... I've got

1004
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,960
some new ideas about this cut-up technique thing,

1005
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,800
I'm gonna put a book in a blender

1006
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,360
and then just make...

1007
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:13,840
Imagination.

1008
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,040
That's what it's all about here.

1009
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,900
He stuck out a large bony

1010
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:20,920
hand. Why did he stick out?

1011
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,540
A large bony hand.

1012
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,600
Mm-hmm.

1013
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,980
No, this was about

1014
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:29,000
a tall man with a lean, almost skeletal

1015
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,840
face, framed by a check.

1016
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:32,760
Big bony hand. He stuck right out.

1017
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:34,880
Would I be

1018
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:36,220
able to pick him out in the crowd?

1019
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,760
He's a salesman. He's a salesman

1020
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,840
with a big bony hand that he sticks right

1021
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,360
out. Who could this be talking about?

1022
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:43,680
Smiling face.

1023
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,720
I wonder if he's been a long ponytail.

1024
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,660
We don't really know what Bob looks like

1025
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,680
before he puts his hair product on, because clearly

1026
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:52,980
that thing's slicked back or he just doesn't take a shower

1027
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,800
so much that he's created a natural grease,

1028
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,360
a natural promod that he

1029
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,960
produces from

1030
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,780
his own scalp. Oh, wait, there...

1031
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:02,480
It's getting exciting, guys. They're asking to be

1032
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,860
taken into a private office to have

1033
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:05,780
a chat. Oh.

1034
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,520
Dang, what's that gonna be all about?

1035
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,520
Read the rest in Amazing

1036
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,600
by some dead

1037
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,120
people.

1038
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,880
Published by a company that

1039
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,460
probably doesn't exist anymore.

1040
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:20,820
Available at a

1041
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,960
garage. Original price, 35 cents.

1042
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:23,800
Resale price,

1043
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,700
49 cents. But don't be

1044
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,760
paying those kind of rip-off prices

1045
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,640
to original retailers. You gotta,

1046
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,240
you gotta get the second-hand market going.

1047
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,520
You can probably find this for

1048
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:35,900
five cents.

1049
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,780
Maybe they'll pay you to take it.

1050
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,640
Free on Craigslist. Now.

1051
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,460
See the

1052
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:43,720
man who had no brains.

1053
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:46,620
Carousel.

1054
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:51,960
Alright, right now we're gonna...

1055
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:54,360
What we want you to do right now is

1056
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:55,780
we need to...

1057
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,380
Get your butts up here. Come from

1058
00:38:58,380 --> 00:38:59,020
your camps!

1059
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:01,300
Wake up!

1060
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,040
And come over here.

1061
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,280
And buy this

1062
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,100
fantastic object that I've just

1063
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:09,880
been presented by Dr. Cosmec.

1064
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,000
And I'll allow you to describe this

1065
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,780
thing that we have right now available

1066
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,080
for you for a limited time here on

1067
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:16,240
the stage.

1068
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,480
So many molded jellies from ancient

1069
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,460
lands. This here, it looks

1070
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:22,500
like a small cake, but it's not

1071
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,600
a cake. It's an off-white

1072
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,540
plastic device, possibly

1073
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,440
with lights. And it's got

1074
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,620
one, two, three carousels.

1075
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,560
Cell horses on it. How much should we

1076
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:34,700
trust that? I can confirm that it's

1077
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:36,280
not a cake. I tried to eat it last night.

1078
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:38,700
One horse is brown. The other

1079
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,240
two are a violet

1080
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,580
color. And if I

1081
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:44,620
turn it on... Dare I turn

1082
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,640
it on? Dare you turn it on.

1083
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,380
I'm sure it wouldn't go spinning about.

1084
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,860
It plays the voices of angels.

1085
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,700
Why don't you play that

1086
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:56,640
on the microphone for about five minutes.

1087
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,740
Hang on. How do I turn this

1088
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,620
up really loud so everybody can know what they're doing?

1089
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,620
They're purchasing. Oh, it's being

1090
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,800
heard very well.

1091
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:11,160
That's great.

1092
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:14,660
I can't wait

1093
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,540
for it to be over so I can listen to it again.

1094
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:18,700
I wonder what

1095
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,420
else it does. So, uh,

1096
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:21,680
we've got an asking price.

1097
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,660
Oh, you're going to

1098
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,660
auction this guy off. Yeah.

1099
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,980
Oh, crap. It's mobile.

1100
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,140
So if you want this hot item

1101
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:30,400
right now,

1102
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,300
it moves around. It will try to

1103
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,280
escape you. It doesn't want

1104
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,260
you around. It will try to run away, but it's

1105
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,300
bad at it. It's like, hey guys, you need to listen to this

1106
00:40:38,300 --> 00:40:40,380
song. You need to come here and get this

1107
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,360
right now for the lowest price that

1108
00:40:42,360 --> 00:40:44,340
you can bid. And it's going to be spicy

1109
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:46,320
too, let me tell you. Honestly, all you gotta do

1110
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,860
is put a couple of those, uh,

1111
00:40:47,860 --> 00:40:50,960
dust cloths stuck to the bottom of it.

1112
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,220
You've got a musical room

1113
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,260
thing. You've got like this.

1114
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,580
You could just sweep up after yourself.

1115
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,440
He's coming up here fascinated with Childlike

1116
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,020
Wonder staring at this device.

1117
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,200
Maybe I want to re-inhabit this planet.

1118
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,500
And you need to sweep up the scorched

1119
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:06,340
ashes. You can do so using this device.

1120
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,520
You just put a little paper towel on the

1121
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:09,640
bottom of it and let it go.

1122
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:12,360
This will be a document to take into space

1123
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:14,540
with us on the pleasure saucers as a reminder

1124
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,440
that Earth existed. Pease, how much would

1125
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,260
you like to pay for this device?

1126
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,660
People should bring plates.

1127
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,600
And when you come up here to get this device,

1128
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:24,620
you should bring great things too.

1129
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,020
He wants plates. Bring your plates. He wants

1130
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,620
He wants buns. He wants

1131
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:26,920
He wants plates. He wants buns. He wants

1132
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:27,080
He wants buns. He wants

1133
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,140
He wants buns. He wants

1134
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,080
hot dog buns. Which one is it?

1135
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,500
Bring your hot dog buns.

1136
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,340
People have plates.

1137
00:41:30,340 --> 00:41:31,620
Bring the remains of your gear.

1138
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,220
Bring your plates. Bring everything over.

1139
00:41:33,380 --> 00:41:36,960
If you want your slop, then bring some buns, you pigs.

1140
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,040
You want to stuff your faces on this red meat?

1141
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,840
You want to sweat it out later tonight?

1142
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:48,620
By providing us the goodies and tools

1143
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:50,380
we need to consume it with.

1144
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,060
I'm talking to all of you.

1145
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,340
Pease is going on a bicycle right now

1146
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,540
to extort buns from every one of you with threats of violence,

1147
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,140
which will be followed

1148
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:03,440
up later tonight after we see your camp get dark.

1149
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:06,660
Where are the fuck with us?

1150
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,680
Bring your buns.

1151
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,220
Where are the buns?

1152
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,140
I know where they are.

1153
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:17,000
They're all out there and they need to be in here.

1154
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:18,680
And that's all your responsibility.

1155
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,540
For those listening at home, bring your buns.

1156
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,420
The robot wants to feed you meat sacks.

1157
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,240
We will take your buns now.

1158
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:30,320
One time, Argus Fox was like, I'm going to make some buns.

1159
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:30,920
I'm going to make some hamburgers.

1160
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,220
And some geniuses.

1161
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,680
And they were like, you don't have enough buns, Argus Fox.

1162
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,860
But he fed it through the hypercube and lo,

1163
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:42,540
there were plenty of hamburgers and everyone could have had one,

1164
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:44,300
but they didn't have any buns.

1165
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:48,980
So we saw plates, mustard, ketchup, mayonnaise.

1166
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,080
The bloodless laws.

1167
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,840
Let there be.

1168
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:54,840
Taste fucking bad antidote pudding for dessert.

1169
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,280
Butterscotch flavor.

1170
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,120
Make them appear.

1171
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,860
I don't like the butterscotch flavored one.

1172
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,140
I like the natural taste.

1173
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,600
The strength of 10.

1174
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:05,660
It's basically kombucha and pudding for them.

1175
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:06,840
It's disgusting.

1176
00:43:06,900 --> 00:43:09,100
We need your spice rack.

1177
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,540
Bring your spice rack and bring your racks.

1178
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,660
Bring your bring your big old racks down here and we'll put some spices on them.

1179
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,080
Where's the beef?

1180
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,000
Naturally.

1181
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,540
The beef is accounted for.

1182
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:25,180
It's the buns that are the problem.

1183
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,440
So if you hear me, you.

1184
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:29,720
Chairs.

1185
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:40,720
Knuckle dragging subgenius, inhuman, here sweet, ugly weirdos who are my favorite people in the world.

1186
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,800
I do everything you do at home, but better.

1187
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:51,180
Bring your buns down here and bring your asses for delicious burgers provided by hypercube laboratories.

1188
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:54,460
I don't have to worry about chopping wood or growing or cooking food.

1189
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:58,240
You're not going to have to worry about chopping your own wood while you're eating.

1190
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,300
Or playing a natural one. If you're chopping.

1191
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,100
your wood out in the TARDIS because

1192
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,240
you can't get hard without the smell.

1193
00:44:03,580 --> 00:44:04,720
Then stop.

1194
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,180
Get your hands off

1195
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:09,220
your dick, grab some hot dog buns

1196
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,960
and get down to Caffeinas.

1197
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,140
Just don't play with your phone.

1198
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:15,340
You can play with your phone

1199
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:16,680
if you're playing with something else.

1200
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:19,060
If you can get a signal to get on those dirty

1201
00:44:19,060 --> 00:44:20,260
websites you go to.

1202
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,180
We have no survival problems

1203
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,100
out here. We got all we need.

1204
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,060
All we want.

1205
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,840
Except for buns and plates. Please bring those.

1206
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:30,760
How many subgeniuses come to

1207
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,520
X-State just because they have a

1208
00:44:32,520 --> 00:44:34,720
Port-A-John fetish and this is like

1209
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,980
number one spot in the world.

1210
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,020
A plus material over there.

1211
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:40,380
The Jacob Capital. This is like

1212
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,620
San Francisco in the 60s but

1213
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:44,360
for shithouses in the woods.

1214
00:44:44,780 --> 00:44:46,740
Speaking of which, don't forget

1215
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,220
to close the doors

1216
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:49,940
for you. Close the lids.

1217
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:52,300
That way the flies get to stay.

1218
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:54,540
Peas is returned and

1219
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,620
probably not with buns because why

1220
00:44:56,620 --> 00:44:58,620
would you expect them to do anything wrong?

1221
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:00,840
If you like

1222
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:02,000
the smell of the fudge. He brought bowls.

1223
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:04,440
Just what we asked for. What else did you bring?

1224
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:06,080
Peas. Is that bread?

1225
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,460
Not buns? You want to see hot

1226
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,300
hamburgers off of plain

1227
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:12,560
white bread? You...

1228
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:16,680
How'd you do that? He asked.

1229
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,740
Now watch. How'd I do it?

1230
00:45:18,740 --> 00:45:20,580
I just thought about peas and said

1231
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:21,580
what was the truth.

1232
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,060
Let there be meat.

1233
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:26,540
But bring buns or

1234
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:28,560
no meat for anybody. How could

1235
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,380
you eat your pudding if you don't bring

1236
00:45:30,380 --> 00:45:32,400
us hot dog buns in the words of

1237
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,380
an old song? Nine.

1238
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,220
Nine is the answer. The number

1239
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:38,160
nine. Bullshit.

1240
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,260
Stop. See the numbers

1241
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:41,880
again. The numbers. Nine!

1242
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:42,960
You're probably

1243
00:45:44,380 --> 00:45:46,500
programming the robot's next direction

1244
00:45:46,500 --> 00:45:48,560
slowly by speaking these codes.

1245
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,480
These numbers. He's slowly

1246
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,400
ticking them off. John Lennon

1247
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:54,380
was part of this too. John Lennon was another

1248
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:56,460
agent of Fid Truly sent back into

1249
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,480
the past. I think I needed to talk to you.

1250
00:45:58,560 --> 00:45:58,840
Do some more.

1251
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,480
You know if you play Revolution Number Nine

1252
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:03,380
backwards. Number Nine?

1253
00:46:03,820 --> 00:46:06,380
It says send $35 to P.O. Box

1254
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:08,320
181417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio

1255
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:10,120
44118. Box.

1256
00:46:10,780 --> 00:46:12,200
The murmuring voice is

1257
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,280
fed into indistinct... I practice at home

1258
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:16,280
in the mirror, Stang. Then the wind grows

1259
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:18,580
covering everything in such a rich

1260
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,180
hum.

1261
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,500
Where's my fucking kazoo?

1262
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,840
Number Nine? Rich hum.

1263
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:26,560
If you

1264
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:27,780
play Revolver backwards,

1265
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,620
if you play Sgt. Pep, I was gonna make

1266
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:32,220
fun of Revolver, but that's a good album.

1267
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:34,460
If you play Sgt. Pepper's backwards,

1268
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:35,780
you hear a good album.

1269
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,840
Thick, needly pine branches

1270
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,080
rubbed together

1271
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:41,860
in a dull crunch.

1272
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,980
Oh, wow. Is that

1273
00:46:44,980 --> 00:46:46,540
a haiku? Oak,

1274
00:46:47,080 --> 00:46:48,300
hickory, maple,

1275
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:51,140
and elm limb screeched

1276
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,940
with the clattering of

1277
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,960
dead leaves. The sound swelled.

1278
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:56,660
That's not a very good haiku.

1279
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:58,200
The zoom faded, leaving

1280
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,400
faint, deeply overcones. I heard a good haiku once.

1281
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,600
And this isn't it.

1282
00:47:01,660 --> 00:47:02,780
And Francis disappeared.

1283
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:05,720
I bet. Where's Pease?

1284
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:07,200
Where's Pease?

1285
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,480
He has to answer for his

1286
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:11,900
typical behavior.

1287
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,400
Every time.

1288
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,540
Every time.

1289
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:20,240
Do you hear that sound,

1290
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:22,340
hungry people? That's the

1291
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,600
sound calling. That's the bread bell.

1292
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:26,200
Bring us

1293
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,400
your buns.

1294
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:27,620
Your buns.

1295
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,180
Not your hot dog buns.

1296
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:31,740
We've had enough hot dog bun related

1297
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:33,880
content from enough people

1298
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:36,060
this week. All the wrong

1299
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:38,380
people all about the hot dog buns.

1300
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,820
Hey, kiddo, he oozed.

1301
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,180
How about some breakfast?

1302
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:41,900
He oozed?

1303
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,800
How about some breakfast?

1304
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,100
I got some new Agri-Corp W, bagels, fruit,

1305
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,200
you name it, a feast.

1306
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,500
Climbers need fuel. It's right over there

1307
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,240
next to the plates.

1308
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:56,300
We need fuel to send the hill

1309
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:57,460
to the Port-A-John.

1310
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:58,940
Looks like dinner time.

1311
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:02,480
Pod crust eats last.

1312
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:04,780
So fine. We're too

1313
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,900
scrummed out to...

1314
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,600
I don't need it. I got all the scrum I need.

1315
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:08,960
You don't get to eat, animal.

1316
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:12,600
I just absorb nutrients through the air.

1317
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:13,540
Good.

1318
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,740
I know I don't get to eat. You didn't bring me any food.

1319
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,480
You left me out here

1320
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:20,680
in the middle of the woods to fight for myself.

1321
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:22,080
I brought you food and you were

1322
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,920
very rude about it.

1323
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:24,740
I showed you how to use a stick.

1324
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:27,780
And I brought you ass.

1325
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,920
No skills to find the things that you need

1326
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,740
to make your way through the forest.

1327
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,680
He doesn't even know how to use a stick properly.

1328
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:33,740
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do.

1329
00:48:33,740 --> 00:48:34,200
I'm a kazoo.

1330
00:48:35,780 --> 00:48:37,780
Didn't even know how to use a stick properly.

1331
00:48:38,060 --> 00:48:39,860
They didn't teach you shit at homeschool.

1332
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:40,720
That's right.

1333
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:44,520
There were other ways a stick was applied.

1334
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:47,940
Upside your head?

1335
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:49,160
No.

1336
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,160
Can't you tell by looking at this million dollar face?

1337
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,160
They never touch that.

1338
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,200
Never.

1339
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:54,700
Never.

1340
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:58,040
That's my money maker.

1341
00:48:58,300 --> 00:48:59,420
Sure. What the hell?

1342
00:48:59,560 --> 00:49:00,500
It's not my wit.

1343
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,060
My dulcet tones.

1344
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:05,200
I'm just reading this fantastic book

1345
00:49:05,200 --> 00:49:08,040
Neighbor World by Dave DeLuca.

1346
00:49:08,260 --> 00:49:10,060
And I'm always really getting off on this book

1347
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:11,540
Neighbor World every year.

1348
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,220
The floor on the stage

1349
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:15,920
has got a weird color

1350
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:18,040
discoloration on it right under her

1351
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:19,700
as she reads Neighbor World.

1352
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:20,840
There in clear sight.

1353
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:22,540
By lonesome cowboy Dave DeLuca.

1354
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,640
Available from Subgenius Press

1355
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,040
for a low, low price of insert price here.

1356
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,580
A very camera looking

1357
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:30,840
Neighbor World source

1358
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,080
pre-processing.

1359
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,920
Sitting here next to the book, I can tell you

1360
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,240
it looks nicely formatted.

1361
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:38,940
Looks like I'm going to go with Times New Roman

1362
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:41,000
though it could be Palantino font.

1363
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,920
I can't tell exactly from here.

1364
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:45,100
The margins are nice and even.

1365
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,320
I'd say that's a

1366
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,380
10.5 or 11 point font

1367
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:50,720
though definitely not a full

1368
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:50,940
font.

1369
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:51,840
That's fine.

1370
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:52,860
That's fine.

1371
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:55,480
It is not a sans serif font.

1372
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,000
It clearly has serifs.

1373
00:49:57,520 --> 00:49:58,660
Holy shit.

1374
00:50:01,020 --> 00:50:02,380
Just saying words.

1375
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,120
Another robot.

1376
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:07,940
But aren't we all?

1377
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,060
I love watching these subgeniuses

1378
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,980
eat their hamburgers that I'm not eating.

1379
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,860
There's something nice

1380
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:16,800
about it, you know.

1381
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,700
Apologies again, dear neighbors, for such

1382
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:19,820
unpro-focus.

1383
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,520
This orgy of

1384
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:21,860
BS.

1385
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:23,320
This book is prophecy.

1386
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:25,260
This book is fucked up.

1387
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,540
I know, that's why it's prophecy.

1388
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:28,140
That's how you know it's real.

1389
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,320
Find another passage.

1390
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:35,340
Don't sign anything before reading it, P's.

1391
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,100
At the...

1392
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,060
Oh, you would.

1393
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,720
Wisdom that you find inside.

1394
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:48,660
I looked inside for wisdom and all I found was a crumpled up bazooka joke comic in the bottom of my soul.

1395
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:51,060
I found wild berries. Can you believe it?

1396
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,160
Let's try one.

1397
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,020
That's not as good as what I got.

1398
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:55,780
Don't eat the red berries.

1399
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:56,960
It was one of the really funny ones.

1400
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:57,580
Don't eat the red berries.

1401
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:01,020
You can tell it is I'm making this up because there are no funny bazooka joke comics.

1402
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,660
I don't even know why they put them in there.

1403
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,300
It's disgusting gum.

1404
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,320
The comic nobody likes.

1405
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,660
I wonder if their brand's even still alive.

1406
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:19,680
Did you ever want bubble gum but didn't want to have all your teeth left?

1407
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,200
Bazooka joke.

1408
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:21,640
Uh...

1409
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:22,920
The worst gum.

1410
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:28,240
The best gum for the record is that bubble gum one that's green on the outside and red on the inside.

1411
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,760
No unfunny comics involved. Just delicious gum.

1412
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,360
Sorry, I can't... My A material is vanishing as I just watch all this food.

1413
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:37,240
Just think Halloween.

1414
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:37,800
It's gone.

1415
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,720
Listen to that.

1416
00:51:39,900 --> 00:51:40,280
You know what...

1417
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:44,360
The Hour of Slack sponsored by Stamps.com will return in a moment.

1423
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:15,240

1432
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,340
You need about 5 more minutes of that.

1433
00:52:25,700 --> 00:52:29,660
Just keep it the same spot. We want them to hear all of it.

1434
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,260
That's better.

1435
00:52:31,680 --> 00:52:32,020
That's my jam.

1436
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,360
La la la la la la la.

1437
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:33,960
No kidding.

1438
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,960
La la la la la la la la.

1439
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,160
Do you not know the name of this song?

1440
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:41,300
La la la la la la la la.

1441
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:44,860
That's Help by Led Zeppelin.

1442
00:52:45,260 --> 00:52:48,360
La la la la la la la la la la.

1443
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:55,240
No, it's Dr. Feelgood by Frank Zappa.

1444
00:52:56,460 --> 00:52:56,860
Oh.

1445
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,560
Maybe it's Alice Cooper's Rock the Casbah.

1446
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,200
I don't know.

1447
00:53:16,480 --> 00:53:18,040
I'm going to take this 5 minutes.

1448
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,400
I request that extended to 5 more.

1449
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:19,840
I have like 5 minutes.

1450
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:19,840


1451
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:19,840


1452
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:19,840


1453
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,360
Oh.

1454
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:23,440
I'm sorry.

1455
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:25,060
I don't know how long 5 minutes is.

1456
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,300
My watch is drawn on.

1457
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:29,680
Here comes Lagoon with the sacrificial poisons.

1458
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:37,860
The final nudge into the diabetic coma that every subgenius will be suffering tomorrow

1459
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:42,860
after their beautiful night of restful sleep that's coming right up, you know.

1460
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:44,900
You've got to be bright, like I said before.

1461
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:46,380
You've got to be ready for the saucers.

1462
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,220
Well rested.

1463
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,020
7 a.m.

1464
00:53:48,020 --> 00:53:48,560
7 a.m.

1465
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:52,100
Just a little after blue 30.

1466
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:53,420
Don't forget to wake me up this time, guys.

1467
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:54,440
That's why they didn't show up last year.

1468
00:53:54,800 --> 00:53:55,540
Why would they?

1469
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:56,700
Never.

1470
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,640
Everybody's asleep like a baby.

1471
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:03,740
And you're going to be the only one out there in the field.

1472
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:04,520
Mm-hmm.

1473
00:54:04,560 --> 00:54:06,320
And they're going to be like, pfft, screw this.

1474
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:07,980
And that's why they left last year?

1475
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:08,260
Masturbation.

1476
00:54:08,260 --> 00:54:09,540
That's why they're like, out of here?

1477
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:10,320
Yeah.

1478
00:54:10,640 --> 00:54:12,560
The X's came down.

1479
00:54:12,580 --> 00:54:14,580
They smelled my shirt and they left.

1480
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:15,740
It's a binary masturbation.

1481
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,540
I'm so glad that you're happy.

1482
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:18,540


1483
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:18,540


1484
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:18,540


1485
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:18,540


1486
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:18,540


1487
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:18,540


1488
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:18,540


1489
00:54:18,540 --> 00:54:20,840
I have bear-scented deodorant now.

1490
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:23,240
It's real.

1491
00:54:23,820 --> 00:54:24,260
Arrr.

1492
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,080
Have you shown anybody else?

1493
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:29,360
Have you let anybody else know?

1494
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,240
No, it's not something that I would talk.

1495
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:32,640
It's a personal issue.

1496
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,540
I did have to buy.

1497
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:36,200
It's a personal matter.

1498
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,880
I don't want to discuss it out loud with people.

1499
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,520
He's like, why did you want to go in town so bad?

1500
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,560
Why did you want to go into town?

1501
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:44,740
What's so important about town?

1502
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:46,480
I was like, to buy you deodorant.

1503
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,520
If I knew that's why you wanted to go to town, I would have bought you deodorant.

1504
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:48,520


1505
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,540
If I knew that's why you wanted to go to town, I would have refused.

1506
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:51,560
And I would have buried you in the woods.

1507
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,180
You did refuse.

1508
00:54:52,340 --> 00:54:53,240
Some place that's familiar.

1509
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:53,700
I did.

1510
00:54:53,760 --> 00:54:54,300
Oh yeah.

1511
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:57,480
I should have taken you in the car I rented.

1512
00:54:57,500 --> 00:54:58,020
And well lighted.

1513
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,120
And secure.

1514
00:54:59,620 --> 00:55:00,940
On my way to the clinic.

1515
00:55:01,220 --> 00:55:03,180
I'm never buying you a plane ticket ever again.

1516
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:05,140
That's good because you haven't yet.

1517
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:05,500
Remember, it's all for your safety.

1518
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,440
I took the bus.

1519
00:55:09,220 --> 00:55:10,140
For your safety.

1520
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:11,620
I don't know what you did with your GoFundMe money.

1521
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:14,480
Actually, I do know what you did with your GoFundMe money.

1522
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,140
About every other subgenius here knows because they smoked it.

1523
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:17,820
Yeah.

1524
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:19,760
That settles it.

1525
00:55:21,780 --> 00:55:24,280
Didn't waste any of that on camping supplies.

1526
00:55:26,460 --> 00:55:28,040
I just been sleeping on the stage.

1527
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,280
You're not sleeping at all.

1528
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,660
Yes, but they won't let me leave.

1529
00:55:33,740 --> 00:55:35,020
Bring me food or kill me.

1530
00:55:35,020 --> 00:55:35,760
But I'm going to rebel.

1531
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:37,780
Want a hamburger?

1532
00:55:38,040 --> 00:55:38,280
Nah.

1533
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:42,340
Give me slack or kill me food or kill me.

1534
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,840
And uh, fuck all your friends.

1535
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:50,600
Give me slack or give me food or kill me.

1536
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,780
Or why not all three?

1537
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:54,640
Do me now, baby.

1538
00:55:54,900 --> 00:55:55,440
Why not both?

1539
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,640
Oh, I'm taking an extra letter.

1540
00:55:59,060 --> 00:56:01,640
Okay, it's a true Thorazine you're in Podcrust.

1541
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:02,820
We got somebody eating food.

1542
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:07,100
Podcrust Theater continues now on a different frequency and channel.

1543
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:07,220
Does anybody have a shop dog?

1544
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:08,960
We need a shop dog to bark into the background.

1545
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:10,960
Can you bring your dog down here?

1546
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:12,160
It's very important.

1547
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:13,620
It's very important.

1548
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:14,680
I want him.

1549
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,720
Oh, no thank you, doctor.

1550
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,820
No, no, no.

1551
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:18,040
No, no, no.

1552
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:21,680
No, no, no, no.

1553
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:23,880
Oh, it looks so good, but I am absolutely...

1554
00:56:25,260 --> 00:56:30,660
This is the first hamburger I've had since January.

1555
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:37,720
Stan gets to eat his new hamburger.

1556
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,680
How lovely.

1557
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,540
From NPR News in Washington.

1558
00:56:45,620 --> 00:56:46,800
I'm known to have information that I want to share with you.

1559
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:46,800


1560
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:46,800


1561
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:46,800


1562
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:56,180
As far as grams.

1563
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:06,580
Yeah.

1564
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,080
So far, in the last four or seven years at some point that I've sat in the middle of

1565
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:15,080


1566
00:57:15,080 --> 00:57:15,180
No, no, don't say that.

1567
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:15,180


1568
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:15,180


1569
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:15,240
Well, you have to share your life together.

1570
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:15,420
There's Congress here today.

1571
00:57:15,420 --> 00:57:15,440
I've heard the word, and they should have told me.

1572
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:15,920
And I think I know what I'm talking about as well.

1573
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:16,640
I'm busy, so I've got no time to be sitting here with anybody else.

1574
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:16,640


1575
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:16,640

00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:16,640
