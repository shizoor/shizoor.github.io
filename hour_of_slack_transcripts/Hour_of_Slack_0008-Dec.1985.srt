1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,500
Do you like slack? I love slack. Do you want slack? Do you need slack?

2
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,480
Gee, I can't wait till that Bob Time train comes around the bend.

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,520
Oh, look out, son. Here it comes now.

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:25,260
It's frightening, isn't it?

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:29,900
It's unbelievably big and scary.

6
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,440
It's not wrenchingly afraid.

7
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:39,180
We stand to receive thee who are of but flesh and understand not the way of the lead-clad ones.

8
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:40,120
Oh, bloody...

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:45,120
Stand direct for your abnormality.

10
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,900
Wise up! They're out to get you.

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,640
The Bob is coming.

12
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,880
Bob, Bob there?

13
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:59,100
Bob, Bob is burning in the flames of his own pipe. Yeah.

14
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,720
He's the head.

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,460
Ah, yes, dear friends, it's live.

16
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,680
I have slack with Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr. Philo Drever.

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,420
And we're taking this show out to get us some beer.

18
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
There we did. It's a matter of fact.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,780
I don't drink.

20
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,720
And now the show's kind of wobbling and running funny.

21
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,860
We've got to move Philo's show out of the way before we get our show on.

22
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:25,740
We've got to get the show out of the driveway and down to the station.

23
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:26,960
Who? Who?

24
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,940
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

25
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,320
Smith, radio operator.

26
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,240
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

27
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:37,680
I have butt naked!

28
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:40,040
No trouble.

29
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:41,560
The hell you say?

30
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,460
Get going.

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,200
You hear me?

32
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:44,660
Recording.

33
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,480
Everything's fine.

34
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,800
Butt naked, he said.

35
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:48,800
No trouble.

36
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,980
It's get going. Everything's fine.

37
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,860
Welcome potential initiates.

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,580
And remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

39
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:56,120
No trouble.

40
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,380
Bob?

41
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,120
Everything is right.

42
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:01,660
Bob?

43
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:08,040
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

44
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:08,740
Bob?

45
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,720
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

46
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,120
What about slack?

47
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,240
That's your key phrase.

48
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,740
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware.

49
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:35,760
Welcome to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack. Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

50
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:44,400
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megafist Temple Lodge of the Church of the Subgenius.

51
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,720
With Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

52
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:52,720
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this video.

53
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,140
No.

54
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,460
Radio Stent Degree.

55
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,740
Doctor Philodrullin.

56
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:58,000
Before the sermon, a monthly live recording.

57
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,640
A message for all followers.

58
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,680
Bob Dobbs.

59
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,240
A living avatar of slack.

60
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:01,400
Don't believe any slack.

61
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:05,280
And saying the same thing on copyright 1985.

62
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:06,700
It's a second megafist in the line, the Church of the Subgenius of Haines.

63
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:06,840
That you by the Church of the Subgenius of Haines.

64
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,600
Are we controlled by secret forces?

65
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,880
Whoever get the feeling that Bob...

66
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:11,860
Bob Dobbs.

67
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,540
Huh.

68
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,540
Or something like them.

69
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,960
Super-me.

70
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,620
Super-me.

71
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,740
Go ahead, Bob.

72
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:21,740


73
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,700
No, Bob.

74
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:22,700


75
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:22,700


76
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:22,700


77
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:22,700


78
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:22,700


79
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:22,700


80
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:22,700


81
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:22,700


82
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:22,700


83
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,200
I think I heard it. There. I heard it that time.

84
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:40,740
Ah, yes. Listen to the sound of that slack bubbling and regurgitating deep down inside yourself.

85
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,260
It sounds so pleasant.

86
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:48,760
Oh, those boys.

87
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:56,100
Why Christians should not allow the injections of those stupid and often diseased subjects into their blood.

88
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,680
Well, Dr. Drummond, why shouldn't we allow the injections for the new incoming subgenius ministers?

89
00:04:02,180 --> 00:04:03,620
Into our veins, you mean?

90
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:11,520
Yes. Why can we not inject the incoming bobbies if they're merely bobbies and not true subgenii?

91
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,740
Well, since the last election, we've been stymied in our methods on how to inject the new incoming subgenius ministers.

92
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:18,740


93
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:34,580
How to cook these subgeniuses down, these bodies, and put them into little vials or tubes, test tubes, and extract them into hypodermic needles that can be mainlined into our veins for drug purposes.

94
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,260
Medicinal purposes, or is this some sort of ritualistic?

95
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,960
Of course, medicinal and ritualistic as well.

96
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:41,540
Hallucinogenic.

97
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,920
Hallucinogenic. And above all...

98
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,040
Listen, the lightning is getting closer.

99
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:47,400
Okay.

100
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:52,380
Soon we'll have enough power to begin broadcasting the Dobstrom signal, Dr. Drummond.

101
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,820
Hey, we're not on the air now.

102
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,880
We're not on the air now.

103
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,680
No, we're just playing the tape.

104
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,440
Or we are on the air now.

105
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,120
Sonic.

106
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:02,600
Yeah.

107
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,140
Drunk.

108
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:03,980
Sonic.

109
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:04,820
Yeah.

110
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,400
Drunk.

111
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,100
Sonic.

112
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:06,940
Yeah.

113
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,520
Drunk.

114
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,420
Sonic.

115
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,200
Yeah.

116
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:09,420


117
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:09,740


118
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,320
Yeah.

119
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,020
Drunk.

120
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:11,240
Yeah.

121
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,440
rofl.

122
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:16,840
saک이

123
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:16,960
saçma

124
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:16,960


125
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,080
rofa

126
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,080


127
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,080


128
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,420
rof

129
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,480
What's all this stuff about the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer?

130
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,960
It's highly a memorable material.

131
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:33,440
Do not attempt to reintroduce...

132
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,060
Do not attempt to reintroduce...

133
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:40,920
If you looked inside Arnold Palmer's head, there were just a bunch of wadded up rubber bands.

134
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,000


135
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:42,940
My God.

136
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,440
It's just been a heck of a war so far here.

137
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:52,320
We're trying to march all the Slack squads back to their barracks now,

138
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,380
and they're a little bit hard to deactivate.

139
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:56,760
They get belligerent late at night,

140
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:59,680
but they seem to be able to make it back to the barracks here.

141
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,980
Look, it started now.

142
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:04,140
This is what we call the monster beach party.

143
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,360
Hey, so welcome to the subgenius beach party.

144
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,340
Yes, last week it was in Houston on KPFA.

145
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:11,980
You'll never know where the subgenius beach party is,

146
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,560
and don't you wish you did.

147
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,680
Oh, dear, that ding.

148
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:18,280
Well, Dr. Howell, is there any way you can fight through the sound effects

149
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,360
and tell us about their relationship between the demopods and the ussopods?

150
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,460
Well, the demopods and the myriapods got together at the early...

151
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,020
No, demopods and ussopods.

152
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,560
Oh, the demopods.

153
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,540
I didn't understand that.

154
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,820
I thought you meant this script right here,

155
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,680
the one with the red lines on the cover.

156
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,660
Listen, never read anything with red dots.

157
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,320
I never believe anything with red dots.

158
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,620
It says read addresses that people don't like on the show.

159
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:45,880
Too many buttons to push, too many tape recorders to watch.

160
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,500
It was obvious that during the game they should not have launched ahead with that size of a rocket.

161
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,300
They should have used a smaller rocket, not hurt so many people.

162
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,520
Some, perhaps, but not so many.

163
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:59,320
As it turned out, JFK was turning to Governor Connolly

164
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:02,120
to tell him the name of the band that dare not speak his name,

165
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,860
and was shot because of that.

166
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:05,240
We thank you for your input, caller.

167
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:06,840
What does it sound like where you are?

168
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,100
It sounds kind of weird.

169
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,260
What is weird?

170
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:11,640
Huh?

171
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:17,540
It's a weird DJ dressed up in a crown of thorns and a dirty, dirty shield.

172
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,420
What's going on here?

173
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,600
Starts kissing on you.

174
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,180
Mobius, I don't give a damn.

175
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,600
Dead center.

176
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,080
Yes, liberty...

177
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,720
I can't stand things that might make...

178
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,640
don't make any sense.

179
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,080
Come on, let's get out of my brain.

180
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:36,800
Eeeeee!

181
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,160
Eeeeee!

182
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:38,320
Eeeeee!

183
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:39,800
Eeeeee!

184
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:40,680
Eeeeee!

185
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:40,680


186
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:40,680


187
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:40,680


188
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,820
Well, Doug, you know, I came down here today because all the way from St. Louis, Missouri...

189
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,780
Yes?

190
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:50,680
...and requested as I was, I thought we might have something...

191
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:54,400
something of substance to accomplish here, and I can see that we're...

192
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,900
why we're just going to do nothing but...

193
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:01,000
well, I hope we can get by with this, but...

194
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,840
No, that is illegal to say on public radio, Dr. Drummond.

195
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,300
You're right, we can't use anything like that.

196
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:08,300


197
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,720
But we can...

198
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:12,480
But we can continue with the interview.

199
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,280
Can we have...

200
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,920
Now we may continue with the interview.

201
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,020
Now we can continue at this point of the next...

202
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,280
Not right here, but...

203
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,480
Now?

204
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:20,220
...right here, but...

205
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,880
One, two, now...

206
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:25,140
We may now continue with the interview.

207
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:38,300
...with Dr. Philodrumon, the only overman of our decade, and probably there would be no other true overman until 1998, and anyone else...

208
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:38,300


209
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,760
...that you see claiming to be an official subgenius overman is an imposter.

210
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,720
Dr. Drummond is the only overman.

211
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,700
Now, Dr. Drummond...

212
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,980
Altered by alien technology.

213
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:47,980
Exactly.

214
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:49,220
Now, now...

215
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:51,220
And it hurt. It was quite painful, I have to admit.

216
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:54,300
Well, Bob did this to you, did he not?

217
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,460
Bob, with the help of some alien Tibetan monks...

218
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,300
And aliens, you say?

219
00:09:01,420 --> 00:09:06,860
...and strange, odd tools on my bodily parts, which will go unmentioned...

220
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,440
...because this is a...

221
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,660
...a family...

222
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,560
...a public radio, and a family hour.

223
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,060
Yes, it is.

224
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,520
I understand that there are children listening.

225
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:18,960
There are many children. This is considered by many to be below the level of a children's show.

226
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,880
And I understand that it is actually below the level of most human intelligence.

227
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,660
That's why they call it subgenius. Yes, thank you.

228
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,280
I understand. Thank you.

229
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:35,960
Now, Dr. Drummond, as I understand it, there are rumors circulating that J.R. Bob Dobbs, the incredible...

230
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:41,340
...original living avatar of slack on this planet, was murdered again.

231
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:51,840
He was feloniously and ruthlessly assaulted for a second time, that did result in severe loss of blood and life, as we know.

232
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:55,380
Now, we understand that Bob Dobbs was already dead.

233
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,540
Now, how could there have been a second Bob assassination in Los Angeles in November of 1985?

234
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,380
Well, contrary to popular belief...

235
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:10,240
...what a lot of people don't realize, and I did know this since Bob did have one chance to materialize...

236
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:19,040
...I spoke with him briefly, and he told me that after the show in San Francisco, there was a cockroach on stage...

237
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:29,780
...which Bob, at the point of impact of those bullets, managed to throw his soul, his nintel eye stench itself, into the body of that cockroach.

238
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:31,540
And what became...

239
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:34,240
...and lived on the excrement.

240
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,060
And...

241
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:40,020
Now, I've heard many, many, many, many theories.

242
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,940
As the victor...

243
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,420
...

244
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:43,800
...

245
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,960
...

246
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,560
When you're driving 16 hours, take a bob.

247
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,700
When you use your mutant powers, take a bob.

248
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,000
When your blood is low in sugar, when you're picking out a bugger,

249
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,080
when you shoot him with a luga, take a bob.

250
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,080
When you're outside exercising, take a bob.

251
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:26,320
When you're using sex devices, take a bob.

252
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,600
When you're walking through the woods, when you make out with the girls,

253
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:34,780
when you're beat up to the hoods, take a bob.

254
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,380
Big bad, big bob, big bad bob.

255
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,520
Big bad bob, big bad bob.

256
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,040
Oh, no. Oh, oh, oh, oh.

257
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,280
Ow.

258
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:00,880
Ow!

259
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:01,900
Ow!

260
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,000
Ow!

261
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:05,840
They're in the human scrapyard.

262
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,320
Please, if you're coughing all over the speaker, you're saying we've got to clean it up here at the station.

263
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,560
Yes, the adventure of the little sub-deenies.

264
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:43,900
I am a sub-genius, and by that virtue, I am in touch with forces greater than man.

265
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,460
I dare you to kill me.

266
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,520
I am not a duper conspiracy.

267
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,200
I know more than they do.

268
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:48,940
I am a sub-genius.

269
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,820
I am a sub-genius.

270
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,780
That's all I need to be.

271
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:51,480
I shall prevail.

272
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,340
Let out the crazy man inside you.

273
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:55,420
He knows what's what.

274
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,060
Smile when you call me a fanatic.

275
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:57,960
Me, primate.

276
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:58,980
Me, overman.

277
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,500
I say to the pigs, give me your money.

278
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,400
You won't need it.

279
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,180
The future offers you nothing but destruction.

280
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,160
The Church of the Sub-Genius.

281
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:27,960
In a country where freedom of religion is guaranteed by the Constitution, anything is likely to develop.

282
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:34,520
Enter the Church of the Sub-Genius, filling itself as the weirdest cult on Earth.

283
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,960
What do they believe in?

284
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,140
Everything.

285
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,720
Who do they believe in?

286
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,420
A mysterious character named Bob.

287
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,020
A man named Bob.

288
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:59,980
And join the Church of the Sub-Genius.

289
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,240
Hello.

290
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,860
You're improving, Jack.

291
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:15,140
You just can't seem to get rid of that streak of honesty in you.

292
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,860
The one that ruined you was that damned Indian.

293
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:18,920
Oh.

294
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:19,620
an old teepee.

295
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,660
You mean Olasky.

296
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,020
He gave you a vision

297
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:25,460
of moral order

298
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,440
in the universe

299
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,400
and there isn't any.

300
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:29,880
Those stars

301
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:31,620
twinkle in a void,

302
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,220
dear boy,

303
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,780
and the two-legged creature

304
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,700
schemes and dreams

305
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,620
beneath them

306
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,060
all in vain.

307
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:42,300
All in vain, Jack.

308
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,980
Did you hear anything?

309
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,180
Listen to me.

310
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,520
Two-legged creature

311
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,520
won't believe anything.

312
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,860
And the more preposterous

313
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:52,320
the better.

314
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,360
Whales speak French

315
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,440
at the bottom of the sea.

316
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:58,620
The horses of Arabia

317
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,660
have silver wings.

318
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,700
Pygmies mate with elephants

319
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,220
in darkest Africa.

320
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,980
I have sold

321
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,380
all those propositions.

322
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,360
Woo-hoo!

323
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,120
Woo-hoo!

324
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:16,940
Woo-hoo!

325
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,620
Woo-hoo!

326
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,620
And they were all fools

327
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:22,640
and none of it matters.

328
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,380
Ah!

329
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,200
Here's the type of the tape.

330
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,340
Here's the type of the tape.

331
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
The sound of it,

332
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,780
the basic sound

333
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,160
of the art surprise itself,

334
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,380
you couldn't see the explosion.

335
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,920
It was magnificent.

336
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,120
It's embarrassing.

337
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,660
It's moist.

338
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,900
It drips.

339
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,640
It dribbles.

340
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,220
It spits.

341
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,680
It's nasty.

342
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,560
But yet it's beautiful

343
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,980
in its own wet,

344
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:16,480
slimy,

345
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,220
squirting,

346
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,280
and embarrassing way.

347
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,040
It is.

348
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:22,680
Ow!

349
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,040
That's correct.

350
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,160
Ah, but are you saying

351
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,140
that it was Bob who was killed or not?

352
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:30,280
Yes, it was Bob that was killed.

353
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,700
Bob, fortunately,

354
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,860
he transferred his body

355
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,880
through soul and stench migration

356
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,020
into the body of the cockroach.

357
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,600
And this was in January of 1984.

358
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:41,340
Is that correct?

359
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,860
January 22nd of 1984,

360
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:43,860
to be exact,

361
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,480
at the Victoria Theatre in San Francisco.

362
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,980
Now, if that is so,

363
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,080
then if Bob,

364
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,820
somehow, Bob Dobbs,

365
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,900
this mystic guru of yours,

366
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,620
somehow managed to infect

367
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,360
the body of a cockroach

368
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,900
for the intervening almost two years,

369
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:04,240
who then was supposedly materialized

370
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,820
during a seance in public

371
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,520
in Los Angeles

372
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:09,240
in November of 1985.

373
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,400
That then subsequently shot down

374
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,500
this, it,

375
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,580
I've seen the videotapes.

376
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,720
It does not resemble,

377
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,760
the same man who was shot and killed

378
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,780
in San Francisco.

379
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:21,860
That's because it wasn't,

380
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:22,600
it wasn't impossible.

381
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,040
Here is wisdom.

382
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,540
Let him that hath understanding

383
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,400
count the number of the beast.

384
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,580
For it is the number of a man,

385
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,720
number of a man.

386
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,140
His number is

387
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,720
six hundred

388
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,100
three score

389
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,580
and six.

390
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,260
You can roar all you want to toward me.

391
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:45,720
Yeah.

392
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:47,620
But I'm gonna tell Jesus on you.

393
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,720
This creature is trying to tell me something.

394
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,940
I can see it in his face.

395
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,820
I, I, I, oh God,

396
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:58,520
give me strength.

397
00:17:58,760 --> 00:18:00,500
I'll fight it off.

398
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:02,520
I'm not afraid.

399
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,200
Be silent all of you.

400
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,920
I've opened the surface of the earth.

401
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:07,880
It's time to attack.

402
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,840
Get the toothbrush.

403
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,620
And he's loaded with toothpaste.

404
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,400
Come on, Jesus.

405
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,680
Come on, show yourself.

406
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:33,760
Come on, Jesus.

407
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,100
Come on, show yourself.

408
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,200
Person, you can probably testify

409
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,560
as to the inauthenticity

410
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,380
of the man posing as Bob,

411
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:48,340
Bob Dobbs himself.

412
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,760
Well, yes, I pers...

413
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,120
Excuse me, that's a conspiracy calling.

414
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,560
Uh-huh.

415
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,860
Well, in that case, we'll take time.

416
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,700
And we'll start...

417
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:57,500
Big financial deal.

418
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,740
I'm glad to say that, uh,

419
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,360
with me, I brought some of, uh,

420
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,380
the latest tapes by the Swinging Love Corpses,

421
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:11,100
that wonderful band from

422
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,960
St. Louis, Missouri.

423
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:13,920
This is your medical, uh,

424
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,020
your medical musical treatment?

425
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:16,520
Why, yes.

426
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,600
They are produced by

427
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,640
5,000 Doctors and Slippid Music Company

428
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:21,280
from St. Louis, Missouri.

429
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,460
And...

430
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:24,900
Let's put them on right now.

431
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,200
Well, all right, go ahead.

432
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,780
If you insist, Dr. Drummond.

433
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,020
Yes, I'm waiting.

434
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,080
So this is your band, eh?

435
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,800
The vortex took them.

436
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,040
The vortex took them.

437
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,980
Just took them away.

438
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,300
The vortex took them.

439
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:45,560
The vortex took them.

440
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,920
The vortex took them.

441
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,380
As you would expect,

442
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:54,900
we will soon leave,

443
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,480
but cut startups in a few hours

444
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:56,480


445
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,960
One, two, joking.

446
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,040
Now, many of you will be foreheads up

447
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,040


448
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,580
like this Antonio Fernandez- ל

449
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,340
adtar hung on to concerns

450
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,200
even during the world zealons.

451
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:04,940
Someone called it difficult science.

452
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:05,320
Somebody called it like the

453
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,840
greatestばいhe evening of the future.

454
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,640
I was Might Dor amen.

455
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:14,960
That's it, these various businesses

456
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:17,580


457
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:24,800
use the magic of anti-technology to drop in this lovely little hymn, this old

458
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:28,840
traditional church hymn from Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.

459
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,820
Let me see a block of birds, take a bob, take a bob.

460
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,340
When you just run out.

461
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,000
When you hear a given call.

462
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:27,940
When you write checks for one dollar, take a bob, take a bob.

463
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,920
When you write to the subgenius, take a bob, take a bob.

464
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,120
B.O. Box 1403-06, take a bob.

465
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,600
When you cast your mojo hexes.

466
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,520
When you ride through Dallas, Texas.

467
00:21:40,580 --> 00:21:44,260
When you are dyslexic, take a bob, take a bob.

468
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,240
One dollar.

469
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:49,240
One dollar.

470
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,320
One dollar.

471
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:51,400
One dollar.

472
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,260
One dollar.

473
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,620
One dollar.

474
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,320
Wotan.

475
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:56,840
Noway.

476
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,740
Noway.

477
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:01,620
Wotan.

478
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:09,800
Well, we're back.

479
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,380
Back.

480
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,320
This we are.

481
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,200
Back in front of the people with our tongues hanging out.

482
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:17,560
We're right where they can see you.

483
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:17,560


484
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:27,640
see him and hear him like hanging your dirty clothes over here somewhere hanging things out

485
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:34,380
would you flip that switch for me there no i can't flip any more switches hold it all right

486
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:43,240
trying to get that thing to work sorry friends you haven't sent your money in and that's why

487
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:47,780
i don't know phylo drummond can't push that switch doug do you have another greener piece

488
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:54,440
to this planet forever yes dr drummond has his hand near a switch i think that could bring you

489
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:59,640
to eternal orgasm for the rest of your life i had about 50 cents i could get this thing working

490
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:07,120
that's right but these these faithless listeners won't believe enough they can they they want to

491
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:13,180
believe some but they can't believe enough about bob and about slack

492
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:24,400
kind of kick itself over you know sometimes because these people just had a tape deck once

493
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:28,700
it had a case and if they would send their money we'd be able to start to get up on the side of it

494
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:34,000
we'd jump down on that kick start that show that that tape deck would turn over it sputtered a

495
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:39,500
little bit but but then after a little while a few kicks it'd come on and it did take us where

496
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:43,120
we wanted to go but you know sometimes oiled machine that

497
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:49,780
would kick start would just come back and knock the living p wadden out of you son i'll tell you

498
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:55,920
i didn't know what to do and and we've got the same bruise on me about the size of your head

499
00:23:55,920 --> 00:24:00,320
until it's not that big but i understand that but for the size of bruise it's pretty

500
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:08,120
pretty hefty sized bruise i appreciate that dr drummond but in the meantime what about their

501
00:24:08,120 --> 00:24:13,100
money what about your money well for 50 cents and what what do you 50 cents i would

502
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:18,100
oh well i won't say that i would well i wouldn't say i would do anything that was illegal

503
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:22,900
or anything like that but i would do something that probably would appall some people

504
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:29,940
and and it might not even be for my own gratification for some type of

505
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:37,000
mental or spiritual stimulation oh now is it for mental or spiritual stimulation that we hear about

506
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:43,120
kidnapped children for instance right showing up at dobbs town this is for mental stimulation we've

00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,160
P P Dog Strut.

552
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,860
P P Dog Strut.

553
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,720
P P Dog Strut.

554
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:42,200
Don't want you to long walk like P Dog.

555
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,040
P P Dog Strut.

556
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:46,000
P P Dog Strut.

557
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:49,600
P P Dog Strut.

558
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,080
P P Dog Strut.

559
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,280
I want you to let your victory run out of your pants like P Dog.

560
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,280
P P Dog Strut.

561
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:03,520

580
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:05,540
has certain esoteric and psychos...

581
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:09,700
So there is a disease associated with the church, I understand,

582
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:14,440
that causes symptoms such as enlargement of the head,

583
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:19,900
a hacking cough, and the ambusotic behavior.

584
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:22,660
Some people have also referred to this as the cough of power

585
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:25,760
because it does indeed take very powerful sublungs

586
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,560
to eject the amount of phlegm and mucus that does seem to accompany it.

587
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,960
This is part of your religion.

588
00:35:32,220 --> 00:35:34,780
And it is a maneuver. It is something that is planned

589
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:37,360
and also is on some type of agenda.

590
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,300
The U.S. Army teaches this maneuver.

591
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,860
It has something to do with...

592
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:46,660
A coughing maneuver that has to do with drugs smuggled out by your church out of Malaysia.

593
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:49,660
Correct. Because you see, in the Far East,

594
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:53,260
these gentlemen, these soldiers of our country,

595
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,200
can get thrown in some of these Oriental prisons,

596
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,680
and this maneuver can come in handy in an escape situation.

597
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,480
Doctor.

598
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:03,620
Doctor Drummond, do you have got any answer to any of my charges?

599
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:11,180
We do understand that a prisoner's first right and privilege is to escape.

600
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:17,460
And that is indeed what we did there in Malaysia prior to founding Dobstown.

601
00:36:17,620 --> 00:36:21,680
Bob and I were sequestered in a solitary confinement.

602
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,300
You and Bob Dobst himself?

603
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,280
We spoke to each other. Yes, of course.

604
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,640
Who else? Bob. I wouldn't refer to any other Bob by the name Bob.

605
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,420
What's wrong with you?

606
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,520
I'm sorry.

607
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,360
And Bob and I were...

608
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:37,780
We were in solitary confinement in a Japanese prisoner of war camp.

609
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,980
See these prisoners?

610
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,460
These Japanese were...

611
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,140
Never got the word that we had...

612
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,100
The war was won.

613
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,300
Now, I understand that Bob Dobst had magic powers.

614
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,340
If Bob had magic powers, Dr. Philodrum,

615
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:55,720
and why were you imprisoned by the Japanese?

616
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,800
Bob did indeed have magic powers, but...

617
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,760
He didn't utilize them all the time.

618
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,420
And is this what you tell your followers?

619
00:37:07,500 --> 00:37:10,020
That Bob has magic powers, but he doesn't utilize them?

620
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:12,580
Do you mind if I use this razor blade to slit your nostril?

621
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,560
Excuse me, Dr. Drummond.

622
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:16,500
I need a blood sample. I need a blood sample.

623
00:37:16,500 --> 00:37:16,880
Is that a threat?

624
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,660
Of course not. I need a blood sample for my experiment.

625
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,520
We're on the radio right now.

626
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,140
My experiment. This is an on-the-radio experiment.

627
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,000
No, you may not slice my nostril with that razor blade, Dr. Drummond.

628
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:27,800
Did you ever see that?

629
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:28,340
Are you a doctor?

630
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:29,460
I'm actually a doctor.

631
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:30,140
Yes, I am.

632
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,660
Where does your doctorate come from?

633
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,220
See, let me show you this.

634
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,940
Dr. Drummond, you're reaching into your pocket.

635
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:40,600
And show me some sort of little card.

636
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,120
See, here it is here.

637
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:44,580
See? Certified.

638
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,780
Dobstown Community College.

639
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:49,660
Doctorate of brain surgery.

640
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:53,840
That looks patently fake, Dr. Drummond.

641
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,460
Uh, Dobstown is not an accredited school.

642
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:57,700
It is designed to look fake.

643
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:58,320
I looked into this.

644
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,900
Believe me, I did my research before this show.

645
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,780
Apparently a little bit more than you did.

646
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,940
Now, and this music in the background.

647
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,240
This is your claiming.

648
00:38:08,300 --> 00:38:11,140
You make your followers listen to this music.

649
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,560
Hold it right here. Just a minute.

650
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,180
I have a...

651
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:17,360
Well, Dr. Drummond has just fled from the studio.

652
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,280
Apparently he can't answer any of our questions.

653
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:23,540
Coming back right now.

654
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:28,300
And this music, if you want to call it that, is something that Dr. Drummond has been doing for a long time.

655
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:28,300


656
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:28,300


657
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:28,300


658
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:31,780
Dr. Drummond claims is a healing music.

659
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,480
Earth was inhabited by a species from another dimension.

660
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,260
With certain chants from the book, sacrifices.

661
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,760
This race, the old ones, can be brought back.

662
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:49,700
And mankind?

663
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,100
Destroyed.

664
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,360
As I entered the bedroom,

665
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:57,360
there were two elderly albino women,

666
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,320
robed entirely in black.

667
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,020
Standing.

668
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,180
Lavinia's insides were all torn up.

669
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:06,860
These whites.

670
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,240
These whites and...

671
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,580
Fertility rites were practiced here.

672
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,860
So they say.

673
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,460
Is this an altar?

674
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:20,720
Yes.

675
00:39:22,940 --> 00:39:24,600
What was it used for?

676
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,420
Halloween!

677
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:27,360


678
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,000
Halloween!

679
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,180
Halloween!

680
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,160
Halloween!

681
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,900
Brothers and sisters,

682
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,960
I want you to put down your frock.

683
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,180
Get those chainsaws and open up your ears.

684
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,840
And listen to this story.

685
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:03,380
In the vast continuity of school park

686
00:40:05,300 --> 00:40:08,720
There seemed to be evil within

687
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,080
There were people there

688
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,780
With sensible heels

689
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,720
And there were children there

690
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:24,660
With no wounds of distinction

691
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:29,840
There were women there

692
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:33,480
Who were thought of as virtuous

693
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:38,520
For they contained the blood

694
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:42,780
Of the ruling class

695
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:46,380
Of Sewell Park

696
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,980
I said men cried

697
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:00,800
Babies died

698

Children fell

Children fell

703
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:28,980
Women suffered

704
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,760
People wanted repentance

705
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,440
And victims

706
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,260
They wanted to escape

707
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:44,120
Yeah they just wanted to escape

708
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:50,020
You should know about it

709
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:55,920
He should know about it

710
00:41:58,300 --> 00:42:01,060
He should know about Sewell Park

711
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,840
And the winter solstice

712
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:15,720
I said men cried

713
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:20,500
Babies died

00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:27,200


720
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:28,140
People were hurt

721
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,600
Babies died

00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,080
Thank you.

739
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:59,080
Thank you.

740
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:28,140
Thank you.

741
00:47:57,020 --> 00:48:02,100
system let us say I'm playing devil's advocate tonight I guess I guess we can say that uh

742
00:48:02,100 --> 00:48:09,600
reverend staying here refuses to admit he is actually I am not denying Bob at this point

743
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:15,880
in time denying Bob denying the belief system established by our guru our beloved

744
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:22,380
what about what about the time that you split with Dobbs and formed your own schismatic

745
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:28,560
dramatic drumundian church I imagine I will take an aside here to the radio audience I'll

746
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:34,420
imagine that reverend staying doesn't realize that it was he who instigated this split and

747
00:48:34,420 --> 00:48:39,400
he and I were partners in this split of course after Bob spoke with us we realized the error

748
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:44,720
of our ways and and came back to the mother our father church I might say and and have

749
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:47,520
and have been faithful members and followers ever since

750
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,320
the minority

751
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,240
the minority

752
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:52,360
the minority

753
00:48:52,380 --> 00:49:00,460
the minority

754
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:03,300
Conspiracy 2, of course, will mind control their country.

755
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:07,080
All nations are using this subliminal silent radio technique

756
00:49:07,080 --> 00:49:10,680
in warped and degenerate psychosexual experiments of their own citizens.

757
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:14,660
The youth of these affected countries will be more disturbed and dangerous

758
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:17,260
than your most foul and hideous nightmares.

759
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,760
This should be more proof to use of geni that humans,

760
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,460
or normals themselves, are intrinsically evil and perverted.

761
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,500
You are saying that ordinary humans are evil and perverted?

762
00:49:28,580 --> 00:49:29,180
Yes, I am.

763
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:30,940
This is the basis for your church.

764
00:49:31,340 --> 00:49:31,800
No, no, no.

765
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:35,000
This seems like a hate doctrine of some kind.

766
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:38,740
Is this not a minority hate church where you feel that you are persecuted?

767
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,080
Well, let's not say hate. We don't hate in any way.

768
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,460
Let's just say this is extreme dislike.

769
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,720
You don't need to speak so close to the microphone.

770
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:46,840
Oh, okay, I'm sorry.

771
00:49:47,060 --> 00:49:47,800
You can...

772
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,540
You can...

773
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:50,960
Hmm.

774
00:49:52,120 --> 00:49:55,060
So I have also put this track together

775
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,260
so that we can tell the people of the world

776
00:49:57,860 --> 00:49:59,160
those poor dudes...

777
00:49:59,180 --> 00:50:01,920
Oops, there are being mind-controlled at this point in time by a sign of radio.

778
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,220
You sell this little track for $20 in airports?

779
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:06,960
No, this is free. This is free.

780
00:50:06,980 --> 00:50:09,380
It's shocking to discover that every single large corporation

781
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,000
in all colleges in the world,

782
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:13,440
with the possible exception of Dobbs Down Community College,

783
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:15,880
have super-secret mind-control departments

784
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:19,140
who cooperate for big money from the conspiracy

785
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:20,720
in mind-control experiments.

786
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:25,680
If you or someone you know consistently make stupid, horrible, crazy decisions

787
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,700
and have ruinous problems,

788
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:29,160
you or they might begin...

789
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:32,200
to be a guinea pig in these evil, insidious, mind-warping tortures.

790
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,380
Each year, these silent radio dupes

791
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:36,940
are going down the economic, social, and mental ladders

792
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,920
because they can no longer be trusted.

793
00:50:39,100 --> 00:50:42,740
No corporation knows when one will be selected as a guinea pig.

794
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:45,100
So many of them are not being hired or promoted

795
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:46,860
because of their electronic hearing handicap.

796
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:49,480
Electronic hearing handicap.

797
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:51,720
Yes, that is indeed an electronic hearing handicap.

798
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:54,980
Their bosses think that they talk to walls and hear unknown voices.

799
00:50:55,820 --> 00:50:58,440
You can imagine yourself if you were a store owner

800
00:50:58,440 --> 00:50:59,140
who would like to be a guinea pig.

801
00:50:59,140 --> 00:50:59,140


802
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:00,640
You would be able to hire someone talking to walls

803
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:01,800
or hearing unknown voices.

804
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:05,320
Who would risk a sizable workforce of persons

805
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:08,620
who on a moment's notice will start furiously working for their competitor,

806
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,100
who in turn could easily wipe you out?

807
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:14,720
The fear of the government using your group as a group experiment

808
00:51:14,720 --> 00:51:16,900
limits how many you could or would promote.

809
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:21,500
It's become a tough, cruel world for our electronic hearing citizens.

810
00:51:22,040 --> 00:51:23,920
Do you realize that, Reverend Stagg?

811
00:51:23,960 --> 00:51:25,300
No, I think this is all a...

812
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:27,360
And I'm glad that you've called us here tonight

813
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:27,860
to let us...

814
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,840
I consider this...

815
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,480
This man is not speaking for his station.

816
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:35,080
This man is speaking for his own foolish opinion.

817
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,980
...now subliminally controlled by the silent radio.

818
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:40,680
And all these years thinking they were insane

819
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,820
because of those voices talking in their head

820
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:45,880
now can realize that the government actually...

821
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,520
The government...

822
00:51:48,180 --> 00:51:51,340
All are taught that a person who hears a voice is automatically insane.

823
00:51:51,600 --> 00:51:53,600
As the advancement of the silent radio increases,

824
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:56,140
more and more persons are hearing silent radio voices,

825
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:58,820
thus explaining the proliferation of apparently insane people.

826
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,440
...TV preachers...

827
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,240
Dr. Drummond, let me ask you something.

828
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:01,460
And anchor people...

829
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:02,060
And use anchor people...

830
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,860
Do you hear these voices yourself?

831
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:05,100
Of course not.

832
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:06,640
You don't hear the silence.

833
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:07,960
Not the silence.

834
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:08,320
How do you...

835
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:08,600
Why do you believe...

836
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:09,300
I do hear voices.

837
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:10,360
I do indeed hear voices.

838
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,120
What evidence do you have that you do hear voices?

839
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,360
And what do these voices say to you?

840
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:17,660
It's a terrible shame that the media only serves to cover up this national security measure...

841
00:52:17,660 --> 00:52:18,580
What do these voices say to you, Dr. Drummond?

842
00:52:18,580 --> 00:52:21,200
...while they service up a diet of needless sporting events...

843
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:21,360
Voices.

844
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,420
...and contrived international political situations...

845
00:52:23,420 --> 00:52:23,520
Voices in your head.

846
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,300
...designed to distract even the most brilliant humans

847
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,240
into complete and total docility.

848
00:52:28,840 --> 00:52:32,020
Don't you think that's what you're trying to do right now, Dr. Drummond,

849
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,960
with this combination of this weird music...

850
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:37,660
Reverend Stern, let me tell you.

851
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,020
Let me tell you, Reverend Stern.

852
00:52:39,080 --> 00:52:41,980
It is very commonplace to find silent radio receivers

853
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:44,680
in dental fillings, eyeglass frames...

854
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,420
Dental fillings.

855
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,300
...pencils...

856
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:47,560
Radio transmitters.

857
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:48,840
...and earrings to ensure communications.

858
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,640
For group experiments, entire rooms and even buildings

859
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:53,120
have been wired to ensure communications.

860
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:53,960
Do you think we're wired right now?

861
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:58,000
Do you think I'm wired on some sort of silent radio bug device?

862
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:58,460
Obviously.

863
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,960
There's no need to wire since we're going over the free airwaves

864
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:04,280
of this wonderful country that we live in.

865
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:06,020
You're a patriot, right, Dr. Drummond?

866
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,020
Of course I'm a patriot.

867
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:08,320
Every American...

868
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,520
This is an all-American subgenius church, right?

869
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,580
That's not to say that...

870
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:14,480
What about the FBI files and the CIA files

871
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:17,020
that call the church of the subgenius

872
00:53:17,020 --> 00:53:21,780
the most subversive organization on ice-cold

873
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,220
from the FBI paper's file?

874
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,820
The church of the subgenius is the most subversive organization

875
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,440
known to this subversive organization.

876
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,180
Can you tell me that, Reverend Stang?

877
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:37,040
Why do you think those fast food restaurants have been wired?

878
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:39,560
And why do you think they advertise so heavily?

879
00:53:39,840 --> 00:53:42,660
No, I don't believe that they do at all advertise so heavily.

880
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,100
I mean, this has nothing to do with your maniacal theory

881
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:50,420
about some silent radio voices in your head.

882
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,700
What do your voices tell you, Dr. Drummond?

883
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,180
Turn that insipid music down.

884
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,520
I have something to tell you.

885
00:53:55,540 --> 00:53:57,100
If you or your group is in an experiment,

886
00:53:57,100 --> 00:54:00,120
you shall be placed under 24-hour surveillance.

887
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,760
There is virtually no escape from their influence.

888
00:54:03,060 --> 00:54:05,540
First, almost all street lights and traffic lights

889
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:08,420
are infrared TV cameras specifically designed for surveillance,

890
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,260
just like in Orwell's 1984.

891
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:14,380
The TV sets are actually cameras watching and analyzing you

892
00:54:14,380 --> 00:54:16,580
even when they are off.

893
00:54:17,060 --> 00:54:19,300
They hear all, see all, tell all.

894
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,460
Most of our freedoms are being stolen from us

895
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,820
as a cover-up of the silent radio than anything else in history.

896
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:26,600
Not one word of this has ever appeared on print before,

897
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:27,080
nor is there ever a word of this ever appeared on print before,

898
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:27,820
nor is it a national secret.

899
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,980
And why haven't you been killed if this is so long?

900
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,980
This is another example of the self-censorship...

901
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,760
well, we only printed these up last Friday.

902
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:34,700
Aw.

903
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,440
This is another example of the self-censorship...

904
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:41,920
Do you think you're going to save the world or something on your subgenius crusade, Dr. Drummond?

905
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,120
...who are in terror, satisfying the lusts

906
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:45,160
of the all-powerful conspiracy?

907
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:49,120
Well, what about your all-powerful lust, Dr. Drummond?

908
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:53,540
These evil, cruel, sadistic mind-control experiments

909
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,480
demonstrate the total lack of compassion or morality

910
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:04,980
within the conspiracy because the conspiracy fear not one organization until now will attack the

911
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:10,160
policies of politicians who control these experiments reverend stang for their own sick

912
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:16,020
twisted humor the aclu states they know nothing about the silent mind rate mind control radio

913
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:22,320
