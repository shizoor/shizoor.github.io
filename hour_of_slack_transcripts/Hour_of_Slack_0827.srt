1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,260
This won't make too much sense, but it's not intended to.

2
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,040
In virtually every case of tracing the lube pictures to the point of production,

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,220
investigating officers were able to link the small-time peddlers to their distributor.

4
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:17,620
The Subgenius Hour of Swatch!

5
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:27,920
But let's leave things of this world behind

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:34,980
and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief minute of slack from the Church of the Subgenius.

7
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,000
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is Reverend Ivan Stang with the facts.

8
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:41,060
That's right, the facts.

9
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,920
But why are you so hung up on facts, my friend?

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:47,800
The Church of the Subgenius, unlike the conspiracy that you serve now,

11
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,900
does not confuse you with so-called, quote, facts, unquote.

12
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:55,140
There are no facts to the enlightened man.

13
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,900
To one trained in the church by Bob Dobbs,

14
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,940
ultimate truth can be found in a potato, in a comic book,

15
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:04,940
or at the bottom of a bottle of liquid slack.

16
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:07,560
Because, friends, slack is what comes first.

17
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,200
Yes, slack must come even before truth.

18
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:14,240
So why are you letting the experts pull the wool over your eyes?

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:17,340
Forget the facts, friends, and do like Bob.

20
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,120
Pull the wool over your own eyes and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

21
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:27,760
This is your only hope, my friend, if you wish to unravel the punchline to the joke.

22
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,740
Of life.

23
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,520
Let there be slack.

24
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,300
Ha ha

25
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,700
Ha ha

26
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:15,180
Ha ha

27
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,500
Ha ha

28
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,120
Ha ha

29
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,520
Ha ha

30
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:54,880
Ha ha

31
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:54,880


32
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,300
Ha ha

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,100
Ha ha

34
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,680
Let there be slack

35
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,740
What's it at, Bob?

36
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,520
Well, Bob, another lie

37
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,580
Where is it, Bob?

38
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,120
Where the fuck is it?

39
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, Bob, another lie

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,560
Well, another lie

41
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,800
Fucking liar

42
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,560
Well, Bob

43
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,700
Well, Bob

44
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,100
Well, Bob

45
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,100


46
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:25,680
Bob

47
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,060
Bob

48
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,060


49
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:26,140
Bob

50
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:26,140


51
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:27,900
Bob

52
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,300
On the highway, on the people's meeting

53
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,400
Shed a smile on the man, what a bitter hit

54
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,540
Roadrunner, roadrunner, runs the road all day

55
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,400
Even the coyote can't make a change his ways

56
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,960
Roadrunner, the coyote's after you

57
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:44,480
Roadrunner, if he catches you

58
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,900
Roadrunner, the coyote's after you

59
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,380
Roadrunner, if he catches you

60
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,960
The coyote's really a crazy clown

61
00:03:53,940 --> 00:03:56,160
When will he learn that he never can go in and out?

62
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,560
Roadrunner, who little roadrunner never bothers anyone

63
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,760
He's open and uncool to his idea having fun

64
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,480
Jidididoo, jididididididoo

65
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,340
Jidididididididoo, jidididididididoo

66
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,500
Disgusting.

67
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,280
Sire, the situation is...

68
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:53,220
We're here at the International Festival for those who have gone too far.

69
00:04:53,960 --> 00:05:00,500
The Lois, the band serenades the Fools as they dance on the empty glass sea of mischief.

70
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:14,180
Yes, it's an exciting day here at the Fool Symposium.

71
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,780
Ah, here comes the President's limousine.

72
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,820
Dumping the dirt.

73
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,200
On the freeway of success.

74
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,400
And there's his curly-headed wife playing the bass drum.

75
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,340
And the small but polite audience.

76
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,480
Of those who don't know any better.

77
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,640
Sire, the situation is...

78
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,180
We're here to see what science.

79
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,620
Sire, the situation is yeah!

80
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:12,440


81
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:13,360
Adam O'Gerer at the Fools.

82
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:18,500
A prêt-à-vis.

83
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:18,700


84
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:18,700


85
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:21,600
With smoke and burning smoke, I'm always awake, notice things my dreams.

86
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:21,600


87
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,920
That was your day.

88
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,440
guitar solo

89
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,940
guitar solo

90
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,960
guitar solo

91
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,280

93
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,200
guitar solo

94
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,280
guitar solo

98
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,260
guitar solo

99
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,880
guitar solo

100
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:27,880
guitar solo

101
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:27,880


102
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:34,040
guitar solo

103
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,620
guitar solo

104
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:39,620


105
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:39,620


106
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:39,620


107
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:42,880
guitar solo

108
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,180
guitar solo

109
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:43,180


110
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,900
Yes, dear friends. Well, it's not

111
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,880
the usual hour

112
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,860
of slack number 827,

113
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,000
is it?

114
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,200
But it

115
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:52,440
sure

116
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,500
is slack. All that

117
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,760
sure was slack to me. I have

118
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,440
steadfastly

119
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,420
maintained that the band

120
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,740
that covers TV themes

121
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,240
metal style will

122
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,780
rule this world.

123
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,360
Actually, instead,

124
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,680
that was several bands all collected

125
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:12,400
together by Pater

126
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,340
Nostril and

127
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,680
mixed in with the old subgenius

128
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,380
Media Barrage No. 5

129
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:20,900
and recent alt binaries

130
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,040
dot slack.

131
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:23,720
Contributions all

132
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:24,900
years.

133
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,420
Anyway, friends,

134
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,560
Hee Haw was done by

135
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,940
Butt Trumpet.

136
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,340
We heard a little bit of collage from

137
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:36,020
Fernanda Nandeli-Mur.

138
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,280
Roadrunner theme

139
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,720
was by Boris the Sprinkler.

140
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,740
That's disgusting

141
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,400
was the Byron

142
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,560
Gosh group. We heard

143
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,160
a little bit about the

144
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,920
International Festival of

145
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,280
Fools, so to speak. That was an

146
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,080
ancient, ancient puzzling

147
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:54,980
evidence recording.

148
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,920
Horton Heat did the theme

149
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,180
from Johnny Quest.

150
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,920
Hey Hey Were the Monkeys

151
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:04,100
was by Furious

152
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,900
George. Mission

153
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,920
Impossible was by The Meat

154
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,780
Men. Get Smart by

155
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,800
Agent Orange.

156
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:14,020
Hawaii Five-O by F.U.

157
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:16,400
And Bewitched

158
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
there was by

159
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,960
Brutal Juice. I know

160
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,160
those guys.

161
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,340
One of the

162
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,640
if you own a Bob

163
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:26,740
anti Bob T-shirt, the guitar

164
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,560
player of Brutal Juice probably

165
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,840
silk screened it and

166
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:32,820
no use for a name

167
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,760
did the Munsters.

168
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:37,120
Friends coming up, an LSD

169
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,740

00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:40,820
Jack Webb and a band

171
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,820
called Incliterati

172
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,960

Marka I dig vigil on

178
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:53,700
because it comes and goes

179
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:55,520
a little slow.

180
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:21,900

or ingest it in any way they bought the farm

193
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,440
LSD

194
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:54,220
opens the door to your mind you live out every experience no matter how bizarre you create your

195
00:16:54,220 --> 00:17:04,340
own brave new world brave new world that beautiful world of LSD LSD opens the door to your mind when

196
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:10,160
you flip out on an acid trip you never know when you're gonna slip out again marijuana is

197
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,340
a narcotic I don't blow weed I drop acid that's preposterous marijuana is a narcotic

198
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:24,600
so high on LSD they couldn't even remember how to feed themselves I'm the expert here you're not

199
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:34,860
marijuana is the flame heroin is the fuse LSD is the bomb that beautiful world of LSD I don't blow

200
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:44,500
weed I drop acid delinquents weirdos hippies pill heads freaks potheads I'm not just news my friend

201
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:48,640
I make news big news so did you?

202
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:48,820
do this

203
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,600
oh did you hear about

204
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:54,080
how our government is winning

205
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,860
has won I believe

206
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:57,840
we've won the war

207
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,740
we've won the war

208
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,980
the war on terrorism or the war on drugs

209
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,100
or the war on

210
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,280
intellectualism

211
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,420
well now

212
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,540
now I did hear that the

213
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,640
internet radio laws are going to

214
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,480
go into effect in about two weeks

215
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,060
which means

216
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,580
I'm only playing I will begin in two weeks time

217
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:23,040
when that starts, I will then start playing only my own music.

218
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,300
You know, that was what I was thinking.

219
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,100
That's what's happening on ESO radio.

220
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,220
It's like, well, okay, I wasn't playing very much conspiracy store bought.

221
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,420
I wasn't going to play my own music.

222
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:38,000
I was just playing this crap people would send in.

223
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:39,080
Send in.

224
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,200
Send in.

225
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,060
Oh, yeah.

226
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,400
I was here on the last tape.

227
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:51,820
This is where the little people come out and take your wallet.

228
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,320
Oh, well.

229
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,020
I didn't have much of my wallet that year anyway.

230
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,640
But I tried.

231
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,700
My family knows I tried.

232
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,460
They imported all of their insides to this side of the nation.

233
00:19:05,020 --> 00:19:06,300
And you know what happened?

234
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,400
The bottom fell out on them.

235
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:08,820
Yep.

236
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,500
It was coming across the great divide.

237
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,580
The bottom fell right out on them.

238
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:15,820
It was like Death Valley in 81.

239
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:17,940
Clogged up.

240
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,640
Choked up.

241
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,800
They elected to stay in a burned out motel south of Icewater.

242
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,580
Well, it was flying over Armpit.

243
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:31,720
Yeah, that was that place.

244
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,860
And the bottom fell out again.

245
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:37,980
But this time, because they had that previous experience,

246
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:46,960
they were able to use their survival guide in such a way to as not to hurt anybody.

247
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,520
As you can see here.

248
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,160
Here in this slide.

249
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:52,440
As they arrived at the Kewater International Airport.

250
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,660
With the entire party intact.

251
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,060
Except for the dog who was eaten three days out.

252
00:19:58,960 --> 00:19:59,460
Whoa.

253
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,120
And do you know what happened?

254
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,560
And do you know what happened?

255
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:10,320
Well, what I heard was they had a big fight over the little tiny wallets.

256
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,680
That was a very early tape.

257
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,000
Early 80s or late 70s.

258
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,880
By puzzling evidence.

259
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:17,540
Puzzling evidence.

260
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,360
Wrenched up.

261
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,140
From the old quarter inch tapes.

262
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,320
For a second life.

263
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:28,360
Shambling across the soon to be censored and strip mined internet.

264
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:35,620
And now the Ashcroft acid trance remix by Godrex.

265
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:42,560
Government officials, the Department of Defense, this secretary and the people that work with me.

266
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:48,360
To the extent anyone says anything that at any time proves to have been the truth.

267
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:51,220
They correct it at the earliest possible opportunity.

268
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,080
The Western land.

269
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,480
Guards see a freedom storm.

270
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,940
And the dudes that dance the watch fires.

271
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:01,380
Of a nation torn by war.

272
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,620
She's far too young to die.

273
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,720
You can see it in her eyes.

274
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,760
She's not yet begun to fly.

275
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,900
It's time to let the body eat.

276
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,460
The source of the power of the world.

277
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,360
The power of the world.

278
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,860
The power of the world.

279
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,900
The power of the world.

280
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,540
The power of the world.

281
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,440
Let the eagle soar.

282
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,920
Like she's never soared.

283
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:36,160
The power of the world.

284
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:38,780
War.

285
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:45,160
Let the mighty eagle soar.

286
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,700
He's here.

287
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:48,440
He's here.

288
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,900
He's here.

289
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:51,620
Amen.

290
00:21:53,280 --> 00:22:01,000
The power of the world.

291
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,400
Is he.

292
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,760
And now live receivers and banishers of evil.

293
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,580
Not we sheرب will be on the military side.

294
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:12,140
Our dessevered all you.

295
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,520
Too many more chiefs.

296
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,280
The 가장 principio.

297
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:30,380
I wish I was back in the alley

298
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:37,260
With all of my friends still running free

299
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:43,040
Hair growing out every hole in me

300
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:51,600
American way, how did it start?

301
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:54,600
Thousands of creeps killed in the park

302
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,460
American way, try and explain

303
00:22:57,460 --> 00:23:00,360
Scab of a nation driven insane

304
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,920
Don't try, gotta go bye-bye

305
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:08,180
Suddenly die, die

306
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,580
Cock, kill a creep, pow, pow, pow

307
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,840
Tomorrow I get to do it

308
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,540
It's a great example of creation

309
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,440
And the day I die

310
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:18,440


311
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,320
And the day after that

312
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,720
And the day after that

313
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,700
Hi boys and girls, I'm Jimmy Carl Black

314
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:24,940
And I'm the Indian of the group

315
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,560
Concentration mode

316
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:35,300
Over the camp in the valley

317
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,980
Concentration mode

318
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,960
Wish I was back in the alley

319
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:53,960
With all of my friends still running free

320
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,760
Hair growing out every hole in me

321
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,320
American way, threatened by us

322
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,260
Drag a few creeps away in a bus

323
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:14,160
American way, prisoner lock

324
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:17,160
Smash every creep in the face with a rock

325
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:18,440
Don't try, gotta go bye-bye

326
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,520
Gotta go bye-bye

327
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,780
Suddenly die, die

328
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,200
Cock, kill a creep, pow, pow, pow

329
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,480
Call us and talk about what you'd wish

330
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:31,880
Go ahead

331
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,200
I might point out that a lot of people worry about the one world government

332
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,620
That the conspiracy is trying to get across on us

333
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:41,800
And we suspect that the only thing that can fight a one world government

334
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,460
Is going to be a one world religion

335
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:45,580
And of course that's what the subgenius

336
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,420
The church of the subgenius is here for

337
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,440
All our love and care is for you

338
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:48,600
And we bless you

339
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


340
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


341
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


342
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


343
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


344
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


345
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


346
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


347
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


348
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:48,600


349
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,100
And other gods besides Jehovah

350
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,300
And youir son, Jesus Christ

351
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,320
Are strange gods

352
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,120
Sir, we absolutely believe in everything

353
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,880
We believe in it wholeheartedly

354
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,480
I feel happy

355
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:06,000
It is no a problem

356
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:17,780
Me startling

357
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:30,060
Give a man a free house and he'll bust out the windows

358
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:32,360
Put his family on food stamps

359
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:36,020
Now he's a big spender, no food on the table

360
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,940
And the bills ain't paid

361
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:41,280
Cause he's spending on cigarettes and PGA

362
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:44,140
They'll turn us all into beggars

363
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,960
Cause they're easier to please

364
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,880
They're feeding our people that government cheese

365
00:25:56,260 --> 00:26:00,920
Give a man free food and he'll figure out a way

366
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:02,960
To steal more than he can eat

367
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,860
Cause he doesn't have to pay

368
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:08,940
Give a woman free kids and you'll find them in the dirt

369
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,920
Learning how to carry on the family line of work

370
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:15,200
It's the man in the White House

371
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:15,940
The man in the White House

372
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,120
The man under the steeple

373
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,880
Passing out drugs to the American people

374
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,080
I don't believe in anything

375
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,920
Nothing is free

376
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:28,880
They're feeding our people that government cheese

377
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,040
Government

378
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,780
Cheese

379
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:36,060
Government

380
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,800
Cheese

381
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:40,000
Government

382
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,880
Yeah!

00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:05,480
Hypoc horrific

396
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:19,900
Give a man a free ticket on a dead-end ride

397
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:24,080
And he'll climb in the back even though nobody's driving

398
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:28,060
Too goddamn lazy to crawl out of the wreck

399
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:32,060
And he'll ride a while he waits up for the welfare check

400
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:36,020
Gone to hell in a handbag, can't you see?

401
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:40,020
I ain't gonna eat no government cheese

402
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,040
No government cheese

403
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:48,020
No government cheese

404
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,980
No government cheese

405
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:55,060
No cheese, no cheese, no cheese

406
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,120
The Rainmakers, dear friends.

407
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:13,160
A great old favorite band of mine from the day.

408
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,020
Uh...

409
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,820
They disbanded, unfortunately.

410
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:22,460
The subgenius-like person behind that band was named Bob Walkenhorst.

411
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:25,060
But you can still find, uh...

412
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:27,340
The Rainmakers here and there.

413
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:30,860
I'm gonna try to resurrect their great legend here

414
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:32,760
on the Hour of Slack.

415
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:33,460
Thank you.

416
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,200
Bobs.

417
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,720
Nay, bobs.

418
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,160
Na-na-na-nattering.

419
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,980
Na-na-na-nattering.

420
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,940
Na-na-na-nattering.

421
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:42,960
Na-na-na-nattering.

422
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:43,800
Nay, bobs.

423
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,900
Of negativism.

424
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,400
Nattering nay-bobs of negativism.

425
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:53,640
This pervasive policy of permissiveness has turned out to be a tragic mistake.

426
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,980
The relating of spiritual declension is never a pretty sight or a pretty picture.

427
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:08,460
Because as foolish as Bob gets, as foolish as Bob gets,

428
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,400
it's the wisdom of the ages.

429
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,880
It's the foolishness and the idiocy that has...

430
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:17,000
kept man from being, uh...

431
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,520
uh...

432
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,440
satisfied with his lot in life.

433
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:25,420
It is that stupidity which has caused man to build his great monuments,

434
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,160
his mighty, uh...

435
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:27,560
uh...

436
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,400
gas-powered engines and his nuclear reactors.

437
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,280
It is that which has given man his...

438
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:33,840
his...

439
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:37,580
his urge to master the entire Earth,

440
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,020
no matter how nice it was before.

441
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,180
And it is this mighty, uh...

442
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:43,820
sacred...

443
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,020
uh...

444
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,720
archetype of an urge of...

445
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:46,460
of...

446
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:46,900
that's...

447
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:48,580
that's in Bob and in all of us

448
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,200
that makes us want to smite our brothers.

449
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,920
And, friends, if it weren't for that,

450
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,260
where would us subgeniuses be?

451
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,400
We'd be like everybody else.

452
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,840
We'd be no different.

453
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:06,100
We'd have nothing to gripe about.

454
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,620
And without the mighty grunt power and the mighty hate,

455
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,460
the hate for the normal that we can feed,

456
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:18,860
the hate that can make us go out and earn something for nothing,

457
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:21,660
the hate that will make us, uh...

458
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,260
overcome every...

459
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,420
every last, uh...

460
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,280
conspiracy, uh...

461
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,060
attempt to...

462
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,300
to hold us down that there's ever been.

463
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,560
In the long run, we may stay poor and broke,

464
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,520
we may stay neurotic,

465
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:39,720
or whatever we started out as,

466
00:30:39,880 --> 00:30:41,540
or whatever we may fall into,

467
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,120
but by God,

468
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,740
we've got Bob and the hate!

469
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,820
And for that, we can hate him!

470
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,280
Hate him!

471
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:49,660
Hate him!

472
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:51,680
The professional pessimist.

473
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:55,960
In the past, he's been called the prophet of gloom and doom,

474
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,460
the troubadour of trouble,

475
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,500
the disciple of despair.

476
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:03,340
With the help of information which the suspect had given us,

477
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,120
we were able to round up three wholesalers

478
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:08,000
and another distributor of obscene books and photographs.

479
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,180
Each one of them was questioned thoroughly.

480
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,160
We ran into the same old routine.

481
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,100
They denied knowing...

482
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,120
anything about the man who was masterminding the racket,

483
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,680
or where it was operating from.

484
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,920
I know nothing!

485
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:18,980
Nothing!

486
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,340
Stakeouts were set up at locations

487
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:23,540
where sales and deliveries of obscene material

488
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,780
were known to have been made.

489
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,000
Nothing happened.

490
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,160
Yeah, voices.

491
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,160
Yeah.

492
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:36,640
Yeah.

493
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:37,140
Yes.

494
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,540
In the 100-level courses, they teach you...

495
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:43,060
They don't teach you how to reach self-actualism,

496
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,740
they just teach you it's there.

497
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:50,400
A carrot you will never taste.

498
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,380
Chaz and I were...

499
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:59,200
At first, we began to morosely think about

500
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,980
the fact that on your list of the top ten priorities in life,

501
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:08,140
getting laid is no longer even in the top ten.

502
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:08,540
No.

503
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:12,200
But things like just being able to go into the bathroom

504
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,100
and have a drink,

505
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:17,360
good, long, productive extra meditation.

506
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:21,460
That becomes more important the older you get.

507
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,960
Those basic things,

508
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,640
the things you started out with.

509
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,380
You know, there's a circle around the sun,

510
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,600
and it all comes right back around.

511
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,440
You end up being more concerned with

512
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:39,880
just being able to eat and get it out of you again.

513
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,540
Yeah, and that it doesn't come back up as...

514
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:45,360
some other form.

515
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,020
And just, you know...

516
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,040
Some other way.

517
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:50,560
If somebody would just change your diapers,

518
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:52,940
your back wouldn't hurt.

519
00:32:53,160 --> 00:32:54,860
They'd just roll you over.

520
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,040
You wouldn't be so out of balance.

521
00:32:58,300 --> 00:32:58,900
No.

522
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:01,080
But, you know, when you're young,

523
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,740
you know that you're never going to get old,

524
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:07,080
and everything is...

525
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,040
It's just going to go on...

526
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,660
No, it's right.

527
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:11,020
Forever.

528
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,720
You don't have to worry about...

529
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:14,300
sleep or food.

530
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:15,260
Don't sleep.

531
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,180
Or crap.

532
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,720
I don't do that now.

533
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,160
Peeing is just like breathing.

534
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:21,900
It's the easiest thing in the world.

535
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,620
You're concerned with lofty things,

536
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,880
like getting laid,

537
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,960
or how you look,

538
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,240
getting a good haircut,

539
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:32,240
having a cool scene, you know?

540
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:35,320
Listening to the right music.

541
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,840
Hey, for winter style,

542
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,300
I've got to get a microphone on me

543
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,100
with a big reverb so I can play this.

544
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,640
Your priorities change.

545
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,360
You know?

546
00:33:43,500 --> 00:33:43,800
Oh, yeah.

547
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,180
Nice cutscene.

548
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,140
Yeah.

549
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:49,840
Chaz is more concerned about his tools.

550
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,080
Yeah, I'm a mechanic.

551
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,800
I kind of like the mechanic.

552
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:55,980
You know, it's...

553
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,040
Well, at a certain age,

554
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,640
you realize what's important in your life,

555
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,760
keeping your tools in good shape.

556
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,320
Yeah, indeed.

557
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,660
I spend a...

558
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,160
Use it or lose it.

559
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,620
I spend several days a month

560
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:12,180
doing nothing but taking care of my...

561
00:34:12,180 --> 00:34:12,980
I don't want to go.

562
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,440
Well, use it or lose it.

563
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:15,740
That's right.

564
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:18,320
I even do that crackpot thing

565
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,640
that they call exercise.

566
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,060
That's such a silly...

567
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:22,960
I mean, it's so pointless.

568
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,160
It just makes you hurt.

569
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:27,000
I mean, theoretically, exercise

570
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,460
is supposed to, like, make you healthy, right?

571
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,720
Yeah, right.

572
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,300
Well, then why does it hurt?

573
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,280
No pain, no gain.

574
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,380
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

575
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:37,860
Well, it was hurting already.

576
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,860
Now it hurts worse when I exercise.

577
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,020
What does that tell you?

578
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,440
No pain, no gain there.

579
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:42,980
Good.

580
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:43,960
It's a scam, dude.

581
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,260
Right.

582
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,620
No, you could get the same benefit

583
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:49,260
if you just...

584
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,560
If once a year,

585
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:51,880
once every three years,

586
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,200
you walked from the east coast

587
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,260
to the west coast and back,

588
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:56,900
you get the same benefit

589
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,480
as all those memberships

590
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,000
to all those clubs you belong to.

591
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:00,980
Yeah, just once a year.

592
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,340
Takes a little time out.

593
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:02,780
That's right.

594
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:04,420
You get the same benefit.

595
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,960
You don't need all that highfalutin equipment

596
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,400
and the Stairmasters and all that stuff.

597
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,740
Talk about a stupid thing.

598
00:35:11,740 --> 00:35:11,940
Dang.

599
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:13,580
A Stairmaster?

600
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:15,180
You're just trying to...

601
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,120
You're going to spend a hundred of dollars

602
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:18,000
to walk up and down a damn stairs.

603
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,760
It's just trying to take care of your tools,

604
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:23,080
you know,

605
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:25,220
keeping the tools in good shape.

606
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,000
After a while,

607
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:27,680
you start realizing,

608
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,160
oh, this shell that I carry around

609
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:31,800
and wake up in every morning.

610
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,640
It is a tool

611
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:37,840
and it is requiring some upkeep and repair.

612
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,920
Oh, they don't...

613
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,740
You can't get a replacement for that?

614
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:41,540
Oh.

615
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:43,580
You mean that tooth is gone forever?

616
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:44,700
Yeah.

617
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:47,120
Oh, you mean that cheekbone is gone forever?

618
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,260
My nut is gone forever.

619
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,680
Hey, that's not funny, Chad.

620
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,340
One like Hitler.

621
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,500
My hair is gone forever.

622
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,440
Yeah, man.

623
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,320
Oh, I thank God for that.

624
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:05,580
Or my friend is gone forever.

625
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,080
That's true, too, right there.

626
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:08,820
My brother is gone forever.

627
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,040
You know, relatives.

628
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,780
My scene, my trendy...

629
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:17,580
My haircut is gone forever.

630
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:18,160
That's right.

631
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,780
My coolness is gone forever.

632
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,540
I lost my hair.

633
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:24,060
You're not Dave.

634
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:24,900
You're not me, Dave.

635
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,900
My Dave is gone.

636
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,560
Alerts and...

637
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:30,240
First, let us ask,

638
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,740
does zombie Dave have beliefs?

639
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,820
It seems to me he does.

640
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:37,200
If we ask him where his car is,

641
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,080
he'll tell us that it's in the driveway.

642
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,720
If we ask him whether he likes basketball,

643
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,780
he tells us that he does.

644
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,440
Even if one resists the idea

645
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,000
that zombie Dave has beliefs,

646
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,820
we can still use him

647
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,520
to show that slack cannot be

648
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,620
the primary mechanism

649
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:55,180
in the self-description of our mental state.

650
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:55,980
That's blasphemy.

651
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,300
Well, this is from a disposition

652
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:00,840
on the psychological zombie,

653
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:01,920
or P-zombie.

654
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,740
I'd be careful about some of that stuff.

655
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:04,780
As it's known in the literature.

656
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:07,320
I don't feel comfortable with that.

657
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,340
There's a whole philosophical literature

658
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:11,720
on what are called P-zombies.

659
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:12,120
P-zombies.

660
00:37:14,120 --> 00:37:16,460
They look just like you or me,

661
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:18,520
but they have no consciousness to be.

662
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:20,000
Yeah, those are like the manger babies?

663
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,900
Not quite.

664
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:22,760
P-zombies...

665
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,480
Did you see that manger babies episode of Hank Hill?

666
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:27,120
The mangy babies?

667
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,400
Yes, that's right.

668
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:31,260
You know that she can put her toes behind her ears?

669
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:34,460
The Christian cousin-in-law there

670
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:38,040
was doing a cable TV show

671
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:41,220
of a Christian children's show.

672
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:41,720
That's amazing.

673
00:37:41,740 --> 00:37:42,340
It was so fun.

674
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:45,640
She was ready to send them all off the cliff

675
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,840
in a burning wreckage.

676
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:51,020
I sometimes wonder why that's an animated cartoon.

677
00:37:52,220 --> 00:37:54,380
Why do they draw them?

678
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,000
It's real.

679
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,380
I mean, the people are saying those words.

680
00:37:57,660 --> 00:37:58,460
They keep coming from Garland.

681
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,280
Those people...

682
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,800
Now there's actors and actresses out of work

683
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,380
because they don't have jobs.

684
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,720
They stopped using it,

685
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,460
and they loosed it.

686
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:14,200
They're not working.

687
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:14,760
They're not working.

688
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,340
They're not working.

689
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:15,340


690
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:17,100
It's all out of balance, kids.

691
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,000
Everything is out of balance.

692
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:25,520
It can get so out of balance

693
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,760
that you become pea-shy.

694
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,520
That where the most,

695
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,180
the most simple,

696
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,520
most taken-for-granted aspects

697
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,980
of your whole life

698
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,820
become a real challenge.

699
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,720
Imagine the plight of the people.

700
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,320
Pea-shy.

701
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:45,280
Pea zombies, nothing, man.

702
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:48,960
At least then you know what the problem is.

703
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,100
Yeah.

704
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,360
The pea-shy.

705
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,300
Think about that.

706
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,740
Think about it.

707
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,800
It starts with not wanting that guy,

708
00:38:58,860 --> 00:39:00,480
the urinal next to you,

709
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,260
looking the way he is.

710
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:04,660
And you can't just let loose

711
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:06,460
when that guy's standing there.

712
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,140
Daring at my pee-pee.

713
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:08,600
Yeah.

714
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,060
But then what happens when you're out in the woods?

715
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:11,580
It's all by...

716
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:11,660
What do you do, Canary?

717
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:11,700
What do you do, Canary?

718
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:11,700


719
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:11,940
You're out there with yourself

720
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,760
and you're still pea-shy.

721
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:15,320
What then?

722
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,700
Or has Bob left you then?

723
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,140
I wondered if Bob left me once.

724
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:21,140
Does Bob even see the pea-shy?

725
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:22,720
One time I was out in the woods

726
00:39:22,720 --> 00:39:24,640
and I did wonder if Bob had left me.

727
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:25,940
Because I was out,

728
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:29,080
and we were camping far, far from the road.

729
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,780
We were backpacked in

730
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,380
at five miles from our vehicles.

731
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:36,160
And I walked off into the woods.

732
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,380
The dark,

733
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:41,060
the dark is not woods.

734
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,840
I was out in the woods to go take a leak.

735
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:44,460
And I walked far enough way.

736
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,220
I was like, how far do I have to walk

737
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:48,360
where I can't see the light of the campsite anymore?

738
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,020
So I get deep into the woods

739
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,240
and I can't see the light of the campsite anymore.

740
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,560
And I take my pee.

741
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,960
And I'm just standing there

742
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,580
after I take my pee and shaggle it out

743
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:58,580
and all that and put it back away.

744
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,420
And I'm standing there just sort of

745
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,500
digging on that moment

746
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,660
that I really kind of

747
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:07,060
almost didn't know what direction to go.

748
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,160
Next thing I know,

749
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:09,940
I had this feeling.

750
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,780
I swear to God

751
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:13,780
that I knew

752
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:16,340
if I'd have stood in that same spot

753
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:19,300
for one more fraction of a second,

754
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,560
a big bear paw would have

755
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,040
swiped out and taken my head off.

756
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,480
But I started running.

757
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,160
So I don't know what made me run.

758
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,600
But I run and I run.

759
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,240
I ran right back into camp.

760
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:31,560
And I'm laughing.

761
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,100
But I know that bear was ready to take me out.

762
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,240
I didn't see the bear.

763
00:40:36,820 --> 00:40:37,400
Never saw the bear.

764
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:38,800
The bear saw you, though.

765
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,360
I know.

766
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:39,580
I've got you.

767
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:39,920
The bear had you.

768
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:39,920


769
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,780
I felt the bear.

770
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,520
The bear smelt fear.

771
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:43,380
That's right.

772
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,200
Smelt the pee.

773
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,640
And the fear.

774
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,100
The fear in the pee.

775
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:52,280
The sheer pee fear.

776
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,600
Concentrated pee fear.

777
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,680
There's bears out there, friends.

778
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:58,000
They didn't get them all.

779
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:01,060
And there's things worse than bears.

780
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,840
That's right.

781
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:05,580
Things on two legs that are far worse than bears.

782
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,160
That are waiting in the dark woods

783
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,640
for you to take up.

784
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:09,920
Things.

785
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:09,920


786
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:09,920


787
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:09,920


788
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:09,920


789
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:09,920


790
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:09,920


791
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:09,920


792
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:09,920


793
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:09,920


794
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:10,340
Things.

795
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,020
Scarier than the Blair Witch.

796
00:41:12,120 --> 00:41:14,240
And a lot realer.

797
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:16,620
Sort of like that movie Deliverance.

798
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:20,120
Will you know the exact moment when to bolt?

799
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:24,060
Will you know the exact fraction of a second moment

800
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:27,560
when to make your feet move faster

801
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:30,040
than you've ever made your feet move before?

802
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,980
Will you know that moment?

803
00:41:32,960 --> 00:41:36,020
You will know when you have done it

804
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:37,340
that you did the right thing

805
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,980
because you'll still be alive.

806
00:41:38,980 --> 00:41:40,780
Sure, it might be silly.

807
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:42,180
But you know this.

808
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,680
You know you're alive.

809
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:44,700
You ran.

810
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,920
For no reason.

811
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:48,320
Perhaps from nothing.

812
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,780
But it must have been the right thing

813
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:53,080
because you ain't dead.

814
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:53,900
That's right.

815
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,520
Whatever it was that was about to get you

816
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,740
didn't get you.

817
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,120
You don't know, my friend.

818
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,640
You don't know.

819
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:01,600
Unless you're real depressed.

820
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,840
Then you know everything's going to be screwed up.

821
00:42:03,900 --> 00:42:04,880
You know everything sucks.

822
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:06,900
But if you're not depressed,

823
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,900
you know that you don't...

824
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:10,280
No, take it from me, friends.

825
00:42:10,500 --> 00:42:11,400
I'm not depressed.

826
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,440
And I know this.

827
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:13,720
You don't know.

828
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:14,780
And I don't know.

829
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:18,500
But that bear knows.

830
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,840
There's one thing we did.

831
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,160
The one thing that we know

832
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,660
is that we're all going to die.

833
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:24,560
That's the only thing you know.

834
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:26,880
So what is the hurry?

835
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,920
Yeah, that bear is what...

836
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:29,900
It is out in the woods.

837
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:31,120
It's not a question of if.

838
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,480
It's just a question of when.

839
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,520
It's like your computer crashed.

840
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,680
One day you are going to take that walk

841
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,620
out away from your campsite.

842
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:38,860
Might be today.

843
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,940
Might be 50 years from now.

844
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,480
Might be 100 years from now.

845
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,100
They might invent a cure for death.

846
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:47,100
And you'd be fine until that piece of space junk

847
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,200
falls out of the sky.

848
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:48,820
That's right.

849
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,300
But believe me,

850
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,740
that walk in the woods is waiting for you.

851
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,920
And you might sit there in your little chair,

852
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,340
in your little fancy little life,

853
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:57,720
and say,

854
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,020
I'm not afraid.

855
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,700
But I guarantee you one thing, brother.

856
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:03,340
You will be.

857
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:06,560
You will feel fear.

858
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:08,900
Or maybe not.

859
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:12,860
You know, there are those who just wander through life blithely.

860
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:15,620
You know, nothing bad ever happens to them.

861
00:43:15,660 --> 00:43:16,800
It's always somebody else.

862
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,520
And one day they die in their sleep.

863
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:20,220
Yeah, right.

864
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,260
And they go to heaven.

865
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:21,720
Yeah.

866
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:23,000
Nobody ever hears from them again.

867
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:25,240
They never even had to go to church.

868
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,140
They just never...

869
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:27,000
They had slack.

870
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:27,400
Yeah.

871
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,260
And went to heaven.

872
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:29,220
And it was okay.

873
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:32,160
But most of those people, friends,

874
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:35,400
are not the ones who create your favorite songs.

875
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,780
Or your best jokes.

876
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:38,380
Or...

877
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:39,420
Your favorite movies.

878
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:41,880
They just live their life happily on the sideline,

879
00:43:42,740 --> 00:43:44,860
watching everybody else do all that stuff.

880
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:49,420
And buying those movie tickets to watch the agony and conflict

881
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:54,000
of those who just seem to walk into trouble.

882
00:43:55,440 --> 00:44:01,240
For Zombie Dave ascribes precisely the same mental states to himself as we do.

883
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:03,080
By some process or other,

884
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,280
he'll tell you that he thinks that Bob Dylan makes good music.

885
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,620
How can this ability be explained?

886
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,800
Clearly not by appealing to slack.

887
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,980
For Zombie Dave doesn't have any.

888
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,540
Zombie Dave does the job, presumably,

889
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:18,980
either by reasoning from non-slack evidence...

890
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,180
Is that a comic book character?

891
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:23,580
Or by simply being thrown into the appropriate state.

892
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:24,500
You're making a good one.

893
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,560
It seems likely that we do it the same way.

894
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:27,440
I can see a liking, Bob.

895
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,340
And the slack is a red herring.

896
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,760
Well, this is a guy named David Chalmers

897
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,100
who's discussing P-zombies, philosophical zombies,

898
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,520
and decided to consider his zombie twin,

899
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:40,220
who's like him in every way,

900
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,060
except he has no interior life.

901
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,540
And so he calls his zombie twin...

902
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,540
What station is this?

903
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:46,860
Zombie Dave.

904
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:48,720
Ah.

905
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,380
So for each subgenius,

906
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:55,600
there is a zombie version who is completely pink...

907
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:56,300
In another dimension?

908
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:58,620
Has no soul and cannot know slack.

909
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,300
Must be in another dimension.

910
00:45:00,540 --> 00:45:01,920
So there's somewhere there's a...

911
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:02,960
The super strength there.

912
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:03,540
It's the other...

913
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:04,340
One of the other...

914
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,260
Yeah, there's a...

915
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:08,020
The six-dimensional world that exists in parallel

916
00:45:08,020 --> 00:45:08,500
to our...

917
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,480
Our four-dimensional one.

918
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,320
And of course, they don't have time.

919
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:12,300
There's a...

920
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,280
There's no time.

921
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,800
There's six spatial dimensions.

922
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,120
Who's a banker, or...

923
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:18,380
And has six spatial dimensions.

924
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,940
And again, but to him, it's normal, and...

925
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:22,360
Yeah, right.

926
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:24,140
You're just like a wavering blue light.

927
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:24,800
He could...

928
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,700
Yeah, we're...

929
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,620
At the bank teller thing.

930
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:28,160
Window.

931
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,360
Well, friends.

932
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:34,640
Waiting for the bear.

933
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:38,480
The wavering blue light.

934
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,520
Out in the woods.

935
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:40,620
Waiting for the bear.

936
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,940
Quivering, shivering in the cold.

937
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:49,900
Well, and you never know how much your life may be influenced by another dimension.

938
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,140
A wave or a force from another dimension.

939
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:53,580
And you also...

940
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,640
You might mistake it for fate or God or devils.

941
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:05,620
The good thing about escaping from the bear is that you're more alive after that than you ever were before.

942
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,200
Yeah, so you become more of a predator.

943
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:08,260
Every time you run...

944
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:09,700
You become...

945
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:10,480
Yeah, you become...

946
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,760
You value what you have a little bit more.

947
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:14,240
Every time you start to lose it.

948
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,840
And every time you lose something good...

949
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,360
Yeah, if you start to lose it, but you save it and pull it out at the last second.

950
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,020
And you...

951
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:24,940
Or maybe you lose it, and the next time you have something like it, you...

952
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:27,040
You see it more clearly.

953
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:28,980
Well, that's why you're...

954
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,120
You value things more, you see.

955
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,540
You know, you got a test pilot.

956
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,080
You don't get no next time.

957
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:36,220
But he runs it right until the test pilot.

958
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,960
He said most people would say...

959
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:42,700
Well, I got four seconds to pull the cord on this here ejection seat.

960
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:45,560
Test pilot says, I got four seconds to save this thing.

961
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:48,820
I got four seconds to pull this thing out of the shitter.

962
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:51,380
He sees it as being half full.

963
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:59,080
As opposed to your cowardly Volkswagen driver who sees it as half empty and doesn't want to go.

964
00:46:59,120 --> 00:46:59,800
Pull the cord.

965
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:00,120
Right.

966
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:00,780
Yeah.

967
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,120
They get down.

968
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,680
They get closer to 50 feet to the ground.

969
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,040
They're pulling their ejection seats.

970
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:10,220
Most of you.

971
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,860
Well, it's...

972
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,000
Do you hear me, sheeple?

973
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,180
Are you listening to what we're saying, sheeple?

974
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:25,380
Oh, think how much easier it must be to live in blissful ignorance of the slaughterhouse.

975
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:29,300
You don't have to deal with any of the problems that smart people do.

976
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:37,860
If Frank Zappa would say, look, you few tiny percentage of people out there who are smart,

977
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,200
quit trying to deny it.

978
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,040
Face the fact you're weird, you're smart.

979
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,460
Just deal with it.

980
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:46,680
Take advantage of it.

981
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:55,120
You actually will find eventually a way to succeed if you just hang in there long enough.

982
00:47:55,540 --> 00:48:00,340
Unfortunately, the people Frank was talking to was not us.

983
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:05,820
Who is there to speak to those less than smart?

984
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,240
Those who cannot see the lofty heights?

985
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:08,460
Right.

986
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:08,460


987
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,460
But only the deep under things.

988
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,640
Who but the chocolate chip cookie?

989
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,460
Who can answer?

990
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,620
For those mole men lurking.

991
00:48:17,660 --> 00:48:24,960
The Morlocks who lurk and build your little machines and make your little CDs and do your little comedy shows.

992
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,900
I'm eating out of your trash cans.

993
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,560
I slept under your bridge.

994
00:48:33,600 --> 00:48:34,840
I bought a Velvet Elvis.

995
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,160
You see this scar?

996
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:37,900
You know what?

997
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:38,340
That's...

998
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:38,760
Trump.

999
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,480
You don't want to know.

1000
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,280
That's ugly.

1001
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,120
Put that away.

1002
00:48:43,260 --> 00:48:48,580
I seen you in your fancy restaurants and your fine houses.

1003
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,380
Oh, I seen you.

1004
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,860
I stood out in the cold and I watched you.

1005
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,720
I saw your girls skipping home from their fancy private schools.

1006
00:48:59,960 --> 00:49:02,020
But I'm always out there.

1007
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:07,740
I'm always watching and I'm wanting and I'm coveting.

1008
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:08,200
I'm coveting.

1009
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,180
I'm always out there.

1010
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,200
I'm the covetor.

1011
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,360
The have-not.

1012
00:49:12,620 --> 00:49:14,820
I'm the have-not and I'm...

1013
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,660
He's coming for you.

1014
00:49:16,740 --> 00:49:17,680
All by being old too long.

1015
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:18,980
What's he going to have?

1016
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,520
He's coming for you.

1017
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:24,380
I don't mean he's coming to get you.

1018
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:26,200
I mean...

1019
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,980
He's coming for you.

1020
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:29,680
He's coming for you.

1021
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:33,820
I said it twisted.

1022
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:34,580
I said it twisted.

1023
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:35,740
I said it twisted.

1024
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:36,760
I said it twisted.

1025
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,160
I said it twisted.

1026
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:37,460
I said it twisted.

1027
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:37,900
I say it twisted.

1028
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:38,180


1029
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:38,180


1030
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:38,180


1031
00:49:38,180 --> 00:49:38,180


1032
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:40,560
Sick and twisted

1033
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:45,980
This world is a sick and twisted place

1034
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,060
And the sooner you realize it

1035
00:49:48,060 --> 00:49:49,900
The sooner you'll get on board

1036
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,820
And just become another cog in the machine

1037
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:55,340
And die happy and ignorant

1038
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:57,800
Is it me that's sick and twisted

1039
00:49:57,800 --> 00:50:02,160
Or is it this world that's diseased

1040
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:02,940
The system

1041
00:50:02,940 --> 00:50:06,680
Is it the system that's sick and twisted

1042
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:11,340
We're merely a reflection of the illness we see in society around us

1043
00:50:11,340 --> 00:50:12,700
It's an empowerment

1044
00:50:12,700 --> 00:50:15,620
Is the human race sick and twisted

1045
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:18,480
Everything

1046
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:22,700
Is mother nature sick and twisted

1047
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,020
Been kind of a strange winter now hasn't it

1048
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:31,000
Been unseasonably warm I'd say

1049
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:34,020
Why even warmer than last year

1050
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:36,060
And why they say it

1051
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,240
It may get warmer yet

1052
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:40,940
You know

1053
00:50:40,940 --> 00:50:43,860
Some of those cities

1054
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:46,040
Amsterdam and New Orleans

1055
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:46,460
They're

1056
00:50:47,480 --> 00:50:48,760
In Venice

1057
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,780
You start to feel the rising tides

1058
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,500
Find some adventure in your life

1059
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:57,000
And start a company that salvages

1060
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:58,240
Icebergs

1061
00:50:59,060 --> 00:51:00,540
Brings them back down to the states

1062
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,660
Makes drinking water out of them

1063
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:05,500
Start the company that salvages

1064
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:06,040
Underwater

1065
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:07,060
Water buildings

1066
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:13,300
You know they're lying to you about that global warming

1067
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:18,200
It's not a question of if

1068
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,420
It's just a when thing

1069
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:21,880
It's already too late

1070
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:24,640
They've kicked the motor over

1071
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:26,240
It's started up

1072
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:28,080
There's no going back now

1073
00:51:28,080 --> 00:51:32,200
Only mysterious science can save us

1074
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,880
It's what got us into this

1075
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:34,180
Big science

1076
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:35,620
Not big science

1077
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,600
Mysterious science

1078
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:40,220
The kind of science that says

1079
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,060
Hey

1080
00:51:41,060 --> 00:51:43,680
Let's go dig up all the oil

1081
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,940
Hey if it's a sufficiently advanced science

1082
00:51:47,940 --> 00:51:49,480
It will appear to be magic

1083
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:52,520
And if it's really really advanced

1084
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,760
It'll just seem like coincidence

1085
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,940
Been having any coincidences lately in your life my friend?

1086
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,720
Could that be how the aliens are trying to communicate

1087
00:52:04,720 --> 00:52:05,680
With you?

1088
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,180
Singling you out

1089
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,180
Because you are the chosen one

1090
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,660
The smart one that Frank Zappa was talking to

1091
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:13,260
Yes you, the listener

1092
00:52:13,260 --> 00:52:15,200
Not just the generic listener

1093
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,780
But you, the one actually listening now

1094
00:52:16,780 --> 00:52:17,240
You

1095
00:52:18,220 --> 00:52:19,280
Is it you?

1096
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,260
Who is now being singled out

1097
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:23,980
And has been throughout your entire life

1098
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,820
As if it were some sort of a movie

1099
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:31,420
As if you were being pulled along by the strings of a puppet master

1100
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:34,200
With a sick and twisted sense of humor?

1101
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,880
Who somehow forced you into

1102
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:41,120
Strange conflicting absurdities

1103
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:44,700
Of paradoxical life situations

1104
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,440
Or are you maybe just imagining things

1105
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,300
And you know we're all just people

1106
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:56,300
Right?

1107
00:52:58,340 --> 00:53:00,420
That neighbor next door

1108
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:03,720
Couldn't possibly be from another world

1109
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:08,100
You couldn't possibly be from another world

1110
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:12,740
That can't really happen

1111
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:16,440
Mars could not possibly ever have

1112
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:19,280
Actually been closer to the sun

1113
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:24,900
And Earth the frozen, polluted, destroyed shell

1114
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,900
That would be crazy

1115
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:31,620
The idea of swapping planets

1116
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:33,640
Just because one had been ruined

1117
00:53:33,640 --> 00:53:35,060
Mars into Earth's orbit

1118
00:53:35,060 --> 00:53:37,360
And pushing Earth with all its messed up

1119
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,320
Screwed up humanity on it

1120
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:43,540
Out into the outer reaches of the solar system

1121
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:44,820
Swapping planets?

1122
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,480
It's nuts, crazy, crazy stuff

1123
00:53:47,480 --> 00:53:48,940
Crazy stuff

1124
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,240
I think I'll just read the newspaper

1125
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,060
Instead of this science fiction

1126
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,400
That'll make a lot more sense

1127
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,340
That'll be more believable, yeah

1128
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:57,840
Yeah

1129
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:02,400
Are we being controlled by secret forces?

1130
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:03,620
Are aliens facing us?

1131
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,080
Are we being controlled by space monsters?

1132
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:05,800
Bringing a startling new world?

1133
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:06,860
Do people think you're strange?

1134
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:07,420
Do you?

1135
00:54:07,880 --> 00:54:09,900
There is an answer

1136
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:13,600
Saturday, April 20th in Indianapolis, Indiana

1137
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,620
The Twitch of the Subgenius comes to Radio Radio

1138
00:54:16,620 --> 00:54:19,200
To free the slackless mutants of the city

1139
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:22,360
And to expose the conspiracy for truly what it is

1140
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:24,060
It's a showdown in Naptown

1141
00:54:24,060 --> 00:54:27,480
With Reverend Ivan Stang, Papa Joe Mama, Pope Fred

1142
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,560
Strange weirdo music from Saint In and DJ Sully Out

1143
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:35,160
Bondage fun with performance fetish group Crimson Mane

1144
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,120
Get your booty off the couch and down to Radio Radio

1145
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,560

1149
00:54:53,300 --> 00:54:57,220
Quit your job, slack off, and praise Bob

1150
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,100
I'm not afraid

1151
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:03,380
I like it out there

1152
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,600
Would you go with me?

1153
00:55:10,100 --> 00:55:10,700
No

1154
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:30,040
It is a time of frequent immorality

1155
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:33,300
A time when the old standards of trouble

1156
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:34,260
Were just a fight

1157
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:37,880
All time champion of false promises and exaggerated claims

1158
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,700
Religion

1159
00:55:43,400 --> 00:55:46,060
Fire, and smoke and burning and torture

1160
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:48,260
And suffer and burn and choke and scream

1161
00:55:48,260 --> 00:55:50,440
And suffer and burn and choke and scream

1162
00:55:50,440 --> 00:55:52,920
Fire, and smoke and burning and torture

1163
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,260
And guilt and perversion

1164
00:55:54,260 --> 00:55:56,480
And suffer and burn and choke and scream

1165
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,640
And suffer and burn and choke and scream

1166
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,020
And cry, and forget them all

1167
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:01,920
ever and ever till the end of time.

1168
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,380
Witchcraft and opportunism.

1169
00:56:05,900 --> 00:56:06,380
Oh, God.

1170
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:09,320
Devil worship and necrophilia.

1171
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:10,740
Naughty peasant.

1172
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,320
Witchcraft and opportunism.

1173
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:14,700
That's it. I'm out of here.

1174
00:56:15,420 --> 00:56:17,340
Devil worship and necrophilia.

1175
00:56:17,820 --> 00:56:18,500
Oh, sorry.

1176
00:56:26,940 --> 00:56:29,980
He loves you and he needs money.

1177
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:34,260
All powerful, all perfect, all knowing and all wise.

1178
00:56:35,320 --> 00:56:38,340
All powerful, all perfect, all knowing and all wise.

1179
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:42,300
All powerful, all perfect, all knowing and all wise.

1180
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:46,080
You talk about a good bullshit story.

1181
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:48,480
How would I go about it?

1182
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,960
How would I go about creating a half-man, half-monkey type creature?

1183
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:53,120
I'm sorry, that would be playing God.

1184
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:55,320
God's smart. I want my monkey man.

1185
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:58,320
Raw sex is peddled in every drugstore.

1186
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:01,360
Religion takes in billions of dollars.

1187
00:57:01,720 --> 00:57:04,320
Raw sex is peddled in every drugstore.

1188
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,380
Religion takes in billions of dollars.

1189
00:57:07,740 --> 00:57:10,320
Raw sex is peddled in every drugstore.

1190
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:13,340
Religion takes in billions of dollars.

1191
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,420
I want it.

1192
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:45,220
I will force my loathsome self-assertion,

1193
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:45,220


1194
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:45,220


1195
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:46,380
Illegal��이 massively думают,

1196
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:46,520
they should lose,

1197
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:46,520


1198
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:46,520


1199
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:46,520


1200
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,440
to accept Japan's

1201
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:47,540
the grand advantage of self control.

1202
00:57:47,860 --> 00:57:47,860


1203
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:04,000
It's time to kick God's doors down.

1204
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:12,740
The bizarre, the strange, and the occult.

1205
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,740
Ministers, priests, and educators.

1206
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,760
And they always need a little more.

1207
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:21,820
And that was by the bishop, dear friends.

1208
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:23,840
By our friend the bishop.

1209
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,000
And before that, Einstein Secret Orchestra, Swamp Radio from WCSB,

1210

1212
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:43,080
Friends, this is the Hour of Slack.

Or anything you've been hearing.

1217
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:51,540
Or just to send us your tapes.

1218
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,260
Send that to me.

1219
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:55,340

1221
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:00,360
You got that pencil ready, friends?

1222
00:59:00,720 --> 00:59:01,380
Right there.

1223
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:05,120
We're just writing to Bob at P.O. Box 181-417.

1230
00:59:32,120 --> 00:59:34,800
And this has been the swinging love corpses in the background.

1231
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,680
Praise Bob!

1232
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,100

P.O. Box 181-417.

1240
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:48,880
Now it's time to say goodbye.

1241
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:50,240
Why?

1242
00:59:50,620 --> 00:59:52,660
Because we like you.

1243
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:53,840
Goodbye.

1244
00:59:54,320 --> 00:59:56,500
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1245
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:05,940
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
