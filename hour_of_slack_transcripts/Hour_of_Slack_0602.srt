Someone's breathing church air.

Yes.

70
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,320
Worshipping.

71
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,420
Worshipping.

72
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,620
You can worship at the workbench.

73
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:01,560
You can worship whatever you're doing.

74
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:06,000
It's a good thing about, you know, the spirituality of all of this.

75
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,080
Is that you don't have to go into a church or anything.

76
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:09,480
Yeah.

77
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,900
You know, whatever you're doing.

78
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,320
When you're drawing, you're doodling pictures, you know.

79
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:13,780
Yeah.

80
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,400
You know, whatever.

81
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,220
Yeah, and I know, you know, so many religions, you can work.

82
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,000
You got to worship with certain orifices.

83
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:25,240
You got to, like, you know, fold your hands and stuff like that and talk in your mouth and your heart.

84
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,520
No, you can pick your nose.

85
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:26,960
Yeah.

86
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,200
You know, like in this one, you can worship with any organ you want.

87
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:33,500
You can praise God with your rectum for all we care.

88
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,760
And he cares, really.

89
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:35,780
Bob.

90
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:35,980
Or she.

91
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:37,600
Yep.

92
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,740
Are we talking about Bob?

93
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,640
Are we talking about Bob?

94
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,460
Are we talking about Bob?

95
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,080
What did you mean by liquor and religion?

96
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:55,920
Reality and spirituality or what?

97
00:07:58,140 --> 00:08:01,720
Well, I don't understand your question.

98
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,640
We have 12 steps.

99
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:05,420
It's a 12-step program for Emotions Anonymous.

100
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,280
What's the first step?

101
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,380
Step number one.

102
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,780
Do they seriously want people who are too emotional?

103
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,320
Yes.

104
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:18,040
We admitted we were powerless over our emotions, that our lives had become unmanageable.

105
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,160
That's number one.

106
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,500
No!

107
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,620
No!

108
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,060
No!

109
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:22,480
No!

110
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:23,240
No!

111
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,580
No!

112
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:23,960
No!

113
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,060
Can somebody get Edward Munch out of here?

114
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:27,620
Here's number two.

115
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,200
There he goes.

116
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,800
We came to believe that a power greater than ourselves could restore us to sanity.

117
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,040
Wow.

118
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:35,980
Sanitation?

119
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,280
Yes, for God is clean.

120
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:46,340
He beareth not stinky boogers and juices that emit from him like we his foul creation.

121
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,540
Here's a good one.

122
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,220
Number five.

123
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:56,700
Admitted to God, to ourselves, and to another human being the exact nature of our wrongs.

124
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,940
Louie, Louie.

125
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,320
I'm getting a little bit woozy.

126
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,500
Louie, Louie.

127
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:03,680
Louie, Louie.

128
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,200
Are you a girl or a girl?

129
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,200
Louie, Louie.

130
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,660
Oh, Dave, man.

131
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,120
Oh, he took a bad one.

132
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,960
I told you not to.

133
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:15,780
Are you a girl or a girl?

134
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:22,580
Dave, when I bring up a tank of nitrous oxide like this, you can't hog it all.

135
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:26,220
You're going to keep falling over and passing out.

136
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,140
What drugs did you use?

137
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,140
And where did you get them?

138
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,200
How much did they cost?

139
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,480
Oh, the sergeant's coming.

140
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,860
That's Bob.

141
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,200
Oh, my God, he's fat.

142
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,120
I never saw him look like that.

143
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,500
The last couple of years have been rough on him.

144
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:46,400
What's he doing?

145
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:47,140
Why do I need him?

146
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,880
Praise Bob.

147
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:49,640
Praise Bob.

148
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,280
I'll praise Bob.

149
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:51,480
I'll praise Bob.

150
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:51,880
Praise Bob.

151
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:52,220
Praise Bob.

152
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:53,160
When he comes to us.

153
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:55,320
Praise Bob.

154
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,820
Praise Bob.

155
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,320
No, wait.

156
00:09:59,160 --> 00:09:59,560
Bob.

157
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:01,860
Praise Bob.

158
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:02,480
Praise Bob.

159
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,120
Praise Bob.

160
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,120


161
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,820
Praise Bob.

162
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:09,820


163
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:09,820


164
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:09,820


165
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:09,820


166
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:09,820


167
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,820
It's that loop again.

168
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,060
It's that loop again.

169
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,060


170
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,060


171
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:14,740
Praise Bob.

172
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:18,040
Praise Bob.

173
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:18,520
Praise Bob.

174
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:19,980
Praise Bob.

175
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,380
Give it up, Dave.

176
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:28,880
Do you pee?

177
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,040
Then you may be interested.

178
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,320
what I have to say.

179
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,220
Some people,

180
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,400
you'll notice, there are, there's, there's,

181
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,340
I just mentioned two kinds of people.

182
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,940
That was a lie. There's three kinds.

183
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,040
There's those who have presence.

184
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:45,000
You know what I mean?

185
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,500
Well, that guy there, probably not.

186
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:50,220
Some people just have, you know,

187
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:52,640
Santa Claus, Dr. Legume.

188
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,600
I'm probably

189
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,640
a pretty good example.

190
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,220
Some people have no

191
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:00,160
presence. They have none at all.

192
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,760
I didn't get any presents!

193
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:02,280
But,

194
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,840
but at least they don't bring you down.

195
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,880
Okay, that's most people.

196
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,780
I guess you call them the Larrys, as opposed

197
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,340
to the Moes and the Curlies.

198
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:14,040
The third, I guess, actually, I'm probably

199
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:15,740
a better example of the third type,

200
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,520
which is a sort of an anti-presence

201
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:19,980
that sucks

202
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,560
slack from you.

203
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,040
You know what I mean?

204
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:26,880
There's, there's, there's,

205
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,740
well, what we're talking about are

206
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,740
human cartels.

207
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,100
We're talking about subgeniuses.

208
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,540
I'm sitting around, I'm sitting around

209
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:37,980
backstage looking at my fellow subgeniuses

210
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,640
and I thought, that's what it is.

211
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,600
I'm living in a world of human

212
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,420
cartoons, or

213
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,560
non-human cartoons. They're cartoons.

214
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:46,680
The humans,

215
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,600
they're full three-dimensional

216
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,840
fleshed-out characters.

217
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,060
Us subgeniuses, praise Bob,

218
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,060
we are two-dimensional characters!

219
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,680
We are cartoons!

220
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,680
We are stereotypes of ourselves!

221
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,740
We just happen to be a subgenius.

222
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,420
be the first example of that particular

223
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:04,100
stereotype.

224
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,600
So, you know, as we've always said

225
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,600
in this church, the sub-genius,

226
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,340
sub-genius, get that,

227
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:13,680
it's not the intelligence that counts.

228
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:15,560
You know, it's the sense.

229
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,440
Common sense, sense of humor,

230
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,540
dollars and cents.

231
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,060
You're only as think

232
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:23,200
as you smart you are,

233
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,280
I think Bob said at one point.

234
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,140
And the pink,

235
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,600
yes, the human, the pink, the pink boy,

236
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,600
the Barbie Ken, the mediocrity,

237
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,860
the cage dweller,

238
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,400
they tend to imitate

239
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,580
TV. In fact, I mean, it used to

240
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:39,480
start out where television imitated

241
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,560
them, but now they

242
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,400
imitate TV. You know, TV

243
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,520
is more real than their reality.

244
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,700
They don't feel like they've really

245
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,160
broken up with their girlfriend

246
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,480
until they've done it on open.

247
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,280
You know what I mean?

248
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,800
They seek

249
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,560
to make their lives

250
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,300
into a, they don't seek

251
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:01,300
slack, they seek the opposite.

252
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,920
They seek what they see on television.

253
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,920
They want to turn their lives into a

254
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,500
perpetual soap opera.

255
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,240
Well, our lives are already

256
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,500
a perpetual

257
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,880
Dr. Bronner's soap

258
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,660
opera.

259
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,440
Praise Dr. Bronner.

260
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,700
And we're trying to escape from it.

261
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,340
So, sure, we're all robots

262
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,060
for our glands, like the

263
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,940
scientists say, but

264
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,040
we sub-geniuses like to break

265
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,160
Asimov's first rule of

266
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:31,140
robotics every day.

267
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:31,940
Yeah!

268
00:13:32,460 --> 00:13:34,540
For those of you, I believe that first rule was

269
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,960
don't harm a human.

270
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,380
So,

271
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:39,160
sub-geniuses.

272
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,240
God damn it, it's

273
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,060
10-20.

274
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,120
Hey,

275
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:50,480
believe me,

276
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,440
these schedules, these schedules are

277
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,620
the one anchor

278
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,660
of sanity in this

279
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,700
raging ocean.

280
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:03,580
Practice time control.

281
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,840
Break your watch.

282
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,120
Hey, speak for yourself. You want to bring your watch up here?

283
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,180
Do you have a watch?

284
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,360
I would love to do a time

285
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,300
control ceremony.

286
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,080
Sickness,

287
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,580
healings. Friends,

288
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:20,040
is there anyone here who's willing to

289
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,240
free themselves? Alright.

290
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:23,980
Break off. Listen,

291
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:25,240
check this out, friends.

292
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:28,000
We will do it. We will destroy

293
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:28,660
time.

294
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,080
Jesus collected. Wait a minute.

295
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:34,060
Are you sure? This is not too bad.

296
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,960
It's a Casio.

297
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,580
It's really working.

298
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:40,140
It's probably at least a $10-$12 watch.

299
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:42,380
Friends,

300
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:43,380
this

301
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:45,880
will be the, because when we

302
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:47,320
smashed this symbol,

303
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,700
this handcuff, that man just

304
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,420
tore off his handcuff.

305
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,960
He just sawed away

306
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,200
the chain that was

307
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,520
tying into the concern.

308
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,720
And it was tying this revival

309
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,140
to the gospel.

310
00:14:59,160 --> 00:14:59,380
And it was tying this revival to the schedule.

311
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,520
Now, this revival will never end.

312
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,220
Friends, we will give you control

313
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,280
over time.

314
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,140
But only if you let us smash and destroy

315
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:16,620
Satan's handcuff.

316
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,120
Pray Satan.

317
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:23,440
No offense,

318
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,580
no offense,

319
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:26,020
Dark Lord,

320
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,920
that old split foot.

321
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,860
And, um,

322
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,500
yeah, actually, I should, I think I need

323
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,740
to get out of the way and make,

324
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,740
begin to make way for someone else.

325
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:41,180
And we will later on, friends, have healings

326
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,740
and sickenings, head-launchings,

327
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,440
and a short duration

328
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:46,700
mass marriage.

329
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:49,440
So, um,

330
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:50,780
you know,

331
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,620
what's the most about Bob Armadillo

332
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,320
hair coat?

333
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:56,260
Yeah, I just want to tell you,

334
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,280
he's got a thing with that hair coat.

335
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,580
We'll get to that.

336
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,680
Um,

337
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:02,960
oh,

338
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,740
and now,

339
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,000
I introduce, to give the introductions,

340
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,700
Paul Panger!

341
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,820
Oh my goodness, my goodness.

342
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,680
Are you starting to feel

343
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,280
a transformation?

344
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,980
Can I hear a praise

345
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,260
bomb?

346
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,720
Say to yourself, praise

347
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,040
bomb!

348
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,640
Now turn to your neighbor and say,

349
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:27,440
praise bomb!

350
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,640
Praise bomb!

351
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,180
Or to someone else and say, praise bomb!

352
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,400
Praise bomb!

353
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,960
Now I want you to meet the man that holds

354
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:38,020
the secret radio frequency codes

355
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:40,120
for the weekly show, The Hour of Slack,

356
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,880
Reverend Ed Strange!

357
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:42,800
Woo!

358
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:52,680
Ladies and gentlemen,

359
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,740
how many of you came here tonight

360
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,940
to be entertained?

361
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:57,820
Not me!

362
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,100
I can't even talk!

363
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,660
I can't even talk right now!

364
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,760
I really hope not.

365
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,840
I can't even talk right now!

366
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:05,900
Because you see, I normally preach for free

367
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,900
on a radio show

368
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,940
three hours a week at least.

369
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,020
I was really looking forward to coming down here.

370
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,140
You know, even some time out

371
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,000
in my busy week

372
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,040
to write a whole bunch of

373
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:17,400
about Bob

374
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,820
to entertain you.

375
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:19,840
Because I thought,

376
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,140
Texas,

377
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:22,480
Austin,

378
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:25,420
just a, what, two hour drive

379
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,760
from what should be the hot bed of slack

380
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,140
in the country, Dallas, Texas.

381
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:31,620
But to my shock,

382
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,120
to my utter disbelief,

383
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,060
in the $20, 30 minute cab ride

384
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:39,440
from my hotel room at the airport

385
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,840
to church headquarters,

386
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,720
I got in a little conversation

387
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,380
with the cab driver,

388
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:45,360
nice enough guy,

389
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:46,720
shooting a breeze.

390
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:47,980
He says, well, you know,

391
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,800
what are you doing down there

392
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,020
in Austin heading down there?

393
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:51,700
I said, well, I'm going to

394
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,860
Subgenius the Bible

395
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,140
to preach to the masses.

396
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:56,660
He just kind of stopped

397
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,920
and looked back at me and said,

398
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,220
what the hell's the church

399
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,180
of the subgenius?

400
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,520
Can you believe it?

401
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,940
In Dallas, Texas,

402
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,380
with only, what, 295 days

403
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,340
left to X day,

404
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,080
there's a cab driver today

405
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,100
in Dallas, Texas,

406
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,500
who has never heard

407
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,760
of the church of the subgenius.

408
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:19,500
My fault.

409
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,800
Well, how many

410
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,540
deuce-pain subgeniuses

411
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,120
do we have here?

412
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,460
How many?

413
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:28,180
Well, I'll tell you what,

414
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,040
you ain't doing good.

415
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,380
You ain't doing good enough

416
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,300
a f***ing job.

417
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:32,320
I'm sorry to say,

418
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,760
that's why I'm here

419
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,720
to recruit,

420
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,820
to extend a special hand

421
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:39,060
of friendship to the,

422
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,640
well, the cleverly concealed

423
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,240
and well-disguised members

424
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:45,100
of the FBI, CIA,

425
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,960
and of course,

426
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,580
the Bureau of Alcohol,

427
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:49,200
Tobacco, and Firearms

428
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,920
that we know are in the audience

429
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,180
here tonight,

430
00:18:52,940 --> 00:18:54,620
planning to do

431
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,500
God knows what to us

432
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,480
to help keep America safe.

433
00:18:59,040 --> 00:18:59,760
For Christianity.

434
00:18:59,780 --> 00:18:59,780


435
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,280
Please speak into the pen.

436
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,480
Well,

437
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,240
f*** the funny s*** out, Bob.

438
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:06,640
F*** it.

439
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:07,960
You know what?

440
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,460
F*** it, Bob.

441
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,800
There's too much killing

442
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,460
left to be done before X day.

443
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,720
You think an alien race

444
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:16,280
is going to come all this way

445
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,460
to see a bunch of nanny-pandy

446
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,100
do nothing,

447
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,460
sit around on their keisters

448
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,800
watching the X-Files,

449
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,400
just hoping a saucer comes along

450
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,520
to take them to a better place.

451
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,140
Why not?

452
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:29,100
Huh.

453
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:32,040
Well, my friends out there

454
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,800
who happen to be working

455
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,760
for the government,

456
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,600
tonight's your chance

457
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,200
at redemption.

458
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,280
We implore you.

459
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,860
I mean, we understand

460
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:43,720
what you do.

461
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,040
You're actually not that different

462
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:45,600
from us.

463
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,580
I mean, face it,

464
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,340
you're just doing

465
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,960
what you know is right,

466
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:51,660
what you believe to be true,

467
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,740
and you're doing

468
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,220
what you know is right

469
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,980
for America.

470
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,260
And, well,

471
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,040
especially the BATF.

472
00:19:58,740 --> 00:19:58,920
The BATF.

473
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:01,060
I mean, for all the bad press

474
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,800
you guys got down there in Waco,

475
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:04,660
I mean, personally,

476
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,240
I thought it was a hell of a job.

477
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,360
You just burned the wrong

478
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:08,800
bunch of pink bastards.

479
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:12,660
Oh, there are so many millions

480
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,320
and millions of willing targets,

481
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,060
and you have to go

482
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,200
and fly 80 or 90

483
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,880
pretty abnormal folks

484
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,120
who probably could have been

485
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,280
members of Church Subgenius

486
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:25,100
had we gotten to them,

487
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,720
but no, you had to go and kill them.

488
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,640
That's why, friends,

489
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,460
we need your help.

490
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:33,260
We need those members

491
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,820
of the FBI, CIA,

492
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,640
because, let's face it,

493
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,260
you already know how to kill.

494
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,220
You're trained in surveillance,

495
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,560
and God knows you're real good

496
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:45,080
at corrupting the entire morals

497
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,700
of nations across the planet.

498
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:51,220
The time has come to join us now.

499
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,920
You may not be convinced yet.

500
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,160
You will be by tonight.

501
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:58,760
Tonight.

502
00:20:58,920 --> 00:20:59,440
Maybe by midnight.

503
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,480
Maybe after you have

504
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,700
a couple more drinks,

505
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:04,780
it'll all start making sense

506
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:07,720
after seven or eight shots

507
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,700
of Jagermeister.

508
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:11,880
You'll start staring

509
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,820
at this banner back here.

510
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,240
Old Bob.

511
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,660
And you'll notice Old Bob,

512
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,540
his whole face,

513
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:19,900
it's made up these little dots.

514
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,640
If you stare close enough,

515
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,960
you can see there's dots

516
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,480
in the dots.

517
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,420
And if you stare even longer,

518
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:28,900
you'll find out that

519
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:28,900


520
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:28,900


521
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:29,860
You'll find yourself going in

522
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,760
beyond the dots to the actual

523
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,760
subatomic particles

524
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,500
of those said same dots,

525
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,120
those ink stains on vinyl or paper.

526
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,200
And you may even,

527
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:41,540
if you're lucky and slackful enough,

528
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,140
see infinite new universes

529
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,300
within those dots.

530
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:48,360
Worlds coexisting in parallel

531
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,920
and perpendicular universes.

532
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:52,400
Multi-dimensional life forms

533
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,480
of vast tapestry of creation.

534
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,600
And you may look at it,

535
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,420
and you may think to yourself,

536
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,760
what majesty.

537
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:06,540
What amazing things there are in the world.

538
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:08,660
What the beauty of life.

539
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:10,940
But all you're really gonna notice,

540
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,140
if your eyes are open,

541
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,560
but all those other worlds

542
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,540
are just as as this one.

543
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:17,000
And it ain't a goddamn thing.

544
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:20,580
You, me, Stan, or anybody else can do it.

545
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,980
But get right with this man,

546
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,760
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

547
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,480
Get right with this man,

548
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,240
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

549
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:27,780
Get right with this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

550
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:29,140
One more!

551
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:29,600
Hey!

552
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,100
Hey!

553
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,380
Where are you gonna find the word of Bob?

554
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,380
Are you gonna find the word of Bob in your church?

555
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,640
Are you gonna find the word of Bob in the supermarket?

556
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:44,140
And you sure as the hell will not find the word of Bob

557
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,680
in your public school systems.

558
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:51,720
Here is where you will find the word of Bob.

559
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,200
When this is bad,

560
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:53,940
this is...

561
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,500
...

562
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:54,680
...

563
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,060
...

564
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,080
Gosh, spam sandwich eating man,

565
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:04,520
it seems like we've been waiting for our kids here forever.

566
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:07,460
Of course, my nipples are always awfully hard.

567
00:23:07,640 --> 00:23:08,860
Yeah, but they're not very big.

568
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,420
I know, but they're...

569
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:11,520
Come on now, admit it.

570
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,940
They're dinky.

571
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,640
They're like men's nipples.

572
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:15,920
Well, they're like raisins.

573
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,200
Of course, they're very small.

574
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,380
I'm not bragging.

575
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,120
I'm just talking...

576
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,980
They're like teats on a hog.

577
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,480
Teats on a hog.

578
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:23,660
What a...

579
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:24,480
It's quite poignant, actually.

580
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:25,040
Hello?

581
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:25,560
Hello?

582
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,500
That's a beautiful illusion.

583
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:29,640
I like teats on a prairie squid.

584
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:32,360
I think they would be much, much, much, much...

585
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,840
No, because teats on a prairie squid have a function.

586
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:39,660
Whereas teats on a male hog are useless.

587
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,740
That's the origin of the old southern metaphor.

588
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,660
Now, a prairie squid...

589
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,720
Well, what would you say, a bull hog?

590
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,580
A prairie squid without teats?

591
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,640
I don't know what the hell you do with them.

592
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:52,060
Millions and thousands of tiny teats,

593
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,940
like little rupturing cups,

594
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:56,320
surrounding our foreheads in the middle of the night.

595
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,540
Sometimes we can't wake up because of it.

596
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,860
Oh, they'll keep you awake.

597
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,900
What you do is you pet the squid.

598
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,740
You take it, you tickle it, and pet it, and squeeze.

599
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,420
And it starts to ooze from those little tiny teats,

600
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,260
this stuff that looks like rubber cement.

601
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:10,900
Oh, yeah.

602
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,900
And you take a glass slide or something,

603
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:15,820
and you scrape it along the little teats.

604
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:20,700
And you let it dry, like a couple hours.

605
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,240
And then you can roll it up in little balls.

606
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:23,780
Tasty.

607
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,680
And you put it in the little pipe,

608
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:30,680
and you can smoke the prairie squid toxic teat secretion.

609
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:34,300
So the lactic expressions of that squid monster

610
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,140
are actually smokable from?

611
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,420
Mr. Romo, I must admit that I'm puzzled.

612
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,180
You hipsters claim to be such relaxed, free spirits,

613
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,520
yet your rules for social behavior

614
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,140
are even more set, tight, and rigid

615
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,380
than those of square society.

616
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,580
Yeah, well, dig.

617
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,820
If you look on a map,

618
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:56,160
the counties in Texas and Oklahoma,

619
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:58,000
the way the counties are laid out,

620
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,300
they outline a swastika.

621
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:01,020
That's true.

622
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:01,420
Yeah.

623
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,700
But that was like, you know,

624
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,580
when they did the first crop circles and stuff,

625
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:09,060
they decided whether they were from the Perseid Galaxy,

626
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:11,520
the ones that are the real white boys and stuff like that.

627
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,020
Yeah, right.

628
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,440
Those guys said, well...

629
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,160
Those guys landed like four years ago.

630
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:15,940
Yeah.

631
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:18,940
Made off with like a number of cows.

632
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:19,540
Yeah.

633
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,120
Some prairie squids.

634
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:22,660
Said they'd be back.

635
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:22,800
Yeah.

636
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:23,700
Someday.

637
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,640
Yeah, right.

638
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,420
Someday.

639
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,040
Two hundred and seven...

640
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:31,480
All it's gotta do is stay alive for 277 more days.

641
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,300
Yep.

642
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,360
And, uh...

643
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,280
And, uh...

644
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,280
And then you get a little, little winky badge.

645
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:39,780
And then it's all over.

646
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:40,680
Yes.

647
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,360
You get a little badge you wear,

648
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:43,780
and you step onto the ship.

649
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,240
Yeah, and it's one of those, you know...

650
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,100
Beep, beep, beep.

651
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:47,620
I saw one of the badges.

652
00:25:48,020 --> 00:25:50,260
I got to see it because, you know, I'm, you know...

653
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:52,200
I can imagine you fondling it, too.

654
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:52,600
Yeah.

655
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,480
You know what they did?

656
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:56,100
Playing with it and stuff, looking at it in the dark.

657
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,340
It's like those badges that the, the...

658
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:58,460
Sexual.

659
00:25:58,460 --> 00:26:01,940
That you got to wear when you were in grade school and you were a crossing guard.

660
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,140
Oh, they're real tacked on.

661
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,040
And the belt, too.

662
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,440
Yeah, you get to wear that belt.

663
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,400
Oh, man, you feel like an Ubermage with those clothes on.

664
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:11,940
A white belt that goes around your waist and then slashes, sashes up over your shoulder.

665
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,700
And then subliminally imprinted, or, you know...

666
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:14,940
Yeah.

667
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,960
Allowed to crack other children on the head, you know.

668
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,260
Yeah.

669
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,120
Enforcer.

670
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,900
Child enforcer, you know.

671
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,260
Little pipes all around.

672
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:22,440
Yeah.

673
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:22,960
And...

674
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,580
And...

675
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,080
Run the belt.

676
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:26,880
What's so funny about it?

677
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:31,340
It's almost evil when you think about a, a crossing guard sonder commander like that.

678
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:35,360
Taking all the little children, letting them go across the street so the cars won't hit

679
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,340
them and then walking them right into a gas chamber.

680
00:26:37,460 --> 00:26:38,320
Get out of here!

681
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,540
You understand what I mean?

682
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:44,160
You follow the hip commandment.

683
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,340
Thou shalt not bug thy neighbor, which means be cool.

684
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:47,800
That's all.

685
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:48,980
Cool.

686
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,240
Cool is a word that's...

687
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,980
It seems to change meaning every time it's used.

688
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:54,860
Yeah, it does.

689
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,140
That is a cheap shot in the name of Yahweh and Joe Hoover.

690
00:26:59,380 --> 00:26:59,800
Yeah.

691
00:26:59,820 --> 00:26:59,980
Two.

692
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,660
Both of them.

693
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:02,680
Both of them.

694
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:02,960
Yep.

695
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,660
Resting in Atlantis now.

696
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:05,760
Yep.

697
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:10,080
With their eyes still open and their nose is still breathing, just dreaming of the days

698
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,060
they're gonna come back here and tell us what to do.

699
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:15,600
I mean, as if we ain't got enough subliminal messages telling us what to do.

700
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:15,900
Yeah.

701
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:20,780
And all's you gotta do is wait 277 more days and...

702
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:21,860
You'll have...

703
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,320
You'll get all the subliminal messages and...

704
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:24,980
Good ones.

705
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:26,140
Everything we'll be telling you what...

706
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:26,680
Yeah, good ones.

707
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:27,460
Really good ones.

708
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,860
Not the ones like you get around here.

709
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,380
Like the other day, I was driving through town.

710
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:34,260
I was going through Euclid and I hallucinated that old big boy.

711
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,580
You know the big boy?

712
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:36,240
Yeah.

713
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,180
You know the big boy?

714
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:37,920
I hallucinated.

715
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:40,280
Remember the actual fat big boy out there?

716
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:40,660
Right.

717
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,460
Holding the big boy?

718
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:42,020
Right.

719
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,820
And when I saw that, I got down and worshiped that as an icon.

720
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,440
I knew I was being given subliminal messages by them big boys.

721
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,340
The big boy.

722
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:50,640
Yeah.

723
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:56,280
I mean, the other day in the supermarket, a can of them Bush's baked beans done give

724
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:56,960
me a...

725
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:02,500
Sometimes told me to do something I couldn't even remember afterwards until I think it

726
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,800
was in the evening sometime I was getting drunk and I remember what the hell was in

727
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,660
that can of beans telling me that stuff.

728
00:28:08,040 --> 00:28:09,600
And beans, talking beans.

729
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,180
Yeah.

730
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,340
It's not, you know, hate Nazi, communism, capitalism, you know, beans.

731
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,820
You know, like a can of beans is giving you orders.

732
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:20,200
The white men leave talking beans, son.

733
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,480
Don't mess with the talking beans.

734
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,520
Those are the white man's medicine.

735
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:28,780
That's bad medicine.

736
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:30,180
The talking beans.

737
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,640
What's coffee?

738
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,920
Coffee, the beans that you roast and then place into your rectum before you're shot

739
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,360
deep into the cans.

740
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,800
Coffee is another form of water.

741
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,600
I'm immortal.

742
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,920
Can you grok that?

743
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:47,740
Can you grok that, brother?

744
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,680
Who is this guy?

745
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,560
He shall be killed.

746
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:51,120
Yeah.

747
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:51,320
Who?

748
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,680
Where is he?

749
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:53,300
Who?

750
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:53,560
What?

751
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:54,060
Where is he?

752
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,600
God that made you do this.

753
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,000
Uh, that is, uh, I thought we were talking to Javaro.

754
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:00,800
Yeah.

755
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:01,520
Oh.

756
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,200
You did it then.

757
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,500
In your own dreams.

758
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,820
You did it.

759
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,960
You are your own Messiah.

760
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,720
I never did that.

761
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:10,360
I would never make a peasant do that.

762
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,600
Well, buddy, connect the dot.

763
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,240
Okay.

764
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,400
Connect the dot.

765
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,320
You'll get it.

766
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:15,980
You really will.

767
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,180
I promise you.

768
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,500
Just connect the dot.

769
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,980
Remember, you are your own Messiah.

770
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,500
Come with me!

771
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,560
Come with me!

772
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,820
Come with me!

773
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:50,860
Aaaaaaaahhhhhh!

774
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:55,840
Aaaaaaahhhhhh!

775
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,600
Oh yes!

776
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:02,780
The friends!

777
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:03,200


778
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,420
He did it!

779
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:06,380
He jumped!

780
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:10,740
Just come over here and sit down in this chair right over here.

781
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:13,760
I got something to tell you, kid.

782
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:14,520
That's right.

783
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:15,980
It's an electric chair.

784
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,560
Ha ha ha.

785
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,580
The Governor never calls.

786
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,280
Yeah, just strap yourself in there.

787
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,020
And we'll let you do all the work.

788
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:28,680
Yeah.

789
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,560
You get to do it.

790
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,180
You hit the button right there.

791
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,380
Want any special theme music?

792
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:34,960
Let's see here.

793
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,000
We got theme music.

794
00:30:36,060 --> 00:30:37,780
We can put a video in for you.

795
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,140
And a bar of cartoons.

796
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:40,620
Huckleberry.

797
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,940
How about Popeye?

798
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:44,720
Oh, he's done making choices.

799
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:45,740
Here's Popeye.

800
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:48,160
I'm Popeye the Sailor.

801
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,080
I'm trying to save the man.

802
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,680
Devil, I'll get you.

803
00:30:54,760 --> 00:30:56,780
They may get me now, but I'll get you.

804
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,120
You'll never take me alive.

805
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:16,620
See?

806
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:17,860
It's easy.

807
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,420
And it feels so good.

808
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:23,560
So if you think some ignorant white boys can do it in the 20th century,

809
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:27,860
imagine what it was done like when the canoes looked like gleaming vessels of...

810
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:28,660
Hate.

811
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,260
Hate.

812
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:34,200
Burning vesicles of flaming testicles of pie.

813
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,400
M squared.

814
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,520
Cherry pie.

815
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,340
Yep.

816
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:43,060
The kind Mom used to make when you were a bad little boy.

817
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:43,780
Oh, yeah.

818
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:44,360
Yeah.

819
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,280
Drink of my body.

820
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,560
Smoke of my face.

821
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:49,880
Drop.

822
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,960
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

823
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,400
Roll up my socks.

824
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:55,760
Yeah.

825
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,140
I like when they say drink of my sweat.

826
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,560
Drink of my sweat.

827
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,280
The water.

828
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,820
The back to the water.

829
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:07,260
The bacterial salty water of my extrusion.

830
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,640
That's when we know we're living in an industrial society.

831
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,720
When the preachers come on the television and ask you to drink a tiny small ball of their sweat.

832
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,260
Wrapped in this.

833
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,260
This healing paste.

834
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,980
Yours for only 1795.

835
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:27,040
And you get a book every month after that for the next year.

836
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,580
With little prayer inscriptions, parts, pieces of the scripture.

837
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,760
And look at this little tiny Madonna you can keep in your wallet or billfold.

838
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,620
Eating the mushroom.

839
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,420
Ooh, more mushrooms.

840
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,580
The misery mushrooms.

841
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,620
The misery mushroom.

842
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,240
I must keep going.

843
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:49,640
Keep walking.

844
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,580
No, there's nothing to eat.

845
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:58,260
Someone said she had a dream in Belgium that those huge cathedrals were surrounding her.

846
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:01,480
She said she was mostly trying to time her Owens Beles.

847
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,920
And buildings and everything.

848
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,680
And books and everything.

849
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:05,300
And I.

850
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,000
And I.

851
00:33:07,780 --> 00:33:08,900
And I.

852
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:10,280


853
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,140
And I.

854
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:11,540
And I.

855
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:11,940
And I.

856
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:12,480
And I.

857
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:13,680
And I.

858
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,840
Don't worry, Reverend Shane.

859
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,760
You can trust me.

860
00:33:32,200 --> 00:33:33,100
Oh, gee.

861
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:36,860
Friend, Dr. Legu pointed out

862
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,140
right in public to many subgenies

863
00:33:39,140 --> 00:33:40,060
he says, yes, on

864
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,980
you spent your $30, bought your membership

865
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,900
card, your ministership, and so

866
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,840
forth. Yeah, on next day,

867
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,580
July 5th, 1998,

868
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:50,640
7 a.m., you'll no longer have

869
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,880
to worry about the conspiracy

870
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,200
or any of the bad aliens.

871
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,540
You won't have to worry about any of that stuff.

872
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,420
You'll be protected

873
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,840
from the conspiracy.

874
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:02,680
But Bob didn't say

875
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,260
anything about who was going to protect

876
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:06,700
you from your fellow subgeniuses.

877
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:08,460
Kill him!

878
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,840
You'll get your own planet

879
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,620
in 295

880
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:13,960
days. Oh, yeah.

881
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,980
But so will he.

882
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,440
What

883
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:19,900
if Dr. Legu

884
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:22,060
decides his planet

885
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,300
isn't big enough, his planet of

886
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,400
broken glass

887
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,400
isn't big enough, and he

888
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,880
wants to turn your

889
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,400
planet into a planet of broken glass?

890
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:34,720
You know,

891
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,500
some people say church is subgenius,

892
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,220
so they get involved in it, and they say

893
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:40,380
after about six or so,

894
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,600
they get real involved. They jump into the

895
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,740
internet intercourse

896
00:34:44,740 --> 00:34:46,620
of the church and so forth. After about

897
00:34:46,620 --> 00:34:47,740
six months, they're going,

898
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:50,040
God, this is worse than high school!

899
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,080
The popular ones pick on the

900
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,640
wimps even worse than in real life!

901
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,280
Yes, friend,

902
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,320
it is like the high school

903
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,120
from hell.

904
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:00,900
Praise hell!

905
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,340
Yeah, praise hell. Praise hell and praise the hate,

906
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:04,820
friends.

907
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:07,780
Actually, you know,

908
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,580
my own,

909
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,480
I've got teenage kids, believe it or not,

910
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,040
and one of them just

911
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:16,080
graduated from school, and he was so

912
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:17,640
glad to get out of high school,

913
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,860
because he thought that people

914
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,940
in high school were so phenol,

915
00:35:22,060 --> 00:35:23,380
full of vanity,

916
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,600
clustering together in cliques

917
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:27,120
to gang up on others,

918
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,200
afraid of anything different.

919
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,800
And he

920
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,600
was so glad to get out of

921
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:34,440
high school.

922
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:37,760
I didn't have

923
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,080
the heart to tell him

924
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:41,660
what it was going to be like when he got his

925
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,180
first office job.

926
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,040
Friends,

927
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,440
but one thing delivers,

928
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:50,520
one thing sustains us,

929
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,180
and you've heard this word before tonight,

930
00:35:52,280 --> 00:35:53,620
and that word is hate!

931
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:54,900
Hate!

932
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:56,540
Yeah, it's an ugly word.

933
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,780
I've seen all the subgeniuses love hate.

934
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,780
I've seen crowds of them

935
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,360
chanting,

936
00:36:02,780 --> 00:36:04,820
hate, hate, kill them.

937
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:07,180
It's a beautiful thing to see them like that,

938
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,240
chanting.

939
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:11,920
And indeed, the creativity

940
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:13,700
is a wonderful thing.

941
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:16,260
Our hate is like

942
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:17,720
a self-fueling,

943
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:19,120
fusion reactor.

944
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,920
Actually, the conspiracy itself

945
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,220
provides the plutonium

946
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,080
which fuels our hate

947
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,280
dynamos.

948
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,180
It's a great metaphor.

949
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,340
Like I said, it sounds ugly,

950
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:32,200
doesn't it? But isn't that what

951
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:34,380
all religions are really all about

952
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,460
is hate? They don't care.

953
00:36:36,500 --> 00:36:38,140
They talk about how they love

954
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,020
God, love Jesus,

955
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,540
love Muhammad. What they really love

956
00:36:42,540 --> 00:36:44,420
is the idea of you

957
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:45,600
going to hell.

958
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,540
And them not doing it.

959
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,740
That's the kind of hate that we hate.

960
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,280
That's normal hatred.

961
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,540
It's a pathetic little...

962
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,280
They want to destroy anything

963
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:58,180
they don't have, whether they

964
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,640
want it or not, especially if it's

965
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,420
something that they desperately need

966
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:04,040
but can't understand.

967
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,340
Like slack.

968
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,180
But our hate is not

969
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,800
wasted on individuals.

970
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,900
No, they're such a nation.

971
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,340
They're such a...

972
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:16,640
They are crazy.

973
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:20,080
They're such a...

974
00:37:52,640 --> 00:37:53,160
They're such a...

975
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,160


976
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,160


977
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,160


978
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,160


979
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,160


980
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:53,700
The song went down.

981
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:57,380
She got a chili coal thing on the back of her shoe, buddy.

982
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,560
And she thought they was like, you know,

983
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,680
the big cathedral thing

984
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,020
had eyes and they were trying to eat her

985
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:04,580
and stuff.

986
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:07,460
Let me suck your rock hard in that...

987
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,180
And there on the side of the building,

988
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,160
King Kong,

989
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,120
King Kong clung

990
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,500
to the pipe.

991
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:16,820
To the pipe.

992
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:18,300
The pipe.

993
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,720
King Kong.

994
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,720
Scratching at it with his little

995
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,840
fingernails.

996
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,380
And the pipe.

997
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,680
And the pipe.

998
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:32,120
And the Pharaoh smoke

999
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,120
in the distance.

1000
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:34,080
Frog.

1001
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:38,200
Well, thank God the Indians

1002
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,060
had pyramids 5,000 years before

1003
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:42,060
the Mexicans or else we would have

1004
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,340
never had them heaping, whomping good tacos

1005
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:46,040
they got down at Taco Jerry's.

1006
00:38:46,180 --> 00:38:47,500
Mmm, fishin'.

1007
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:47,700
Mmm.

1008
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:47,860
Mmm.

1009
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:48,060


1010
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:51,160
Nuclear fishin' tacos.

1011
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,960
Fishin' tacos.

1012
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:53,660
Mmm.

1013
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:53,880
Mmm.

1014
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:54,860
Nuclear fishin'.

1015
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:57,160
You can get the cold fishin' tacos

1016
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,800
and the hot fishin' tacos.

1017
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,000
You can actually get one of those rectal jammers.

1018
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:04,240
You can get the fusion taco now, too.

1019
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,920
And the cyclotron accelerator.

1020
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,200
Or the decelerator.

1021
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,820
That is if you don't want to eat as fast.

1022
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:14,500
The accelerator taco is really big, though.

1023
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,900
Yeah, but you do get mighty windy afterwards.

1024
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:17,660
It's 30.

1025
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,620
It's 30 miles in diameter.

1026
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:19,380
Yeah.

1027
00:39:20,060 --> 00:39:21,240
It's the biggest in town.

1028
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:21,820
Yeah.

1029
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:22,440
They claim.

1030
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:25,140
It only costs 99 cents.

1031
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,360
Well, that's it.

1032
00:39:26,440 --> 00:39:27,580
Well, I'm not sure I can say that.

1033
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:30,580
Well, if you do qualify for the government grant,

1034
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,900
it's only 99 cents.

1035
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,920
If you're just a regular...

1036
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,140
You know, if you walk in off the street

1037
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:34,900
and say, give me one of them...

1038
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:35,880
It costs $4 billion.

1039
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:36,660
Yeah.

1040
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:37,460
So who cares?

1041
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:38,820
They kind of change around with them.

1042
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:39,660
Yeah.

1043
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,100
I do sometimes, but it's not the kind of change

1044
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,940
you'd want to be around when it was happening.

1045
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:44,520
No.

1046
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:45,840
No.

1047
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:45,940
Okay.

1048
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,000
A little psychomomatronity there.

1049
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,240
Especially since they got rid of the $1 million bill.

1050
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:55,160
It's not easy to carry around a couple of bill.

1051
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:57,620
Oh, if you want change for salsa, you're out of luck.

1052
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,380
You're out of luck.

1053
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:58,780
All right.

1054
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,400
Flying saucers never change, though.

1055
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:02,300
Nope.

1056
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,480
It's the universal stability principle.

1057
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,040
That's the disc.

1058
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:09,120
That's why females have breasts on them

1059
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,640
so that we can think about discs and stuff

1060
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:14,100
to remind us that we have to get the hell out of here.

1061
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:14,940
Yeah.

1062
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,400
I think.

1063
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:17,560
Bang on a drum.

1064
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,700
Yeah, that's an oval-shaped thing, too.

1065
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:20,260
Yeah.

1066
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:22,340
They look just like flying saucers.

1067
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,260
Let the prisoner go.

1068
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,720
Yeah, feed them on bread and water, but let them go.

1069
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,160
Damn you.

1070
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,900
I haven't gone in weeks.

1071
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:32,220
Let them drift away.

1072
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,020
What's it to you?

1073
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,100
What's it three by four you?

1074
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:36,760
Yeah.

1075
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,100
You come and you go.

1076
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,540
Sometimes you come in your pants

1077
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:44,180
when you're driving in your car and you're confused.

1078
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,160
Yeah.

1079
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:48,500
Sometimes you go backwards

1080
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,280
and you still forget how it started

1081
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,440
so you're left without any contextual framework.

1082
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:54,720
Yeah.

1083
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:55,600
That's bad.

1084
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:58,500
You know, you're twilighted, zoned and stuff, you know,

1085
00:40:58,520 --> 00:40:59,860
and things just don't make sense.

1086
00:40:59,940 --> 00:41:02,560
Things are like odd little dark currents

1087
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,840
that roll around in your mind

1088
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:08,080
like some sort of shining, sparkling drift

1089
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,480
in the nucleus of space.

1090
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:15,440
Like a brainstorm, but a bad one.

1091
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:15,740
You know?

1092
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:15,920
Yeah.

1093
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:17,640
It kind of makes your ears flood

1094
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,140
and them conduit pipes behind your head

1095
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:22,080
actually light up in the middle of the dark.

1096
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,920
Try getting a drink looking like that.

1097
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,680
Especially with the specs and shoes I got

1098
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:29,240
and the pair of spats I have to wear

1099
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,320
since my increasements.

1100
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,160
I had not only a beta increasement,

1101
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:34,360
but I had an oxygen case.

1102
00:41:35,180 --> 00:41:36,960
And the oxygen case been going on

1103
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,440
for something like 15 years now.

1104
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,140
I mean, I wouldn't want to use anybody else's

1105
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,860
clothes or anything.

1106
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:45,300
I mean, I wouldn't just,

1107
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:45,920
just wouldn't want to use anybody else's clothes.

1108
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:46,900
I wouldn't want to share like that.

1109
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:48,480
I wasn't born.

1110
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,580
I was made.

1111
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:50,680
I was created.

1112
00:41:51,820 --> 00:41:54,560
And it wasn't a kind and loving God that fetched me.

1113
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:56,260
It was a pissed off old man.

1114
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,240
Some people think that angels

1115
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:04,880
went into the creation of their being

1116
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,880
and that angels made the sparks that made them go.

1117
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,240
We know what it really was.

1118
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,800
Simple toss of a card.

1119
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:15,660
Grumpy,

1120
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:15,880
old,

1121
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:16,540
old fart saying,

1122
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:19,520
here's nothing human being to look at for a while.

1123
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,740
I can't believe it.

1124
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:21,360
I,

1125
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,160
please,

1126
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:22,960
please,

1127
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:23,500
Roxy.

1128
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,120
Let me do it.

1129
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,340
Now we've gone too deep.

1130
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:30,660
You can't go back now.

1131
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,260
You have to follow the road.

1132
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,000
You told us this is what you wanted.

1133
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,880
Sin and,

1134
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,560
um,

1135
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:41,520
poison.

1136
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:42,100
Too much gas.

1137
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,500
No wonder.

1138
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:44,980
Dave's hallucinating again.

1139
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:45,520
Yes,

1140
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:45,760
yes.

1141
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:47,120
We check it out.

1142
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:50,900
I thought that that was the moment.

1143
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:51,780
Hey,

1144
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:56,700
naughty,

1145
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,720
naughty.

1146
00:42:58,040 --> 00:42:59,080
Someone's got the bus.

1147
00:42:59,180 --> 00:42:59,700
Someone's breathing.

1148
00:43:00,120 --> 00:43:01,040
Church air.

1149
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:01,600
Hey,

1150
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:05,020
yes.

1151
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,000
I want to.

1152
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:07,380
Hey,

1153
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,280
you know,

1154
00:43:09,300 --> 00:43:10,000
it's bashful.

1155
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:14,000
You know what that means when you're bashful?

1156
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:15,600
Uh,

1157
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:18,400
you have some kind of like an idea of,

1158
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:18,860
you know,

1159
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:19,140
I,

1160
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,640
I really.

1161
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:23,340
Ladies and gentlemen,

1162
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,520
every year,

1163
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:32,900
thousands of landmines are abandoned by people who just can't care enough to give their landmine the sort of love and attention it needs.

1164
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,820
Under the mistaken belief that the landmine can take care of itself,

1165
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:42,460
these poor explosives are left in deserted war zones and along interstate highways.

1166
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,280
Most of them desire starvation.

1167
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:47,460
Others are eaten by predatory.

1168
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:48,100
Yeah.

1169
00:43:55,200 --> 00:44:02,640
So the conspiracy itself provides the plutonium which fuels our hate dynamos.

1170
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:03,560
Praise the Lord.

1171
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:05,500
And like I said,

1172
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,640
it sounds ugly,

1173
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,260
doesn't it?

1174
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:11,300
But isn't that what all religions are really all about is hate?

1175
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,780
They don't care.

1176
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:15,200
They talk about how they love God.

1177
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,280
Love Jesus.

1178
00:44:16,540 --> 00:44:17,260
Love Mohammed.

1179
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:21,920
What they really love is the idea of you going to hell.

1180
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:22,500
Yeah.

1181
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,800
And then not doing.

1182
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,660
But that's the,

1183
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,060
that's the kind of hate that we hate.

1184
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,620
That's normal hatred.

1185
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,580
It's pathetic little.

1186
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:33,740
They want to destroy anything they don't have,

1187
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,580
whether they want it or not,

1188
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:40,400
especially if it's something that they desperately need but can't understand.

1189
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:41,680
Like slack.

1190
00:44:42,360 --> 00:44:45,000
But our hate is not wasted.

1191
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:45,180
It's not wasted.

1192
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:45,960
It's wasted on individuals.

1193
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:47,020
No,

1194
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,480
they're such our nations.

1195
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:53,240
Even such vessels are far too small to contain our great hate.

G Gordon Gordon.

1198
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:56,600
Yes,

1199
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:56,820
friends.

1200
00:44:56,980 --> 00:45:03,380
Ours is an all-consuming and all-encompassing and all-pervading hate.

1201
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:05,220
A radioactive hate.

1202
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,140
A burning,

1203
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,020
scouring,

1204
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:08,900
annihilating hate.

1205
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:09,860
And that's when,

1206
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,160
when you build it up that,

1207
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,580
pump it up that much,

1208
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:12,980
friends,

1209
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,820
that's when you start to become the hate.

1210
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:17,760
But then,

1211
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,760
we would,

1212
00:45:18,760 --> 00:45:19,060
check it out,

1213
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:19,980
I thought,

1214
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:20,920
I thought that,

1215
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:21,520
roll that back,

1216
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,060
roll that back.

1217
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,660
That was the moment when the raw eggs were placed under his pillow.

1218
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,320
He's still on his way to Alpha Centauri.

1219
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,200
Yes.

1220
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:30,620
There we have it.

1221
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:31,000
Now,

1222
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:31,600
now zoom in,

1223
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:32,180
zoom in there.

1224
00:45:32,260 --> 00:45:32,460
Look,

1225
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,740
the eggs are seeping from around the pillow.

1226
00:45:34,820 --> 00:45:36,140
He's rolling in the,

1227
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,320
in the flattened,

1228
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:38,020
broken eggs.

1229
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,660
He does not even seem to notice.

1230
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,120
He's not waking up.

1231
00:45:42,120 --> 00:45:42,820
Now,

1232
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:43,840
as the eggs not,

1233
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:44,440
matter,

1234
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,140
begins to assimilate into his paws,

1235
00:45:47,460 --> 00:45:49,340
things change and take place.

1236
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,280
He's only two months from Alpha Centauri.

1237
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:55,820
He's actually entered the Alpha Centauri system.

1238
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:56,900
You want to bring him back?

1239
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:58,440
That's why you're here.

1240
00:45:58,580 --> 00:45:59,600
Bring him back.

1241
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:01,680
Bring him back.

1242
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:04,560
He starts to hear,

1243
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:07,320
radio signals.

1244
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,460
That's a call, Jimmy.

1245
00:46:08,780 --> 00:46:09,680
Here he comes.

1246
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:10,760
Here he comes.

1247
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:11,260
Take one.

1248
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:12,720
Voices.

1249
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:14,960
Voices.

1250
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:17,140
He heard voices.

1251
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:19,660
One tree reaches Alpha Centauri.

1252
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:20,040
Oh,

1253
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:21,500
it's in the Pullman car.

1254
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:23,940
It'll be a couple more months.

1255
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:24,620
Pullman.

1256
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:25,500
Or the Orbitz.

1257
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:27,040
Where's my daiquiri and cheese?

1258
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:31,800
And then he'll be a beacon for the pleasure ships.

1259
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:32,920
Don't be reluctant.

1260
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,760
Don't be reluctant.

1261
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:35,940
Give in.

1262
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:37,620
Give in.

1263
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,980
Give in.

1264
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,440
Give in.

1265
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:40,520
Give in.

1266
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:40,780
Give in.

1267
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:40,800
Give in.

1268
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:42,100
Give in.

1269
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,100


1270
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,100


1271
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,100


1272
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,100


1273
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,100


1274
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,100


1275
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,100


1276
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,100


1277
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,560
Give in.

1278
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,100
Give in.

1279
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:56,340


1280
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:56,680
Come on, Jimmy.

1281
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:56,880


1282
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:56,880


1283
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:01,960
Banzai, it's time.

1284
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,300
I'm glad you're load up.

1285
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:11,100
Hold up.

1286
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:42,080

1287
00:47:51,300 --> 00:48:11,980

1299
00:53:46,940 --> 00:53:48,960
I like the future. I'm in it.

1300
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,900
I built it myself and I love it.

1301
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,140
I'm not sure.

1302
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:54,240
Personally, I'm very pleased.

1303
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:56,440
I think it's going to be all right.

1304
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:57,300
I can dig in.

1305
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,940
How do I like the future?

1306
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:00,860
Well, the future's not here yet, man.

1307
00:54:02,020 --> 00:54:03,240
Smaller, but cleaner.

1308
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:04,640
Right on.

1309
00:54:04,900 --> 00:54:07,060
I say live it or live with it.

1310
00:54:07,260 --> 00:54:07,860
Straight ahead.

1311
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:11,040
Well, I think it has quite a great future in it.

1312
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:11,640
It's electric.

1313
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,060
Yes, it's the Honorable Chester Cadiver.

1314
00:54:17,340 --> 00:54:23,220
Sure, understanding today's complex world of the future is a little like having bees live in your head.

1315
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:24,920
But there they are.

1316
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:26,940
And like the young lady said...

1317
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,900
I said live it or live with it.

1318
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,080
What does this mean?

1319
00:54:30,520 --> 00:54:33,820
Well, for the straight poop, let's go where I go every morning.

1320
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:38,180
Centrally located and barely a stone's throw from the tomb of the unregistered voter,

1321
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:41,040
downstairs in the historic old grid building.

1322
00:54:41,360 --> 00:54:41,760
Hello.

1323
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:42,720
Hello, Clive.

1324
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:44,340
Ah, come on in, Chester.

1325
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:45,120
Thank you very much.

1326
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:46,100
Thank you very much.

1327
00:54:46,120 --> 00:54:50,300
Hey, hey, you're just in time to help me check out this new model government.

1328
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:50,620
Yeah?

1329
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:53,960
Yeah, they just brought it down and they say it explains everything.

1330
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,120
Well, you know, it sure is big.

1331
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:56,900
Hey, well, look, look over there on the left end.

1332
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:57,520
That's where you work.

1333
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,300
They're in the Bureau of Western Mythology.

1334
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:03,600
By golly, we're a proud service of the Lost Electricity Reclamation Agency, Senator.

1335
00:55:03,780 --> 00:55:05,660
Yeah, well, the LAS is under the left...

1336
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:07,000
Well, it's...

1337
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,040
I, uh, don't...

1338
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,020
I think I'll just plug it in.

1339
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,020
Oh, well, listen, I'll just use this little plug.

1340
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:12,620
Right down here.

1341
00:55:12,620 --> 00:55:13,820
Not that plug, Choco.

1342
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:14,760
Uh-uh, see?

1343
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,700
Oh, that's terrible.

1344
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,160
Oh, you've got to plug in the female.

1345
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,400
Ah, listen to it.

1346
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,580
Teaches you, huh?

1347
00:55:22,740 --> 00:55:22,940
Yeah.

1348
00:55:22,980 --> 00:55:24,160
Half a watt comes in here.

1349
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:25,980
Ha, must go out there.

1350
00:55:26,340 --> 00:55:26,960
Right-o.

1351
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:32,060
Ah, let's see what it does with this fine miniature boxcar of industrial coke.

1352
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:32,540
Okay.

1353
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,520
Oh, yeah, look at that.

1354
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,960
Ah, turn it up.

1355
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:36,640
That's amazing.

1356
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:37,160
Let's see.

1357
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:40,500
It's pumped from the Veterans Tap Dance Administration.

1358
00:55:40,640 --> 00:55:41,900
It goes up here.

1359
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,300
To the Assistant Secretary of Leftovers.

1360
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:47,060
Let's plop down to the Secretariat Covers.

1361
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:47,540
Right, right.

1362
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:48,480
Now, watch it go now.

1363
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,740
Around the Department of Spies.

1364
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,080
And, uh...

1365
00:55:52,080 --> 00:55:55,080
Ah, into the office of the Secretary of Failure himself.

1366
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:55,780
Wouldn't you know?

1367
00:55:55,980 --> 00:55:57,520
That's shoes for industry, Charlie.

1368
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,540
And it's food for thought, you know, Mr. Brown?

1369
00:55:59,700 --> 00:56:02,100
Yeah, but we're talking about power, Choco.

1370
00:56:02,280 --> 00:56:03,180
Well, I know you are.

1371
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,160
You wouldn't be here.

1372
00:56:04,480 --> 00:56:06,840
Oh, look at that.

1373
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:07,740
Yes, sirree.

1374
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:11,260
It heard the word power, and it responded just like we do.

1375
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:11,400
Ooh.

1376
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:12,980
And here it comes.

1377
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:15,380
Here comes our ox cart right back to Earth.

1378
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:18,340
Smack dab on the middle of the Small Animal Administration.

1379
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:21,740
Well, I must say, that's the most incredible demonstration.

1380
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:23,640
But where are the humans, officer?

1381
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,740
Why, they're right here, son, waiting in the lobby to use the power of that ton of coke.

1382
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:30,840
Oh, then we must be very near the President, Mr. Devis.

1383
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:31,740
Yes, Dagwood.

1384
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,300
He's the terminal bus.

1385
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:34,380
The output.

1386
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,040
I'll bet you he really puts out.

1387
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:36,760
That's right.

1388
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,080
Everyone's always asking him questions.

1389
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,160
Oh, well, maybe my friend here will.

1390
00:56:41,260 --> 00:56:42,040
I'd like to ask something.

1391
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,780
He's been with us since before the beginning, sir.

1392
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:48,760
He must be bursting with a short question about his place in the future.

1393
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:50,160
Oh, is he your friend?

1394
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:50,620
Yes.

1395
00:56:50,820 --> 00:56:51,840
Well, I'll ask him his name.

1396
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,060
Oh, I'm sorry.

1397
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,180
Could you state your name?

1398
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,740
Please state your name.

1399
00:56:59,740 --> 00:57:01,300
Oh, oh, do you want me to...

1400
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,920
Please state your first name.

1401
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:04,460
Uh, Ivan.

1402
00:57:05,020 --> 00:57:05,540
Who?

1403
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:06,520
Uh, Clem.

1404
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,580
Now we can introduce you and some of your selected neighbors to...

1405
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:11,740
The President.

1406
00:57:13,040 --> 00:57:13,680
Thanks.

1407
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,740
Step off stopping yellow line.

1408
00:57:16,060 --> 00:57:16,420
Okay.

1409
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:19,340
Stand on steady blue lines.

1410
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,060
Strobbing.

1411
00:57:21,180 --> 00:57:23,500
You are now going to see the President.

1412
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:24,040
Oh, okay.

1413
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,260
No flashes, please.

1414
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,400
Thank you.

1415
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,920
You're not spring-headed.

1416
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:28,520
Here I come.

1417
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:34,340
Yes, dear friends.

1418
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,540
That was the Firesign Theater.

1419
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:40,300
Progenitors, you might say.

1420
00:57:40,420 --> 00:57:41,100
One of the...

1421
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:47,780
From their album, old album, called, uh, I Think We're All Bozos on This Bus.

1422
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:54,380
Probably one of the most influential, oh, I guess you'd call it a comedy record or, um,

1423
00:57:54,380 --> 00:58:01,560
uh, radio play or whatnot of, of, uh, folks like Einstein's Secret Orchestra, um, Lonesome

1424
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:07,620
Cowboy Dave, certainly, and, uh, the, the KPFA subgenius radio show, Mongers, and me.

1425
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,040
We're all old Firesign Theater heads.

1426
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:11,080
And friends, I'm about to...

1427
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:12,040
Give you a couple of addresses.

1428
00:58:12,220 --> 00:58:17,980
An important one being the address of Einstein's Secret Orchestra, where you can write to them

1429
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:24,300
about, uh, I believe Chaz does, like, a little publication with, uh, sick, perverted artwork

1430
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,560
in it, and, and, um, they have tapes.

1431
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,460
And the Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

1432
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,900
Got that pencil ready?

1433
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:38,100
3-2-2-6, West 99th Street, Cleveland, Ohio.

1434
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,520
Once again, and I'll give that zip.

1435
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:48,820
And that's 3-2-2-6, West 99th Street, Cleveland, Ohio.

1436
00:58:49,580 --> 00:58:53,840
4-4-1-0-2.

1437
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,200
4-4-1-0-2.

1438
00:58:56,220 --> 00:58:59,460
And friends, of course, the subgenius post office box.

1439
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,320
The Church of the Subgenius, P.O.

1440
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:10,260
Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1441
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,620
If you join, I'll let you spank my bottom.

1442
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:14,960
Oh, yeah.

1443
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:17,400
You know you want me.

1444
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:18,880
You want it, friends.

1445
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:20,380
You want it.

1446
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:29,060
It's only Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

1447
00:59:29,140 --> 00:59:30,960
What else have we been listening to?

1448
00:59:31,060 --> 00:59:39,100
Um, besides the ESO, uh, broadcast with, uh, Dave and Chaz from, uh, from WCSB in Cleveland,

1449
00:59:39,260 --> 00:59:40,640
uh, we also heard music.

1450
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,540
Music from Ego Plum.

1451
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:56,160
Um, and which you can, uh, you can get information about, um, Ego Plum from www.EbolaMusic.com.

1452
00:59:56,820 --> 00:59:57,800
How about that?

1453
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:01,440
And I believe we gave, uh, his address last week.

1454
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:09,100
Also, we were hearing, uh, the, uh, Fringeware-sponsored subgenius devival in Austin, Texas.

1455
01:00:09,360 --> 01:00:10,440
Uh, uh.

1456
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,540
Uh, yes.

1457
01:00:12,260 --> 01:00:13,060
Praise Fringeware.

1458
01:00:13,220 --> 01:00:17,080
Um, uh, uh, great preaching there by, uh, Reverend Ed Strange.

1459
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:18,920
And what else?

1460
01:00:18,940 --> 01:00:20,540
I guess that's all it's, it's mostly been.

1461
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:25,140
It's been, uh, ESO, Einstein Secret Orchestra, and, uh, subgenius devival.

1462
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:28,960
A little bit of Wendy Carlos, a little bit of Jimmy.

1463
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,660
Here's Wendy Carlos in the background and J.S. Bach.

1464
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:33,120
Oops.

1465
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:36,760
Friends, I keep pushing the wrong knobs.

1466
01:00:37,380 --> 01:00:37,780
Ahem.

1467
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:38,900
Hey.

1468
01:00:39,460 --> 01:00:40,620
Oh, and we heard some Fringeware.

1469
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:43,920
Friday Jones there, I believe, talking about, uh, her landmines.

1470
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:49,100
Uh, friends, it's a beautiful, beautiful thing, this old...

1471
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:49,940
No, it's not.

1472
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:51,140
It's an ugly old thing.

1473
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:52,240
This old church is.

1474
01:00:52,340 --> 01:00:54,980
It's an ugly, ugly thing, and I love it.

1475
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,820
And good night.
