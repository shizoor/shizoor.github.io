1
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:10,300
And now, the subgenius hour of SWAC.

2
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:28,840
Okay, engine stop.

3
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,320
We've got a descent.

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,560
Both control both auto-damage.

5
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,680
Command override off.

6
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:34,460
And drop off.

7
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:35,760
Tranquility base here.

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,080
The Eagle has landed.

9
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,480
Roger, Twink.

10
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,600
Tranquility, we copy you on the ground.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,980
Levitating 285, contact 105-25-52.

12
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,180

13
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:50,940
Levitating 285, contact 105-25-52.

14
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,060

16
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,200

17
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:05,500
Levitating 285, contact 105-25-52.

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,120
Computer, activate emergency medical holographic program.

19
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,340
All program.

20
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,760
Although your world wonders me,

21
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,300
with your majestic and superior cackling hand,

22
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,380
your people I do not understand.

23
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,480
So to you I shall put an end.

24
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:36,520
Hello, I am your New Moon bender.

25
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,420
I do everyone bad.

26
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,800
The other one has switched off the Hierophant Quan,

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,900
because they are seeing the No Jean and they do one thing

28
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,880
that I would not imagine dealing with them that most people would feel like it is a trouble.

29
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:45,220
And you are going to be

30
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:48,280
standing on this piece of ice for a long time.

31
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:48,580
For all as much hurt and as marriage and such.

32
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,360
And the others want you dead,

33
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:53,860
and so I think I am younger and ранier.

34
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,860
Have you seen him?

35
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:55,640
How he looks.

36
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:55,640


37
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:55,640


38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:55,640


39
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,740
I do not want to see you hanged.

40
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:57,280
Oh!

41
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,320
My fellow Americans,

42
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,080
I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation

43
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,500
that will outlaw Russia forever.

44
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,900
We begin bombing in five minutes.

45
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,940
The functioning of our senses has been spiritually impaired

46
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:52,460
and chemically corrupted by the fake artificial food coloring.

47
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,620
We're the lucky ones.

48
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,120
The handful with the chance to reach another world.

49
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,720
And we're the lucky ones.

50
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,480
And we'll use those guns, you'll use them, doctor,

51
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:02,060
to keep your only chance to stay alive.

52
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,620
Somebody tell me, who is this guy?

53
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,560
Shit-hot Bob John.

54
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,580
Shit-hot Bob John.

55
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,600
Shit-hot Bob John.

56
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,580
Shit-hot Bob John.

57
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,080
Shit-hot Bob John.

58
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:16,620
Bob John.

59
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,880
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

60
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,700
Come on, baby, let me tell you about a place

61
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,120
that ain't far from here, it's in outer space.

62
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,940
Come on, baby, let me tell you about a place

63
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,700
that ain't far from here, it's in outer space.

64
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,380
Come on, baby, let me tell you about a place

65
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:28,680
that ain't far from here, it's in outer space.

66
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,080
That good chicken there.

67
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,400
Salt-fried chicken.

68
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,400
A musician, if you consider the normal pattern

69
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:46,720
of modern civilized life, is on the outside of it all.

70
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,280
He doesn't build things, he doesn't work regular hours

71
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:52,860
like a decent, God-fearing citizen,

72
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:56,540
and the life he leads in many ways seems useless,

73
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,440
and irrelevant to those of us who prefer

74
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:01,460
a quiet evening in front of the television

75
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,040
and a bottle of beer.

76
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,960
Amazing as it might seem to some of us,

77
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,440
musicians have basic physical needs,

78
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,080
just like real people.

79
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:16,960
If I could just get my hands on a big, fat, juicy prairie squid.

80
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:19,380
Oh, yeah!

81
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,000
Ha, ha, ha.

82
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,880
Prairie squid.

83
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,800
Prairie squid.

84
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:26,520
Prairie squid.

85
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,820
Prairie squid.

86
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,620
Prairie squid.

87
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:30,800
Prairie squid.

88
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,840
Prairie squid.

89
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,820
Prairie squid.

90
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,880
Whenever you can hear NATO

91
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,660
traumat glow

92
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,840
Look, Connie is coming.

93
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,340
It's useless to read this.

94
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,160
Mr. Connie.

95
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,840
Mr. Connie.

96
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,500
Mr. Connie.

97
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,980
Mr. Connie.

98
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:19,300
Anti-virgin Cosmo Green, the prettiest thing you've ever seen.

99
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,120
She's super sexy, nasty, mean.

100
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,960
The original bad girl, so unclean.

101
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,520
An uber from outer space.

102
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,560
She's so outrageous in your face.

103
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:30,020
An icon of desire and sex, just like the girls from Planet X.

104
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:33,380
A diva of debauchery, mistress of hot swivory.

105
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,460
She's ultra cool, she's so hot.

106
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,780
A juice of genius, patriarch.

107
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,520
Our sister of salvation.

108
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,820
A pin-up queen for masturbation.

109
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,980
A true Jezebel.

110
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,280
She'll send you straight to pink hell.

111
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,920
Divine domestic deviation.

112
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:50,800
Connie is your inspiration.

113
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:54,320
A lonely leader in fighting love.

114
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,800
This is the Connie we trust.

115
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,380
Divine domestic deviation.

116
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:04,980
Connie is your inspiration.

117
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,540
A lonely leader in fighting love.

118
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,900
This is the Connie we trust.

119
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,760
Look out, boy, she's on her way.

120
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,400
Our darling Connie is here to stay.

121
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,280
A girl like her is something rare.

122
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,780
She's superwoman, she's everywhere.

123
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,760
A mighty enemy of the safe.

124
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,620
She's the devil incarnate.

125
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,280
She's one hell of a revelation.

126
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,100
A siren of divine creation.

127
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,860
Hail Connie, fuck Bob.

128
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,700
This girl's got class, a true hard throb.

129
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,500
She'll get you on this righteous kick.

130
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:48,200
Get with Connie, do it quick.

131
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,920
This girl's a winner in plain to see.

132
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:51,640
She's the center of our galaxy.

133
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,940
She's the heaven's interpretation.

134
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,140
Straight from bottom radiation.

135
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,040
Divine domestic deviation.

136
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,960
Connie is your inspiration.

137
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:05,460

139
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:12,200

141
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,600

A lovely leader in fighting love.

Does we trust.

156
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,580
Does we trust.

157
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:19,580


158
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:19,580


159
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:19,580


160
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:22,500
Sister Corny

161
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:25,980
Sister Corny

162
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:30,920
I have sinned against you my lord

163
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,460
And I beg your forgiveness

164
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,460
I do not call it a mistake

165
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:04,180
I do not call it

166
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,780
A mendacity

167
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:10,720
I call it sin

168
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,220
I call it sin

169
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,780
I want to address myself

170
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,520
As best as I know how

171
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:38,580
To those that I have wronged

172
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,300
That I have sinned against

173
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,440
I want to address myself

174
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:43,340
First of all

175
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,800
My wife Frances

176
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:49,100
God never gave a man

177
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:51,880
A better helpmate

178
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,260
And companion

179
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,300
To stand beside him

180
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:03,940
I have sinned against you

181
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,540
And I beg your forgiveness

182
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,860
Sister Corny

183
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:22,860


184
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,560
God never gave a man

185
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:25,460
A father

186
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,420
A minister

187
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,600
Of the gospel

188
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,560
A finer son

189
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,500
Than he has given me

190
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,580
And his mother

191
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:38,080
Sister Corny

192
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,440
I have sinned against you my lord

193
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,440


194
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,440


195
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,440


196
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,440


197
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:41,440


198
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,800
Donnie and Debbie,

199
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,480
I have sinned against you.

200
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,460
And I beg you to forgive me.

201
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:18,860
I know that so many would ask,

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,200
why?

203
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:22,940
Why?

204
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:30,300
I have asked myself that 10,000 times

205
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:34,640
through 10,000 tears.

206
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,380
Why?

207
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,060
Why?

208
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,900
I call it sin.

209
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,300
I have sinned against you, my Lord.

210
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:09,080
And I would ask that your precious blood

211
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,680
be shed.

212
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,940
I would wash and cleanse every stain

213
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:25,600
until it is in the seas of God's forgetfulness,

214
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:32,480
never to be remembered against me anymore.

215
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,460
Here is my testimony against minimizing the sin

216
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:47,460


217
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:47,780
Ilán Gonzalez

218
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,420
Ilán González

219
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:48,680
Ilán González

220
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:52,540
he's the media darling they like to see.

221
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,120
They watch him go pee

222
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,280
look at him playing

223
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:59,160
playing Nintendo...

224
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:01,360
while Barney's asleep on the floor.

225
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,160
Let's give him more.

226
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:10,340
All the stupid people, where do they all come from?

227
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:17,000
All the stupid people, where do they all belong?

228
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:24,280
Look at this moron, cutting me off on the freeway because he can't drive.

229
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,680
He should not be alive.

230
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:33,120
Here comes George Jr., constructing sentences badly while he smirks and grins.

231
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:35,860
Will he get in?

232
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:41,880
All the stupid people, where do they all come from?

233
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:48,620
All the stupid people, where do they all belong?

234
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:54,260
I look at all the stupid people.

235
00:13:56,600 --> 00:14:01,160
I look at all the stupid people.

236
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,140
My heart is broken.

237
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,140


238
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:04,840
My heart is broken.

239
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,300
Luckily you won't hear me talk at all.

240
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:09,420
That's because it's over in shape.

241
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,220
They want me to come back.

242
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,160
I don't want him to come back.

243
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:17,620
I don't want him to come back.

244
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,100
I don't want him to come back.

245
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,640
I don't want him to come back.

246
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:21,600
I'm never going to come back.

247
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:21,600


248
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:27,280
All the stupid people, where do they all come from?

249
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:33,800
All the stupid people, where do they all belong?

250
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:57,080
Well, that was, uh, old death.

251
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,900
Friend, you know, you gotta shout and make a lot of noise.

252
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,800
Because when you're dead, you shut up like hell.

253
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:08,540
So we're here to make some noise.

254
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:15,460
And, uh, that song, Old Death, was used in that movie, Brother, Where Art Thou?

255
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,700
A great movie.

256
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,020
Uh, I would recommend to anybody.

257
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,020
Really, it's just an amazing movie.

258
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:30,180
Um, somebody told me that when they, um, they saw,

259
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:34,340
saw that movie and Fight Club in the same week,

260
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:38,320
and they said, well, I felt like I'd been rebooted with a new operating system.

261
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,720
Friends, before that, we heard, uh, several cuts from the new Subgenius album,

262
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,840
A Squid for Connie.

263
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,740
And I'm holding, uh, the second copy of that self-same album.

264
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:55,660
That had, um, Phineas Narco doing all the stupid people.

265
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,580
Bit of a takeoff there.

266
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,640
Um, we had, uh,

267
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:05,640
prior to that was, uh, I call it sin there with Jimmy Swaggart,

268
00:16:05,780 --> 00:16:09,340
Reverend Jimmy Swaggart, bitching and griping and confessing.

269
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:12,340
Uh, that was by a group called Panting Antics,

270
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,260
which, uh, Bleepo Abernathy sent to me.

271
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,920
Before that, Saint Anne and Helena Handbasket doing Sister Connie.

272
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:28,120
Um, you can find them at www.mp3.com slash Saint Anne.

273
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,160
As in Saint Anne.

274
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,120
And loves you.

275
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,520
And before that, a squid space collage by Professor Chaz Smith,

276
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,880
Dances with Rockets, who couldn't be here tonight

277
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,860
because he's flying all over Mojo World on the other side of the planet.

278
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:47,400
And so it's just Princess Wiardo and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stangen here,

279
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:52,900
uh, playing music until the lone cow, Daveman, gets here.

280
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,320
And, uh, then, uh, then, uh, well, I just, we just don't know.

281
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,020
Oh, and the very first thing that we started off with was,

282
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,680
a message from space by champion Jack Codini.

283
00:17:03,840 --> 00:17:08,280
All of those sequences off of A Squid for Connie.

284
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:12,120
Um, you heard it here first on the Ips AC, my dear friends.

285
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,400
Mmm, hey there, sweet little nurse-ay.

286
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,900
Mmm, come into the strong yet capable hands of Dr. White.

287
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:23,780
Ow!

288
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,880
I'm gonna perform some delicate surgery of the heart.

289
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:29,940
So...

290
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:35,680
Come here, my child, and lay right down on my operating table, yeah.

291
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,500
Hey, I tell you, talking about medical matters, right,

292
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:41,960
you know, I went to see me old mate Fat Larry at the hospital.

293
00:17:41,960 --> 00:17:43,320
He's having his tonsils out.

294
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,980
Now, I had mine done about six months ago.

295
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,300
I remember I was having a lot of trouble,

296
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:51,080
and my very, very handsome man friend, Dr. Simon,

297
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,680
you know, he's from, uh, Leicester's a shire, right,

298
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,540
said I better let him operate.

299
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:58,960
Well, I submissively laid back while he came over me.

300
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,680
And after a few tentative probes and pokes,

301
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:03,500
he whipped out me big swollen pear

302
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,220
as soon as you could say Jack Robinson.

303
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,280
Brought me instant relief, I can tell you.

304
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,760
Although, of course, he did leave me a little raw,

305
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:12,860
and it was quite a while before I could swallow properly.

306
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:15,360
Well, anyway, I went to see Fat Lass.

307
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,120
I took him some chocolates, and for a gag,

308
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,720
I hid them under me ankle-length black fur coat

309
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,320
with the single vent at the rear.

310
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:24,980
Well, when I got there, Fat Lass looked at the bulge down below

311
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,020
and, turning me round, prized open the slit at the back

312
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,940
to get a good look at it.

313
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:29,800
A little big box.

314
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,840
Well, he greedily grabbed it

315
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:34,140
and was just about to get stuck in when I remembered,

316
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,720
Oi, lass, nil by mouth, our kid.

317
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,520
Oh, well, he was right, act off.

318
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,120
Said he was fed up not getting what he wanted.

319
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:45,020
Said that very morning, the hospital cook had presented him

320
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,680
with his lovely spotted dick,

321
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:48,660
and he hadn't been able to take that either.

322
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,540
Oh, blimey.

323
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,320
Well, I felt sorry for him,

324
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,200
but I fancied the chocolates meself.

325
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:54,480
And fair play to Larry,

326
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,400
he helped me push them all in me mouth.

327
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:57,660
And what a sight,

328
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,520
the ver-very,

329
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,600
sexy ward sister friend found when she came in,

330
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:04,640
saw Fat Lass stuffing me between the cheeks, you know.

331
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,460
Well, I left him soon after, feeling very sorry for himself.

332
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,680
But I know it won't be too long

333
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,080
before he'll be able to gobble away to his heart's content.

334
00:19:14,740 --> 00:19:16,660
But, you know, I mean, you should look after yourself,

335
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:17,220
shouldn't you?

336
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,240
Which is why me and my very, very sexy lady friend,

337
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,020
Foxy Fiona, went to a health farm just the other week.

338
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,040
Well, we got there, we got to our bedroom with our luggage.

339
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,360
I was just about to unload my big bag in the corner

340
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:34,100
when first sexy lady friend, Foxy Fiona,

341
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:36,620
asked me if I'd be, you know, rising early.

342
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:40,440
Well, when I told her I wanted to be up at six, her jaw dropped.

343
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:43,980
She said it might be a bit too hard for her, you know, getting up so early.

344
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:46,140
Still, she soon got used to it

345
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:49,880
and particularly enjoyed an early dip in the pool just before breakfast.

346
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:51,600
I'd recommend it too.

347
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:54,080
You know, a quick length first thing in the morning

348
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,820
always puts a spring in your step.

349
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,200
Well, when it came to breakfast time,

350
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,480
we were at it like rabbits, you know,

351
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,720
scoffing away at all the lettuce and carrot salad.

352
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:05,660
I also enjoyed the celery that was available.

353
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,820
But when I offered some to Foxy Fiona, she refused.

354
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:13,200
She said she didn't really fancy Goblin on a full store just then.

355
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:16,000
But if I, you know, gave it to her later in the sauna,

356
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:16,920
she might have a nibble.

357
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,020
Well, as we were on a strict vegan diet,

358
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,320
we weren't allowed to eat any dairy produce,

359
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,440
which personally I found very difficult indeed.

360
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,760
And I've got to confess,

361
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,980
I did try to smuggle some butter in.

362
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:32,440
But unfortunately, would you adamant believe it, I got caught.

363
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:35,800
I mean, I only had a small knob and was really surprised

364
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:38,120
when the elf farm manager walked into my bedroom,

365
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:41,060
grabbed hold of it and tossed it out of the window.

366
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,860
Still, apart from that, we had an enjoyable time.

367
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,220
It's anecdotal, really, but look after your health

368
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:48,760
and then you'll be in the mood for loving.

369
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,440
Mmmmm.

370
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:53,740

The Water Gator did not bother me Does your conscience bother you?

00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:30,360

414
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:55,720
The King there, the mighty, the, the King.

415
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:03,460
It's from his album Gravelands. It says here on the Gravelands CD,

416
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,940
The King's patented vocal style answers the musical question,

417
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:11,420
What would Elvis Presley be singing if he were alive today?

418
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:15,920
Gravelands is a tribute to the great deceased rockers of the past.

419
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,900
The King sinks his teeth into such classics as

420
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:19,080
Nirvana,

421
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,880

and many more.

425
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,860
Since Elvis's death in 1976,

426
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:31,000
there have been numerous sightings of him,

427
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,160
but who would have thought the King would take up the residence in the body of

428
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,820
James Brown,

429
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:41,400
a 31-year-old Belfast postman.

430
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,460
Ah, yes.

431
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,580
Oh, we have to do this.

432
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,980
We would love to see the rest of the cast in person.

433
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:06,980


434
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:06,980


435
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:06,980


436
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:06,980


437
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:06,980


438
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,440
I want you to be shy,

439
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:13,300
that youogenic to listen to,

440
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:13,980
and be very clear-headed.

441
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,400
I hope that our storm Being black,

442
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,600
That you could Seldom hear Kelly goodbye,

443
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
For you both

444
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:24,960
An older version of me

445
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,200
Is he perverted like me?

446
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:30,960
Will he go down and win a theater?

447
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,680
Does he speak eloquently?

448
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:36,020
And will you have his baby?

449
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:39,780
I'm sure you'll really make an excellent mother

450
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,080
But the love that you gave that we made

451
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,260
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open

452
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:46,660
Why?

453
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,340
No

454
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,400
And every time you speak his name

455
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,400
Does he know how you'd hold me and hold me

456
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,520
Until you die?

457
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,240
But you're still alive

458
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,600
Cause I'm here

459
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,620
To remind you

460
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:05,460
Of the mess you left

461
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:07,000
When you went away

462
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,940
It's not fair

463
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,820
To deny me

464
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,620
Of the cross I bear

465
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,340
That you gave to me

466
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,120
You

467
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,540
You oughta know

468
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:25,680
Things seem very well

469
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:29,640
You look peaceful

470
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,540
I'm not quite as well

471
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:38,040
I thought you should know

472
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,420
Did you forget about me?

473
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:43,200
Mrs. Duplicity

474
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,180
I hate to bug you in the middle of dinner

475
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,100
But I'm not quite as well as you think you are

476
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:48,100


477
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:50,340
It was a slap in the face

478
00:28:50,340 --> 00:28:52,380
How quickly I was replaced

479
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:54,580
And all your thinking of me

480
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:56,560
When he fucks you

481
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,380
But the love that you gave that we made

482
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:02,380
Wasn't able to make it enough for you to be open

483
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:02,860
Why?

484
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:04,580
No

485
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,600
And every time you speak his name

486
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,540
Does he know how you told me to hold me

487
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,720
Until you die?

488
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,440
But you're still alive

When you went away

493
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,120
It's not fair

494
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:27,880
To deny me

00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:56,800


562
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:56,800


563
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:56,800


564
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:56,800


565
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:56,800


566
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:56,800


567
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:56,800


568
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:56,800


569
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:56,800


570
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:56,800


571
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:56,800


572
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:59,080
And the joke that you made in the bed that was me

573
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:02,300
And I'm not gonna fade as soon as you close your eyes

574
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,360
Ah don't you know it

575
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:09,580
And every time I scratched my nails down someone else's back

576
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,200
I hope you'll feel it

577
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,480
Ah can you feel it?

578
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,060
Cause I'm here

579
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,100
To remind you of my love

580
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,100


581
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:22,580
Of the mess you left when you went away

582
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,560
It's not fair

583
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,400
To deny me

584
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:30,260
Of the cross I bear

585
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:32,020
That you gave to me

586
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:33,960
Cause I'm here

587
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,820
To remind you

588
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:41,200
Of the mess you left when you went away

589
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:43,140
It's not fair

590
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:46,080
To deny me

591
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,940
Of the cross I bear

592
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,680
That you gave to me

593
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:54,900
You wanna know

594
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:46,060
That I'm not mean, man.

595
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,060


596
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:46,700
You're funny, you know.

597
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,920
I can't, like, tell you stuff, man, you know.

598
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,280
Don't turn by your foot.

599
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:50,920
Pick that up right now.

600
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,600
You're not so stupid, like, you think I might be.

601
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,260
Pick that up by what you drop that thing by your foot.

602
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:56,080
What I pick up?

603
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:56,980
What I drop it?

604
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:57,620
I don't know.

605
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,620
Something you drop.

606
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,120
I don't know what I drop it.

607
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:02,900
You drop something by your foot right now.

608
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,760
No, there is nothing down there.

609
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:11,080
Radio stations of the gods, dear friends.

610
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:14,680
That's us.

611
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:15,980
Prophylactics.

612
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:16,040


613
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,020
Prophylactic users of the world unite.

614
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:21,380
You have nothing to lose but your sensibilities

615
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:27,440
and your wide-open, wide-open psychotic musings.

616
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,860
The things you hear when you can't really hear.

617
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:34,760
Yes, good luck for a long, long nap

618
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,740
because you're gonna be needed

619
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,800
the way your brains are gonna be twisted and torn

620
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,500
and shaved into sweetbreads

621
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,620
and deep-fried in a fatty vessel

622
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:46,040
and left alone for three and a half...

623
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:46,380
...and left alone for three and a half years

624
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,940
for you to cry over.

625
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,280
It's gonna happen, baby.

626
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:50,020
It's gonna happen, baby.

627
00:32:50,340 --> 00:32:51,320
It's gonna be real...

628
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:52,000
It's coming.

629
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,240
It's coming.

630
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,060
It's coming down, man.

631
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:53,380
Not pretty.

632
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:53,860
Not pretty at all.

633
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,380
No, man.

634
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:55,820
It's a bad scene.

635
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,480
Pigs are everywhere.

636
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,600
Last night the pigs were at my door.

637
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:02,540
Not, you know, no, not real pigs, man.

638
00:33:02,660 --> 00:33:03,940
They were like these real pigs

639
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:05,700
clambering all over the house

640
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,740
and banging on my door.

641
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:08,560
We've got your name.

642
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:09,520
We've got your number.

643
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:10,260
We've got your...

644
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:10,340
Oh, man.

645
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,760
We've got your blood type.

646
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,220
We've also got some of your favorite pictures

647
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,120
on the interweb.

648
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:15,900
Dave ain't here.

649
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,860
They turned...

650
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,540
They turned it...

651
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,260
Dave ain't here.

652
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,780
We're selling on Yubay.

653
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,420
We're selling some of your shavings

654
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:22,340
from your inner ear.

655
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,380
So listen softly, dear friend.

656
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,780
You're allowed to visit a place

657
00:33:27,780 --> 00:33:30,580
where very few people are allowed to go.

658
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:33,600
Make sure you're wearing sunglasses, man.

659
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:35,460
It's too loud in there.

660
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,680
Too loud, man.

661
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,080
Too loud to go in there.

662
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,200
Too loud.

663
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,760
Make sure you're turned down real smooth.

664
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,020
You know, you're wearing something

665
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:43,980
the archbishop would wear in his underwear.

666
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,880
You know, make sure you're wearing something

667
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:47,440
to be ready to scream, daddy-o,

668
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,020
because...

669
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,180
Yeah.

670
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:50,280
Yeah.

671
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,360
Yeah.

672
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:52,100
Yeah.

673
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:52,300
Yeah.

674
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,300


675
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:52,300


676
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,860
And make sure you're wearing your lockdown braces, too,

677
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:56,500
so you don't bite your tongue

678
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,140
when you go into convulsions.

679
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,080
Yeah.

680
00:33:59,340 --> 00:33:59,720
Yeah.

681
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:00,640
Yeah.

682
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,160
Yeah.

683
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:01,220
Yeah.

684
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:01,320
Yeah.

685
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,860
And make sure that all your body parts

686
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:05,120
are all really well shaved

687
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,140
and painted up real good.

688
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,560
That way they can recognize you.

689
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,120
Yeah.

690
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:08,820
Yeah.

691
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,000
Yeah.

692
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:09,040


693
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:11,560
But there's more to life

694
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:15,420
than shaved knees and body parts, my friends.

695
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:19,320
Yes, there is more to slack and to life

696
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,280
than death and anti-slack.

697
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:22,520
So much more.

698
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:23,680
There is...

699
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:24,800
So much more.

700
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:25,300
There is...

701
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:29,160
There is no divine purpose for you,

702
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:33,580
but there is a turp-a-turp-a-turp-a-dickin'-on lifestyle

703
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,760
designed especially for you

704
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:38,220
and your finuncular unicorn family.

705
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,740
Now wrapped in a crystalline silver plate,

706
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,340
I'll get someone with that,

707
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:43,440
and I'll give you a little tip.

708
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,480
Your hands will be softly welded into the background

709
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:50,300
as your brain lifts silently and softly to the other side.

710
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:52,880
Yes, friends,

711
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,320
have a frock.

712
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:57,860
Zipulops is the one true medicine.

713
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,960
The only food or drink you will ever need

714
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,220
is the sacred herb.

715
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,020
Replace it and save mankind.

716
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:03,840
Have a frock, Zipulops.

717
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,860
The one Bob grows on the droppings...

718
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:08,480
The common vegetable.

719
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,400
...and graves of dead yetis

720
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,300
and Tibetan holy men, friends.

721
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,320
The frock is the only thing

722
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,320


723
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,320


724
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,320


725
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,320


726
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:13,460
that can save mankind.

727
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:13,460


728
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:13,460


729
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:13,960
Bop-bop, bop-bop.

730
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,920
One tiny whiff, one droplet,

731
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:20,540
one tiny skin pop of the frappy.

732
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,900
One little pinch shoved up your exit wound,

733
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,140
and my friend,

734
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:29,500
you'll never, ever come down.

735
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:37,180
We've been sitting in the same room

736
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:43,540
for the last five and a half hours and nobody seems to notice the clock is picking away it's

737
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:49,960
packing clacking clacking like that old street car that your grandmother ran down back in the

738
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:57,600
days before there were real days back in the years before time disputed its first parts those were

739
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:04,760
the knights of night back in them days but the knights of knights had enemies there were those

740
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:12,100
strange cults secret societies and the stone pounders the flea bakers the stone breakers

741
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:21,320
the rose old questions the alunimators and the squags not the squags the squags first form in

742
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:28,620
the years zip in a lonely saloon in the jerusalem basement three former crusaders hatched a plan

743
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,180
the squags an elite paramilitary group of fighting monkeys

744
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:40,560
men with short haircuts and shorter tempers isn't happening mostly blue-eyed but sometimes they

745
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,060
knew more than they were supposed to

746
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:51,820
stand back from the cabinet ironman wait a minute that's the wrong device there

747
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,880
stand clear from the element cleanser

748
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,320

758
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,280
I think it's too late!

759
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:07,840
Oh no!

760
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,080
Damn, I should have never-

761
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:11,980
Oh I'm sorry I said that in front of our lord, but you should never-

762
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:14,780
I should have never left you in charge of the washing devices!

763
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:19,820
I'm so sorry! I'm so, so, so, so-

764
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,040
Has this happened to you before?

765
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,280
The child you leave to wash the washing devices is left alone.

766
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,420
Her mind is confused.

767
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:38,640
She sees trees, airplanes, frogs, apparitions, things that don't exist,

768
00:38:38,840 --> 00:38:44,500
and yet at the same time she's being controlled by an ubermind much smaller than his.

769
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:49,080
If you look crystal clear into the dark, you'll see she's coming back.

770
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:51,540
What can we do with these wayward waves?

771
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,840
Certainly we're not going to leave them to wash our washings.

772
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,280
Hey, hey.

773
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:02,400
Yeah?

774
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,400
He didn't want you to do that.

775
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:04,360
You get the wrong impression.

776
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:10,020
The film was not meant to hurt your feelings, just to illuminate you.

777
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,560
The problems we are having reconditioning the children and the furniture.

778
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:20,100
Some of them do not accept Bob as the ultimate uberman.

779
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,220
The consummate thinker, the lover, the poet, the prophet.

780
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,000
They think he was just a silly-ass businessman from Tohoku, Kansas.

781
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:31,740
Or so they said in the old days.

782
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:33,620
I see, yes, I see.

783
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:37,900
Well, what do you expect from your little trip here, underneath the sheep?

784
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:38,200
I don't know.

785
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:42,100
You know, I try not to expect too much.

786
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:44,820
So, you know, I just keep open my...

787
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,260
Yes, yes.

788
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:47,740
Do you have any specific desires?

789
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,480
You notice the desire window is opening just for you, my sweaty face.

790
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:55,220
I should not talk about my desires.

791
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:59,300
Well, now I'm afraid everyone must know.

792
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:05,600
The whole cabin clues are as now is filled with sickening children who cannot watch the washing machine.

793
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:08,120
Ah, you are...

794
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,760
Pablo, hermano, .

795
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:12,960
.

796
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:20,320
Ah, the world of the squid.

797
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:24,280
When was the last time you slept with you, a big old...

798
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,060
Something started to snow.

799
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:26,480
Squid.

800
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,840
They are so delicious.

801
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,060
.

802
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:31,240
.

803
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:31,240


804
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:31,240


805
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:31,240


806
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:31,280
.

807
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:31,340
.

808
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:31,360
.

809
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:31,380
.

810
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:33,500
.

811
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:35,060
.

812
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:35,140
.

813
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:35,160
.

814
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:35,180
.

815
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:35,180


816
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:35,300
.

817
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:35,440
.

818
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:35,440


819
00:40:35,440 --> 00:40:35,480
.

820
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:35,480


821
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:35,640
.

822
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:35,640


823
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:35,640


824
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:35,700
.

825
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:35,700


826
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:35,700


827
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:35,720
.

828
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:35,720


829
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:56,580
.

830
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,460
.

831
00:41:07,660 --> 00:41:07,960
.

832
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:07,960


833
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:07,960


834
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:07,960


835
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:07,960


836
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,060
. .

837
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:25,300
. .

838
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:25,420
. .

839
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:25,500
.

840
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:25,500


841
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:26,440
. .

842
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:26,460
. .

843
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:26,460


844
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:26,460


845
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:26,460


846
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:26,460


847
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:26,460


848
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:26,460


849
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:31,840
Reese has no idea about my guts and she obviously she was used by western forces.

850
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:37,700
Perhaps she was subjected to some type of mind control or is it deeper?

851
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,240
He deserves the 83.

852
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:45,580
So, um, it's just a lot of speculation actually.

853
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,940
Well, I would say the first thing, 83 is in a numerology.

854
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,020
The 8 and the 3 are combined to make the form of 11.

855
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:59,680
11 has the same standard as the 2 which is a symbol of unity or of things in balance.

856
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:09,260
11 is a spiritual number which many of our people have used until the time of the fourth nostril beyond the dreaming days.

857
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:14,980
Have managed to accrue such a great waste of knowledge that look here.

858
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:18,220
Now, if they do, look at some of these books. I've spit on them.

859
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:21,480
Hector, Hector, you cannot turn on the books.

860
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:22,000
Ah!

861
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,920
But look, look, these other ones are so perfectly confined.

862
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:27,780
Just bursting at the seams.

863
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,600
Like veils with the air.

864
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:31,400
Yes, much like your own apertures you are wearing.

865
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,660
I see you have met Bob.

866
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,400
Well, you know.

867
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,300
You have known Dubs.

868
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,020
Talk about it.

869
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:41,460
Yes, of course.

870
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,320
I think Dubs knows you very good.

871
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,780
Oh, yes.

872
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:51,080
I can't get myself in trouble, you know.

873
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:51,620
Well.

874
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:53,020
You can't be talking about it.

875
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:53,780
I won't say nothing.

876
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,860
I can't.

877
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:57,160
Honey is mighty, you know.

878
00:42:57,500 --> 00:42:58,840
Oh, my goodness.

879
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,740
You are serious?

880
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:00,360
Yes.

881
00:43:00,980 --> 00:43:02,200
Oh, my God.

882
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:03,700
I have no idea.

883
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:04,320
Why?

884
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,820
Is he long or short?

885
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,480
Is he like a billy goat?

886
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,480
Or is he like an old, flaccid man?

887
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,200
A mountain.

888
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,120
A mountain.

889
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,240
Like a mountain.

890
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,620
Yes, like a mountain.

891
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:15,200
Mountain on the shore.

892
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,080
I will tell all of them.

893
00:43:16,380 --> 00:43:17,520
Everyone I know.

894
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,300
I don't know that many people.

895
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:22,000
I will make sure that there are plenty of people.

896
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,000


897
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,000


898
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,000


899
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,000


900
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:22,000


901
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,200
Plenty of ears for which these two fall on, okay?

902
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:29,180
Oh, I thought you must know lots of people because you're so interesting a person.

903
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,100
You must know lots and lots and lots of people.

904
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,260
I talk a good game.

905
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:39,260
I want the affection of people and yet I am very shallow.

906
00:43:40,080 --> 00:43:41,020
I see.

907
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:45,220
I am also very confused right now because if you will notice you look on the clock and

908
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:46,600
while it's going backwards now.

909
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,120
Yeah.

910
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:49,040
And I think it is time for a little.

911
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,060
I never see something like that before.

912
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,200
A station breakage.

913
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:51,380
How you do it?

914
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:51,900
I choose.

915
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:58,880
Nostradamus forecast that Armageddon would come in the 20th century.

916
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,040
The days in which we live.

917
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:03,980
Born and hailed, you little green bastard.

918
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,920
Hey, hey look up in the sky.

919
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:07,380
So what Ozzy?

920
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,280
It's just a rainbow.

921
00:44:08,620 --> 00:44:09,620
It's a magic rainbow.

922
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:11,520
No dad, that was not an animal.

923
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:14,700
Okay, I know what it feels like when a man caresses my leg.

924
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,160
You do?

925
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,620
Whether or not I like someone doesn't depend on what kind of genitals they have.

926
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:21,360
The most interesting fact is that I am a man.

927
00:44:21,360 --> 00:44:21,360


928
00:44:21,380 --> 00:44:25,100
But not one of us, they say it's only Mr. Red electron, from the

929
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:26,140
rzebs of vacuum.

930
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:29,060
I do.

931
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:47,620
Has an aggressor because I'm soUC.

932
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:48,180
Or have

933
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:48,620
in Bible,

934
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:48,820
the

935
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,180
power of now.

936
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:50,560
This is kind of.

937
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:51,160
I said,

938
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,280
it's important.

939
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:55,260
We don't even know what they say. For all we know you could be reading Latin insults about our mothers.

940
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:02,820
Dr. Hughes called you and told you that the tumor on her neck is definitely a fetus.

941
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:07,240
Just assume for a moment, sir, that this woman is a young woman?

942
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,160
Yeah, a young woman.

943
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:13,580
Just assume that she has a problem. Now assume also this problem has to do with Indian magic.

944
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:17,300
Oh my god, son, you do have one hell of a problem.

945
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:24,380
My boss would be rich too. And you have boss too. And his boss. See that dame over there in the car?

946
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:29,200
Oh my god. They keep on breaking my heart.

947
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:38,680
If only we could get out of this wild tough stuff. If we could only burrow beneath the barbed wire.

948
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:44,960
If only these vessels could get us out of here. These tiny little boats.

949
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,280
The sponge rafts.

950
00:45:47,300 --> 00:45:54,400
Perhaps we can fashion some sort of crew device. And maybe if we flap our arms very, very hard we will go...

951
00:45:54,940 --> 00:46:00,680
I can help keep you buoyed up old Davey. You won't think.

952
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:07,640
I have some ideas. I think wild kind of craft things that we can float on.

953
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:13,180
I think I know what we can use. We'll make our own ship.

954
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,220
No, no, no, no. There's no chance.

955
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:17,280
Yeah, yeah. We'll make our own ship.

956
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:17,280


957
00:46:17,300 --> 00:46:24,920
We have some mailing tubes and old cams and marshmallow cream. It will be good. It will work.

958
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:33,640
In order to sink, you have to lose your ship, my friend.

959
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:40,040
And in order to fly, you have to lose your little poo poo head.

960
00:46:41,260 --> 00:46:46,120
Yeah, fly so far and long because you lost your little poo poo head.

961
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:51,600
They call this inappropriate laughter for those people confined in mental institutions.

962
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,640
Don't you know the walls around you have eyes and ears and nose and throat, doctors?

963
00:46:57,020 --> 00:47:04,360
You must be aware that Dr. Ben no longer exists except for in your own febrile sexual organs.

964
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,240
The what?

965
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:05,560
The contaminated.

966
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,520
The Dr. Ben's no longer exist?

967
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:09,360
You're contaminated.

968
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,920
Then what do you call this thing?

969
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:11,700
He is contaminated.

970
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,180
And no one understands his point.

971
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,240
Oh, yes, it is the most contaminated music of all.

972
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,900
Music made by doctors.

973
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,740
True, enlightened doctors.

974
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:30,640
We're going to remove your hypothalamus with sound now.

975
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:40,460
Now Dr. Philodrumon applies his saxophone to the patient's sacroiliac in this sacred act of love.

976
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:42,340
Yes, friends.

977
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:47,440
Surgery is a form of intimate love.

978
00:47:48,060 --> 00:47:54,200
And the doctors of the airwaves will do this to your very ear, mind and your ear brain.

979
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,940
Just trust the good doctor.

980
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,940
Now he's going to take out your spleen and your hava pancus.

981
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:04,580
He's going to replace the soles of those tired shoes with a brand new heart and belly button.

982
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:06,680
Just like the one you wanted to grow.

983
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,800
I was scared but it was over, doctor.

984
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:10,960
Sit down here on this barbed wire seat.

985
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:13,580
Don't worry.

986
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:17,040
Don't wink and nod about those little winkings in your eyes now.

987
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:19,180
They're just controlling your rapid eye movements.

988
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:22,860
Those doctors have powers you don't know about yet.

989
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:24,280
But you're going to find out.

990
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:28,200
Oh, you'll find out soon enough, my good fellow.

991
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,360
My good little nurse girl.

992
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:32,460
Yes, yes.

993
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,240
Come on into the operating room now.

994
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:37,160
The operating theater we call it.

995
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,700
But on these rubber gloves.

996
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:39,700
Sit down, doctor.

997
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:40,040
Come on.

998
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:40,300
Yes.

999
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:44,560
Pour this alcohol into your lap and here, drink some of this.

1000
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,180
And have some of this gas.

1001
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,820
And take this pill.

1002
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,160
And take this shot.

1003
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:50,860
And then this knife here.

1004
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:53,340
Insert this deep into your chest cavity.

1005
00:48:53,940 --> 00:48:58,440
Now take these pencils and work them gradually into your ears.

1006
00:48:58,660 --> 00:49:02,420
Now put on these headphones and give me $20.

1007
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:05,060
You notice the acrobatics we are doing now?

1008
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:06,020
Look at me.

1009
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:06,880
Look at me.

1010
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:07,920
I am a monkey man.

1011
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:09,040
Look at my strong forceps.

1012
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:10,400
Look at my chin.

1013
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,540
I bet you wish you could imitate this.

1014
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:13,880
But no.

1015
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:17,320
You need more, more, more sound cut.

1016
00:49:18,740 --> 00:49:19,300
More.

1017
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,580
There will always be a need for more.

1018
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:25,200
More slack.

1019
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:30,660
And yet more money, dear friends.

1020
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:31,960
More money.

1021
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:36,740
And how, how, you ask me, Reverend Stang.

1022
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,140
You say, how should I get this money?

1023
00:49:39,220 --> 00:49:40,660
With what you speak?

1024
00:49:40,820 --> 00:49:41,920
Because it's true.

1025
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:43,020
Oh, sure.

1026
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:48,540
Slack is what you make of your imagination, your dreams, and blah, blah, blah.

1027
00:49:48,540 --> 00:49:50,640
But let's face it, we need money.

1028
00:49:50,840 --> 00:49:55,780
We don't need a bunch of this hoo-hahs and a bunch of new age gobbledygook.

1029
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:56,620
We need money.

1030
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:59,080
We need money coming into this radio station.

1031
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:01,100
We need money coming into this church.

1032
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,220
We need money coming into this wallet.

1033
00:50:03,320 --> 00:50:05,140
The one I am sitting on with my butt.

1034
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:07,280
Now I want you to get off of the button, my friends.

1035
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,200
And get on down there to the left.

1036
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:09,200


1037
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:11,100
that sub.com thing

1038
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,720
and check out that because

1039
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,260
this is a prosperity ministry.

1040
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,320
We are not going to sit here

1041
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:19,080
and just hope that some

1042
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,940
magical monkey's going to start

1043
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:23,280
crapping money out of its butt.

1044
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:27,040
We want you to

1045
00:50:27,040 --> 00:50:29,300
start crapping that money out of

1046
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,260
your butt. So get with

1047
00:50:31,260 --> 00:50:31,720
it, baby.

1048
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,020
Oh, Ellie, you understood.

1049
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:37,380
If you were one of the

1050
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:39,060
brilliant shining lights of

1051
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,040
humanity, you would know that

1052
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,260
you can crap that money out

1053
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,980
of your butt as easily

1054
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,880
as flying saucers make

1055
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,900
planets. You

1056
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,180
know that you can create a better

1057
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:52,800
world for you and your

1058
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,200
mutant clones by simply

1059
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,140
following

1060
00:50:56,140 --> 00:50:56,880
the

1061
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:00,440
Ruga!

1062
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:00,500


1063
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:04,620
Ruga!

1064
00:51:07,380 --> 00:51:09,020
It was moving very close

1065
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,860
to some place.

1066
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:11,840
I didn't want to go.

1067
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:13,960
My head was

1068
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:14,700
throbbing, sure.

1069
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,180
I had been knocked down ahead

1070
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:17,220
three times by a bowling

1071
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:17,560
ball.

1072
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:20,040
Of course, that dang was no

1073
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:20,620
helpまだ.

1074
00:51:20,900 --> 00:51:22,640
I was sticking that strange

1075
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,400
substance down my pants and

1076
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,080
was also trying to click my

1077
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:27,700
donuts together with a safety

1078
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:28,020
bun.

1079
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,720
I understand it was to

1080
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,160

00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,180
Are you a victim?

1110
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:32,980
Are you a user of the demon sperm?

1111
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,520
Are you addicted, my friend?

1112
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:38,800
Are you lost in bondage to the demon sperm?

1113
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:40,420
I saw them down by the riverfront.

1114
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,200
Come on, now, you can tell an old preacher.

1115
00:53:43,540 --> 00:53:46,040
They can't, and they can't do it, and they can't move their limbs anymore.

1116
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,240
What about this demon?

1117
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:48,160
They feed around disease.

1118
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,580
Demon disease?

1119
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,960
Most of them have eye problems.

1120
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,740
Eye, eye, eye, eye, eye, this.

1121
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,700
You know, they're egocentric.

1122
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,320
Of course, they're the old wino bums.

1123
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,780
Aye, aye, sir.

1124
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:59,060
We make good use of them.

1125
00:54:00,260 --> 00:54:04,140
So Shanghai Willie, I mean, Shanghai Nelly.

1126
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:10,060
Could you come and help me put some of this cottage cheese here on my pantyhose, child?

1127
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,500
I'm going to touch nothing around there.

1128
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:16,580
You know, great, great uncle grandma woman thing here needs help putting...

1129
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:18,260
Hepace.

1130
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:19,400
Hepace.

1131
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:20,100
Help is here now.

1132
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:23,060
Help is on its way.

1133
00:54:24,020 --> 00:54:26,980
Help is here and on its way.

1134
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:30,320
Help is coming, friends.

1135
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:40,700
In the form of a well-dressed businessman carrying a briefcase, smoking pipe, and wearing a great big grin on his face.

1136
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:43,940
He's got something for you in that briefcase, my friend.

1137
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:46,740
It's a little minister's card.

1138
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:50,940
You never thought of yourself as minister, preacher, any kind of religious person.

1139
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,460
Did you?

1140
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:59,680
In fact, the last thing you ever saw yourself as was some kind of a holy man or holy babe.

1141
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,960
I'll tell you what.

1142
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,900
Maybe this is a different kind of holy man.

1143
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,660
A hole in the head that we're talking about, friends.

1144
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,580
They don't call it the church of the subgenius for nothing.

1145
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:16,740
We're not picky.

1146
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,540
It's not hard to qualify.

1147
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:20,820
It's not hard to qualify.

1148
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,400
All you got to do is praise Bob.

1149
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:26,300
Love Bob with all your heart, mind, soul.

1150
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,560
Do whatever he says.

1151
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,300
Chances are he's probably not even going to notice you there.

1152
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:36,080
You'll just glean that luck power off.

1153
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,000
You'll just be sapping some slack off Bob, won't you?

1154
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:39,480
Yeah, sure.

1155
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:39,940
It's easy.

1156
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:40,640
Easy.

1157
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:41,580
Easy.

1158
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,000
That's why everybody's doing it.

1159
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,320
Everybody's doing it right now.

1160
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:49,880
Everybody is doing it.

1161
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:50,940
Everybody is doing it.

1162
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:50,940


1163
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:50,940


1164
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:50,940


1165
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,380
Everybody is doing it.

1166
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:51,380


1167
00:55:51,380 --> 00:55:51,740
Right, buddy?

1168
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:52,600
Right, pal?

1169
00:55:52,940 --> 00:55:53,560
That's right.

1170
00:55:53,800 --> 00:55:58,240
You're the only buddy pal right there not doing it yet.

1171
00:55:58,280 --> 00:55:59,200
You can't make it.

1172
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:00,280
You can't make it real.

1173
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,980
You can build your own ship.

1174
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:04,000
You can build your own ship.

1175
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:05,560
You can make this right.

1176
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:07,200
You can do it, man.

1177
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:07,580
You can do it.

1178
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,100
If you don't rock the band, you're in baby's mood.

1179
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:12,300
A magic moment of resolution.

1180
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:14,420
A grand relation, for sure.

1181
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:15,980
A great...

1182
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:17,460
A great...

1183
00:56:17,460 --> 00:56:19,760
A great...

1184
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,560
You are waiting a moment of innocence.

1185
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,140
I'm not doing it.

1186
00:56:24,140 --> 00:56:25,000
I'm not doing it.

1187
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:25,840
I'm not doing it.

1188
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,920
Everybody's doing it.

1189
00:56:26,920 --> 00:56:27,860
Doing it.

1190
00:56:27,860 --> 00:56:28,780
Doing it.

1191
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,340
Doing it.

1192
00:56:29,340 --> 00:56:30,180
We have to go now.

1193
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:35,120
Could you please, uh, could you please put your hand just a little bit further to the left?

1194
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:38,120
Oh, I can't.

1195
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:40,460
I'm using a spirit hand again.

1196
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:41,080
Not a line.

1197
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,640
Could you use a real, real electric hand?

1198
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:45,480
It tastes like chicken.

1199
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:46,240
Ah.

1200
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:46,600
Oh.

1201
00:56:47,140 --> 00:56:49,260
It tastes...

1202
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:50,840
It tastes like rattlesnake.

1203
00:56:50,840 --> 00:56:50,940
It tastes like rattlesnake.

1204
00:56:50,960 --> 00:56:51,640
It tastes like...

1205
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:51,640


1206
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:51,980
I love you.

1207
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:52,200
I love you, Mike.

1208
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:52,200


1209
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:52,200


1210
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:52,200


1211
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:52,680
Smell the sausage.

1212
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,200
Yes, baby.

1213
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:57,560
We're going back in time.

1214
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:03,440
In fact, we're going back in time to when this show ends, and another show begins.

1215
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:04,900
This is ten years after.

1216
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,300
It's lot of fill more east in the background, friend.

1217
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,380
And we're gonna slowly groove on outta here.

1218
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,260
But Chaz will be back next Chaz week.

1219
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,300
Chaz time and Chaz channel.

1220
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,140
And Dave is still here.

1221
00:57:18,220 --> 00:57:18,580
So Scott-

1222
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:18,920
Wait.

1223
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:18,980


1224
00:57:18,980 --> 00:57:20,540
You will be backstage next week?

1225
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:20,940
Oh my God.

1226
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:20,940


1227
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:20,940


1228
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:20,940


1229
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:20,940


1230
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:20,940


1231
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:25,460
We'll be back in a lot better physical condition than we were this week.

1232
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,300
We're going to come back from the therapist.

1233
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:30,800
We're going to have to really solve some problems,

1234
00:57:30,900 --> 00:57:35,280
not just diddling our times away eating those weird cinnamon bites you're hanging.

1235
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:39,620
But that said, we're going to really find out what's making it tick.

1236
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:44,120
And then once we pronounce ourselves deaf,

1237
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,740
we'll be ready to solve all the problems it's created for me.

1238
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:51,020
Oh, the son of a bitch.

1239
00:57:51,020 --> 00:57:55,180
I wish I knew who my mind controller was.

1240
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:59,340
I wish I knew who was pushing my click on the off and clicking off button.

1241
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:03,760
I wish I could get out of this terrible suitcase.

1242
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:07,360
Bob Dogs, indeed.

1243
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:12,340
I don't know how much longer I can take in Bob's suitcase.

1244
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:16,300
I don't know.

1245
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:21,960
With marijuana in your brain.

1246
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:29,540
Oh, you smoke a dog.

1247
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:37,800
Hear me knocking upon your door.

1248
00:58:38,660 --> 00:58:41,000
But you can't move no more.

1249
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:43,120
You're stoned.

1250
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:44,660
You're stoned.

1251
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:47,120
Yo, yeah.

1252
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,420
Y'all know what time it is.

1253
00:58:48,460 --> 00:58:48,720
It's a good time.

1254
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:48,720


1255
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:48,720


1256
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:48,720


1257
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:52,520
If you need more information about the Church of the Subgenius,

1258
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:56,480
please write to this address I'm about to give.

1259
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:08,500
That's Bob at Post Office Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.

1260
00:59:08,580 --> 00:59:15,820
Once again, that's Box 140306 Dallas, Texas 75214.
