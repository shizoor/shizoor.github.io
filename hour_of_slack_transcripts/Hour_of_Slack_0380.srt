1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,960
For the next hour, sit quietly and we will control all that you see and hear.

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,820
Turn on the machine.

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,580
This is Radio Yerevan.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:13,240
Wake up, puppet boy!

5
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:27,220
We are conscious of our responsibility and obligation to provide programs

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:31,320
which will be enjoyable, entertaining, and tasteful.

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,780
There is absolutely no other possibility.

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:47,720
We subjected it to careful editing to eliminate elements which we might consider in questionable taste for late-night viewing.

9
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:53,520
As it will be shown, it is well within the restrictions of the television code,

10
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,700
which is even more restrictive and stringent.

11
00:00:56,700 --> 00:00:57,200
In many cases, it is not.

12
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:04,680
We are sensitive to the concerns which prompted your letter

13
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:13,760
and assure you that this network will continue to adhere to the high standards we have maintained throughout the years.

14
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:15,240
Thank you.

15
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:22,780
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

16
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,040
You are about to experience the awe and mystery

17
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,900
which reaches from the inner mind to...

18
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,080
The Self-Genius Hour of Swag.

19
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:34,640
What?

20
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,140
You can relax and enjoy this quality product,

21
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,360
secure in the knowledge that it has been specially created for the lover of fine things and the man of good taste.

22
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:51,000
Oh, sorry. You can edit that out, can't you?

23
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,600
I can't.

24
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,240
I can't.

25
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,580
I can't.

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:53,980
I can't.

27
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,600
I can't.

28
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:55,400
I can't.

29
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:55,640
I can't.

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:55,760
I can't.

31
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:57,020
I can't.

32
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,920
I can't.

33
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:57,920


34
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:57,920


35
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:57,920


36
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,160
Just simply.

37
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,800
I can't.

38
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,440
othes

39
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:15,900
Over all, we want you to be satisfied with the queen,

40
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,440
the cierto esperar sacrificio

41
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,220
is as difficult and as complex as anything...

42
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,500
If you need anything,

43
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,420
you are wrong.

44
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,960
Are you?

45
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,700
I'm not talking to you.

46
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,560
on a friendly basis.

47
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:50,640
Now we're heading into the sexual or gonadial area of the Doug Smith brain.

48
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:58,580
As you can see it has some similarity to the previous portions of the brain and the typewriter area.

49
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,600
But the enormous stamina of this human.

50
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:10,280
Saying hey, hey.

51
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:17,980
Yes, that's all the trigger the Smith brain needs to get an enormous rise.

52
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,900
I say something.

53
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:25,240
Can I say something?

54
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,840
This show is our only method of communicating with you earth people.

55
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,920
In hopes that in the storm of Babel you will understand the basic reality of our planet.

56
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:41,440
And apprehend that we are not simply a comedy group or a humorous exercise.

57
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:48,280
But actually the emissaries of a distant civilization which only wishes to confer its own understanding.

58
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,620
Upon the citizens of your rather distant planet.

59
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,660
We thank you for listening.

60
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,120
How do they do it?

61
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,620
Well, like this.

62
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,460
Put that on like this.

63
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,220
Oh no, not like that.

64
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,780
And like this.

65
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,380
Ouch, that hurts. No, cut it out.

66
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,040
And like this.

67
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,080
Oh, hey, hey.

68
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,420
Yes, you'll see us.

69
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,420
Enthroned in glory.

70
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,980
Trailing clouds of glory.

71
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,640
Emitting the sacrosanct.

72
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:13,400
The call of heavenly flame.

73
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,120
Like the gods we are.

74
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,520
Yes, that's our aura.

75
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,560
What, radio?

76
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:20,620
What?

77
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,020
Radio gods.

78
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,460
Yes, I think so.

79
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:23,620
Radio gods.

80
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,720
You can watch it.

81
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,780
See the lightning.

82
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,100
Do you wanna party?

83
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,500
Yes, dear friends.

84
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,700
Hell yes, friends.

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,100
We're back.

86
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,820
We're back.

87
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,800
That wonderful hour.

88
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:41,080
Friends, that bad hour.

89
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,340
That one time hour, friends.

90
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,980
That mysterious hour.

91
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,900
That poltergeist infested hour, yes.

92
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,920
Friends, the poltergeist is working tonight.

93
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,780
Yes, he's working double time.

94
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,820
Because one of these day decks won't turn off.

95
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:55,160
Get your finger out of the hole there, Dr. Stang.

96
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,480
You're liable to hurt your...

97
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,380
There you go.

98
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,140
There we go.

99
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:03,480
Well, let's turn on the dampers and see if we can get the nuclear power plant started

100
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,220
here, doctor.

101
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,120
I'm anxious to take off.

102
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:07,800
Take off.

103
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:08,220
Hold on.

104
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:08,960
Hold on, personnel.

105
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,960
Clear most area at this time.

106
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,320
Will you get all those guys out of the other side there, please?

107
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,660
What'd you do, doctor?

108
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,000
Central control processing on.

109
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,840
Their central control is on.

110
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:19,900


111
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:19,900


112
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:19,900


113
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:19,900


114
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:19,900


115
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:19,900


116
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:19,900


117
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:19,900


118
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:19,900


119
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,340
Dr. Stang, you're on, doctor.

120
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,420
Good, good.

121
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:23,600
Okay, you want to close the watertight doors here?

122
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,480
Yeah.

123
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,320
Oh, watch out for that squid, man.

124
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,940
There's a prairie squid right by the door.

125
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,840
Speaking of which...

126
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,580
And inject some of those caller souls, would you, into the retribution chamber?

127
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,740
Primary and secondary circuit tests commencing now.

128
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,120
Well, we really...

129
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,360
Yes, line two has a prayer request.

130
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,580
Is that so, friends?

131
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,600
Well, tell them to pray.

132
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:47,500
I have to run away from anything because I don't believe in anything.

133
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:50,480
What direction is the zoo in?

134
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,320
Back the other way.

135
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,940
That where you escaped from.

136
00:05:55,160 --> 00:06:01,020
I'm not going to go into that because this is a continuation of last week's show about

137
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:07,840
censorship, both of the subgenius church and also by us.

138
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:13,080
The First Amendment gives you the right to choose what you hear, what you say, and what

139
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:13,580
you think.

140
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:15,280
We've got to get out of here.

141
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,020
We've got to get out of here.

142
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,480
We've got to get out of here.

143
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:17,480


144
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,260
We've got to get out of here.

145
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,380
Chris Cole, hang on.

146
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:21,380


147
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:22,320
If you're going to shut all up, do

148
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,360
it right.

149
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,180
No shall we ride five o'clock?

150
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,200
Get out of here?

151
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:29,420
Done.

152
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:29,780
We're ready...

153
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,140
Go oppress or risk.

154
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:47,480
. . Zhi.

155
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,380
So what?

156
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,860
Why shouldn't they be offended?

157
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,960
What have they done that they shouldn't be offended?

158
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,000
What was that?

159
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:03,360
Shh.

160
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:05,640
Who gives a...

161
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,760
Who gives a...

162
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:10,240
Who gives a...

163
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:29,780
Who gives a...

164
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,900
Could you state that as a question, please?

165
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:43,660
Where are you?

166
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:44,560
Who gives a...

167
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,660
Who gives a...

168
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:50,300
Who gives a...

169
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,400
Who gives a...

170
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:56,000
Who gives a...

171
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:04,000
Money, talk, and book...

172
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,620
Walk.

173
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,660
How do you feel about that?

174
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,480
I don't give a...

175
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:10,140
I don't give a...

176
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,880
I don't give a...

177
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,860
I don't give a...

178
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,060
I don't give a...

179
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:17,060


180
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,180
I don't give a...

181
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,120
I don't give a...

182
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,320
I don't give a...

183
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,100
I don't give a...

184
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:28,220
Censorship is never going to accomplish anything.

185
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,360
As long as there are a few formatted words in the album,

186
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,600
it will always sell an extra million copies.

187
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,140
We want people to make up their own...

188
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,240


189
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,240


190
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,240


191
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:40,240


192
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:49,940
The First Amendment gives you the right to choose what you hear, what you say, and what you think.

193
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,680
The money, talk, and book...

194
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:57,440
...they offended me by trying to offend themselves.

195
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:57,940
School.

196
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,060
I don't give a...

197
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,960
I don't give a what?

198
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:10,220
O-B-E from their nickname,

199
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:16,380
album doing I Don't Give a Bleep. They're kings of feedback series. And you can reach

200
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:23,260
out. These are available as LPs and EPs and tapes and everything else. You can call Out

201
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:34,120
Band Experience, Reverend Bill Miller at area code 617-LICK-OBE. That's right. Lick-OBE.

202
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:47,000
617-LICK-OBE. Or write them at post office box 221. That's 221 Boston, Massachusetts.

203
00:09:49,140 --> 00:10:00,760
02123. What an easy address. Box 221 at 02123 there for kings of feedback. But speaking of

204
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:04,100
censorship, the other kind of censorship.

205
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:14,160
The kind that's not excusable. The Nickelodeon TV network offers a pretty insidious yet kind

206
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:20,580
of beautifully ironic and telling example. Last night we were settling down to watch

207
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:27,540
our favorite show, Ren and Stimpy, and Nickelodeon showed the powdered toast man episode of Ren

208
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:34,060
and Stimpy, but it was censored. In the original broadcast of it, this was a rerun.

209
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:39,940
The powdered toast man becomes president of the United States and when the oval office

210
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:47,120
gets a little chilly, he burns the bill of rights in the fireplace. And as we understand

211
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,820
it, after they showed that the first time, Nickelodeon got three, count them, three letters

212
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:59,820
from patriots, patriots complaining that it was bad, bad to show the bill of rights being

213
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,620
burned by a cartoon character.

214
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:10,820
So, Nickelodeon censored it. Which is typical of these would-be patriots who are so very

215
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:18,440
attached to the symbols like the bill of rights or the flag, they'll kill to protect the symbol,

216
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:24,800
but they'll also kill to prevent the practice of what those symbols stand for. They like

217
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,360
the name of the bill of rights, but their mind can't quite make the connection between

218
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,900
the name and what it actually means, what it stands for. And in fact, they hate and

219
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:43,980
fear, dear friends, what it actually means. And it's these corporate chicken gut soup

220
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:51,580
boys that are so quick to kowtow to three kook letters, it makes me sick.

221
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,120
Make up scarcity, defy reward.

222
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:05,380
And I'm seen as it relates to community standards.

223
00:12:14,540 --> 00:12:16,600
Community standards.

224
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,100
We don't all agree.

225
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,780
We're losing our minds.

226
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,720
Virtual reality.

227
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,060
Community standards.

228
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,420
Oh, hypocrisy.

229
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,020
Community standards.

230
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,340
Insanity.

231
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:57,380
This is art.

232
00:12:58,020 --> 00:12:59,420
CIT.

233
00:12:59,440 --> 00:12:59,960
CIT.

234
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,040
CIT.

235
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:03,440


236
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,760
This is art.

237
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,100
Obscenity.

238
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,600
This is art.

239
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,040
Obscenity.

240
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,040


241
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:12,220
This is art.

242
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,000
If you did it.

243
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:13,980
Obscenity.

244
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,220
Because we want you to be just like us.

245
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,340
Normal.

246
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,340
My lyrics were put on trial.

247
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,260
Rob.

248
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,720
As in Robert.

249
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:30,340
Rob.

250
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,340


251
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,340


252
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,340


253
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,340


254
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,340


255
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,340


256
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,340


257
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,340


258
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,340


259
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,340


260
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,340


261
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,340


262
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:30,340


263
00:13:30,340 --> 00:13:40,240
Well Bob, what makes you think you and your artistic whore community stand in the same community?

264
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,220
Normal art for normal people?

265
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,600
A closed mind is your destiny.

266
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,900
We know there's no reason to live if you have your mind closed.

267
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,960
You must open up to all things that come before you.

268
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,700
Open your mind.

269
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,700
This is art.

270
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,060
This is not a fantasy.

271
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,460
This is the reality of life.

272
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:03,740
There are people who don't live like you.

273
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,540
There are people who are not like you.

274
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,940
There are people who don't want to be you.

275
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,860
He said come over here and stand in.

276
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,540
Now this is not FCC approved.

277
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,380
This is not for your children.

278
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:25,260
This is not for your mother.

279
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:29,040
Everybody stand up.

280
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,980
People should make up their own minds.

281
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:35,620
FCC approved.

282
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:38,100
Art.

283
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,040
Obscenity.

284
00:14:42,980 --> 00:14:43,860
Reality.

285
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,920
I don't care.

286
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,100
I...

287
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:53,820
I don't listen.

288
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,200
I don't buy it.

289
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,320
We live in precisely a quindi'

290
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,940
Art.

291
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,700
I'm over the edge.

292
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:14,720
Where are you?

293
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,940
れた

294
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,780
That was Community Standards by Kings of Feedback.

295
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:27,960
Also known as Out-of-Band Experience.

296
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,860
Coming up, 10 Inches of Slack.

297
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,620
This is an album by, well, not by the Subgenius Foundation,

298
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:37,720
but it's got a lot of subgeniuses on it.

299
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,000
It certainly has material that relates to this mighty church.

300
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:50,980
This particular cut done by Skull and Bones called Who Killed Africa?

301
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,740
It's there ready to be hatched.

302
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,060
It's in 1969.

303
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:58,820
Okay.

304
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,100
After the AIDS virus was appropriated for, as we see in Hospital 1509,

305
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:06,880
when they got their $10 to $25 million for this.

306
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,520
In 1969.

307
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,300
Okay.

308
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,620
They took the virus after having completed it in the laboratory,

309
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:15,420
infecting the smallpox vaccine.

310
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:22,720
100 million Africans were injected or infected from at least 1976 until 1979.

311
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,080
Wait, wait, wait.

312
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,720
You're saying from 1976 to 1979?

313
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:32,740
From 1979, 100 million Africans were infected with or given a smallpox vaccination

314
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,340
that was deliberately infected with the HIV virus?

315
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:40,760
According to the London Times, May 11th of 1987.

316
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:45,480
We're just talking about the AIDS conspiracy.

317
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,380
We're trying to get rid of Black.

318
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,960
We're trying to get rid of Gator.

319
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,180
If somebody was playing with this virus in a laboratory and it got loose, I don't know.

320
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,460
It's a conspiracy.

321
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,900
We're looking at some of the literature that Dr. Strecker points out

322
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,640
is that we'll never be able to do anything with it.

323
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:04,400
I mean, we're trying to get rid of Blacks.

324
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,540
We're trying to get rid of Gays.

325
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,480
We're trying to get rid of Gays of 200.

326
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:08,120
Who else are we trying to get rid of?

327
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:13,080
Okay.

328
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:13,860
Very legal.

329
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:21,300
It seems as though the credibility of the experts involving who's responsible for AIDS

330
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,740
is still in question.

331
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,900
But the masses of people are doing research

332
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,820
and living and searching as we are.

333
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,560
And then we come and, as Dr. Silverman said,

334
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:37,740
they found places in 1955 and 1968 that predates the information that the masses of people seem to come up with.

335
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,380
But we just don't believe that that's really legitimate.

336
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:50,020
It has been really terrifying for these administrations.

337
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,820
This is not softball games they play.

338
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,660
And when the director of CDC sits up here,

339
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,260
he's got a shotgun sitting next to him.

340
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:08,180
Especially in the early years, this was extremely repressive government.

341
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,320
Don't kid yourself on this.

342
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:12,500
I mean, I've worked for lots of governments around the world.

343
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:16,240
This one was some of the most repressive I've ever been involved in,

344
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,220
in what we as scientists could say to the public.

345
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,880
I was writing memos that we were caught between a rock and a hard place.

346
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,560
It was a huge epidemic.

347
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,480
And no resources.

348
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,740
And the secretary of HHS was saying,

349
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,920
I've just checked with all the public health service folks,

350
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,660
and everything that needs to be done is being done.

351
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:37,380
That was a direct lie to the American public.

352
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:38,480
And then, and then,

353
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,600
the folks at CDC are caught in the middle of that when you ask,

354
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,320
what is the truth?

355
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:52,800
Probably the silliest debate that's gone on with AIDS is this abstinence condom issue.

356
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:56,280
It has been absolutely crazy.

357
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,860
Because the truth,

358
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:04,100
and when the director of CDC sits up here,

359
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:08,340
he's got a shotgun sitting next to him.

360
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,340
And it's only behind the scenes as the truth comes out.

361
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:21,040
That's not good for the American public when you've got such an epidemic like this.

362
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,860
What it provokes is an,

363
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,700
I want to throw every gay person in jail.

364
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,360
There is a problem with homophobia in this country,

365
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:38,800
as we've been told by the AIDS community for years and years and years.

366
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:39,720
There is a problem.

367
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,640
There's a problem with racism in this country.

368
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,980
And one of the things that we find, unfortunately, still,

369
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:48,100
as we take materials out into the country,

370
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,040
and we do test these throughout the country,

371
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,600
that these unfortunate, uh,

372
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,000
aspects of our human societies do bubble up.

373
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,880
Tell me about it, pal.

374
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,900
That was, uh, from the EP,

375
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,260
vinyl EP called 10 Inches of Slack,

376
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:12,320
a cut called Who Killed Africa by Skull and Bones,

377
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:17,760
which I believe is actually the same as Reverend Richard Longenecker of Shout Out,

378
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,420
who produced that EP.

379
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,440
The EP also has songs by three other bands,

380
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:26,920
including that old piece by D.K. Jones,

381
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,760
Huge Voodoo and Me,

382
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,940
well, not an old piece,

383
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:33,220
Jim Bob Joyce Speaks,

384
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,460
the one that, uh,

385
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,400
well, you've heard it.

386
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,760
You can write us, friends,

387
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:39,700
for free information.

388
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:45,400
That album will be available from the Subgenius Foundation in Dallas, Texas.

389
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:52,100
And, uh, you can write us for free information on just about anything involving the church.

390
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,100
Give us up, genius.

391
00:20:53,320 --> 00:21:00,940
Just write to Bob at Post Office Box 140306,

392
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:04,820
Dallas, Texas 75214.

393
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,060
We will be giving that number again before the end of the broadcast.

394
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,320
Ah, yes, dear friends.

395
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:20,760
The devil owes you money, friend.

396
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:22,080
But Bob, you're the best.

397
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,800
Bob Dobbs is the bank where you can cash it in.

398
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:27,380
We gotta burn out the banks of the devil!

399
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,620
We gotta root him out!

400
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,860
Burn out the hate!

401
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,160
Burn out the radiation!

402
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,640
Burn out the fire!

403
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,480
Standin' around actin' like you got wires of blood and anybody else,

404
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:40,020
but you ain't, cause I'm the one that has it, not you, me.

405
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,080
What are you talkin' about?

406
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,560
About I know things I ain't never learned.

407
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,040
How I can see signs.

408
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,060
It's somethin' that just happens,

409
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,940
and I got to do some things sometimes.

410
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,340
I got to do some things sometimes I don't even wanna do.

411
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:58,380
And sometimes inside me I can feel it.

412
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:01,220
I can feel it pullin' and tuggin' at me and pushin',

413
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,320
and I can feel my blood beatin',

414
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,020
and I got to do this thing right now.

415
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,980
It's wires of blood.

416
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,580
Ain't everybody has it.

417
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:11,840
See, it's a gift.

418
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:15,300
It's a gift, like a gift for the prophets.

419
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:16,940
Now, I ain't sayin' I'm a prophet.

420
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,740
No, it ain't like that, but it's like that.

421
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,840
You're crazy, boy.

422
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,280
You get away from me and you stay away.

423
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,660
I'm goin' where I'm goin'.

424
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:29,060
I got a woman. I got a woman, see?

425
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,600
And that's where I'm goin', to visit her.

426
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,200
He thinks if he keeps on insulting you that you'll go away.

427
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:35,280
Whoa.

428
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:37,060
Whoa.

429
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:39,940
Scary and neat.

430
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,320
Oh, we wish. They wish.

431
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:44,740
More cars going in and out of little car doors.

432
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,540
We can do those clicks, too.

433
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,940
Oh, there he is.

434
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,820
Fire! Fire! Fire!

435
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,440
Fire! Get the car doors, okay?

436
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,580
Okay, good. We've cut rid of them. They're dead.

437
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,580
For once.

438
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,080
And we can continue with...

439
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:01,160
Ah, yes, your subgenius...

440
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,860
Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

441
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,460
Uh...

442
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:11,040
Back, back on the airwaves again.

443
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:14,380
To exploit women and men.

444
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,840
Because, you know, Bob Dobbs can free you from the petty constraints

445
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,580
of so-called

446
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:21,700
civilization.

447
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:24,740
He'll show you how to beat the system

448
00:23:24,740 --> 00:23:25,800
without effort.

449
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:28,280
Because ever since the very

450
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,840
first day of Bob's life,

451
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:32,620
from his very conception,

452
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,320
which we call the day of the Burst Trojan,

453
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:39,660
the church has strived to negate,

454
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,980
to negate the smarmy, mealy-mouthed,

455
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,340
coke-bottle-up-the-butt puritanism

456
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,120
that has helped make human beings

457
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,560
the violent, vengeful, uptight killer apes.

458
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,720
And of course, they are today.

459
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:59,380
Well, we aren't trying to make a big deal

460
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,420
out of unrestrained sexual, mental, and spiritual freedom.

461
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:07,560
It's Thame that have gone out of their way

462
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:10,060
to twist natural impulses

463
00:24:10,060 --> 00:24:11,700
into narrowly defined

464
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,760
Dobbs disapproved artificial behavior patterns.

465
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:18,200
We're not trying to pry open your skull

466
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,280
to eat your brain

467
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:20,600
like those other religions.

468
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:24,440
We just want to air your brain out.

469
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,280
We know that if you'll just let your skull breathe,

470
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:31,120
it will inhale the truth

471
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,060
of what Bob is saying.

472
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,320
And we aren't trying to envelop the globe

473
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,660
with the church because we want to.

474
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,800
It's because we have to.

475
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,100
Because it's fated.

476
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:46,360
The church must sweep over America

477
00:24:46,360 --> 00:24:48,960
or time itself will stop.

478
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,420
There are many ends of the world preached by many religions,

479
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:55,040
but none of them are as permanent as that.

480
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,300
Bob has a better end of the world in mind.

481
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,380
For us.

482
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,780
We like to call it the practical joke

483
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:07,020
that we don't stick around for.

484
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:11,600
Of course, the normals think this is all just a funny, funny joke.

485
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,820
And you can indeed look at it that way.

486
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:16,380
Bob is the stand-up comic.

487
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,340
Earth is the straight man.

488
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:22,200
And the end of all normal human reality

489
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,680
is the punchline.

490
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,360
Can you turn up the bass a little bit?

491
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:29,140
Can you turn up the bass a little bit?

492
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,140
Turn up the bass, mate.

493
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:33,680
Pass that bowl of frop over here, man.

494
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,400
Can you turn up that bass?

495
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:38,660
Get that frop out of that place, kid.

496
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:41,660
Give it up for that bowl of frop, man.

497
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,620
Frop man!

498
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,180
More feedback.

499
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:45,920
I am the frop man.

500
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:47,500
Google, Google.

501
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:47,980
Google, Google.

502
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,820
Oh, Mitch.

503
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,480
More pills, Bob.

504
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,340
We've got fucking, fucking, fucking...

505
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:00,500
We're gonna...

506
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:01,780
We're gonna...

507
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:06,220
This is the most illegal, most illegal thing you'll ever make.

508
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,240
Ain't you gonna eat us, too?

509
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,880
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna eat you, man.

510
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,700
You've never seen this.

511
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:11,800
This is illegal.

512
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,040
You're gonna get a bucket of pills.

513
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,920
Doctors are Bob.

514
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,180
He's gonna save us home,

515
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,840
pills are the best,

516
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:17,640
and we'll leave a 35 state spot.

517
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:20,100
These wonderful, wonderful doctors are all bucking the pills.

518
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,140
You won't believe.

519
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:26,080
Ask your waitress for a codeine injection after the show.

520
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,020
Bucking the pills.

521
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,160
Not responsible for loss of brain cells, loss of psychic abilities,

522
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:38,080
astral projections, other psychic phenomena, ESP, dream phenomena,

523
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:43,560
loss of limbs, self-mutilation, suicide, all these things.

524
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,660
Rolling.

525
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:44,800
Rolling.

526
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,320
Type is rolling.

527
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:56,980
Beyond our earthly veil of illusion are vast, bodiless powers,

528
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:01,900
great intentions of dark and light,

529
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,560
locked in a constant, aeon-spanning struggle.

530
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,360
And we are their weapons against one another

531
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,440
in the coming apocalyptic storms of the near future.

532
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:20,320
It's no cosmic coincidence that the Earth and its solar system

533
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,860
just happen to be lined up in their present configuration

534
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,640
at this particular intergalactic crossroads

535
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,140
and that it just happens to be now.

536
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:35,460
No, these events were all set in place one day 80 million years ago

537
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,740
in fabled Mutantis.

538
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:43,080
It was decreed then by the yetis of old

539
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,640
that on Jupiter...

540
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,440
July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.,

541
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:52,000
their true descendants, the chosen ones,

542
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:56,220
the high unpredictables of the subgenius church

543
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,700
under the last bob,

544
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:02,360
would be rewarded in that great rupture.

545
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:07,140
X-Day, when the men from Planet X will come

546
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:11,840
and we faithful shall be lifted up in power and glory

547
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:13,900
to the escaped vessels.

548
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,540
Oh.

549
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,660
Of the sex goddesses.

550
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:19,660
Fleeing while enjoying on TV

551
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,820
the cataclysms on Earth

552
00:28:21,820 --> 00:28:27,760
while being transfigured into over-men and uber-women.

553
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:31,860
Superior mutants who will lead a new race,

554
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,140
the master race because it comes in all colors,

555
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,480
to the promised land of Dimension X,

556
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,700
the pleasure dimension of eternal slack

557
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,640
and cytor-spanning.

558
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,000
And the best part about it,

559
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,000


560
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,000


561
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,000


562
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,000


563
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:45,000


564
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,940
We have to get rid of the phantasmagous squirt.

565
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,480
Sounds good, huh?

566
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:49,480
And believe it or not,

567
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,900
it's not really very expensive.

568
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,100
But it is a little risky.

569
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,620
Most subgeniuses thrive on danger, though.

570
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,760
They get off doing just what the conspiracy

571
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,540
doesn't want them to do.

572
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,880
In fact, it's many subgeniuses' only reason for living.

573
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,240
But rest assured,

574
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:10,980
the conspiracy sleeps lightly

575
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:12,680
when the strong awaken.

576
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:18,260
It is watching us with its vast, cold, impersonal eye.

577
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,960
Subgeniuses don't use all those fake names just to be cute.

578
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:26,900
They do it to help clog the thought-crime computers.

579
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:30,700
The dream police and the anti-sex leagues

580
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,740
toil deep into the night trying to analyze

581
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,800
and sort out all our contradictory clues.

582
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,960
They know, they know that somewhere out there,

583
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:40,960


584
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,260
maybe in the alley next door,

585
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:47,340
there lies a purebred subgenius who got away.

586
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:50,120
And as long as the subgenius gene lives,

587
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,760
they are in danger.

588
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:53,820
For there was a legend.

589
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,920
A legend that someday,

590
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,840
there would come a man with a pipe.

591
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,880
One who could outsell the conspiracy.

592
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,680
That man came,

593
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,040
and he keeps coming.

594
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:10,140
But he's got some new clients now,

595
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,120
and they'll be arriving soon

596
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,920
to inspect the property.

597
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,280
The stars shall descend upon the earth.

598
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,660
The heavens shall open up and rain fire.

599
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,140
The earth shall rise up and swallow the conspiracy dupes.

600
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:30,460
Those remaining masters unlucky enough to survive the Holocaust

601
00:30:30,460 --> 00:30:33,140
shall perish at the hands of their slaves.

602
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,100
It will be a bloody day.

603
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,640
A day of vengeance.

604
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,080
A day of purging.

605
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:41,460
But until that day,

606
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:44,580
we must feed and gather strength.

607
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:49,300
We must build and perfect that special vehicle

608
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:52,920
for exploring the frontiers of Dimension X and outer space.

609
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:54,520
The brain.

610
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,420
We must purge that brain of all the banal social interactions

611
00:30:59,420 --> 00:31:01,040
that are turning it to sludge.

612
00:31:01,180 --> 00:31:05,280
We must move, hone it, tighten it, update it.

613
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,060
Use it to build guns and flyers.

614
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:21,080
We must throw him out until GrangstanceArepa.

615
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:21,080


616
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,200
We must purge him,

617
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:25,100
and get him into the dark.

618
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:29,040
We must purge it

619
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,840
until Dimension X theirs is no longer known.

620
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,960
You know what?

621
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:36,800
See,

622
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,380
the truth is,

623
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:37,480
we,

624
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,040
partying mothers,

625
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,040


626
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:39,040


627
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:44,480
four or five different records and tapes and things from people that had some relation

628
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:48,500
to the Church of the Subgenius. They were all very friendly to us. You know, they said,

629
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:54,660
well, if we make any money, we'll give you some. And is this okay? And it is, usually.

630
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:04,180
Here's one from France. We got a CD in the mail from France from a group called Come

631
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:10,100
Together Productions. It's actually a collection of about 20 different bands, and they're all

632
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:19,820
kind of psychedelic sounding bands. It's kind of, it's like an Iron Butterfly Zeppelin airplane

633
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:26,240
or something. However, one of the groups on there is our old friend John Bartels, and

634
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:31,340
this is a piece that wasn't on any of his cassette tapes that he sends us. So stay tuned

635
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:33,400
here for John Bartels singing about

636
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,900
Neil Young.

637
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,360
Ah, yes.

638
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:13,720
And sometimes when I get bored, I go nuts and I play a second chord. Oh, yeah!

639
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:27,420
I'm Neil Young and I'm getting kind of old. All I gotta do is play one chord. Just like this. Yeah!

640
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,140
.

641
00:33:34,180 --> 00:34:04,180


642
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:16,100
.

643
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:30,160
John Bartels from, John Bartels of New York off of a French CD covered with pictures of

644
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:34,160
J.R. Bob Dobbs. Man, it's a small, wide CD.

645
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,160


646
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:34,580

672
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,000
.

673
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:21,740
.

674
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:21,740


675
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:21,740


676
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:21,740


677
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:21,740


678
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:21,740


679
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:21,740


680
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:21,740


681
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:21,740


682
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:29,620
The bitch, the weirdness, the twisted psychosis, the gut-splitting owls and screaming senseless

683
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,200
chuckles.

684
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:40,300
But you must regain them in full forced impact if you want to survive the scabrous abominations

685
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:48,420
that slither from your TV set, or slip from your newspaper, or burrow into your belly

686
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:52,280
to tunnel up your spine and devour your brain.

687
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:56,360
That is the space they're fighting for, and their goal?

688
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,420
Neutralize the Deviant.

689
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:13,540
But through Bob, dear friends, through Bob, through Bob, you can transcend mundane existence

690
00:36:13,540 --> 00:36:16,520
and become logic-free.

691
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,160
With these

692
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:24,900
secrets known only to the ancient yetis until now, Bob Dobbs can explain anything without

693
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,000
logic.

694
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,080
And with practice, so can you.

695
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,320
Select individuals receive private lessons.

696
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:35,500
But don't worry, anyone can pay for it.

697
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,520
So why wait?

698
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,780
Ask Bob into your life today.

699
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:41,360
No reasons will be given.

700
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:42,480
Count on it.

701
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,980
And don't let the sacred babble of Bob be drowned out by the pathetic

702
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:52,320
peep, peep, peep of pinkness, dear friends.

703
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:58,660
Join the warrior elite and fight the castrating cosmovogues.

704
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,380
Because it's what you don't see that sells you.

705
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:07,680
It is a laughing matter.

706
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:13,900
Be like the man who almost thought for himself.

707
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,960
Because, dear friends, you can't be a warrior without a laughing matter.

708
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:17,960


709
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:17,960


710
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:17,960


711
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:26,500
I invite you to take the time to take a look at this fish to the biting of the finden,

Sweeter English into your heart.

727
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:51,360
But Hal is talking over there more than when I'm talking.

728
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,240
I don't like that.

729
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,660
I need some more over here.

730
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,320
Hey, is that?

731
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,740
Yeah, okay, I see.

732
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,700
Just switch it down.

733
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,480
Oh, it's the both doing it.

734
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:05,460
Okay, but the one that really gets me is that one that's like an oscilloscope.

735
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:11,440
If you could be here, folks, I think you would really appreciate the wonders of modern radio communication.

736
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:17,100
They've got needles, switches, buttons, slide bars.

737
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,140
Like a mad scientist's laboratory.

738
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,400
I don't know.

739
00:38:21,460 --> 00:38:22,280
I'm just going to do this.

740
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:24,140
Whatever it's doing, I don't know, but it's doing it.

741
00:38:27,020 --> 00:38:27,620
Stop it.

742
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:28,860
Quit it.

743
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,560
I don't know.

744
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,700
Cut it out.

745
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:34,480
But they're crying in pain, so this must be the pain button.

746
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:35,220
Hey, it hurts.

747
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:35,960
Turn it off.

748
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,600
But I'm supposed to hold these records up here so you can all hear them.

749
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:41,320
You can hear the covers of these.

750
00:38:42,220 --> 00:38:45,080
These are the records we use on the show.

751
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,300
No, you can't.

752
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:52,800
The ones you've heard a thousand times, but they're just like new music every additional time.

753
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,580
Well, I wouldn't know about that.

754
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:56,080
And now I've started something else over here.

755
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:59,820
A machine just started waking up, and now...

756
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:00,800
Sid, calm down.

757
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,380
The machines in this studio make the weirdest noises I've never understood.

758
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,640
No other radio show has...

759
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,820
What is the deal over there?

760
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,140
I think that's the calcinator ray.

761
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,420
It's like this radio show.

762
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:11,940
It runs itself.

763
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,220
I can't even...

764
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,040
You know, as hard as I try...

765
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:14,720
It's a steaming power sport.

766
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:19,980
I've got what I think is control, but maybe it's nothing more than just a mere compression control.

767
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,780
Maybe I'm just fooling myself.

768
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,480
If I only could get a collar, I don't even know if I'm recorded.

769
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:31,380
I may be previously recorded, and they're fooling all of you.

770
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,980
That's probably what it is.

771
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:36,220
These guys are the kind of guys that will...

772
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,980
They'll record something and act like it's happening now, and really it happened...

773
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,460
three or four years ago.

774
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,300
A month ago.

775
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,300
Maybe last week.

776
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,720
And that's really...

777
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:48,880
That may be the case here.

778
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,760
You wouldn't know it unless you call.

779
00:39:51,280 --> 00:39:53,320
That's the only way you can prove it to yourself.

780
00:39:53,440 --> 00:40:00,880
You have to have that real-time connection between reality, which is out there, and then in here.

781
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:03,760
Hello?

782
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:06,940
Callers?

783
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,320
You know, one reason why...

784
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:14,460
it's easy for us to stay in Dallas...

785
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,460
is because we have so much hate.

786
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:22,220
You know, it's good for the artistic aspects of the Church of the Subgenius,

787
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,760
because we have plenty to hate.

788
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,840
This is a city full of normals.

789
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:27,960
A bunch of...

790
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,840
And what's worse, what's even worse than a normal...

791
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,100
is a token weirdo.

792
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,260
One of these passive weirdos.

793
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,260
Oh, I appreciate all the cool things.

794
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:40,580
I watch Ren and Stimpy.

795
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,760
I listen to the Hour of Slack.

796
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,620
I'm like, so cool.

797
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:46,240
I know all the right bands.

798
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,820
I know all the cool books.

799
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,540
I read William Burroughs.

800
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,840
Yes, I've read all his books.

801
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:52,140
And, uh...

802
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,780
And, uh...

803
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,640
But, uh...

804
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:54,820
Oh, but I can't.

805
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,260
I mean, I don't have enough money to...

806
00:40:57,260 --> 00:41:00,400
You know, I mean, that station's gonna be on the air anyway.

807
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:02,820
I don't need to send in my...

808
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:05,240
any kind of money to help support KNON.

809
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,800
Oh, no, I'll just, uh...

810
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,740
Somebody else will do it.

811
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:11,620
I'm a real mutant.

812
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,460
I'm like a rebel.

813
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,780
I hate everybody.

814
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:15,960
Ha ha ha!

815
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:16,820
Ha ha ha!

816
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:20,120
All the sins and all the inequities

817
00:41:20,120 --> 00:41:22,800
of mankind throughout history

818
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:27,420
will be placed on the shoulders of Charlie Manson.

819
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,880
That leaves Charlie a hero!

820
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,000
He is a super guy!

821
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,380
He is above good and evil!

822
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:40,420
He is the second!

823
00:41:40,580 --> 00:41:41,920
The coming of Christ!

824
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:48,020
And begged forth by the masses for centuries!

825
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,520
The same, sir!

826
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:52,800
The little, decrepit souls

827
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:55,440
wiring aimlessly into an infinite nothing!

828
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:57,360
Kneel, you leader!

829
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,340
And who's that man?

830
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,460
Who's the one

831
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:02,760
who has taken the sins

832
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,960
upon his shoulders of all mankind

833
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,460
and has gone beyond

834
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:09,680
the simple morality structures?

835
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:11,560
The one who has been

836
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:13,540
transformed into a new value!

837
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:14,720
I say again!

838
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:17,040
Charlie Manson!

839
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:19,500
You can't live forever!

840
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,420
Is he more willing to die

841
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:24,360
at this very moment?

842
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,680
Just accept Charlie Manson

843
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:31,820
into the very deepest essence of your soul!

844
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:35,460
You'll be redeemed, brother!

845
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,760
You'll be redeemed, brother!

846
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,180
You'll be redeemed, brother!

847
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:39,320
You'll be redeemed, brother!

848
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,560
You'll be redeemed, brother!

849
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:40,560


850
00:42:42,680 --> 00:43:02,160
Sorry, you fucking city!

851
00:43:04,520 --> 00:43:05,780
I said that you didn't know

852
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:06,360
what we were talking about and have guerrillas!

853
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:06,420
That's about right!

854
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:06,420


855
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:06,420


856
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:06,420


857
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,080
The final justice!

858
00:43:08,080 --> 00:43:08,740
easy- etc.

859
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,180
Follow the answers!

860
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,040
There's production between the two!

861
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:15,640
He's a tie-dye with a heart on.

862
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:19,960
The revolution is waiting for a spark.

863
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,020
Everybody's ready.

864
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,680
Are you weak little questions?

865
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,980
Don't say it!

866
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,660
Are you little, mmm, little loving

867
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:30,740
sacramental squishy little questions?

868
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,280
Don't say the true

869
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,880
cry that is needed!

870
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
We will

871
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,640
talk about the

872
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,480
smut peddlers

873
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,980
selling their bodies

874
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,900
mindlessly on the streets

875
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,340
for ten dollars

876
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:47,900
so they can get a dime of crack.

877
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:51,160
And these pornographers

878
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,460
they have people masturbating

879
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:54,660
inside their theaters.

880
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:57,980
And these evil heathens

881
00:43:57,980 --> 00:43:59,460
killing their babies.

882
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,920
These huge markets that sell

883
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,180
to death and destruction.

884
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,520
Abortion was ordained

885
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,140
by God to

886
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,640
wipe out all the children

887
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:13,320
of godless parents.

888
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,560
And God has

889
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:16,740
sent down a decree

890
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:19,120
that these children

891
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:21,160
will be aborted.

892
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:27,140
Blood on the ground!

893
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:30,640
Jesus getting stung!

894
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:32,880
Just the power

895
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,340
the demons need!

896
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:37,480
Thousands of cops on the streets!

897
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,060
We want to see

898
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,540
the real voice

899
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:41,300
that is

900
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:41,460
intimidating

901
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,660
the high priest!

902
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:45,600
These gay

903
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,060
God-had-lust

904
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:48,700
mobbers,

905
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,100
soldiers of Satan,

906
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:51,660
bodies in the streets!

907
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,580
We want to see

908
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:56,060
the eyes of

909
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:56,320
the people

910
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:56,840
who look

911
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:57,200
and die!

912
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,360
We told you

913
00:44:58,360 --> 00:44:58,940
this would happen!

914
00:44:59,220 --> 00:45:00,740
But you will have pity on them

915
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:01,860
instead of hospitals

916
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,140
where they can die!

917
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:04,820
You know the beauty of a way

918
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,540
to destroy a famous

919
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:07,840
synagogues building!

920
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:09,040
That is after

921
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,400
the sun comes back again

922
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:12,720
and rules us for one thousand years

923
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:14,500
and many people are judged

924
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,620
and executed!

925
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,980
And be weary

926
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:17,420
of the

927
00:45:17,420 --> 00:45:18,140
death of the

928
00:45:18,140 --> 00:45:18,380
deceased!

929
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:22,820
Be weary of your

930
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,880
unsafe neighbor!

931
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:25,460
For they are wretched,

932
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,860
wretched flock!

933
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:28,180
They must die!

934
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:28,840
They must kill!

935
00:45:29,140 --> 00:45:29,580
They must die!

936
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,380
They must die!

937
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:35,000
They must be against us

938
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:35,500
for years!

939
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,760
For years we have tried to be lined up

940
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:38,760
guns and executed!

941
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:39,860
They will say,

942
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,040
good works God!

943
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:43,700
But that is when they see the destruction

944
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,260
that they will encounter!

945
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,640
They will die a very gruesome death!

946
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:50,020
All who do not believe must die!

947
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,800
All who do not believe!

948
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,360
How many will die!

949
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:55,780
Millions will die in the battle against Satan!

950
00:45:56,200 --> 00:45:57,340
Millions speak the truth!

951
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,280
And the truth hurts so bad

952
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,020
it is still the truth!

953
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:02,960
The temple of death!

954
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:05,860
The hate!

955
00:46:05,960 --> 00:46:06,380
Storm!

956
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:06,940
Kill!

957
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:07,560
Die!

958
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:09,620
They know who killed them!

959
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,100
The ancestors of the American Indians!

960
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:13,080
The letter space!

961
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,780
The UFOs!

962
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:15,400
The spheals!

963
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,680
The human slaves!

964
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,420
They are wrecking rape camps!

965
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:21,180
But they don't care!

966
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,620
They would rather die than a thousand

967
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,240
screaming,

968
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:27,740
anarchy for the masses,

969
00:46:27,900 --> 00:46:30,620
a tent revival of body parts,

970
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:31,160
death,

971
00:46:31,300 --> 00:46:33,660
destruction, mayhem,

972
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:34,840
and black flags!

973
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:38,880
We could have made your limbs regrow

974
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,960
and healed your sick and unwanted children!

975
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:46,660
Endless masses looking for a reason to die

976
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:47,920
and not finding it!

977
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,960
They have declared war on the people!

978
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:53,740
Drop your crack pipe,

979
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:54,800
your bong,

980
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,120
your guns at our feet,

981
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,920
and we will save you from your miserable self!

982
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:03,420
If you could just call and help us out

983
00:47:03,420 --> 00:47:05,480
to prove that somebody listened to us,

984
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,120

992
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:38,920
That means a politically incorrect statement has been made within the last 24 hours on this station.

993
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:42,740
Approved by Federal Communications Commission regulations, of course.

994
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,820
What happened to the sound? I had a... Ah, here it is.

995
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:46,960
Let's all sing I Love Ronald Reagan.

996
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,900
Oh, so this is the mix.

997
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:51,060
I mean, this is what I sound like?

998
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:53,140
This is what I sound like?

999
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:54,580
Oh, my God.

1000
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:57,000
He's the best man president we've got.

1001
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:57,460
Wow.

1002
00:47:57,640 --> 00:47:59,560
Oh, I love Ronald Reagan.

1003
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,460
Well, the caller's calling in.

1004
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,520
Come on in, callers.

1005
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,520
Come on, callers.

1006
00:48:06,580 --> 00:48:07,120
Caller, you there?

1007
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:07,640
Let's hear you.

1008
00:48:07,900 --> 00:48:09,020
Meese. Meese.

1009
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:10,240
Are you there, caller?

1010
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:10,800
Mr. Meese.

1011
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,640
Ronald Reagan, walk me down the stairs.

1012
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,380
Mr. Meese, time to get up, sir.

1013
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:14,040
Do you hear the caller?

1014
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:15,780
We hand the Meese's to pieces.

1015
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:17,080
Mr. Meese, time to get up, sir.

1016
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:18,780
Are you there, Mr. Caller?

1017
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,600
Mr. Meese, time to get up, sir.

1018
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,060
Sounds like he's overdriving the climate change.

1019
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,000
Sounds like some kind of a war call.

1020
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:28,680
Sounded like some kind of a show to me.

1021
00:48:29,580 --> 00:48:31,280
A horrible sounding show.

1022
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,640
Yeah, well, dear friends.

1023
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:33,440
Boy, is this...

1024
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,160
This is like way past my bedtime.

1025
00:48:35,980 --> 00:48:41,440
Sitting here filling in for lost show makers.

1026
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,360
But we'll be able to use these recordings

1027
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,320
when we do pledge drives

1028
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:50,660
and yet have to send copies of show out.

1029
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:52,840
That's why I'm being so careful with these recordings.

1030
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,580
Because you never know when you might suddenly need

1031
00:48:56,580 --> 00:48:58,740
a pre-recorded hour of slack show

1032
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:01,260
thrown together unexpectedly

1033
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,800
in the dead of night

1034
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,380
by the things of Bob.

1035
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:09,060
Are you fed up with boring radio?

1036
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,520
Iron of Turgeon Antidia's Top 40.

1037
00:49:24,420 --> 00:49:26,440
Prepare to puke over pretty pop.

1038
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,080
Well, it's time to...

1039
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,140
Tune in to...

1040
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,980
The Soap Genius.

1041
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,800
Hour of Slack.

1042
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:40,660
That's what that is.

1043
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,920
Oh, kill the airlock.

1044
00:49:42,080 --> 00:49:42,800
Yeah, well...

1045
00:49:42,800 --> 00:49:43,400
Okay.

1046
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:44,020
Okay.

1047
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,260
Friends, let me tell you something.

1048
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,880
First off, number one...

1049
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:47,140
Let's get serious about this, Doctor.

1050
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:47,740
First of all...

1051
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:48,740
Cassette deck two...

1052
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,240
Is not working.

1053
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:54,400
And the ports on the starboard side are completely...

1054
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,380
That's okay.

1055
00:49:55,460 --> 00:49:56,880
We're losing air fast,

1056
00:49:57,140 --> 00:50:00,620
and we're gonna have to try to keep up with it.

1057
00:50:00,620 --> 00:50:02,880
Well, I'll open up this big blue cylinder of church.

1058
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,720
Oh, yes.

1059
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:05,100
Heaven.

1060
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:07,380
Oh, yes.

1061
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:09,400
Now I feel considerably better.

1062
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,760
Oh, yes.

1063
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,360
Now, baby, this church air...

1064
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:15,620
Oh, yes.

1065
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,720
Praise Bob.

1066
00:50:16,740 --> 00:50:18,420
I feel that church air now.

1067
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,560
Do you feel it?

1068
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:23,800
Friends, can you feel it out there in the radio audience?

1069
00:50:23,940 --> 00:50:24,760
I bet you can.

1070
00:50:24,920 --> 00:50:25,600
I bet you can.

1071
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:26,000
Yeah.

1072
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:28,120
Reach out and feel it, friend.

1073
00:50:28,380 --> 00:50:30,580
And if you can't reach down and feel it,

1074
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,180
then you're gonna...

1075
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:31,680
And then...

1076
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:32,860
You probably don't even...

1077
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,540
You probably don't even know what a prairie squid is.

1078
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:37,400
You probably don't even care what one tastes like.

1079
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:41,020
So, dear friends, once again, as we saw it,

1080
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:44,260
we come to the end of this side of the show.

1081
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,260
Once again, you'll have to...

1082
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:46,940
Turn your show over.

1083
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,120
Turn your radio over, flip it,

1084
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,520
so that you can hear the rest of it.

1085
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,660
The subgenius radio ministry,

1086
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:54,760
Hour of Slack.

1087
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:55,600
I'm sorry.

1088
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,000
I'm sorry.

1089
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:57,920
I'm sorry.

1090
00:50:59,060 --> 00:50:59,580
I'm sorry.

1091
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,120
I'm sorry.

1092
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,540
The next move is Hall's.

1093
00:51:05,660 --> 00:51:09,560
We've got to break this conspiracy of silence and secret orders.

1094
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:11,340
You've got to right this man now.

1095
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,760
Now, you listen to me.

1096
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,380
I'll only say it once.

1097
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,880
We are not sick men.

1098
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,300
God.

1099
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:21,860
God.

1100
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,500
Who's God?

1101
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:24,540
God.

1102
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:25,420
God.

1103
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:26,540


1104
00:51:26,680 --> 00:51:27,320
God.

1105
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:27,780
God.

1106
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:28,680
God.

1107
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:29,440
God.

1108
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:29,440


1109
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,000
God.

1110
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:30,440


1111
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:30,440


1112
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:30,440


1113
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:30,440


1114
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:30,440


1115
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:30,440


1116
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:30,440


1117
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:30,440


1118
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:30,440


1119
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:30,440


1120
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:30,440


1121
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:30,720
God.

1122
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:31,260
God.

1123
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:52,180
A lovely little tape edit here from Joe Riley.

1124
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:55,280
Praise St. John.

1125
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,480
What you are about to see, you may find hard to believe.

1126
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:05,260
It is a tale of the supernatural, an experience of the occult beyond all imagination.

1127
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:10,580
It is a story of frightening monsters of human origin

1128
00:52:10,580 --> 00:52:13,900
who could only be repulsed by monsters more wicked,

1129
00:52:15,140 --> 00:52:18,540
like the underworld demons who avenge spilt family blood.

1130
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,860
That's right, dear friends.

1131
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:28,380
It's the subgenius radio ministry hour of...

1132
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:33,040
Slack relentlessly pounding on and on into the night.

1133
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:40,540
Chopping and digging our way through the airwaves to reach your ear,

1134
00:52:40,660 --> 00:52:44,440
to punch our way past it and get into your brain.

1135
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:46,160
Ah, yes.

1136
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:52,840
It's a shame.

1137
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:54,660
I'm going to get us off on a nice note.

1138
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:55,800
This is...

1139
00:52:56,960 --> 00:52:57,600
Saint.

1140
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,240
Feresht vape,

1141
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:02,360
by Dee Fredit.

1142
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:06,000
Feresht by VapeHouse.

1143
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:06,820
That's how they say it.

1144
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:07,520
Oh, and if you're any a fuki fan,

1145
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:07,520


1146
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,440
God damn, Yumi,

1147
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:11,480
I'm gonna love this.

1148
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:23,000
That was a lovely album the hots irrigation over Ubuntu made me re-edit.

1149
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:27,020
vape.

1150
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:27,340


1151
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:27,460
Vape.

1152
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:28,460


1153
00:53:28,460 --> 00:53:33,560
Every step you take, I'll be watching you.

1154
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,060
I'll be watching you.

1155
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:40,280
Every single day.

1156
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:46,380
Every word you say.

1157
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:52,840
Every game you play.

1158
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,000
Every night you stay.

1159
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:59,260
I'll be watching you.

1160
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,720
I'll be watching you.

1161
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,800
Oh, can't you see?

1162
00:54:09,560 --> 00:54:12,120
You belong to me.

1163
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:20,440
And my poor heart aches.

1164
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,340
With every step you take.

1165
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,120
Every move you make.

1166
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:38,120
And every vow you break.

1167
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:44,280
Every smile you fake.

1168
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:47,380
Every claim you stake.

1169
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:50,620
I'll be watching you.

1170
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:54,120
I'll be watching you.

1171
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,520
Every day you think of me.

1172
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:14,060
Every day you sing me many songs.

1173
00:55:14,200 --> 00:55:14,540
Every single week I stop to think of you.

1174
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:16,280
Every day you say that you love me.

1175
00:55:16,280 --> 00:55:19,860
Every day you say that you're CrimePopuff.

1176
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:25,640
Every day you say that you love me.

1177
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:48,640
Oh, can't you see

1178
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:55,400
That you belong to me

1179
00:55:55,400 --> 00:56:01,940
And how my poor heart, it aches

1180
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:07,820
Every step you take

1181
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:14,600
Every move you make

1182
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:17,300
Every move you make

1183
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,800
Every bow you break

1184
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:26,880
Every smile you fake

1185
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,080
Every claim you stake

1186
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:33,680
I'll be watching you

1187
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:40,100

00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:47,280


1192
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:47,280


1193
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,820
I'll be watching you

1194
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,580
Follow your ass home

1195
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:59,320
I'll be watching you

1196
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:02,700
Look in the window of your trailer home

1197
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,860

00:57:29,000 --> 00:57:34,840
I will say to you

1207
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:41,260
I'm the only one who feels she's dead

1208
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:41,920
But camera is the last thing that I can do

1209
00:57:41,920 --> 00:57:52,340
I'm the only one who feels she isn'tså
