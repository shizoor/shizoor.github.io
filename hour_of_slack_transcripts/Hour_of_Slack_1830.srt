1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:04,620
A beginning is a very delicate time.

2
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:08,580
Strange things began to take place.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,180
Flying saucers seen over Washington, D.C.

4
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:16,440
I understand, Colonel, you've been on tap, tap, tap.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:20,600
The Earth people who can think are so frightened by those who cannot.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:23,600
It's been absolutely impossible to work through these Earth creatures.

7
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,760
Their soul is too controlled.

8
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:29,260
Kill him!

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,480
I'm the Jet.

10
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:32,200
The subgenius.

11
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:34,480
Power of the Sun.

12
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:36,760
You ain't gonna find him in there.

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,480
And now for the first time, we are bringing to you the full story of what happened.

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:53,760
We are all interested in the future, for that is where you and I are going to spend the rest of our lives.

15
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:55,520
And remember, my friends,

16
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,100
future events such as these will affect you in the future.

17
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,240
You are interested in the unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

18
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:07,120
That is why you are here.

19
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:11,440
It was a light coming down from the sky.

20
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,740
I don't know who or why.

21
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:19,480
We've been around for, well, we've been public since 1980.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,620
That was when we printed our first pamphlet.

23
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:24,460
And then the book of the subgenius came out in 1983.

24
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,300
Now, all through the 80s, it was really just kind of a club of nerdy, over-white boys.

25
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:34,560
As you might well imagine.

26
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,700
It looked kind of like a GWAR concert.

27
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:47,740
But we lied and presented it as a sex cult, like the Raelians that you may have heard of.

28
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh yeah, right, right, Rael.

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,120
And then they wanted to clone themselves.

30
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,380
Well, you know, it's like a building.

31
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,200
They build it and they will come.

32
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:00,620
And sure enough, it turns out there are a lot of lonely mutants out there

33
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:06,040
looking for a mutant of the opposite or otherwise desired sex or species.

34
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:14,200
And we started having these yearly events, which we call X-Day drills.

35
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,860
Did you know the world ends July 5th?

36
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:17,940
No, I did not know that.

37
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:23,860
Yeah, Bob predicted a long time ago that the world ends on July 5th, 1998.

38
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,180
1998 at 7 a.m.

39
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,800
1998.

40
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,480
Yeah.

41
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:34,440
Now, obviously, the conspiracy of the normal people has been fooling with calendars for who knows how long.

42
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,300
Well, this is true, yeah.

43
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:35,940
Just to embarrass Bob.

44
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,900
And it's obviously really not 1998 yet.

45
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,940
Well, then there was the Romans that screwed it up, too.

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:41,460
You know what I mean?

47
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:42,160
You always blame the Romans.

48
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:45,360
Yeah, it's a real mess.

49
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:48,620
We don't really know what year this is or what planet this is, even.

50
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,860
But we get together at different campgrounds.

51
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,840
And we have these in-house meetings.

52
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,060
We have these end-of-the-world drills.

53
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:55,620
Cool.

54
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:00,180
Every July 5th, we do what you would do if you thought the world was about to end.

55
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,560
What does one do on a drill?

56
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,740
I mean, where the world ends?

57
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,000
I mean, just kind of run around screaming?

58
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,500
It's up to you.

59
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,100
I mean, things you wouldn't do on a normal day at work.

60
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,900
Well, I can think of a lot of things I wouldn't do on a normal day at work.

61
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,860
You know, like eat three helpings of ice cream instead of just one.

62
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,300
Really wild stuff like that.

63
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,420
People turning south from the freeway

64
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:26,440
were startled when they saw three flying saucers high over Hollywood Boulevard.

65
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,720
With your ancient juvenile minds,

66
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:33,660
you have developed explosives too fast for your minds to conceive what you are doing.

67
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,460
Then they attacked a town.

68
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,980
A small town, I'll admit.

69
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,160
But nevertheless, a town of people.

70
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:41,660
People who died.

71
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:46,280
Must be those strangers that come every night

72
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:50,700
Those saucer-shaped lights put people uptight

73
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,240
Leave blue-green footprints that glow in the dark

74
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,300
I hope they get home alright

75
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:04,520
Aside from the church declaring war on God and trying to change all human nature,

76
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:09,300
which is also what every peacenik wants, I guess,

77
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:15,900
is to change human nature and make us so we're not chimpanzees or even primates anymore.

78
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,120
Good luck on that.

79
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,120
But actually, Bob promises the end

80
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:26,620
of warfare for all who have become ordained subgenius ministers,

81
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,040
which only cost $30,

82
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,300
on X-Day, July 5th, 1998,

83
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,940
if the real 1998 ever gets here.

84
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,060
That's how big the conspiracy is!

85
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,820
That's how insidious it is!

86
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,580
You think this is, what, July 29th, 2008,

87
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,900
if that's what it's supposed to be.

88
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,680
But we don't really know what year this is.

89
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,700
We don't even know what planet this is.

90
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,940
If I could tell you that Earth was switched with Mars,

91
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:01,600
and World War II was nothing but a diversion to hide that slight of planet trick,

92
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,780
and you would laugh, some of you, if it were that funny,

93
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,540
but it's fucking true!

94
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,940
That's the horrible thing about it!

95
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:16,460
And if you don't believe me, the evidence is in our new book, The Bobliographon.

96
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,560
I'm sure the evidence is also in the Bible.

97
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,980
As far as I can tell, the evidence for anything is in the Bible.

98
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:27,360
And our books are the same way.

99
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:33,280
They're vague, they're full of generalizations,

100
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,800
and terrible, wrathful things,

101
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:39,700
which suddenly turn into peacenik, nice things,

102
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:43,200
and there's a lot of sex, and killing.

103
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:47,560
So, you know, and what we have that the Bible doesn't?

104
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:48,880
Pictures.

105
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
That's a selling point.

106
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,020
Our books have pictures.

107
00:05:55,480 --> 00:06:00,500
You see, as Onan said, once again, see, he's my script writer,

108
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,840
God forgot to make stupidity painful.

109
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,420
We're here to change that.

110
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:15,720
And I have a condition known as everything hurts really bad all the time-thritis.

111
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:19,340
The last time I said that at one of these,

112
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,000
a guy came up and gave me three Vicodin.

113
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,660
Is that guy here?

114
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:25,400
Yeah.

115
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,800
Anyway, we have, um...

116
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,380
Where is he?

117
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,660
Ah, one guy.

118
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,900
Bumped out. Lady trouble, huh?

119
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:37,100
Yeah, my ex was a pain in the ass, too.

120
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:42,100
What did you say?

121
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:45,440
You said my ex was a pain in the ass, too.

122
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,060
Your ex?

123
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,280
Yeah.

124
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:49,680
Your ex?

125
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,980
Yeah.

126
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,340
Your ex?

127
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,780
That's it!

128
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,240
Ex day!

129
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,140
Ex day!

130
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,620
Ex day!

131
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:03,740
Thank you!

132
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,200
Ex day!

133
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,240
Ex day!

134
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:07,880
Ex day!

135
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,880
Hey!

136
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,860
Ex day...

137
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:18,800
A day to rid yourself of that extra baggage.

138
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,480
And to once again soar like a falcon to new horizons of freedom.

139
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,900
Abandon your intimate side and demolish your relationships with ex day cards.

140
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,900
Ex day.

141
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,460
Well, that's it.

142
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,260
That's the new greeting card line.

143
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,860
Great new greeting card line.

144
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:48,780
This 1830th hour of slack is a good rerun from 2013.

145
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:51,580
It's 2008, number 1150.

146
00:07:51,980 --> 00:08:00,200
And everything about ex day still applies in 2001 except that the main party is being held in Land O' Lakes, Florida,

147
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:05,840
at the nudist resort of Reverend Exanthea Octo-Shroom and her dad.

148
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:09,800
But most of the subgeniuses probably won't be nude.

149
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:16,520
Most of our skins are generally unkissed by the sun's rays and would like to stay that way.

150
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:29,240
All information about how and when and where and how much can be found at subgenius.com under events, ex day, etc, etc, etc.

151
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:38,300
Dr. Hal and I will be there and a whole bunch of much younger subgeniuses including our ringleaders, Argus Fox and Reverend Pease.

152
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,100
Don't put off reserving a spot because the limit is 100 persons.

153
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,680
And...

154
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:48,240
And now I have something sad.

155
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:54,460
Another great old subgenius has boarded the saucers ahead of us.

156
00:08:55,520 --> 00:09:06,180
Reverend Rock Roswell, human name Charles Mark B. of Champaign, Illinois and radio station WEFT.

157
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:12,520
At age 60, after terrible struggles with health and insurance,

158
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:16,500
has gone to meet Bob and the sex goddesses,

159
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:25,140
and Reverend Heathen and Dr. Dark and Dr. Legume and Reverend Anitrocity and Chaz Smith and...

160
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:27,800
Oh God, the list is too long.

161
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:35,000
Reverend Roswell used to sponsor Hour of Slack on WEFT and had his own show, Mental Vortex.

162
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:38,820
He was a super nice guy and very generous.

163
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,900
He jammed with us at a couple of ex days.

164
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:46,480
And he gave me my two best professional subgeniuses.

165
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:54,940
He was a junior scientist, for real, specializing in microscopy.

166
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:56,980
If that's how it's pronounced.

167
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,620
It's just not fair and he will be missed.

168
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,700
Hour of Slack salutes Mark B.

169
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,040
And we'll see you on ex day.

170
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,460
See you then.

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,600
Every new beginning's a delicate time

172
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,860
But just like when the end comes

173
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,520
It's never very pretty

174
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,600
And every in-between time

175
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:58,300
Looks like a perfect picture

176
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,020
It seems to last forever

177
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:02,080
Because it's learning still

178
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:04,720
But oh, baby

179
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:08,280
Change is gonna come

180
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,240
Not just maybe

181
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,700
Change is gonna come

182
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,040
Man, change now

183
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:24,040


184
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:35,580
.

185
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,160
Oh, it's been a while

186
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,340
But it still has a strong lasting influence

187
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:46,460
To me

188
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:46,460


189
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:46,460


190
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:46,460


191
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:46,460


192
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,400
A change is gonna come

193
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,220
A change is gonna come

194
00:11:51,220 --> 00:12:00,780
A change is gonna come

195
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:04,500
A change is gonna come

196
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,260
Here it comes

197
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:11,160
Every new beginning's a delicate time

198
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Just like when the end comes, it's never very pretty

199
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,940
And every in-between time looks like a perfect picture

200
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,700
It seems to last forever because it's running still

201
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:29,020
But oh, mama, change is gonna come

202
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,520
Psycho, mama, a change is gonna come

203
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,620
If this were a dictatorship, it'd be a heck of a lot easier.

204
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,400
Just so long as I'm the dictator.

205
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,440
What's your view on homosexuality?

206
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,100
Yeah, I am mindful that we're all sinners.

207
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:02,940
And to the C students, I say, you too can be president of the United States.

208
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:10,000
It's just, uh, I just don't understand.

209
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,700
It doesn't make any sense to me.

210
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,340
But hey, I get it.

211
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:17,340


212
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:17,340


213
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:17,340


214
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:19,640
Er, a change is gonna come.

215
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:24,160
By the Attery Squash!

216
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,340
…♡

217
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:29,880
They're with Reverend Diva ________, praise Diva, praise Skaefo.

218
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:38,560
And there's lots more of the Attery Squash at myspace.com

219
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:42,920
slash the attery squash,

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,080
one more pronounce that well, by the μ orbit.

221
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:46,840
Attery is A-T-T-E-R-Y.

222
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:51,940
Before that, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang, sermonizing at Winterstar of 2008.

223
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:56,760
See RosenComet.com for more on that and Starwood coming later this summer.

224
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:03,120
And see Subgenius.com if you want to know about X-Day.

225
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:12,740
We also heard more on X-Day Moronicism on Rick Barber's show on KOA Denver from last year.

226
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:19,880
Praise Rick and praise Lemur, the collagi-graphiar.

227
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:23,840
How do you say that? Collagiographiest.

228
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:34,420
Anyway, friends, this is hour of slight number 1,150 devoted to the world of X-Day.

229
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,740
A world from which all normality has vanished.

230
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:42,620
The disappearance of humans may seem like science fiction.

231
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:48,500
But eventually there will come a day like this.

232
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,100
A day when people no longer walk the earth.

233
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,460
It's no great stretch to imagine humans disappearing from the face of the earth.

234
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,980
Every generation has its tales of Armageddon or apocalypse.

235
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:11,500
We're the first generation that could, by deliberate actions, cause its own doom.

236
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:42,120
Several of us, on average, have experienced任query, from in v sint vi rated baraet dragoôgævëræ,

237
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:42,720
anrah Acting Director of вед dire desserts for

238
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:42,720


239
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:42,720


240
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:42,720


241
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:42,720


242
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,660
and plot lines

243
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,320
Yeah, the monkeys.

244
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,140
They just seemed appropriate somehow.

245
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,360
Not exactly Yeti, but close enough for jazz.

246
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,520
By the way, is it true that the subgenii are descendants of Yeti?

247
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,340
Right.

248
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:04,300
We believe that there are only two races, the human race and the subgeniuses.

249
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:04,500
Ah.

250
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:11,360
And both come in all colors and shapes and ages and several different genders.

251
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:12,740
And furry?

252
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,680
Well, some are.

253
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:19,800
You know, not all of us can boast that we're full-blood Yetis.

254
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,380
In fact, almost nobody can.

255
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,540
In fact, I don't know a single one.

256
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:24,320
Yeah, well.

257
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,700
But, you know, if you look around at the people you work with, you'll go,

258
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:32,300
that person there might have a little bit of Sasquatch blood.

259
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,300
Yeah, well, I...

260
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,980
A little bit of Bigfoot there.

261
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,920
I've seen a few.

262
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:41,080
Especially, you know, some of the Russian premieres, they have that look about them.

263
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:41,940
Right.

264
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:44,140
Yeah, so, you know, the unibrow look.

265
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,000
Let's go back to the telephone.

266
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,840
In Denver is Lee.

267
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,020
Lee, you're on with the Reverend Ivan Stang.

268
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:50,500
Good morning.

269
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,680
Good morning, Rick.

270
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:53,160
Reverend Stang, it's an honor.

271
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,340
All hail Dobbs.

272
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,260
Praise Bob.

273
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,500
All hail Bob.

274
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:56,980
You bet.

275
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:59,640
Well, you know, some religions have the pilgrimage.

276
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,960
Some have jihad.

277
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,860
Some have the vision quest.

278
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,420
What would you say is the highest deed one can perform to achieve universal slack?

279
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,340
Well, slack is...

280
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:13,460
Slack is the goal of every subgenius.

281
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:20,660
The trick, though, is that slack is different to each subgenius.

282
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:26,800
Most religions will preach a specific form of slack that's supposed to fit everybody.

283
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:31,680
And the conspiracy of the normal people, of course, that that's the way they work.

284
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:40,120
But, so, we'll tell you that you need slack and that you should work your way towards it.

285
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,340
But since we don't know what slack is...

286
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,540
Slack is for you, we can't be all that specific.

287
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:54,120
As far as a pilgrimage, I would say X-Day is getting to be the yearly subgenius pilgrimage.

288
00:17:54,220 --> 00:18:05,600
We hold the main X-Day drill in a clothing optional campground in Amish country in New York,

289
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:11,040
way out in the boonies, where we can pretty much do anything we want.

290
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,900
You'll be glad to know that most people keep their clothing on.

291
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,160
Would this be anywhere near Yaskier's Farm?

292
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,600
No, it's the other side of New York.

293
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:22,560
It's kind of near Erie, Pennsylvania.

294
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,300
I see.

295
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:24,620
And it's a pretty eerie place.

296
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:25,260
Sort of.

297
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:31,200
But, yeah, Brushwood Folklore Center is where X-Day is held.

298
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:31,700
And we...

299
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:32,900
That's got to be the...

300
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,840
People come to that from all over the world.

301
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,340
I mean, we've had people come from Germany and China.

302
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:41,600
China.

303
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,280
It's just amazing.

304
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,920
It's kind of a mutant convention.

305
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:54,660
The first day is always rather awkward, because, you know, weirdos often are kind of shy.

306
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,020
Or else they talk so much they drive everybody else away.

307
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,460
So it's a little rough the first day.

308
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,860
But it's got to be quite a community.

309
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:04,420
Interesting.

310
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,760
But, yeah, it's a real cult.

311
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:11,220
You know, I mean, when people talk about cults, the Church of the Subgenius is a lot bigger.

312
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,720
Than many of the ones that get so much press.

313
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:14,660
You bet.

314
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,080
Maybe you do believe this.

315
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,380
Maybe they're not lies.

316
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,420
They're delusions.

317
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:20,840
Whatever.

318
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,440
The fact remains.

319
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,660
The evidence here is flimsy.

320
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,540
It's bordering on ludicrous.

321
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,400
Hey, this isn't a courtroom.

322
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,660
You're not arguing a case.

323
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,480
And you're doing nothing but damage talking the way you are.

324
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,160
And you can throw as much cow's blood around the loading dock as you want to.

325
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,620
You still haven't fooled anyone.

326
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,720
Leave it alone, David.

327
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,080
You can't convince some people there's a fire even when their hair is burning.

328
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,220
Denial is a powerful thing.

329
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:41,960
Well, keep talking.

330
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,520
I'll have no part of it.

331
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,760
Nor would any thinking person.

332
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:48,200
Keep thinking, Mr. Lawyer.

333
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,000
There's no defense against the will of God.

334
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,420
There's no court of appeals in hell.

335
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,600
There's no defense here either.

336
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:58,340
Not even with all the fertilizer in the world.

337
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,660
Not even if you stack it as high as you can.

338
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:03,720
It's still just bags of shit, isn't it?

339
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:09,140
Those of you who want to discuss this thing rationally to find a means of rescue are welcome to join me.

340
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:11,340
Those who want to stack dogs.

341
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:11,740
Dog food.

342
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:13,940
Knock yourselves out.

343
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:16,880
And anyone who believes in it,

344
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:20,940
don't take it personally if there are no colleagues.

345
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:26,320
No matter what happens on the show, don't take it personally.

346
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:30,800
I bought the thing where, you know, dude, trailer.

347
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:31,540
Thank you.

348
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:34,460
Don't confuse the listener with an active human.

349
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,500
But we can be merciful.

350
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,220
By asking them to do more than one thing during a plug.

351
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,000
And that is listen to.

352
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,500
The Puzzling Evidence Show.

353
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,540
And download the podcast.

354
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,980
And your show have the support it needs.

355
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:51,120
Now, which were the real callers?

356
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,340
Are you really big callers?

357
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:54,500
I am in the same room with Puzzling Evidence.

358
00:20:54,740 --> 00:21:00,340
These shows are actually lovingly collected and downloaded and podcasted.

359
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:01,280
See, that's what I'm afraid of.

360
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:03,540
If your show is an hour long.

361
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:06,340
I have to live with that every X day, Puzz.

362
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,340
I've been shot at X day.

363
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,160
Luckily.

364
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,360
It was by my good friend, Dr. Legume.

365
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,980
And it had blanks in it.

366
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,640
But, uh.

367
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,460
Vary your delivery and your words.

368
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:22,120
Even the great X day has a copy of the original.

369
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,360
And conversational.

370
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:24,580
Now have the deity shot.

371
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,880
Reintroduce your deity.

372
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,140
Now remember, remember I'm deaf.

373
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:33,400
Recognize your many different listening styles.

374
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,940
I can change the brain from the eye to the eye.

375
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:41,000
Call out through towns with central and lateral control.

376
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:41,840
Mechanisms.

377
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,140
Gratting with the weather.

378
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:46,840
It's also about how people will believe anything.

379
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:47,920
Of course.

380
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:52,700
I mean, look at Jim Jones out in California back in the 70s.

381
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:58,180
I mean, look at how he was able to mesmerize 900 people into drinking the Kool-Aid.

382
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:04,460
Well, I heard about this Texas death cult that gets people to stand around waiting for flying saucers every single year.

383
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,580
They think the world is going to end.

384
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:10,020
Now, they may be a Texas death cult, but they don't meet in Texas.

385
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:10,980
They actually meet.

386
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,420
In the most rural part of New York State.

387
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,220
Well, how do you know they don't meet in Texas?

388
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,040
Well, they could meet in Texas.

389
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,260
Yeah, as a matter of fact, they do.

390
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,080
Yes.

391
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,400
And what they do, it's like the Bohemian Grove there.

392
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,580
They don't wear clothes.

393
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:26,400
Yeah.

394
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:32,120
We're talking, of course, about the Raelians, the fabulous visitors from the stars.

395
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:32,580
Right.

396
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,260
From Star Royale.

397
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,760
Everybody must get cloned.

398
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,800
Oh, yeah.

399
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:45,720
When you have too many and there's too many replicants replicating replicants and stuff, it gets confusing.

400
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:49,500
No, they're the people who claimed they had cloned a human being.

401
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,240
And the press actually bought it.

402
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:53,940
For about five minutes.

403
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:57,520
Like, they actually got these people on the front page of various national papers.

404
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,300
It's like, wow, these reporters need to keep up with their bizarre cults better.

405
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,840
You know what I mean?

406
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:07,140
Well, nowadays, you can clone the little corporal in your basement.

407
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,740
Yes, sir.

408
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:08,920
Napoleon Bonaparte.

409
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,640
One strand.

410
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:13,120
There is enough to create an entire dictator from Republican roots.

411
00:23:14,020 --> 00:23:14,620
I'm sorry.

412
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:15,420
If only.

413
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,320
If only we could clone people from their hair.

414
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:18,800
Huh?

415
00:23:19,180 --> 00:23:25,720
Actually, the reason why the media went after that guy with the Raelians, he provided too much information all at once.

416
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:32,420
He was out there spilling the secrets about his own faith, and nobody had any reason to buy into it.

417
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,720
Because it was like.

418
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,900
Which is why the Church of the Subgenius is different.

419
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:36,620
Right.

420
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:39,780
We provide just enough faith for you to believe on your own.

421
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:40,540
Right.

422
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,520
What is real and what isn't.

423
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,160
Well, the thing with the applesauce duo, they used to tour together.

424
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:55,020
Not the same as Stang and we, but they would come and appear long before they were, you know, the Raelian saviors and stuff like that.

425
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:55,960
Uh-huh.

426
00:23:56,020 --> 00:24:05,220
They'd like show up at high school and, you know, like Socrates bowling alley places and stuff where people would congregate and, you know, have this meeting.

427
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:09,780
And people were expected to field questions, but they would never answer some other person who was there.

428
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:09,780


429
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:16,040
And people who looked real serious and scared would say, I mean, says, and then they would say what they said.

430
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,720
And that's what it was like.

431
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:19,440
That's what it was like.

432
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,160
That's what it was like.

433
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:20,820
That's what it was like.

434
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:21,520
That's what it was like.

435
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:22,680
You see?

436
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:23,520
You see?

437
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,060
You're stupid minds.

438
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:25,960
Stupid.

439
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:26,780
Stupid.

440
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:32,940
There comes a time in each man's life when he can't even believe his own eyes.

441
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:38,640
Take any fire, any earthquake, any major disaster, then wonder.

442
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:43,180
Oh, every year there's some movie that rips off Bob.

443
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,120
Yep.

444
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:48,540
The conspiracy uses Hollywood as a tool to distract from Bob.

445
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:53,800
One of the most gross examples was, you know, Bob predicted the end of the world July 5th, 1998.

446
00:24:54,000 --> 00:25:00,860
Well, what movie was released July 4th, 1998, Independence Day?

447
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:02,480
Yes, that's all terrible.

448
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,640
To distract people from our little alien invasion.

449
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,020
Goddamn it.

450
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:08,620
And in that one, of course, the Earthmen win.

451
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:08,620


452
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:12,900
With a computer program that the aliens can't...

453
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,760
Whereas in Bob's prophecy, the aliens and the subgeniuses will win, but the humans will lose.

454
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:17,260
So...

455
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,620
We know that.

456
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:24,840
Isn't that telling us then that everybody who survived in Independence Day is actually either a subgenius or an alien in a humanoid body?

457
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,160
In these, they're all mixed up.

458
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:33,480
In that movie, the subgenius was the drunken hick who had been abducted by aliens that no one would believe.

459
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:38,620
And he martyred himself by flying his fighter jet up the tailpipe of the moon.

460
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,080
And he was the father of the alien's mother ship.

461
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,880
A likely scenario.

462
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,540
Gave away the ending.

463
00:25:41,660 --> 00:25:42,860
Yeah, well...

464
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:44,240
It's a little slim pickings for me.

465
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,900
I was gonna go see it tomorrow.

466
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,260
Warning, spoilers.

467
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,200
Spoiler like you are saying.

468
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,560
Movie is conspiracy propaganda.

469
00:25:52,760 --> 00:26:02,880
And of course, the conspiracy does have its giant festival on July 4th with fireworks and depressing desert storm parades, as someone once wrote.

470
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,600
But the next day, Subgenius Day, as it were...

471
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:08,600


472
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:08,600


473
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:13,380
Is freedom from the conspiracy of the Normans.

474
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:16,180
Is independence from them.

475
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,640
That's our main holiday.

476
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:19,640
The 5th.

477
00:26:19,700 --> 00:26:21,120
Yeah, 5th of July.

478
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:26,360
You don't have to come to Brushwood in New York to be lifted up and ruptured.

479
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:35,460
No, but if you do, you'll find that the orgies of X-Day lead up to the supreme moment of the saucer landing and boarding.

480
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,600
Now, I've been out there all day.

481
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,080
On that field at 7 o'clock in the morning.

482
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,600
Me too.

483
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:47,860
Every July 5th since 1996 when we started drilling for the end of the world.

484
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,700
There have been unexplained mystery phenomena in the sky.

485
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,020
It's a hellish time to be up.

486
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:54,200
You know, for Subgenius, for me it's a...

487
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,200
It's hard to get up.

488
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,200
It's a few hours after I go to bed, especially right there.

489
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:07,320
Well, it's a reminder to me how so many of my fellow subgeniuses have to get up at that ungodly hour.

490
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,360
Six days a week.

491
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,220
So they're back there but to work and...

492
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:12,580
That's right.

493
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,240
So what's the 4th look like then?

494
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,260
How are you preparing?

495
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:18,060
How are you preparing for the 5th?

496
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,220
What are you doing on the 4th?

497
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:23,440
We do all the things that you would do if you thought it was the last day of your life.

498
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:26,000
Sweet. Lots of sex and alcohol.

499
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,080
See, we don't celebrate July 4th out there at all.

500
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,660
We are separated from planet America.

501
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,280
And we're out that...

502
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,220
We don't even hear the distant pop of...

503
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:37,980
Fireworks.

504
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,320
That's one thing to do.

505
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:41,060
We have...

506
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:46,780
We might have fireworks of our own but that's a different matter and they wouldn't be let off at that particular time.

507
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:48,560
Actually Hal, um...

508
00:27:49,300 --> 00:27:58,620
Brushwood has outlawed firework use by subgeniuses on their campground because we overdid it for so many years.

509
00:27:58,880 --> 00:27:59,520
Horse...

510
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,620
Amish...

511
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:07,200
The Amish farmers were having trouble with their horses kicking down the stables because of...

512
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,800
The subgenius fireworks being so loud and violent.

513
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:15,600
But you're just alerting the masses that the truth is now.

514
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,120
It's...

515
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:18,440
It's the 5th dammit.

516
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,180
The 4th is over.

517
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,840
We've been trying...

518
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,240
We've been at it for 25 years now.

519
00:28:23,420 --> 00:28:26,220
Well no, 27 years now.

520
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,560
Now, since the subgenius foundation first went public.

521
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:36,140
Trying to spread the word of slack, the truth of J.R. Bob Dobbs and warnings about the conspiracy.

522
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,140
And uh...

523
00:28:38,140 --> 00:28:38,720
Every...

524
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,100
If...

525
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:40,520
You know if one...

526
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,180
One soul is saved by this broadcast tonight and this whole trip.

527
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,300
This whole church was worth it.

528
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:53,400
If one soul is saved that 27 years is justified.

529
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,220
Justified my friend.

530
00:28:56,400 --> 00:29:01,240
Call in now and Pastor Stang will relieve your woes.

531
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,540
Just give us a jingle.

532
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,540
We can't promise we'll relieve your woes.

533
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,400
But we can change your woes.

534
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:08,720
Six...

535
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,780
Well figure it out.

536
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:10,740
No more open the...

537
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:11,180
Or is it?

538
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:11,600
No.

539
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:12,460
Call now.

540
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,800
Now is the time.

541
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,360
Save yourselves.

542
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,060
Wow, where the hell did you find those?

543
00:29:17,620 --> 00:29:18,080
Now...

544
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,820
Mission control, this is Mars 295 ready for departure.

545
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:35,900
Uh, Er...

546
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:36,220
Uh, Er...

547
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:36,520
Uh, Er...

548
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,520


549
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,520


550
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,520


551
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,520


552
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,520


553
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,520


554
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,520


555
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,520


556
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,520


557
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,520


558
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,520


559
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,520


560
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,520


561
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:36,520


562
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,540
But err Paw...

563
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:48,560
Uh, Er...

564
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:48,560


565
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:55,140
Huh?

566
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:00,020
Oh, we told him to

567
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,720
run away earlier.

568
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:04,240
He let's is go.

569
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,240


570
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:04,840
And now we try a little extra.

571
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:05,820
Did he get wet?

572
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:06,520
No, not just that.

573
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,860
In the acro field, I'm trying not to get killed

574
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:13,160
I'm dodging mouse bars and all filthy ways

575
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,900
Cause the planet's stacking and I should call a biggie

576
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:18,600
And say, what were you thinking?

577
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,520
I will get the mess you made

578
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:24,860
This was a bunch of mess that you made

579
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,520
From the monkey this province has come to be

580
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:32,380
La la la, it's the box, it's the spot

581
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:36,340
La la la, it's the box, it's the spot

582
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,160
So I'm ditching and hitching the ride

583
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,240
I got my seat just down

584
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,440
Here's my new room, where we go

585
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:46,020
To it go

586
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,800
1,600 years is not too long ago

587
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,740
I'm a nigga, I'm knocking on heaven's door

588
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:56,120
La la la, it's the box, it's the spot

589
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:59,960
La la la, it's the box, it's the spot

590
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,160
La la la

591
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,060
It's the box, it's the spot

592
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:07,900
La la la, it's the box, it's the spot

593
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:12,240
Walk through the gate

594
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,200
Welcome the creature you made

595
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,000
Embrace your discovery

596
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:27,700
It took a pinch of the pain

597
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:29,720
To make us rage for some days

598
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,540
And then it threw us away

599
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:32,360
La la la, it's the box, it's the spot

600
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,660
La la la, it's the box, it's the spot

601
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,660
And I was scouting the face

602
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,660
And simply counting the days

603
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:38,340
Until you squeezed my thumb

604
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:39,500
And blow us away

605
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:48,840
How much more time will last?

606
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,240
A list of all the ways

607
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,940
I've been found and found

608
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,760
I've been found and found

609
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,540
Remember, did you know?

610
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:19,720
I'm the best man in the field

611
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:22,980
I'm the first one who's in the field

612
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,520
I'm the man in the law

613
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:25,520


614
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:25,520


615
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:25,520


616
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:25,520


617
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:25,520


618
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:25,520


619
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,140
Now the gamers are omdatance

620
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,120
After all, murder onion

621
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:28,120


622
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,240
Got naked, hold on

623
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:30,640
Because tonight is the moment of truth

624
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:33,320
Planet X!

625
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,320
Planet X!

626
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:41,180
Planet X!

627
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:42,100
Planet X!

628
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,440
Planet X!

629
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:54,440
Dr. Steel did that.

630
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:57,980
Friends, a song called Planet X marks the spot.

631
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:03,040
And you might want to check out Dr. Steel's cool website.

632
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,980
There are some amazing videos and, yes, lectures on there, along with music and toys.

633
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,980
And that's at drsteel.com.

634
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:16,920
Steel, S-T-E-L.

635
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,400
drsteel.com for an amazing experience.

636
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,720
And before that, we heard Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence, Ed Lloyd, Mongoloid,

637
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:27,740
and yours truly.

638
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:32,300
On John Hell's show on Pirate Cat Radio in San Francisco,

639
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,700
A Season in Hell.

640
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:40,540
And before that, Radio Synesthesia from beautiful WCSB Cleveland

641
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:46,040
with Dr. Sinister, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Governor Rocknar, and others, I think.

642
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:50,500
Before that, some Puzzling Evidence show from KPFA Berkeley.

643
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:56,080
More from that can be had at kpfa.org

644
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,320
or see...

645
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:00,360
at liveringbrain.com,

646
00:34:00,660 --> 00:34:04,680
which is the website of Dr. Philo Drummond himself,

647
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,480
the co-subtowner of the Subgenius Foundation.

648
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:13,720
And now, my description of X-Day as delivered to the young pagans at Brushwood

649
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:17,220
who made me forget which pagan festival I was at.

650
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,980
First off, something I forgot to say.

651
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:23,180
Thank you all for coming to Starwood,

652
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:26,460
and thank all of you who were our winner star.

653
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:27,760
Thank you for coming to...

654
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,200
There's a reason I mixed up like this, believe me.

655
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:34,000
And it's because of Winterstar and Starwood.

656
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,140
And Burningstar and Woodman and so forth, you know.

657
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:41,620
There's...

658
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,640
Now I can't even remember...

659
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:47,180
Oh, yeah, so I was leading up to X-Day.

660
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:49,740
That's our Subgenius event.

661
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:54,520
It's a couple of weeks before Starwood at the same place out at Brushwood.

662
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:57,820
Every year we hope that maybe this year,

663
00:34:57,980 --> 00:35:01,960
it'll be 1998, and this will be the year that the saucers show up

664
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:06,180
and rupture all the subdues paying subgeniuses

665
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:08,560
into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

666
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:11,020
where we have eternal slack and whatever we want forever

667
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:14,160
and get to punish everybody we ever didn't like.

668
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,640
Which, unfortunately, in most cases, I'm afraid is going to be our fellow subgeniuses.

669
00:35:18,660 --> 00:35:21,720
So it will truly be a war in heaven at that point.

670
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:26,340
But somebody else pointed out that regarding X-Day,

671
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,960
that an X, after all...

672
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:30,880
It's just a cross that's been knocked over.

673
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,660
Not to me.

674
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,700
We don't have anything... Believe me.

675
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,820
Got nothing against Jesus.

676
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,120
Jesus is just all right with me.

677
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:45,700
It's always been his fan club that gave us...

678
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,480
And not just his fan club.

679
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:49,420
All those other guys.

680
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,920
Buddhist fan club.

681
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,600
Oh, I've got less ego than anybody here.

682
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,580
You know?

683
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,660
You can't get away from it.

684
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,020
It's fundamentalism.

685
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,580
We put the fun in fundamentalism.

686
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:07,520
We also put the duh in fundamentalism.

687
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,720
And we put the...

688
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:11,580
The hun.

689
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,480
The ism.

690
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:15,060
The mmm.

691
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,840
You name it.

692
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,020
We put it in the fundamentalism.

693
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:21,120
Over and over again.

694
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:25,980
Anyway, our friend Joyce Levine,

695
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,480
Reverend Joyce Levine,

696
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:27,960
who couldn't...

697
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,100
Wrote an X-Day poem.

698
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,880
I don't think she's ever even been to X-Day,

699
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:34,000
but she's been to Starwood,

700
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:34,940
and so she can imagine.

701
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:37,280
It's just a smaller,

702
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:39,820
much smaller Starwood,

703
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:43,160
where everybody...

704
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,620
Like a science fiction convention,

705
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,040
only they believe a different kind of science fiction.

706
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,000
Here's the poem.

707
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,800
Bare-breasted ladies run amok.

708
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,840
Seems they came by pickup truck.

709
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,860
From town,

710
00:36:57,980 --> 00:36:59,420
we did not know exist.

711
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,600
It's slack time here on Mother Earth.

712
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:05,060
All beings celebrate your birth.

713
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,000
She gave this to me on my birthday.

714
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,300
Meteors fly across the night.

715
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,140
Cicadas sing with all their might.

716
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,140
From a lounge chair,

717
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,160
take it in

718
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,620
with a satisfied, dazzled grin.

719
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:24,620
I just thought that was a sweet X-Day poem,

720
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,860
especially since it starts with bare-breasted ladies.

721
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,760
That always gets me.

722
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,480
You know, I waited for somebody to say,

723
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:31,620
Bob.

724
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,660
X-Days are coming.

725
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:37,120
So, can a caller call in with a credit card number

726
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,220
and become ordained right here on the air?

727
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,240
Yes, although I...

728
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,260
Man, yelling your credit card

729
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:46,920
and expiration date over public airwaves.

730
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,100
Well, we'll max it out before anyone else can.

731
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:49,720
We're ready.

732
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,160
No, that's okay.

733
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:54,460
No, we're fine.

734
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:55,480
I wish...

735
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:03,100
I hear King of Slash Bill T. Miller in the background

736
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,680
singing one of his X-Day songs.

737
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,060
We have a whole CD collection of songs about X-Day.

738
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,780
It's like 30 different songs

739
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,540
in every style imaginable.

740
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:18,600
I wrote one.

741
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,460
How do we find them?

742
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,460
How do we get them?

743
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,820
Subgenius.com!

744
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:26,780

745
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,120

Subgenius.com!

749
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,240


750
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,660
Thank heaven for that.

751
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,980
X-Days are coming!

752
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,660
We don't actually sell many CDs,

753
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:45,060
and it may be because we give away

754
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:47,260
so much of the truth on the internet.

755
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,640
You can download

756
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,680
the Subgenius Hour of Slack

757
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,640
weekly show.

758
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:54,280
In fact, that's probably what you did to hear this

759
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,480
time to think about it.

760
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:58,680
Yes.

761
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:03,960
You can download the Puzzling Evidence show from Berkeley.

762
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:08,200
You can download the Suzy the Floozy show.

763
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:14,620
Bob's Slacktime Funhouse from WREK.org in Atlanta.

764
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,040
On Puzzling Evidence, you'll be interested to know that one X-Day porn,

765
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,580
when the rest of us were up at Brushwood,

766
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:27,260
some subgenius in Dallas went to Dealey Plaza.

767
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:33,040
It was in the late 90s, July 5th at 7 a.m.

768
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:41,840
And there was a nude woman frolicking around on the grassy knoll area.

769
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,480
Very briefly.

770
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,840
They even got a photograph of her.

771
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:48,200
They were just three nerds.

772
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,220
It's X-Day.

773
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,700
Let's go to Dealey Plaza.

774
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,300
Oh, my God.

775
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:54,740
There's a sex goddess running around over there.

776
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:56,120
Maybe this is X-Day.

777
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:56,820
Yeah.

778
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:59,960
So they followed her to the ship, I hope.

779
00:40:00,040 --> 00:40:03,480
That's the kind of thing you see in Los Angeles at dawn all the time.

780
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,780
In fact, the last time I was there, that's what I saw.

781
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:10,180
Several naked women stumbling around the streets.

782
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:14,700
Well, little callers, I don't know if you understand that if a bomb dropped on Berkeley right now,

783
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:17,780
the top of the subgenius church would just disappear.

784
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,780
And finally, it would start making some money.

785
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:23,780
Okay, here's the money raining down from the sky.

786
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,800
Look how pretty it is.

787
00:40:26,020 --> 00:40:26,920
Oh, sorry.

788
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:27,880
See it twinkle?

789
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,520
It's sparkle.

790
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:33,340
But it's highly toxic to handle.

791
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:35,960
I can't hold my money.

792
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,920
It'll burn right through.

793
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,780
The ultimate X-Day nightmare.

794
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:48,680
The tribulation money rains from the sky, and it's made of acid that burns through your skin.

795
00:40:49,060 --> 00:40:51,960
People are so desperate that they grab it anyway.

796
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:56,460
I get laid, I drink a beer.

797
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:57,860
And then it burns.

798
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,180
And Interviewer says,

799
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,180


800
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,180


801
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,180


802
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:58,340
تحِظُمَ

803
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:03,420
and some reason to make the changes.

804
00:41:03,440 --> 00:41:10,200
And want toeled it.

805
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:26,720
And ask to hire somebody to prepare me for唉 потрί۔

806
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,420
Oh, that was a good show.

807
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,320
Camp Malarkey is right over there.

808
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:33,720
What are we having at Malarkey's show?

809
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:35,660
Is he still on the air here?

810
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:39,360
The Bunch of Malarkey show?

811
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:40,240
No, I...

812
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,620
You took over that slot.

813
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,120
Yeah, I've been a long time since those...

814
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,920
The country of Kroistan.

815
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:49,160
Conan!

816
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,100
What is best in life?

817
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,740
To crush your enemies,

818
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,740
see them driven before you,

819
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,920
and to hear the lamentation of the women.

820
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:57,900
That is it!

821
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:02,140
At X-Day, of course, we have symbolic auctions

822
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:04,800
where we enact this ritual among ourselves,

823
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,360
the inner subgeniuses.

824
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:12,240
But that is an overt form of the ordinary progressive sales

825
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,460
which has to be made

826
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:18,260
as part of the existing subgenius journey.

827
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:23,920
There are actual flesh auctions at X-Day.

828
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,400
Yes.

829
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,740
And auctions of all kinds of bulldada,

830
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:32,460
kitsch...

831
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:32,940
Great stuff.

832
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:33,500
Yeah.

833
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,920
Complete Jack Chick comic collections.

834
00:42:38,140 --> 00:42:40,400
By the way, did you all know that

835
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,260
there is a book about Jack Chick comics?

836
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:46,240
By Kurt Kirsteiner.

837
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:46,640
Right.

838
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:49,040
By subgenius...

839
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,560
Nazi subgenius.

840
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:51,660
And Papa Joe Mama.

841
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:52,460
Yes.

842
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,720
They infiltrated Jack Chick...

843
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,520
Jack Chick's headquarters got to know Jack Chick himself.

844
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:00,720
They went to the war room where the comics are created.

845
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:01,260
Where is that?

846
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:03,560
In Chino, California.

847
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:09,980
And in fact, Jack Chick promised our friends

848
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:15,000
that he would get around to doing an anti-subgenius pamphlet

849
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:20,720
as soon as he finishes his huge life work that he's still on.

850
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,180
He's like 90 years old.

851
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:23,400
What's the work he's working on?

852
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:24,640
Paintings.

853
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:24,720
Paintings.

854
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:25,980
He's illustrating the Bible.

855
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:30,000
He had a movie that they were working on,

856
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:31,740
which is essentially kinesthesis,

857
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,500
but it had to do with huge paintings created by

858
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:38,580
the good artist who works at Chick things,

859
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:39,660
who's a black guy.

860
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:40,760
I forget his name.

861
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:41,600
Oh, Fred Carter.

862
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:42,800
That's his name.

863
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:46,760
He's made these giant paintings of Eve in the Garden of Eden and so on.

864
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:50,080
Then they've photographed them and done kinesthesis

865
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:52,520
and they have a movie that's ready to come out.

866
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,440
Or maybe it is out.

867
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:54,700
Among the...

868
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,560
The devotees of Jack Chick.

869
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,300
Oh, it is out.

870
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:02,020
Yeah, if you can find information about this great Jack Chick book,

871
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,240
which, by the way...

872
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,940
It's called The Unofficial Jack T. Chick.

873
00:44:08,140 --> 00:44:14,080
That's available from monsterwax.com, I believe.

874
00:44:15,380 --> 00:44:16,180
Monsterwax, yes.

875
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:16,660
Yeah.

876
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:21,800
I think if you do just a search on the one word monsterwax,

877
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:23,940
you would certainly immediately get...

878
00:44:24,700 --> 00:44:27,100
It's like candle wax, but it's monster...

879
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:27,880
But with monsters.

880
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,820
Monster wax.

881
00:44:30,980 --> 00:44:37,200
Well, Dr. Hal, I can't wait to bring you into X-Day this next year

882
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:41,780
on those plane flights we always get you that hover around Philadelphia for 10 hours.

883
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:43,060
Those clean and simple flights.

884
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:46,880
Yeah, well, Dr. Hal writes great songs when he's stuck in airports

885
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:51,200
and hovering in planes for hours and days.

886
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:51,980
Tis so.

887
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:54,240
I've got to get them all recorded.

888
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,920
Recorded or noted or something or other.

889
00:44:56,240 --> 00:45:02,580
My problem is we've got to convince Governor Rocknar to pay your way to X-Day and Amsterdam every year.

890
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:04,120
Going back to Amsterdam?

891
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:06,040
Oh, he's already planned that.

892
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,240
How about you?

893
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,000
I can't plan that sort of thing.

894
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,340
It can't be an annual plan?

895
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,000
Milo's going.

896
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,420
On my epitaph.

897
00:45:16,080 --> 00:45:19,780
Here lies an atheist, all dressed up and no place to go.

898
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:22,180
That's an old chestnut.

899
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:23,720
How about this one?

900
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:29,040
Remember, man, as you walk by, as you are now, so once was I.

901
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:31,780
As I am now, so shall you be.

902
00:45:31,960 --> 00:45:33,960
Remember this and follow me.

903
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:39,380
And on this grave, you then may be.

904
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,300
On the tombstone next to it, it says,

905
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:47,360
To follow you, I'll not consent until I know which way you went.

906
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:48,820
Woo-hoo!

907
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:49,620
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

908
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:52,960
Those clever Englishters.

909
00:45:52,960 --> 00:46:00,460
So now that the writer's strike is on, you guys do the show by just queuing up pages on the internet full of funny quotes?

910
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:05,220
What did you do, Google funny tombstone quotes?

911
00:46:05,500 --> 00:46:06,480
Funny epitaph.

912
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,840
Oh, that's right, epitaph, that's the word.

913
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:15,660
Are you planning anything extra special for X-Day this year?

914
00:46:15,820 --> 00:46:19,440
Yes, the world will be destroyed by the save.

915
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,140
Really?

916
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,000
This time?

917
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:22,360
Yes.

918
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:27,420
Well, some July 5th, that's going to happen, and maybe this is 1998.

919
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:28,420
I didn't know, I didn't even know that.

920
00:46:28,420 --> 00:46:29,200
That's right, it has to be.

921
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:31,540
Maybe tomorrow is July 5th, 1998.

922
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,680
Are you ready?

923
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:36,480
That's the big question, of course.

924
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:43,520
Hey, Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along?

925
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:46,020
I won't do anything wrong.

926
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:52,420
Hey, Mr. Spaceman, won't you please take me along?

927
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:53,740
Before you ride.

928
00:46:57,660 --> 00:47:05,880
Before you ride.

929
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,300
Oh, yeah.

930
00:47:10,880 --> 00:47:18,900
My name is Chaz, and I'm broadcasting you tonight from my little holding cell here.

931
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:22,080
All quarantined.

932
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,680
All strapped in my suit.

933
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,220
Pressure suit's all pressured up.

934
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:30,340
Yeah.

935
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:32,420
It's here.

936
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:39,640
The ship is waiting, hissing away, spewing out its little steam.

937
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,480
Waiting for the moment.

938
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,500
The final countdown.

939
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:49,100
And that's where we're at.

940
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:52,000
Just hours away from...

941
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:53,880
The final hour.

942
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:56,320
The final minute.

943
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,100
The final second.

944
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,240
And...

945
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:01,680
X-Day.

946
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,080
Thought I'd never get here.

947
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,180
It's kind of late now.

948
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:13,880
We're there.

949
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,820
There's nothing else to do.

950
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,520
Just sit.

951
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:21,220
Look out the window.

952
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:21,860
Oh.

953
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,760
And wait for the light.

954
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:38,760
And wait for the light.

955
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:44,600
Is your pleasure ship hovering above?

956
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,620
Waiting for the final hours to pass?

957
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,100
Yes.

958
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,140
Is your alien sex goddess waiting for you

959
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:57,780
somewhere?

960
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:01,920
In Eurasia blue.

961
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:06,640
My end.

962
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,180
We'll see you.

963
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:11,060
Goodbye, w comentários and you called off.

964
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:12,520
Goodbye.

965
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:14,840
I gotta go.

966
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:15,260
Into space.

967
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:17,080
To know.

968
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:22,940
The量 that there were.

969
00:49:22,940 --> 00:49:22,940

997
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:31,120
Felix

998
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:31,520
selenium

999
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,320

1001
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:34,680
mint

1002
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,520
pipette

1003
00:52:40,520 --> 00:52:44,660
within an hour

1004
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:48,360
ens

1005
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,960
major market broadcast radio bleep-o.

1006
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:53,300
There are those of us that...

1007
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:56,260
I would say major disappointment might be the word used,

1008
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:59,680
but he is regressing enough to grow an awful lot of body hair.

1009
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,760
I mean, I don't know if his voice is getting higher because of the operation or...

1010
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:06,100
There was major disappointment and there was General Electric.

1011
00:53:06,540 --> 00:53:09,820
Oh, I thought you were going to refer to the guy's erection again.

1012
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:11,020
And then there was that girl, Bob.

1013
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:11,840
Bob.

1014
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:16,520
Just like a penguin in bondage, boy.

1015
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:21,780
No, on X-Day, Neegie will return to us all

1016
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:24,480
the greatest tapes that we ever recorded,

1017
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,340
which he has been keeping in...

1018
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,780
Praise the Neegie.

1019
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:29,040
Oh, God, that's so good.

1020
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:33,620
Neegie has been keeping all of our lost recordings

1021
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:35,240
in a special vault.

1022
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,780
You hear that, Bob?

1023
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:38,740
Those will all be returned to us on X-Day.

1024
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,060
Oh, that's so glorious.

1025
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:43,780
Shainer will get his 8mm films back.

1026
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:45,420
Oh, this is so good.

1027
00:53:45,420 --> 00:53:46,480
You know, your first...

1028
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:47,580
Your first show will come back.

1029
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:48,060
I'll...

1030
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:51,860
Actually, I never did lose any.

1031
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:54,980
Will I get those videos that I erased by accident back?

1032
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,980
As long as you saw them, Bill.

1033
00:53:57,320 --> 00:53:58,040
Things that...

1034
00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:58,840
I mean...

1035
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:01,520
Everything I've ever seen.

1036
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:03,260
You know, that you never got around to looking at.

1037
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:03,820
Uh-huh.

1038
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:07,360
Even if I've only seen it for a fraction of a second.

1039
00:54:07,560 --> 00:54:08,040
What about events that I've never taped that never were taped?

1040
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:10,380
There's a thing called the new program.

1041
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,100
That you imagined very vividly doing...

1042
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:13,260
This is too damn confusing.

1043
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:13,740
I'm getting out of here.

1044
00:54:13,740 --> 00:54:14,600
...will then be done.

1045
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,460
They will have been done.

1046
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:18,580
When you want to do a wonderful new show,

1047
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,780
that show will materialize in your hand as a tape.

1048
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:22,700
Yeah, the new program.

1049
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:26,200
Click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click.

1050
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:26,580
Ooh.

1051
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,820
The hair escaping from my hands.

1052
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:35,960
The hair escaping from my hands.

1053
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:43,120
My hands are gripping, but they're slipping.

1054
00:54:43,560 --> 00:54:46,120
And they're gripping, but...

1055
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:47,100
I'm tripping.

1056
00:54:48,740 --> 00:54:49,380
Tripping.

1057
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:50,460
Tripping indeed.

1058
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:56,200
Friends, the late Chaz Smith, or maybe we should say the early Professor Chaz Smith,

1059
00:54:56,360 --> 00:55:01,000
because he ended up boarding the escape vessels early ahead of the rest of us.

1060
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:07,960
He edited all that, taken from his ESO radio shows on WCSB Cleveland,

1061
00:55:08,020 --> 00:55:12,640
and I think most of that was from the conspiracy year 1998.

1062
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:15,460
Con version, anyway.

1063
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,220
Obviously.

1064
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,280
Not a real ex-day.

1065
00:55:17,380 --> 00:55:22,800
The background music, what you're hearing now, is by the Rudy Schwartz Project.

1066
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,760
This has been Hour of Slack, number 1150.

1067
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,200
Praise Bob, and praise K-Rob.

1068
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:38,860
And now, friends, let us go back to the end of the end of 2007's season in hell.

1069
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,880
They said we were going to go to hell.

1070
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,760
What choice did we have but to start our own religion?

1071
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,260
And our own hell.

1072
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:51,460
Which is going to be far more comfortable than one so often described.

1073
00:55:51,840 --> 00:55:53,720
Spend more than a season in hell.

1074
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:57,940
It hasn't been so bad, has it, for the past four hours?

1075
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:01,400
Gone rather fast, actually, as the show seems to do.

1076
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:06,460
Next week, I'm actually having chiropractors on.

1077
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,560
And they're all going to adjust me.

1078
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:11,400
They'll give you a hands-on...

1079
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:16,100
Well, you better have a couple of body mics so they can hear that cracking,

1080
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:17,640
the spars and timbers.

1081
00:56:17,660 --> 00:56:18,320
That's the idea.

1082
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:20,040
Ship at sea in a storm.

1083
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,740
Get some contact mics going in.

1084
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,160
I think that'd be a great idea.

1085
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:26,220
Oh, and you'll have to follow that up with acupuncturists.

1086
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:27,240
Yes, yes.

1087
00:56:27,260 --> 00:56:31,240
There you have the sound effect of the whistle of escaping gas.

1088
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:33,660
Essence, as the tiny needles.

1089
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:35,380
What a sensation.

1090
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:38,340
You'd have to have a pretty sensitive mic for that, wouldn't you?

1091
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:40,180
Oh, it's a special effect.

1092
00:56:40,520 --> 00:56:40,740
Yeah.

1093
00:56:40,960 --> 00:56:42,780
Just to pipe in the sound effect.

1094
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:46,180
Now, last ex-day, remember, we were doing radio.

1095
00:56:46,180 --> 00:56:48,940
Radio from on stage, outdoors at this campground.

1096
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:54,360
A spider suddenly was crawling across Dr. Howell's microphone.

1097
00:56:54,860 --> 00:56:55,360
Yes.

1098
00:56:55,820 --> 00:57:00,820
And we were able to turn it up enough that you could hear his tiny footsteps across the...

1099
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,960
Fascinating.

1100
00:57:02,240 --> 00:57:03,600
Those mics are sensitive.

1101
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:06,820
And it was an exceptionally large and clumsy spider.

1102
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,860
We have the club-footed thing.

1103
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,280
Our final minutes.

1104
00:57:13,060 --> 00:57:14,060
Oh, no.

1105
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:14,780
Thank you.

1106
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:15,820
Spiders on microphones.

1107
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:17,660
Here at Pirate Cat Radio.

1108
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:22,240
We're harmed during the making of this radio motion picture.

1109
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:26,240
I'd like to thank Reverend Ivan Stang for coming in this evening.

1110
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:28,240
Say thank you, Stang.

1111
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:33,160
Dr. Howell for coming down on a...

1112
00:57:33,160 --> 00:57:33,800
Your two-time...

1113
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:34,420
On a night off.

1114
00:57:34,540 --> 00:57:35,040
Your two-time.

1115
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:41,360
Lloyd Mongoloid for stepping in two weeks in a row after a very, very busy show on Saturday nights.

1116
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:42,880
I'm going to be here every week.

1117
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:44,300
Perfect.

1118
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,980
I didn't explain that to you.

1119
00:57:45,980 --> 00:57:46,060
I know.

1120
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,600
We'll make sure you get adjusted as well next week.

1121
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:53,140
Puzzling evidence documenting the entire evening.

1122
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,900
K-Rob on the aural stimulants.

1123
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:05,200
And we got about two more minutes before they literally force us off the air.

1124
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:13,140
Well, I hope the subgenius presentation you've heard tonight hasn't been confusing or off-putting.

1125
00:58:13,660 --> 00:58:15,840
Remember, we're always trying to improve.

1126
00:58:15,840 --> 00:58:20,040
We're trying to improve our presentation for you and your comfort.

1127
00:58:21,420 --> 00:58:23,900
What do you see in the upcoming year for the church?

1128
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:35,160
Well, various hagiographical contributions, canonizations, ascension to higher planes of being and feeling.

1129
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:39,360
And of course, money flowing in like a tidal wave.

1130
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:42,220
You think this X-Day might be the X-Day?

1131
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:44,640
Well, we always feel that.

1132
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,100
We're always playing at X-Day.

1133
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:50,260
Playing at X-Day?

1134
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:50,340
Ooh.

1135
00:58:50,780 --> 00:58:51,800
You'll get yours.

1136
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,060
You got 30 seconds to answer.

1137
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:53,300
Go.

1138
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:53,880
Yeah.

1139
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,540
Well, I guess it'll be the last show.

1140
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:57,520
Last show here.

1141
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:58,140
You'll have to wait.

1142
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,320
Last show on Planet Earth.

1143
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,960
We'll be there to greet the sex gods.

1144
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,580
Thanks for tuning in, ladies and gentlemen.

1145
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:03,940
A Season of Hell with John Hell.

1146
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:04,700
See you next week.

1147
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,540
Reverend Ivan Steng, Dr. Howell, Lloyd Monga, Lloyd.

1148
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:08,180
Puzzling evidence.

1149
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:08,880
K-Rob.

1150
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:10,780
Thanks, K-Rob.

1151
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:12,860
Thanks, K-Rob.

1152
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:13,700
Thanks, K-Rob.

1153
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:14,740
Thanks, K-Rob.

1154
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:15,820
Thanks, K-Rob.

1155
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:15,820


1156
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:15,820


1157
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:15,820


1158
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:24,800
Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely, I reach over and touch it.

1159
00:59:25,420 --> 00:59:27,560
Then it doesn't seem so lonely anymore.
