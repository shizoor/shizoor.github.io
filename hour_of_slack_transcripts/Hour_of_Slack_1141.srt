1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:17,020
Ah, yes dear friends, this is in fact Hour of Slack number 1141, which is a rerun of

2
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:27,620
Hour of Slack number 33 from early July of 1986, when I had just returned from six weeks

3
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:35,780
in China and Japan on a missionary trip. Yeah, that's it. And this was probably the last

4
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:43,840
show with Reverend Buck Naked as a co-host, because after he ran the show for the six

5
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,400
weeks that I was gone, when I returned to the station, the managers told me that it

6
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:56,280
was either Buck goes or all of Hour of Slack goes. And so went Buck. Anyway, to repeat,

7
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,340
friends, the material...

8
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:04,420
The material in this show is from when I was working for Reverend Mickey Grant on the film

9
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:12,920
China Run. I left China exactly three years before the Tiananmen Square Massacre, by the

10
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:20,480
way. Exactly three years. While I was there, the Chernobyl Russian nuclear reactor meltdown

11
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,160
happened, which made things even more interesting. But now let us continue back into the year

12
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:26,940
of 1980.

13
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,880
18 into 86.

14
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:37,120
And it's true, man, I just got a taste. But it was a thrill, baby. You really wake up

15
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:45,020
when you're treading that tightrope of danger, international intrigue.

16
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,400
You know what I mean?

17
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:48,980
Yeah.

18
00:01:49,420 --> 00:01:50,980
I'm not sure how many of you have heard of the show.

19
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:51,480
I don't know.

20
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:51,760
I don't know.

21
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,460
I don't know.

22
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:57,260
.

23
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,880
Damn, righty-o.

24
00:01:59,120 --> 00:01:59,800
.

25
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:02,740
.

26
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,220
The emperor is really

27
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:09,440
roadblocked.

28
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:13,500
He is thrown and sawed barefoot on the road.

29
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,620
I could never hold on myself, you know.

30
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,540
Ha ha.

31
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:20,860
.

32
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:20,860


33
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,560
Ha ha ha.

34
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,460
Thanksgiving.

35
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:24,840
.

36
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,080
campaign .

37
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,920
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

38
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:26,920


39
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:26,920


40
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:26,920


41
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:47,440
I'm sitting here watching TV in China,

42
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:52,120
and I'll tell you, we've been making these jokes

43
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,720
about how it's been 1984 since 1953 for a long time.

44
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:59,500
And I'm almost ashamed of myself

45
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:01,920
for making those kind of jokes about the U.S. now

46
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,600
because I didn't really know how true it was here.

47
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,700
And it has been 1984 since 1953 here.

48
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,160
Repent. Quit your job. Slack off.

49
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:22,880
Driven to the brink of false sanity

50
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,340
by the conspiracy's false reality,

51
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:30,180
and the pressure of a crumbling world,

52
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:33,780
then this may be for you.

53
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,440
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

54
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,740
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

55
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,840
Welcome, dear friends.

56
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:56,380
Yes.

57
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,100
Welcome, dear friends.

58
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,700
Welcome, dear friends.

59
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,360
Welcome, dear friends,

60
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,860
to the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

61
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,440
With reverence, I will stand and pass the bag naked.

62
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:17,960
This is your announcer,

63
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,300
Chris Ford.

64
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:24,640
Yes.

65
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:30,320
Yes, praise Bob, dear friends.

66
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,460
Come on, send your pledges in.

67
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:31,960
You made your commitment.

68
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,560
Now follow through.

69
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:33,200
Thank you very much.

70
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,220
Well, welcome back, friends.

71
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,580
And...

72
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,200
I've got a couple of special guests with me.

73
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,640
I'm Pastor Buck Naked, your announcer.

74
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,300
And here with me in the studio,

75
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:04,700
I've got the Spider Deacon, Jim,

76
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,420
and Reverend Ivan Stang.

77
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:08,520
Ah, yes, dear friends.

78
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:10,820
Back from the missionary trip to Red China.

79
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,780
I'm back, and I'm beautiful.

80
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:16,580
Praise Buddha.

81
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,020
And, ah, yes, friends.

82
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:18,900
Praise Buddha.

83
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,880
Back from mighty...

84
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,960
Praise Buddha.

85
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,400
We're back once again from mighty...

86
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,560
How come I'm making up my mind?

87
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,400
I'm going to play some mighty red Chinese music here.

88
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:30,100
I'm going to stick this in this other receptacle

89
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,640
and get this booger going.

90
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,740
Ah, yes.

91
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:39,380
Oh, listen to that, friends.

92
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,960
Beautiful tune given to me by a taxi driver in Beijing.

93
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:44,620
Ah.

94
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,780
Them were the days.

95
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,860
Leaving the Friendship Hotel in China.

96
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,080
Friends, I must say that Bob guided our hands

97
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,040
while, ah,

98
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:57,000
we were on our missionary tour of China.

99
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,720
He was instrumental in us getting the great shipment

100
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,640
of Habba Frop Zipulops out of Tibet.

101
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:08,580
Friends, you think it's easy getting that Frop out of Tibet,

102
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:12,040
but, ah, you know, China is the only way to get in there now.

103
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:17,080
We had to get 10,000 copies of the book of the subgenius

104
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:21,520
smuggled into China and 10,000 tons of Habba Frop Zipulops

105
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,520
out of Lhasa and through customs.

106
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,500
Friends, it's espionage.

107
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:28,680
It was dangerous work.

108
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,980
At times, we ministers had to pretend we were brain surgeons.

109
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,660
We had to pretend we were filmmakers, prisoners of war.

110
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,220
And, you know, compared to all that tightrope of danger,

111
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:43,240
it's mighty dull to be back here in Dallas.

112
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,860
Don't you agree, Buck?

113
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,700
Yeah, pretty much.

114
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:50,800
I haven't been out of the country since the last of my

115
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:50,920
.

116
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:53,360
Oh, they're doing good in Malaysia.

117
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,900
We ran into several students.

118
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:00,380
Some of the new zombies that have come out of Dobbs Town, the slack camps.

119
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,920
Friends, it was hard to leave China.

120
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,880
We had such a successful voyage there.

121
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:09,380
That vast, vast world of strange people.

122
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:11,060
And that's what's so great about them.

123
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,840
They're so strange.

124
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,300
I saw a good old DDT agent back there in Malaysia.

125
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,900
Speaking of strange.

126
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,520
Yeah, he was, I saw him.

127
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,280
He had a good operation.

128
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,380
He came through.

129
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:21,260
He had his operation.

130
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,340
He's doing better now.

131
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,880
Well, they can't do that.

132
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:24,880


133
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:25,980
I'll heal up after a while.

134
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:28,240
I'll have a scar on my head next time you see me, Buck.

135
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,780
As a matter of fact, made a special deal.

136
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:39,100
But yes, I'm full of sea slug, eel, octopus, ox tail dinners, live baby mice.

137
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,060
That's the best one.

138
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,100
We couldn't afford the monkey brain.

139
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,380
You know, they eat monkey brain live.

140
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,900
The monkey's head is stuck through a hole in the table, and he's sitting there in utmost

141
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,500
terror.

142
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:54,760
And they take the cleaver and hack the top of his head off.

143
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:54,860
Yeah.

144
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,400
And then everybody takes their chopsticks and goes at that still thinking brain.

145
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:04,180
I mean, they don't even do it with the electric saw like they do in Malaysia?

146
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:04,920
No, no, no.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:05,700
This is restaurants.

148
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,500
These aren't people.

149
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,140
These are monkeys.

150
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,240
No, I know.

151
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,220
In Malaysia, it's people.

152
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:12,360
So you have to be a lot more careful when you're eating, you know, sucking down some

153
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,820
brain, sucking some soul down.

154
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,460
Damn good old brains.

155
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:23,720
But friends, you know, most Chinese, a quarter of the world, a billion people, they don't

156
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,660
even know about Bob.

157
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,720
Or they didn't until we were there.

158
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,200
But now, friends, there are five devout subgeni, including our new announcer that you heard

159
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,860
a little earlier, Dr. Li Jing, the Pope of all China.

160
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,640
And we hope to get here on the show at some point.

161
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,000
The high priestess of all Asia, Li Yan.

162
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,240
You'll like Li Yan, Buck.

163
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,580
But yes, friends, these are some of the top folks in China.

164
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:54,680
And that's all it really takes to spread the virus of our belief system throughout that

165
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,480
mere one billion people.

166
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:03,480
So our new gang of four or five subgeniuses will be listening to this tape on Voice of

167
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,460
America on their shortwave.

168
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,820
So hello to Zhang Ping and Zhang Laoshi.

169
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,400
You like them too, Buck.

170
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:13,020
We've got the best kind of missionaries there.

171
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:18,160
We tried to get some signals out to the subgenius faithful in the States, but I believe we were

172
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,640
being scrambled by the Russians.

173
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,660
And also, we had to deal with the amazing Chernobyl nuclear explosion.

174
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


175
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


176
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


177
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


178
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


179
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


180
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


181
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


182
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


183
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


184
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


185
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


186
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


187
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,180
And so we're going to be doing a little experiment that we helped conduct out there.

188
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,940
So how's it been going here, Buck?

189
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:35,660
I understand we've had an incredible new type of crank caller.

190
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:41,360
Yes, Mr. PP is our sort of remote co-host now.

191
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,100
We officially installed him.

192
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,000
He sort of installed himself over the last month or two.

193
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:49,600
They tend to do that, you know, after a while.

194
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,980
We had to replace Ronald, let's put it that way.

195
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:54,380
We had to replace Ronald, let's put it that way.

196
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:54,660
We had to replace Ronald, let's put it that way.

197
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:54,660


198
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,000
I don't get it.

199
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,340
You'll get it.

200
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,020
Okay.

201
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:04,940
Well, you know, friends, the Chinese, most of them are actually not communists, we found

202
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:05,280
out.

203
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,140
They're mere, like you or me, they're not dupes.

204
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:12,620
They're mere victims of that hideous conspiracy that covers the globe.

205
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,400
And I'm afraid one thing I learned there is that the conspiracy has a much tighter grip

206
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,760
on China than it does on the US.

207
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:21,480
I probably should have known that already.

208
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:24,660
But you know, you get about 8,000 miles out of China.

209
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:24,660


210
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:27,580
You get about 8,000 miles out of town, Buck, and you start to realize just how much slack

211
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,720
you actually had.

212
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:33,680
I'd be put into a work camp for doing this show for one night in China.

213
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:35,260
Yes, you would.

214
00:10:35,300 --> 00:10:36,820
And you wouldn't last five minutes.

215
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:38,020
Oh, I don't know.

216
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,600
I'm sneakier than you think.

217
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,760
But look, I also brought, we've also brought our missionary here, a Christian missionary

218
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,440
named Mr. Jim Ryan, and he's here with us too.

219
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,320
Awesome.

220
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:54,580
And Jim, so how have you been doing trying to Christianize the masses out there?

221
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:54,640
Trying to Christianize the masses out there.

222
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:54,640


223
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:54,640


224
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:54,880
Jim?

225
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,920
Pastor Buck, I've had some problems.

226
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,260
First of all, they keep throwing bottles at me, and I've been throwing them back at them,

227
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,160
and they just do not understand the word of Bob there.

228
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:09,680
Occasionally, they break.

229
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,200
No, but what about the word of Christ?

230
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:15,220
Like I was talking to you on the phone a little while ago, Stang, and you were telling me

231
00:11:15,220 --> 00:11:18,780
that the Chinese are getting pretty mad at the Christian missionaries.

232
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:20,500
Could you tell me anything about this at all?

233
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,560
That's to me the most interesting part of this interview.

234
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,620
Well, as I said, I'm a Christian.

235
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:31,020
As I understand it, actually, the Chinese are very suspicious of particularly Christian

236
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:36,420
missionaries because they've done so much spy work for the Goh Men Dong over the years,

237
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,380
and the Japanese, and all the other people that ever invaded China, and not to mention

238
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:44,140
you, me, and all of our listeners.

239
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:48,200
So there's some suspicion now.

240
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,080
It's not true that there's no church allowed in China.

241
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,880
In fact, we...

242
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,600
On our secret camera...

243
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:54,600


244
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:57,320
On our camera, we have film of a Catholic Chinese church.

245
00:11:57,420 --> 00:12:00,100
The only difference is they can't obey the Pope of Rome.

246
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,480
They have to obey the Pope of China, who was never...

247
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:06,040
There never has been one until our visit there.

248
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:06,760
And so now...

249
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,500
The Italians are real upset about this, I hear.

250
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,260
Oh, absolutely.

251
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:09,960
I keep hearing that.

252
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:10,700
Oh, of course.

253
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,680
I'm just wondering why we don't get anything on cassette one up there.

254
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,860
Everything says...

255
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,880
Oh, don't worry about cassette one.

256
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,500
It's just...

257
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,140
Okay, well...

258
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,680
It's just a maniac.

259
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,780
Anyway, this is cassette two, so...

260
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,220
Yeah.

261
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:22,860
Okay.

262
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,600
Okay.

263
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:25,580
Well, friends, I understand.

264
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:29,540
You were doing something a couple of weeks ago about, is Reverend Tseng really in China

265
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,800
or is this a fake?

266
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,480
And somebody called up and said that...

267
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:32,840
Right.

268
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:34,300
...they saw me downtown.

269
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,700
Well, you know, we like to keep things sort of under our hat on the hour of Slack Radio

270
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,060
Ministry.

271
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:45,560
And when we send one of our people abroad, we're not gonna tell you until he comes back

272
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:49,180
because, well, look what happened to Sternow.

273
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,400
Look what happened to Sternow.

274
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:52,760
As a matter of fact, friends, there's all sorts of ways you can...

275
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,500
You go off for a little while.

276
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:54,600
Yeah.

277
00:12:54,620 --> 00:12:56,940
You go off for a little while and, well, if you say the wrong thing in some of these

278
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,540
countries, there's an operation they can do with like a...almost just a fingernail file

279
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,340
under the eyelid without damaging the optic nerve.

280
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:07,700
They can actually give you a prefrontal lobotomy.

281
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,500
And I met a couple of students from Nairobi who, by the way, were into Dr. Maka Doody,

282
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,340
I might add.

283
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:14,800
They knew him?

284
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:15,300
Oh, my.

285
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:15,340
Yes.

286
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:15,680
They knew him?

287
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:15,920
In Nairobi.

288
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,460
They knew the subgenius saint, Dr. Maka Doody.

289
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:18,620
Wow.

290
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:19,040
Wow.

291
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:19,540
And...

292
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,800
Hey, you were in Nairobi or were...

293
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,440
No, I was in the Friendship Bar of the Friendship Hotel in Beijing, but that place

294
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,840
is full of African students.

295
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,200
They're only allowed foreigners, right?

296
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:28,740
No, no, no.

297
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:32,320
We had Chinese friends eating in there with us and so forth.

298
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,720
No kidding.

299
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,160
Okay.

300
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,480
Oh, yeah.

301
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,000
It's open, man.

302
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:36,120
It's real open.

303
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:39,520
As long as you're a foreigner, you can almost do as you please.

304
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,880
You can get all...if you can get the permits.

305
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:43,140
Now, if you're Chinese, that's a little different.

306
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,380
If you don't get into college with the best grades in your high school, well, then they'll

307
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:52,180
give you a job, and once you're in that job, they keep you in that job.

308
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:52,460
Right.

309
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:52,560
Of course.

310
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:57,700
You can't quit, and you can't be fired either, so you're going to get paid no matter what.

311
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,780
So, friends, you're wondering what the Hour of Slack is all about.

312
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:00,500
Yeah.

313
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:04,080
Yeah, well, you can tell we've really gone communist since...

314
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:04,620
God almighty.

315
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,160
Well, I'll tell you what.

316
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:09,760
Talking about missionaries, this is a tape I just discovered on the way over here.

317
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:10,980
Don't turn it on yet.

318
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,000
This is the way you turn people on to Bob.

319
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,760
Now, see, this is a different kind of religion.

320
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,380
We don't have to be that hard sell.

321
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,900
We choose to be, but we don't have to be.

322
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:24,420
Now, when I left China, we had a good start.

323
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:31,200
There's a billion people there to be translated into the word of Bob physically and spiritually.

324
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,200
How's the work going to translate the pamphlet over there?

325
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,860
It's moving along.

326
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,120
We got the right people to do it, I'll tell you that.

327
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:38,660
They just can't be caught at it.

328
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:39,680
You see, it's...

329
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:40,000
Oh, really?

330
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:40,680
It is tough.

331
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,940
So they can't mail it back to you?

332
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:42,820
Yeah, they can.

333
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,440
They just have to be real careful about it.

334
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,040
But this was getting...

335
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,600
I got into an elevator going up to the room here, and the elevator lady asked me who the

336
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,880
man on my shirt was.

337
00:14:54,340 --> 00:14:55,680
I hopefully will.

338
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,160
This man looks like you.

339
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,220
That's Bob.

340
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:03,980
Bob.

341
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,260
Bob is a funny guy.

342
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:08,380
He says, AI, AI.

343
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:08,980
Oh.

344
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,600
You see, friend, she knew.

345
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,260
She understands.

346
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,540
You can tell by the way she...

347
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:13,940
Ni hao.

348
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,020
See, that means praise Bob in Chinese.

349
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,020


350
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,020


351
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,020


352
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,020


353
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,020


354
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,020


355
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,020


356
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,020


357
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:16,020


358
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,640
And they say that all the time.

359
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,360
That's the way they say hello.

360
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,720
It sort of means praise Bob.

361
00:15:21,900 --> 00:15:22,360
They just don't...

362
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,200
Most of them don't know who Bob is.

363
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:25,900
But...

364
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,800
Oh, they will, friends.

365
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:31,160
They know about the pills that Bob takes, though, over there.

366
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:31,820
Yes, they do.

367
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,320
And I can't believe we've only got one tape deck.

368
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:38,060
I can't do a show in here with one mere tape deck.

369
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,960
Now you're saying house rules.

370
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,120
You can't complain about the equipment.

371
00:15:41,220 --> 00:15:41,520
But...

372
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:43,120
Oh, let's see.

373
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,020
For those who don't believe that Bob is...

374
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,020


375
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,020


376
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,020


377
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,020


378
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,020


379
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,020


380
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,020


381
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,020


382
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,020


383
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,020


384
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:46,420
We're getting a call in China.

385
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,080
They don't believe there's a country there.

386
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:50,980
We did make some satellite recordings.

387
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:58,180
We couldn't get them over here because, well, they do things to you if they find out what

388
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:58,960
you're really doing.

389
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,880
The one thing we've discovered is that you can't believe what anybody says about themselves

390
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:03,480
over there.

391
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,560
At one point, we were actually told...

392
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:05,580
What do you mean?

393
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:11,840
We were told by one of the translators that there was a camera and a microphone in our

394
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,640
room at the hotel.

395
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,000
I kid you not.

396
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,100
And you didn't notice it?

397
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:15,520
Oh, my.

398
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,620
After all the cameras and microphones you have in your house?

399
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:21,840
Well, we took the place apart, and they've got the finest little cameras.

400
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,660
I brought it with me.

401
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:27,100
In fact, that's what I recorded most of my rants all week on.

402
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:29,300
On your Tommy?

403
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:33,340
On my stolen communist spy cameras and recorders.

404
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,000
No kidding?

405
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:34,420
It was wonderful.

406
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:34,660
Wow.

407
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:34,760
Yeah.

408
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:42,620
But friends, you know, they need slack in China, just like we do here, like everybody does.

409
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,200
But they don't have it.

410
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,720
And there's no explanation for that.

411
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,140
There's no explanation.

412
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,920
That's a thing you've got to remember, friends.

413
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,140
There's no explanation.

414
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,800
There's a black hole out our window.

415
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:53,620
There's no light.

416
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,140
And there's no explanation.

417
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:56,480
There's only one thing you can do, friends.

418
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:57,040
Look out the window.

419
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:58,500
And that's trust in Bob.

420
00:16:59,040 --> 00:16:59,760
Look out the window.

421
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:00,440
There's no light.

422
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:02,840
You can't see anything.

423
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,500
It's a blackout all over the whole neighborhood.

424
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,000
What happened?

425
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:05,640
Except for right here.

426
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,340
Right here, friends.

427
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,520
You've got to trust Bob in the dark.

428
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:14,260
If you could, there'd be no war, no crime, no open-ditch latrines.

429
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,180
You'd have to squat.

430
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,960
Squat over like in some third-world country like Japan.

431
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:24,680
You'd be able to sit on the finest raised porcelain thrones and pedestals with suction.

432
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:27,880
Oh, friends, the Chinese love Bob.

433
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,120
They just don't know yet.

434
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,600
And when we were going through customs saying goodbye to Li Li Jing and Li Yan

435
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:39,440
and these wonderful new popes and priestesses, they were chanting Bob and slack.

436
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:40,620
That's the truth.

437
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,500
They were.

438
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,240
They were indeed.

439
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,700
Well, the Chinese can really chant.

440
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,300
Man, I mean, compared to an American.

441
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,780
Well, they haven't been.

442
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:55,120
They don't have the, I could call it the patience to really chant Bob the way they can in the East.

443
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,600
That's right.

444
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:59,960
That's the one thing that's so spiritually strong about our friends in the Orient.

445
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,200
Uh-huh.

446
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,680
And the underground Chinese subgenius resistance.

447
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:07,660
You know, friends, someday if those people, if our friends in China can do what Mao did,

448
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:12,360
all the Chinese people will be praising Bob and burning all the books that aren't about Bob

449
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,420
and beating and criticizing all the people.

450
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,260
And all the people that aren't into Bob.

451
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:18,340
And, oh, don't it bless your heart to think about that, friends.

452
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:22,200
Because someday, you know, someday that's going to happen here in the U.S.

453
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,680
This country, friends, it's going to happen here.

454
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,000
This country's going to get back to Bob.

455
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,400
I can see that uprise.

456
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,540
I can see it in my mind.

457
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,560
I can see an uprise in all of the country right now.

458
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,980
If they can do it in Red China, they can do it here, friends.

459
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:36,360
They're going to love Bob forever because they have to love Bob.

460
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,420
And that's the way it's going to be in the U.S.

461
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:43,140
You're going to love Bob, my friend, because you have to love Bob.

462
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:44,260
And if you don't?

463
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,120
I will just.

464
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,840
You'll be sent to the subgenius slack farm where you can dig ditches

465
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,480
and carry baskets full of dirt on your shoulders and push water buffalo around.

466
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:58,920
And until you're reeducated and you remember what slack really means,

467
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,080
you'll be ready to praise Bob then, won't you?

468
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,080
Oh, yeah.

469
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,280
I know you will.

470
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:07,960
But it was pretty amazing.

471
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:11,900
Friends, let's go to a little bit of taped live report from that strange country

472
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:13,760
while Buck tries to find out who.

473
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,880
Is listening on our telephone.

474
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:19,100
Oh, by the way, my friend, Professor Mickey Granta,

475
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:24,580
who is the co-host sometime of this last month's show in China,

476
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:28,840
was he was one time calling somebody on the telephone there.

477
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,360
Yeah.

478
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:37,040
And he he heard his own voice from the day before conversation the day before being played back on the phone

479
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:44,000
because somebody hit play instead of record somewhere in the phone company building in Beijing.

480
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,500
That's been happening to me around here, too.

481
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:46,320
Oh, yeah.

482
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:46,700
Yeah.

483
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:50,560
I've been getting all kinds of weird things on our phone because we put our phone number on the air once.

484
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,500
Not me, but my my buddies, my roommates put our phone number on the air for their crazy projects.

485
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,860
And that was me.

486
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:02,080
Well, as a result, you know, anyway, our phones been tapped ever since.

487
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,280
Oh, yes.

488
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:03,480
Pray.

489
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,940
Then now they'll have to sit through sit through my arguments with my girlfriend.

490
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:08,920
Oh, God.

491
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,180
If you're in the FBI.

492
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,120
I know the FBI guys.

493
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,680
One minute.

494
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,500
They'll be praising.

495
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:13,720
Bob.

496
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:16,140
The next minute they'll be cussing you out.

497
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:18,300
I hate and but I know.

498
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,880
And I'm like, again, they're fighting to get out.

499
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,520
So much.

500
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:31,340
I just I need to in America before we spend money, we need to know how much.

501
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:34,800
So I'm hoping later there's not some deal I don't know about.

502
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:38,380
When we do business, we are responsible for the money.

503
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:43,220
And so before we have work done, we have to ask the price.

504
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,440
And that's how our system works.

505
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
That's how our minds work.

506
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,480
We don't.

507
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,600
Yes, friends.

508
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,700
And for some reason, this music, which sounds uncannily like Devo, I was hearing this in

509
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:11,160
the first first night I was there in China, the taxi driver was playing this bizarre thing.

510
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,480
We're going to go to the taxi driver.

511
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:13,480


512
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:13,480


513
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:13,480


514
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:39,240
He came up and he was eating this strategic, but he also was on the taxi bus.

515
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:39,400
I was arranged to go to China, because he said today is media salah, I'm going to say

516
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:39,400


517
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:40,560
I didn't wish to buy a driver's license.

518
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,500
Oh, you just went out with the dough.

519
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:41,500


520
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:41,660
Well.

521
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:41,660


522
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:41,660


523
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:43,440
.

524
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:47,220
They listen to, they don't get rock and roll much in China.

525
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,040
They really don't.

526
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:48,460
It's sad.

527
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:54,140
They do get Hong Kong love songs, which is real radical for them.

528
00:21:54,380 --> 00:22:07,340
They get, in Taiwan, rock and roll, which is like warmed over versions of current hits in America done by Taiwanese bands sung in strange accents.

529
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,240
Like girls just want to have fun.

530
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,460
They do, don't they?

531
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:15,320
The Chinese just want to have fun, too.

532
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:20,680
At points, I was reading that they're not into the squirting universe in China.

533
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:27,560
They don't believe in getting sexy beyond marriage.

534
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:30,580
And I thought, well, gee, that's real moral, but it can't be true.

535
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,480
That must be a bunch of government propaganda.

536
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,480
It is.

537
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,460
It is, friends.

538
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,040
It is.

539
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:38,840
And I was so glad to hear that you can't suppress.

540
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,180
Of course, you can suppress having babies.

541
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:44,080
They have forced abortions in China.

542
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:48,360
If you have more than two kids, then that's it, boy.

543
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:50,440
You can go over to the scraper.

544
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,640
That's life control.

545
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:55,080
Yeah, but see, that's why we were able to work on brain transplant experiments there.

546
00:22:55,660 --> 00:22:57,360
That's called urethral day scraper.

547
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,120
Hey, man, that's crude.

548
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:03,240
That's bad, Buck.

549
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:05,080
I don't care.

550
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,820
It's easy to remember because it rhymes.

551
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,720
That's right.

552
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,960
See, I want to be, I want to point out how atrocious.

553
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:12,160
That's true.

554
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,160


555
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,160


556
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,160


557
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:12,900
It really is.

558
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:13,360
Okay.

559
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:18,240
But it's so, so I make it worse so that you can understand it out there.

560
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,360
I'm trying to shock you.

561
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,220
I'm trying to get you angry.

562
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,460
I'm trying to make you react.

563
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,680
Yeah, it's all part of the satire, folks.

564
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:28,560
The diseases you get from listening to this show, that's just part of the satire.

565
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,180
So, like, don't worry about it.

566
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:35,040
The lawsuits, the station gets, that's just part of the joke.

567
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,640
That's part of this big satire, see.

568
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:41,980
But as I was saying, you know, abortion is like, uh, it's,

569
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:44,920
it is murder, as Bob said, but it's murder in self-defense.

570
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,320
In China, they don't look at it that way.

571
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,660
It's, it's murder against population growth.

572
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:56,140
And, uh, but see, that gives doctors like us an unending supply of donors of fetus brain tissue,

573
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:59,680
which, if you've been reading your Time magazine, you'll know that's the only way

574
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:06,300
to even work towards brain transplants, is working on brain grafts using fetus brain tissue.

575
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,440
And in China, you've got donors, you've got no insurance problems,

576
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,960
and you've got no crippled people.

577
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:15,200
Or, uh, or, or mentally ill people, because they kill them.

578
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,560
And you don't have too many troublemakers like, uh, us,

579
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:23,220
because they put them in, in, uh, the work camp right outside of town.

580
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:26,260
For, not forever, not like they used to, you know.

581
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,640
They had that big revolution there to get rid of the horrors of feudalism,

582
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,500
and they ended up with something just as bad.

583
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:36,940
But, uh, you know, it's a, it's a cultural thing.

584
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:41,900
The, uh, I mean, Bob will be doing that to the,

585
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:42,680
to the United States.

586
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,700
And you're laughing.

587
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:44,600
You're thinking, oh, yeah.

588
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,980
Yeah, the U.S. couldn't, we couldn't have a cultural revolution like, like China did.

589
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,940
No, Bob would never do that to us, would he, Bob?

590
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,720
Not the real Bob, my friends, but not the real Bob.

591
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,980
Well, there's a good Bob, there's a bad Bob,

592
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,660
and then there's a yellow Bob, and there's a white Bob.

593
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:05,500
And then there's doctors.

594
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:16,580
Uh, please vote.

595
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,700
Hello, everyone.

596
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:26,900
This is your Chinese correspondent for the Hour of Slang.

597
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,780
Li Liqin speaking to you from Beijing.

598
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,880
And this is the Chinese subgenius report.

599
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,440
Everyone probably knows.

600
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,720
This is a train to Beijing.

601
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,360
Beijing, ah, that's just a sea of people.

602
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:47,020
Especially now, ah, people's life is getting better.

603
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,000
These rural villagers, ah,

604
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:53,540
they come to Beijing, ah, to the city, ah,

605
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:55,600
to sell their stuff, ah,

606
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,420
to get their money back.

607
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,160
But the bicycles, they often don't have a nosebleed.

608
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,540
Ah, when they're in danger,

609
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:05,980
they use the, the, the shoe band to go to the outside,

610
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,360
and they pull themselves up like this, and then,

611
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:09,380
ah, they stand up.

612
00:26:09,840 --> 00:26:11,340
Because the discovered one, ah, get hit.

613
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,260
I've been hit this day and I'm getting off work.

614
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,540
The old researcher came over shows a big frame.

615
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,640
I went left and right.

616
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,040
Fantastic.

617
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,420
The eighth crit was hit.

618
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:26,720
I came out again and was afraid,

619
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:27,640
I said, I said, you're in university.

620
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,220
You're such an old man.

621
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:29,900
I said, you ah.

622
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,200
He said, how do you say it?

623
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,240
You say we are patriotic.

624
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:36,220
We are old.

625
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:38,540
حم帥

626
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:38,540


627
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,140
Oh yes dear friends, listen to that Chinese TV in the background.

628
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:08,220
You know how we do in the U.S. here, we have the Star Spangled Banner.

629
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:12,340
No, it's not, this is Reverend Eiland's thing.

630
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,260
I can't believe it.

631
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,640
And Buck's here battling it out with the callers.

632
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,240
Barbarians, dog people, that's what we are.

633
00:27:21,280 --> 00:27:22,060
Oh, oh, here.

634
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,700
That was, by the way friends, that was once again, that was Dr. Li Jing, the Pope of all

635
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:30,160
China, the Chinese subgenius doing the Chinese report.

636
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:34,580
And hopefully every month or so he'll have a couple of minutes or longer to speak in

637
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,320
Chinese.

638
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,160
And those, I figure there's probably three or four people out there that'll, that'll

639
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:39,680
get it.

640
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:44,100
Reverend Stang, we've got a lady up here who would like to tell you something.

641
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:46,920
And this is a love call for you, Reverend Stang.

642
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:47,780
Oh geez, great.

643
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,880
We feel like you deserve it.

644
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:51,200
Okay, well you know how to work this new board, not me.

645
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:52,280
Oops.

646
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:52,700
Hello.

647
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:53,280
Reverend Stang.

648
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:55,400
Yes, my daughter.

649
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,360
Welcome back, praise Bob.

650
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:58,600
Oh yes.

651
00:27:58,820 --> 00:27:59,520
Praise Bob.

652
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,720
We praise Bob and, and Kill Mal.

653
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,500
And we have missed you.

654
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,160
We have not had any true slack in over a month and a half.

655
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,940
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

656
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,140
It's all right.

657
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,140


658
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,140


659
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,140


660
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,140


661
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:09,140


662
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:09,580
It's me, Buck.

663
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,440
I, I, I screwed it up.

664
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:11,780
I know.

665
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:16,480
I, I, I whip myself every night after realizing what I've done to the show.

666
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:17,140
Oh no.

667
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,380
You ruined it, Buck.

668
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,080
No, no.

669
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:23,140
When the spirit gets a hold of me, I don't know what I'm doing.

670
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,700
I can tell, Buck.

671
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,560
It's really bad.

672
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:30,900
Reverend Stang, you can, we can absolve him just as long as he stays away for a while.

673
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,620
How the hell can you say such a thing?

674
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,720
I thought, I thought all.

675
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,880
You didn't hear my show, Stang.

676
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:36,280
Oh boy.

677
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,340
Yeah, that's true.

678
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:38,760
I haven't heard any of Buck's shows.

679
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:39,140
Oh, no.

680
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,000
I mean, we don't get, I mean, like I said, the Russians were scrambling the signal there

681
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:43,500
in China.

682
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,520
Well, are you going to be back for a while now?

683
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,440
Apparently so.

684
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:48,320
Good.

685
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,500
They, uh, uh, jeez, thanks.

686
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,200
Well, I'll tell you, did you like Dr. Chaos any better?

687
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:54,480
What's your phone number?

688
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:58,120
Oh, I'm just so glad you're back, Reverend.

689
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:03,120
Okay, well, uh, I'll be leaving the station in about half an hour, so, uh, you know,

690
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:06,920
if you, any, any gladness, I'd be very glad to see myself.

691
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,560
Oh.

692
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:09,980
I'll be back just before we go.

693
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,860
No, no, no, no, no.

694
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,140
No, I'm just kidding.

695
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:20,340
I left three wives in China, two in Japan, and I got at least 37 here in the U.S., and

696
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,160
the payments are really stiff.

697
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,960
Well, you're a master of sweat, I can tell.

698
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,680
They all are good cooks.

699
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,920
The problem is, they're also all feisty.

700
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:31,180
That's the problem with these subgenius girls.

701
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,280
I, I, when it's like, as soon as I walk out of here, there's gonna, they're gonna be waiting

702
00:29:34,280 --> 00:29:35,500
for me with rolling pins.

703
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:37,540
Oh, gotta mention what they're frying.

704
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,140
Yeah, or their new, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh,

705
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:39,660
uh, uh, uh.

706
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:44,660
Oh, dear sister, I'm, well, uh, who is call, who is this calling by the way?

707
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:45,420
Oh, this is Joy.

708
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:47,300
It is, isn't it?

709
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,100
Oh, hello, Mom.

710
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,700
Uh, Joy and Bob.

711
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,420
Whoa.

712
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,300
That makes me wanna play some hymns.

713
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,680
It makes me wanna play a cart.

714
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:57,860
Oh, yeah, that's true, we do have to play the cart, which is our obligation to the stage.

715
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,120
Well, anyway, welcome back.

716
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,740
Well, thank you very much.

717
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:03,640
Okay, well, I hope I get some love calls after that one.

718
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:04,120
Yeah.

719
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,040
Yeah, any.

720
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:05,360
Nice.

721
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,140
Yeah, let's have some, some Buck love calls.

722
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:08,360
Yeah.

723
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:09,120
Yeah.

724
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:14,060
girls as a sort of a trademark for six months now.

725
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,560
I haven't even been able to say it lately.

726
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:19,460
All I can say is, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

727
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,160
I never know that.

728
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:20,700
OK.

729
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:21,300
It takes a while.

730
00:30:21,380 --> 00:30:22,040
It never does even.

731
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:24,340
We're going to get back to the Chinese report here

732
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:24,820
pretty quick.

733
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:25,180
OK.

734
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:25,380
Thank you.

735
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:28,040
Let's put on this next call and see if I got a call here.

736
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:32,460
Oh, I can tell she's touching her laugh right now

737
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:33,420
with that thought of mine.

738
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:34,140
Hello, our Slack.

739
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,040
Hello, my friend.

740
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:35,540
How are you?

741
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,320
Ah, it's Mr. Beepy.

742
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:37,060
This is him.

743
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:37,720
This is him.

744
00:30:37,780 --> 00:30:37,800
OK.

745
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:38,440
Hello.

746
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:38,840
Mr. Beepy.

747
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,360
Yes, sir.

748
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,220
Did you hear my Mr. Beepy impression

749
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,280
when we started the show tonight?

750
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,720
It was a shock to my system.

751
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,040
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

752
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,320
It was a shock to his system.

753
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:47,520
I couldn't believe it.

754
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,780
I don't understand why you make fun of me.

755
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:50,680
Make fun?

756
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,080
Heck, that's a tribute, dude.

757
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:53,840
That's a tribute to you.

758
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:56,140
Yeah, since I walked in the door here,

759
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:59,120
everybody's been saying, wait until you hear Mr. Beepy.

760
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,500
I mean, good, you've got a following out here.

761
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,120
What do those initials stand for?

762
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,140
Don't say it over the air.

763
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,180
Don't say it over the air.

764
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,420
Just read it.

765
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,040
Just remember this thing.

766
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:10,000
He's got more than one.

767
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,000
He's got more than one.

768
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,280
Listen, your reputation was reaching us all the way

769
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,960
in Shanghai earlier in the month.

770
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,160
I was standing there.

771
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,180
They know about me over there.

772
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:20,880
Huh?

773
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:22,280
They know about me over there.

774
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:22,920
Oh, yes, they do.

775
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,600
In fact, on May Day, the anniversary

776
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:26,840
of the Bolshevik revolution, they

777
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:30,800
were drawing mustaches over the mustache on Karl Marx

778
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,340
and putting your picture up.

779
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:34,580
A giant phallic symbol?

780
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:35,400
Yes.

781
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:35,680
Oh.

782
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:38,060
I tell you, they're getting into slack.

783
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:38,780
They're getting into slack over there.

784
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:39,720
Praise Bob.

785
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,880
I cannot believe it.

786
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:41,680
Yeah, yeah.

787
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:44,440
America is such a wonderful place, and I praise Bob for it.

788
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,520
Where are you from?

789
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,000
Where am I from?

790
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:49,000
You sound like a local Texas guy.

791
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:49,740
Where I am.

792
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,180
Oh.

793
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,320
Oh, yeah.

794
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:52,960
Oh, OK.

795
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,360
I've got another tape of him.

796
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,320
Oh, you got to meet someone else, too?

797
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:57,220
Yes, yes.

798
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,540
I have another tape of you.

799
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:00,880
Would you like to come over sometime?

800
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:02,660
No.

801
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,400
Why not?

802
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,100
No, no.

803
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:04,300
Why not?

804
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:04,700
No.

805
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,380
I could show you my collection of you know what's.

806
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,040
Yeah, yeah.

807
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,040


808
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,040


809
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:08,040


810
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:11,700
Yeah, that's exactly why I don't know what I do know what.

811
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,220
We've got the same collection, pal.

812
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,300
Look, I know.

813
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:18,340
Look, we need to.

814
00:32:18,920 --> 00:32:21,760
We're going to surprise you with a tape of yourself.

815
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,900
I didn't even know I had this.

816
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:24,380
Thank you.

817
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,300
I want to hear it right now.

818
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,740
OK, this imposter here.

819
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:31,060
Let me see if I can get Professor Lele Jang out of the box.

820
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:32,480
I'm waiting.

821
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,200
Time is of the essence.

822
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:34,520
No, no.

823
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,880
Not upside down.

824
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,020
OK, now this imposter goes to the box.

825
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,020


826
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,020


827
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:42,180
It goes by the name of E. Yotta D. Shiite, and he's speaking in trance.

828
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:46,240
And this is a message I think we should all pay attention to.

829
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,120
OK, go ahead.

830
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:47,520
Play it.

831
00:32:47,660 --> 00:32:49,820
Oh, well, we have to take you off.

832
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,320
I have said this before, and I say it again.

833
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:59,920
Let us suppose the peoples that are coming here from others past.

834
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,220
Let us suppose they are spiders.

835
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,020
They have come to us.

836
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,020


837
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,020


838
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,020


839
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:08,020


840
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,040
They have come to save you.

841
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:11,000
Yes, to eat.

842
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:22,080
Always be very suspicious about everyone who comes to save you, because he is saving

843
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,180
you for himself.

844
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:25,840
And you cannot tell what for.

845
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:33,020
Save yourself, and you will be safe.

846
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:36,100
How do you do this?

847
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,020
By educating yourself.

848
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:38,020


849
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,360
By making yourself as the what if.

850
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,880
Get out of the child mind.

851
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,960
Get into adulthood.

852
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,760
This means you will have to be responsible for your dream.

853
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:04,380
If you are not willing to be responsible, just do that.

854
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,040
Well, friends, you see, that was unbelievable.

855
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,340
I believe that is the same individual who has been calling this show.

856
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:14,120
This tape says it is Iyadadi Shiite, the entity.

857
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,200
The tape is called You Are the Dreamer.

858
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:24,100
And this man, this is a tape of a man, a man like you or me, who goes into a trance and

859
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:28,480
makes these pronouncements, which you can barely understand on only one channel, about

860
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,000
the aliens.

861
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:34,060
And what he was basically saying on there is that the aliens want to eat you, but you

862
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,600
want to be used by them.

863
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,020
Because you love a man.

864
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,080
You love authority so much.

865
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,160
And he's got a point there, you know?

866
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:41,500
Yeah.

867
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:41,780
He's got a point.

868
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:47,140
I've got another caller right here, and I'll just patch this fellow in.

869
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:49,460
I need another tape deck, man.

870
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:53,240
There's no media barrage hellish background noise going on.

871
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:53,820
I've got a...

872
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,700
I'm going to...

873
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,260
Wait a minute.

874
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,080
Hello, caller?

875
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:56,620
Hello?

876
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:57,960
Hello.

877
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,960
Yeah, go ahead and say that again.

878
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:06,600
The sound of the salute, the tone, can you tell me what frequency it is?

879
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,560
It drives my cats crazy.

880
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,460
It's a very...

881
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,760
Actually, a very...

882
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:21,200
It's a combination of a 27 and a half over about a thousand point three.

883
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,560
No, you don't understand.

884
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,320
So 440 is standard, okay?

885
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:24,740
Yeah.

886
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,720
I have two cats, you see.

887
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,460
They both go crazy when they hear it.

888
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:30,940
Like this?

889
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:33,580
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

890
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,320
What have we done to them?

891
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,340
How do they look?

892
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:36,920
I don't know exactly what they do.

893
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:37,700
How do they look?

894
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,700
Do they do that?

895
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:41,580
No.

896
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:41,620
They're...

897
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:42,800
I finally got some background noise.

898
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,340
No, but they're learning.

899
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:45,540
They're learning to do this?

900
00:35:45,540 --> 00:35:46,980
Well, thanks for sharing that with us.

901
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,200
Yeah.

902
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:47,880
That's wonderful.

903
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,360
Well, those...

904
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:49,280
See, they're...

905
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:54,420
What this salute does to cats is a shame, and that's why the Chinese think we're a

906
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,660
bunch of dog people, man.

907
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:56,420
They think we're...

908
00:35:57,420 --> 00:35:58,420
Yeah, yeah.

909
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,420
Death, death.

910
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:06,320
The Chinese think that we're like just these clumsy, big, bad, idiotic, stupid, stupid

911
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,320


912
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:06,320


913
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:11,980
ill-mannered, quasi-retarded, culturally deprived idiots.

914
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,180
But we're not as bad.

915
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:18,380
They don't think us Caucasians and black people are nearly as bad as the Chinese minorities

916
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,420
who are like the Tibetans and Mongolians.

917
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:25,540
And it's like a hideous cartoon of the US in the 50s.

918
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:33,900
The Mongolians and Tibetans and Chinese minorities have to sleep in their own hotels, they drink

919
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:35,260
out of their own water fountains.

920
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,300
And they have to sit out of their own water fountains.

921
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,420
And they have to have the back of the bus.

922
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,280
No way.

923
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:38,920
Really?

924
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,720
It's just like the US before Bob.

925
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:47,340
But friends, if China is like America before Bob arrived, I want you to know that last

926
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:49,320
week Bob arrived in China.

927
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:56,340
So we've got a firm toenail hold on mainland China, friend, an unholy alliance between

928
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:57,940
slack and communism.

929
00:36:58,380 --> 00:36:59,000
Praise Bob.

930
00:36:59,060 --> 00:36:59,640
Oh, yeah.

931
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:01,580
So the conspiracy is everywhere.

932
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,440
It was Mao the same way?

933
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:06,260
Did he approve of putting everybody in the...

934
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,200
Back in the bus and all that?

935
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:08,980
Oh, yeah.

936
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:09,820
This is all...

937
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:11,140
I mean, everybody's...

938
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,880
All us workers are equal, but...

939
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,320
Except for the minority.

940
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:24,320
The dumbest, most ill-informed Chinese worker is equal to the richest party member who gets

941
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:28,500
paid real highly and can buy all sorts of products the other ones can't.

942
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:32,940
It's just that some party members are more equal than some ordinary citizens.

943
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:34,180
That's kind of like from Adam.

944
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:35,260
Yeah, kind of like.

945
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:35,360
You could say.

946
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:37,480
It's kind of exactly like...

947
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:37,700
Exactly like.

948
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:38,900
To give you an idea.

949
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:44,680
Now, the funny thing is I talked to a lot of old hipster radical types who said, oh,

950
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:45,540
we have Reverend Stang.

951
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,540
I've been to China.

952
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,420
I was with a radical tour group.

953
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,240
They showed us the ideal commune.

954
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,180
They showed us the rich peasants.

955
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,620
That's like, it's utopia.

956
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,560
There's no crime.

957
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,380
There's no rape, they said.

958
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:57,780
Right.

959
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,100
But that's like judging the United States from Disneyland.

960
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:01,760
That's exactly what it is.

961
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:02,440
That's very...

962
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,760
That is exactly what it is.

963
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,200
And we were there for a month working.

964
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:06,280
And we were there for a month working.

965
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,280


966
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,280


967
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:06,280


968
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,300
So we need, I mean, we needed to say it alongside the workers.

969
00:38:08,540 --> 00:38:08,780
Hey.

970
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,860
I mean we were workers too.

971
00:38:09,980 --> 00:38:12,380
And after about a month they start to tell you what they really think.

972
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,500
And friends?

973
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,560
Oh, they need slack.

974
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:17,140
They need Bong.

975
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:18,080
Stang, while you were gone.

976
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,820
Well, maybe not Bong, but then at least they need Bong.

977
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:24,140
One of the greatest American basketball players is named Akeem Olajuwon.

978
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:24,560
Yeah.

979
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:25,280
Yeah, the giant guy.

980
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:26,840
Well, he's pretty big.

981
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:27,440
He's not that big.

982
00:38:27,540 --> 00:38:28,740
He's about six-nine .

983
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:32,620
Although they list at 7-0 because he just plays over everybody's head anyway, okay.

984
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,660
He's from Nigeria, okay.

985
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:34,820


986
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:35,140
Okay.

987
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:40,160
Anyway, when they went there with Clyde Drexler from the University of Houston, they went to Disneyland in California.

988
00:38:41,300 --> 00:38:48,160
And so Clyde Drexler starts talking to a Goofy, you know, one of the Goofys at Disneyland.

989
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,940
You know, the dog, right?

990
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:54,080
And the Kimo Lodge one comes up and says, who is this dog and why did he speak to you?

991
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,860
Why did he speak to you, friend?

992
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:05,520
You see, in China, Goofy would end up in somebody's stew pot.

993
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:06,960
That's right.

994
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:15,620
Along with Muffy and Fluffy and all the other house pets because they can't afford to be keeping a frozen goblin animal around.

995
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,500
Mickey for dessert chocolate covered for us.

996
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,920
No, they quit eating rats.

997
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:24,280
There was a big rat problem for a while, about 10 years ago.

998
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:31,580
And the government started sending out on the early morning news show that everyone in the country listens to on loudspeakers because you can't turn them off.

999
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,380
They said they gave them rat recipes and how you could eat rats.

1000
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:35,880
Right.

1001
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,040
Right.

1002
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:36,260
Right.

1003
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,260


1004
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,260


1005
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,260


1006
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,260


1007
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,260


1008
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,260


1009
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,260


1010
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,260


1011
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,260


1012
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,260


1013
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,260


1014
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:39,980
And the rats were so full of DDT that everybody started getting sick from the rats.

1015
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:43,620
So then they had to do another propaganda campaign to make people quit eating rats.

1016
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,120
Yeah.

1017
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:45,960
Yeah.

1018
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,800
I heard that they, what did they do?

1019
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:53,180
They got rid of some kind of animal by just getting everybody after them out there.

1020
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:54,140
What was it?

1021
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:55,200
Now, which?

1022
00:39:56,040 --> 00:39:58,720
What animals, what animals did they get rid of in China?

1023
00:39:59,120 --> 00:39:59,500
Birds.

1024
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:00,700
Oh, really?

1025
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:01,480
Yeah, birds.

1026
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:05,320
They used a lot of DDT and got rid of all the insects, see?

1027
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:09,160
They thought that was a real modernistic move for the five year plan.

1028
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,640
Well, the birds didn't have anything to eat.

1029
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:20,080
So the birds are all gone and the insects came back because they're, you know, got their immunity up by a few generations down and no birds to eat them.

1030
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:24,220
So you've got to use really strong DDT in China these days.

1031
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,520
Maybe they'll have to borrow a little stuff from the Soviet Union, from the Ukraine.

1032
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,380
Oh, yeah.

1033
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,360
Yeah, they are.

1034
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:29,920
They do.

1035
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:30,840
They borrow from both.

1036
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:35,640
And by the way, America made a big arms sale to China just about three weeks ago.

1037
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:36,260
And they were really, really good.

1038
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,760
Real friendly to us after that.

1039
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:41,680
I bet you, I bet you out there hardly even heard about it.

1040
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,140
No.

1041
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,540
As a matter of fact, you probably didn't hear about the joint air maneuvers.

1042
00:40:44,620 --> 00:40:50,340
You probably didn't know about how we know what was on the, what happened there.

1043
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,220
Joint air maneuvers.

1044
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:52,100
Hey, get this, Buck.

1045
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:54,260
I was sitting in the bar at the Friendship Hotel.

1046
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:54,680
Yeah.

1047
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:58,440
And these French and German scientists, this hotel is full of scientists that live there.

1048
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,420
These guys are behind me looking at satellite photographs.

1049
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:06,180
The Romanian journalist for Radio BGing across from me.

1050
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:10,520
He says, oh, those are US spy satellite pictures from Chernobyl.

1051
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:12,920
And they sure indeed were.

1052
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:13,920
You could see it.

1053
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,240
You could almost see people down there like little ants.

1054
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,900
And that's why we got this report here.

1055
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,040
They're intercepting it.

1056
00:41:20,040 --> 00:41:20,980
They're intercepting them.

1057
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,660
They're intercepting them in China.

1058
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,140
Yes.

1059
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,940
The Romanians are.

1060
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:24,420
Oh, no, no.

1061
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,940
These French and German guys did.

1062
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:28,920
And the Romanian just overheard what they were saying.

1063
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,860
And was able to transfer.

1064
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:30,380
In France and Germany, right?

1065
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:30,680
Oh, yeah.

1066
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:31,020
OK.

1067
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:31,180
Yeah.

1068
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:31,580
OK.

1069
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:32,720
But here's how we do it.

1070
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:35,020
Friends, this is a report from Beijing that Dr.

1071
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:36,240
Professor Mickey Garanzi.

1072
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:36,820
And I did.

1073
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:41,680
About that very self-same subject matter of how they get those pictures.

1074
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,120
Speaking for the hour of slack in Dallas, Texas.

1075
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:49,580
But I'm speaking tonight from Beijing in the People's Republic of China.

1076
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:55,380
With super espionage expert, Dr. Mickey Garanzi.

1077
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:59,500
And Dr. Grant, would you explain to me once again.

1078
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,820
Just exactly what kind of.

1079
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,600
What just exactly what sort of.

1080
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,140
I got to check.

1081
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,100
How you got those.

1082
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:08,400
How did you get.

1083
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:09,300
Just a second.

1084
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:10,320
I'm looking for some bugs.

1085
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:12,340
The Chernobyl explosion.

1086
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,180
Is this on?

1087
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:13,580
Is this on?

1088
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:18,500
How did you get your information regarding the radiation spread from the Chernobyl.

1089
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:24,020
Let's call it the small accident that our friends, the UGWO rounds had.

1090
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,460
KH-11.

1091
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:26,820
KH-11.

1092
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,460
The KH-11.

1093
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,360
KH-11 satellites.

1094
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,720
We've got to deal now with the Chinese.

1095
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:36,220
With KH-11s, they released photo devices where they perished.

1096
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,060
They were shot down in the balloon pox up.

1097
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:41,160
The C-131 comes along and picks up those suckers.

1098
00:42:41,360 --> 00:42:42,100
And we've got.

1099
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,540
Okay, they've got homing devices on the film that's dropped.

1100
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:45,400
On the pouch.

1101
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:45,840
On the pouch.

1102
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,100
On the pouch.

1103
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,200
Now what do our Chinese friends have to do with the.

1104
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,160
They allow us to fly our C-131s over their territory.

1105
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:57,380
Because some of these in southern part of Russia since we lost our good buddy in Iran.

1106
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,760
Some of these, some of these, they float down this direction.

1107
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,800
And that's one of the big things we got going with the Chinese.

1108
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:06,200
Oh, that's why we're training them.

1109
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,860
Training them to fly up there and catch them.

1110
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,060
Well, we do more than that.

1111
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,440
We've had joint air maneuvers.

1112
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:18,140
We had the first joint air maneuvers in 1984 with the Chinese Air Force and the U.S. Air Force.

1113
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,980
That was in October 1984.

1114
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:24,140
Now how come we didn't hear about this in general release of news in the U.S.?

1115
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:28,240
A lot of reporters, AP reporters, in fact some others I know, they were aware of it.

1116
00:43:28,300 --> 00:43:30,800
But this was, this was kind of killed back in the U.S.

1117
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:34,240
This wasn't the sort of thing to put on at that time.

1118
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,360
So, you know.

1119
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:37,900
Not exactly prime time material, eh?

1120
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,740
Well, you know, what can I say?

1121
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:45,440
One morning there were about five generals with stars on the Great Wall.

1122
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:46,940
What can I say?

1123
00:43:47,880 --> 00:43:55,120
Why in the world would George Bush, former head CIA, be the first ambassador to China?

1124
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:56,660
Think about it.

1125
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:57,880
Think about it.

1126
00:43:57,880 --> 00:43:59,000
Think about it.

1127
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,600
That's the hard part, sir.

1128
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,320
There's only one hard part.

1129
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,460
Yeah.

1130
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:06,140
Praise God.

1131
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,880
Oh, yes, my friend.

1132
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,180
It's true.

1133
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:10,900
That's true.

1134
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,960
We're right here in the red communist time.

1135
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Let's go talk to some folks out here and just put this on here and let these folks out here, let them listen to this.

1136
00:44:21,140 --> 00:44:22,300
We're going to go talk to some.

1137
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,220
What a pung you yell Fiji.

1138
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:30,920
That's what I mail Fiji.

1139
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:31,640
Fiji?

1140
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:32,200
Yeah.

1141
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,180
He's saying my friend wants a prostitute.

1142
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:46,420
His wife in America is not here and he needs a Chinese tai tai or wife.

1143
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,760
Just so that they know the truth.

1144
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,240
That was Chinese in an elevator.

1145
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:07,820
That was the 10, 10 people at an elevator on top of a hotel.

1146
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,400
We won't say which hotel.

1147
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,660
No, sir.

1148
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:12,280
We can't pronounce it.

1149
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:16,520
That would be revealing too much because we just met another CIA guy in the bar.

1150
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:17,440
That's exactly right.

1151
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,140
And he would hear this broadcast.

1152
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:20,500
Oh, he would know.

1153
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:23,040
Who done it?

1154
00:45:23,100 --> 00:45:25,880
Friends, they listen to the hour of slack and I do mean they.

1155
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:27,060
You know what I mean.

1156
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:27,480
Them.

1157
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:29,240
Hey, oh, and we hate them.

1158
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:29,840
No way.

1159
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,240
We don't necessarily hate them.

1160
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:31,920
I'm one of them.

1161
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:32,440
We need to.

1162
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:33,180
Yeah, we got to have.

1163
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:37,760
Would you go into a little more detail on exactly how these spy satellites work that

1164
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:43,840
our government is keeping over that, for instance, how we know that the population of Kiev is

1165
00:45:43,840 --> 00:45:45,540
being evacuated at this moment?

1166
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,700
Our biggest problem.

1167
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:51,140
Everybody thinks we got satellite over all Russia and that ain't true.

1168
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:54,800
We watch skis, teach military areas in specific places.

1169
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,660
We can't watch all of Russia.

1170
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,780
So man, a whole bunch of time passed.

1171
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:01,020
There's some radiation detected in Sweden.

1172
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,440
These guys pay all attention to that kind of stuff.

1173
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:05,540
And the moment they said that, we started looking.

1174
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:06,840
We studied the wind.

1175
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:07,920
We studied everything.

1176
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:09,840
And we finally fucking whoops.

1177
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:15,540
We finally discovered that that wind was coming from this particular area down there in that

1178
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,680
part of Russia.

1179
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:22,920
And immediately we sent the appropriate satellite vehicles.

1180
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:24,020
Guided satellite vehicles.

1181
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:26,100
All these are guided man.

1182
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,420
These K-11s.

1183
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:28,440
They got got they got.

1184
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:30,480
They got all kinds of ramble.

1185
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:30,920
Like a video.

1186
00:46:30,920 --> 00:46:31,400
Video game.

1187
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:32,340
Just about.

1188
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:32,960
Just about.

1189
00:46:33,140 --> 00:46:35,360
In fact, the control looks real similar.

1190
00:46:35,920 --> 00:46:37,480
Have you ever operated one of those?

1191
00:46:37,540 --> 00:46:38,460
You want to do that one day?

1192
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:39,180
I'd love to.

1193
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:40,900
Oh, we can get you to do that.

1194
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:41,340
Oh, yeah.

1195
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:42,220
From here in Beijing?

1196
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,400
No, you can't do it from here in Beijing.

1197
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:46,260
You have to go to Tokyo or back.

1198
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:46,660
Or Houston.

1199
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,400
Yeah, Houston.

1200
00:46:48,460 --> 00:46:48,980
That's near.

1201
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:49,860
That's near the bottom.

1202
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:49,880
Yeah.

1203
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,200
Jet Propulsion Lab is the main place.

1204
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,520
You can do it from Washington, too.

1205
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,000
The president likes to do that sometimes.

1206
00:46:54,180 --> 00:46:57,260
He likes to take hold of the joystick and move those suckers around.

1207
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:58,100
I knew you were a hunter.

1208
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,660
You'd not believe what you can see.

1209
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:00,900
But anyway, that's the problem.

1210
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:00,900


1211
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:02,300
That's how all that happened.

1212
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:06,600
You know, I understand you can see down the premier, the front of the premier's blouse

1213
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,140
in Moscow.

1214
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:08,680
Well, it depends on the cleavage.

1215
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:10,340
That's the bottom line.

1216
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,700
It depends on the cleavage.

1217
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:14,200
Most of them, most of them Ruskies got some damn big old.

1218
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:16,680
Well, it depends on cloud cover.

1219
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:37,320
So we're going to have to wait and see.

1220
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,760
Doctores for Bob, friends.

1221
00:47:41,180 --> 00:47:45,140
Well, we've got a caller here coming in with some sort of message, but we can't put it

1222
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:52,480
on at the same time as this beautiful new Mark Mothersbaugh hymn, the Bobcotta, which

1223
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,640
you'll be hearing on the show quite a bit, I'm sure.

1224
00:47:55,000 --> 00:48:00,100
We'll have to get back to our Beijing traffic report next week, because our time is swiftly

1225
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:05,760
beginning to run out that's too bad because well actually we can get a live

1226
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,180
traffic report from Beijing because dr. Garanta is going back there he's gonna

1227
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:17,480

00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:53,320


1236
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:54,760
Well, let's spit them out.

1237
00:48:54,940 --> 00:48:56,700
Okay, first he said, I flung dong.

1238
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:59,000
I flung dong.

1239
00:48:59,560 --> 00:48:59,960
Amazing.

1240
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:01,660
No, listen, listen, listen.

1241
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:03,700
And then he said, one hung woe.

1242
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:04,960
Okay.

1243
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,400
Those are famous book authors.

1244
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,340
No, no, no.

1245
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:09,880
And then he said, we're in the Fungawi.

1246
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:11,080
Uh-huh.

1247
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,740
That's an Indian tribe.

1248
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,140
Okay, what else was it?

1249
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:16,500
We're in the Fungawi?

1250
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:17,100
Yeah.

1251
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:20,540
That's actually derived from the Fugawi tribe.

1252
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:21,380
Oh, really?

1253
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:21,780
Right.

1254
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:30,780
The first two are authors of books respectively titled Brown Spots on the Wall and, oh, I can't remember the other one.

1255
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,980
But I don't think that was Bob.

1256
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:38,860
I think that was perhaps the one whose name we must not say.

1257
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:40,560
He who has no name.

1258
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,400
He who was in heavy rotation for the last three weeks.

1259
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:43,880
Yeah.

1260
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:49,960
Well, tell me some more about the birds because, like, I've got a bird here and I've had problems with her before.

1261
00:49:50,700 --> 00:49:51,480
Well, first.

1262
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:52,860
She may be eating DDT.

1263
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:55,880
Birds kill all the insects and the birds will die.

1264
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:56,960
Okay.

1265
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:03,440
That noble experiment was tried by our comrades in the Far East and it worked wonderfully.

1266
00:50:03,720 --> 00:50:06,500
So if you have lots of roaches, the bird ought to be okay.

1267
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:13,660
Anyway, now a word from your station, the Voice of the People, K&ON, and this is called Dallas PD.

1268
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:15,460
Aye, aye, aye, aye.

1269
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:16,740
Aye, aye, aye, aye.

1270
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:17,720
That's excellent.

1271
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:18,660
That's excellent.

1272
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,960
That was really pretty good.

1273
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:20,320
Okay.

1274
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,620
I'll pull it out and stick it in again.

1275
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:26,120
Forgive me.

1276
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:29,220
Oh, my back.

1277
00:50:29,420 --> 00:50:30,320
There we go.

1278
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:34,820
Yeah.

1279
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,000
Yeah.

1280
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:38,400
Yeah.

1281
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:38,720
Yeah.

1282
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:40,020
Yeah.

1283
00:50:40,020 --> 00:50:40,380
Yeah.

1284
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:40,420
Yeah.

1285
00:50:40,780 --> 00:50:41,380
Yeah.

1286
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:41,840
Yeah.

1287
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:42,040
Yeah.

1288
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,140
Yeah.

1289
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:43,160
Yeah.

1290
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:46,360
Yeah.

1291
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:46,780
Yeah.

1292
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:47,200


1293
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:47,500
Yeah.

1294
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:48,140
Yeah.

1295
00:50:48,380 --> 00:50:48,900
Yeah.

1296
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:49,720
Yeah.

1297
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:51,600
Yeah.

1298
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,540
Oh.

1299
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:52,860
Yeah.

1300
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,400
I don't want to tell you how to you your life.

1301
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:02,300
But please be informed the last couple weekends the Dallas Police Department

1302
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:06,180
has been running a campaign of apparent intimidation in the Deep weiter.

1303
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:06,780
Yeah.

1304
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:12,440
Please be advised that the slightest violation of law, with each result, it'll be improvedπου

1305
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:12,440


1306
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:12,440


1307
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:15,420
They probably do not show out.

1308
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,360
We can see all the shows, at least clearly careful.

1309
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:21,560
He would you to do on the sidewalks and in public and.

1310
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:21,580


1311
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:21,580


1312
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:21,580


1313
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:21,580


1314
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:21,580


1315
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:21,580


1316
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:28,160
have all of your papers in order. Do not let them win in this battle of wills.

1317
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:32,220
This is what I call a battle of wills.

1318
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:25,260
This is what I call a battle of wills.

1319
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:29,380
Conspiracy is everywhere.

1320
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:37,000
As I was saying, those poor Chinese people can get in a lot more trouble than you or me

1321
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,320
for carrying their book of the subgenius in public.

1322
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:43,580
I'm afraid sometimes for my friends in China.

1323
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:47,700
I can imagine Li Jing getting caught and going,

1324
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:51,780
Are you, Li Jing? You read the foreigner's pornography about this man Bob.

1325
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:55,140
We have caught you. You have a choice now, Li Jing.

1326
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,040
Either denounce this Bob and Confucius,

1327
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:01,960
or we will send you to the work camps with bamboo shoots in your eye.

1328
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:03,920
And I would say, and Buck would say,

1329
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:06,560
Li Jing, whatever you do, denounce Bob.

1330
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,000
If Bob walks in, kill him. Don't let him do that to you.

1331
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:12,860
Because friends, not all religions call for martyrs.

1332
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:17,040
Only Bobbies, the pathetic Bobbies, should be martyrs in this church.

1333
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,160
And Li Jing, our Chinese subgenius friends, you're not Bobbies.

1334
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,340
So it's your duty to renounce Bob.

1335
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:27,060
Your duty to Bob, to renounce Bob.

1336
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,140
If not, do not.

1337
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:29,920
Because you're a Chinese subgenius.

1338
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:35,820
And you're free to continue to secretly subvert a red China and bring them around to slack.

1339
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,320
And for the life of thousands of yuan, we'll be coming Bob's way soon.

1340
00:53:40,720 --> 00:53:45,860
Everything half-priced, friends, to Chinese subgeniuses, not counting Taiwan or Hong Kong.

1341
00:53:46,460 --> 00:53:47,720
Half-priced.

1342
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,500
So just remember, folks, Bob is a man, not a god.

1343
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:57,400
God would never understand how the party keeps you enslaved,

1344
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:59,680
how your job keeps you enslaved.

1345
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:00,740
Dick!

1346
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:01,520
Army!

1347
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:02,520
Dick!

1348
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:03,340
Army!

1349
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:08,980
So friends, before we sign off, I have to tell you, I'm going to be doing a marathon run.

1350
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:15,220
I, Reverend Stang, am going to run 2,000 miles along the Great Wall of China on a pogo stick.

1351
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:20,980
And I'm going to be carrying 10,000 copies of the Book of the Subgenius to hand out to those needy Chinese,

1352
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:23,400
spiritually starved Chinese.

1353
00:54:23,680 --> 00:54:28,040
And $100 will put a book of the subgenius in the hand of a China.

1354
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:31,340
Because, friends, those China people need Bob.

1355
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,780
And maybe, I don't know, maybe you need Bob.

1356
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:39,860
Maybe you need to be saved by a Chinese who's already been turned on to Bob.

1357
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:44,220
So from now on, I want our Chinese-American friends to know that you're not forgotten.

1358
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:48,780
And we're going to be bringing you Chinese language, a couple of minutes of slack,

1359
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,160
every couple of weeks here.

1360
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,700
In the meantime, friends, all we can say is...

1361
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,780
Bob loves you.

1362
00:54:58,560 --> 00:54:59,200
Bob loves you.

1363
00:54:59,200 --> 00:54:59,200


1364
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,480
We're going to have to sign off here.

1365
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:04,280
Hang on for Monday morning with the quarterbacks.

1366
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:08,800
And we'll be the Monday morning quarterbacks, friends.

1367
00:55:13,540 --> 00:55:15,540
They're using that shock treatment again.

1368
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:20,620
Friends, Bob gave me my shock treatment.

1369
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,780
I've got that Bob blog for you.

1370
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,760
And friends, remember to send your tithe and your love offerings.

1371
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:30,520
To the Church of the Subgenius.

1372
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:32,940
And do you have that mailing address, friends?

1373
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:37,620
Do you have that mailing address for information, free information from the church?

1374
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:46,360
Post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214 for your free information pack.

1375
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:54,860
Church of the Subgenius, post office box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214, USA.

1376
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:56,840
USA, friends.

1377
00:55:56,840 --> 00:55:57,980
God bless America.

1378
00:55:59,580 --> 00:56:01,240
Praise Bob, friends.

1379
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:06,060
We're going to let Dr. Onan Kanabot's lovely music carry us to the end.

1380
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:06,760
Ah, yes.

1381
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:09,280
If you'll just remember to send those prayer blankets.

1382
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:15,440
We need those blankets and contraceptives for the children in the home for slackless children.

1383
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,060
Ah, yes.

1384
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:16,640
Praise Bob.

1385
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,580
Praise somebody.

1386
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,480
Good.

1387
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:19,080
Yeah.

1388
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:19,820
Yeah.

1389
00:56:19,940 --> 00:56:20,320
Yeah.

1390
00:56:20,360 --> 00:56:20,880
Yeah.

1391
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:21,220
Yeah.

1392
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:21,380
Yeah.

1393
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:21,480
Yeah.

1394
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:21,540
Yeah.

1395
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:21,660
Yeah.

1396
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:21,880
Yeah.

1397
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:21,880


1398
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:21,940
Yeah.

1399
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:22,120
Yeah.

1400
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:22,340


1401
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:22,560
Yeah.

1402
00:56:22,900 --> 00:56:23,280
Yeah.

1403
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:24,080
Yeah.

1404
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:26,020


1405
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:26,200


1406
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:26,460
Yeah.

1407
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:26,460


1408
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:26,460


1409
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:26,460


1410
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:26,460


1411
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:26,460


1412
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:26,460


1413
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:26,460


1414
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:26,460


1415
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:26,460


1416
00:56:26,460 --> 00:56:26,780
Yeah.

1417
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,140
Yeah.

1418
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:34,480
Uh-huh.

1419
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:45,120
Well,

1420
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:45,220
Well,

1421
00:56:46,980 --> 00:56:47,760
yeah.

1422
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:50,180
Even I was just about to say,

1423
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:50,420
uh,

1424
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:50,420


1425
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:50,440
Oh,

1426
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:50,440


1427
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:50,440


1428
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:50,440


1429
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:50,440


1430
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:50,440


1431
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1432
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1433
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1434
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1435
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1436
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1437
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1438
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1439
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1440
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1441
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1442
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1443
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1444
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1445
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,480


1446
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:50,540
Okay.

1447
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:50,540


1448
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:50,540


1449
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:50,540


1450
00:56:50,540 --> 00:56:51,160
All Hail.

1451
00:56:53,020 --> 00:56:53,800
Wall washed.

1452
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:53,880
We're the.

1453
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:56,820
Keep going.

1454
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:06,840
Yes, friends, this was a rerun of an hour of slack, number 33, in fact, from July 1986, recorded in Dallas, Texas.

1455
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:12,260
Nothing in this old recording relates to anything that exists now.

1456
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:18,000
You can learn more about the modern Church of the Subgenius from subgenius.com.

00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:30,560
Or write for information from subgenius at post office box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1458
00:57:30,600 --> 00:57:34,780
And praise Bob, praise Bob, and praise Bob.

1459
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:35,700
Ni hao.

1460
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,660
Franken-Budweiser.

1461
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,480
Watchin' Bob on TV.

1462
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,540
Oh, swallowing red man.

1463
00:57:57,920 --> 00:57:59,840
The day my coon dog died.

1464
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,620
Reading the pamphlet.

1465
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,680
Oh, bird, oh, bird, oh, yeah.

1466
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,180
Eyes drinkin' Budweiser.

1467
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:17,680
And Bob was on TV.

1468
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:27,100
The day that Uncle was good kicked by a mule.

1469
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:31,660
I was with Cousin Junior.

1470
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,200
But the N.A. backfired.

1471
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:40,520
I was drunk.

1472
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,780
I was lonely.

1473
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:45,680
I was plastered.

1474
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:47,980
I was drunk.

1475
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:50,240
I was drinkin' Budweiser.

1476
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:52,460
Ba, ba, ba.

1477
00:58:52,580 --> 00:58:53,540
Ba, ba, ba.

1478
00:58:53,960 --> 00:58:55,460
Ba, ba, ba, ba.

1479
00:58:55,460 --> 00:58:55,880
Ba, ba, ba.

1480
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:55,880


1481
