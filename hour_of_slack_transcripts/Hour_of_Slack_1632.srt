1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,120
The Self-Genius Hour of Swag.

2
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,560
Look, look, there's Susie and there's a big old microphone.

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,840
Yes, I just moved over so you can take a look.

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:14,200
Did you see her third eye glasses?

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,340
Alright.

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,760
That is really an amazing scientific device that she has.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,340
They're Tuatara-like.

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:30,060
It has, it's glasses that have no glass over the eyes but a swiveling glass.

9
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:33,580
Oh, who needs glasses over the eyes?

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:39,280
Oh, I'm just going to sit here and sweat.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,180
Does it pick up sound?

12
00:00:40,180 --> 00:00:41,000
Sounds like a plan.

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,960
There's a, there's a, here, why don't we try, that's what we'll do.

14
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:50,880
Now there's Hanky Panky going with the microphones here.

15
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:52,140
Yeah.

16
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,320
It's like, I'm getting excited.

17
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,160
Microphones hidden in every chair.

18
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:05,040
I know I have to shove this out of her face.

19
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:07,480
Well, do what you must do.

20
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:09,300
She's so polite.

21
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:11,600
We have this bump here.

22
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,440
She doesn't like to lip it like some of us do.

23
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:20,200
No, we don't have spit guards like we have back at Radio Valencia.

24
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,920
No, sir.

25
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:22,160
Which we need to keep.

26
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,260
Michael Peppy from thoroughly wetting the instrument.

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:30,680
Well, Suzy can wet the instrument if she needs to.

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:36,160
Most of this stuff is pretty cheap, and made to work outdoors.

29
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:42,320
We have a foamy protective layer surrounding Mr. Microphone.

30
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,940
It's Mr. Microphone.

31
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:46,780
Hi, girls.

32
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,280
Really, very thr醫jän pal our show.

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,240
I'm extremely suspicious.

34
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:52,320
Okay, everyone, put the book on the table.

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:52,320


36
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,760
Okay, now it's real radio.

37
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,780
Look, there went the audience.

38
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,200
The morning zoo.

39
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,400
We're wacky.

40
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,020
We're crazy.

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,080
We're out of control.

42
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,020
We're certifiably insane.

43
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,620
91.1.

44
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,120
The crazy zoo.

45
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,240
Top farty radio.

46
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,880
That's right.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,300
And Bob Dobbs is a-coming.

48
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,080
Nothing can stop it now.

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,940
The sluice gates have been opened.

50
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,800
Sluice gates.

51
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,240
That sounds good.

52
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,560
The goo-nami.

53
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:23,940
That's true.

54
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,040
I ain't cleaning up after that.

55
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,280
No, fortunately, we won't have to.

56
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,000
Let others sniff and then clean up our mess.

57
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,980
Because they weren't paying attention,

58
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,920
and now they had their fun.

59
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,880
As it says in the Bible, they had their reward.

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,220
And now they must go to their next reward.

61
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,180
Isn't that right, Stan?

62
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,160
Wouldn't you say so?

63
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,420
Oh, Suzy is fanning herself

64
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:51,220
with a seatbelt.

65
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:52,340
She's got a big CD jewel case.

66
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,240
Who ordered the steaming tart?

67
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,640
One of her biggest fans.

68
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:56,940
Vibration.

69
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,420
Yes, I...

70
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,680
I wish you'd been next to me on that

71
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,580
jolting airplane flight I was on.

72
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:08,680
I had to get on a plane.

73
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,560
It was like that shot in an airplane.

74
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,060
The plane, as we were coming into Chicago,

75
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,720
the very rough weather,

76
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:19,960
and the plane started to actually vibrate.

77
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:20,400
Thank you.

78
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,220
People are coming in.

79
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,220


80
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,220


81
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:21,980
People are getting scared,

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,500
but I want you to know, Suzy,

83
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,900
that I remembered that there was a lady

84
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,340
sitting next to me with a low-cut blouse,

85
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,080
and that I knew the top of her chest

86
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,540
would be doing this waveform ripple.

87
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:37,260
And I'm not the kind of person

88
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,400
who's just going to do that

89
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,300
unless I'm next to Suzy.

90
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:42,160
But that's why I wish that you'd been there.

91
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:44,480
Because the best I could do is very...

92
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,280
get one or two glimpses,

93
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,200
and yep, sure enough, just as I thought.

94
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,020
One horrible vibratorians. Oh, it was a beautiful pattern.

95
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,680
It happened to me.

96
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,700
I can remember what my boobs did,

97
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,980
because I'm watching them, too.

98
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:58,100
It's like, whoa, fucking broncos!

99
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,120
I wish I had boobs

100
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,440
that I could see like that.

101
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,700
Oh, wait, I kind of...

102
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,580
I kind of do, a little bit.

103
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,740
They're much smaller

104
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,440
since I lost my...

105
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,760
I think the moves are catching.

106
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,340
Do you wish to use these headphones

107
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:16,440
to hear the exciting Basil Polidorus soundtrack?

108
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,900
Well, then, my dear,

109
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,860
you must wear them.

110
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,800
Yeah, you don't understand.

111
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,280
You're not really here if you're not really hearing.

112
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,080
You know what I mean?

113
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,880
But I have the same problem on my radio show.

114
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,720
I just can't get some people to put them on.

115
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,200
Well, you can't hear

116
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,320
the Conan theme.

117
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,860
I already pointed that out.

118
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:37,840
But then, perhaps,

119
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,100
it is for the best.

120
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,660
That is pretty manly music.

121
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,020
Well, now we do have

122
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,700
politicians like that, so...

123
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,060
Hmm.

124
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,560
Reeves, Freebooters, Reavers...

125
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,600
Have you seen his already doing ads for 2020 campaign?

126
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,280
Have you seen that?

127
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:57,940
No, I haven't.

128
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:01,080
But, of course, what he does best is campaign.

129
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:03,400
They think there's gonna be a 2020.

130
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:04,580
Isn't that cute?

131
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,160
Morons.

132
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,420
It's possible he could go on

133
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,320
amid the ruins, equally deluded

134
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:16,960
that all was

135
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,720
as it should be.

136
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:20,320
Of course,

137
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,360
Reverend Susie Dufluzzi will be saved

138
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,020
from having to go to

139
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:27,200
Trump stop by being

140
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,860
red-headed. She's part of the

141
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,480
orange people.

142
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,040
Colored people, as they've been

143
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,180
dubbed lately. I think by

144
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,820
Obama. Didn't

145
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,040
Obama actually say something

146
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,800
about Trump being a colored person?

147
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,120
That was John Boehner. He said he was a person

148
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,440
of color. Oh, okay.

149
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,280
And therefore could sympathize with him.

150
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,760
I don't want to have to reject my orange hair.

151
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,620
I was blonde.

152
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,640
This past year I've been blonde.

153
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,880
And it was ugly

154
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,980
and frightening. Well, I knew that in

155
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:59,240
theory. You've explained that to me.

156
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,220
And I mean, my rational mind

157
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,260
knew that you had this normal

158
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,880
actual hair. My bangs were the same

159
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,100
tone as my face. And I couldn't

160
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,920
tell where anything was. And since I have no

161
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,980
eyebrows now, because of my

162
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,260
thyroid medication made my eyebrows

163
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,160
fall out, I can't

164
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:15,980
tell what I'm thinking.

165
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:18,760
I mean...

166
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:21,060
They're painted on eyebrows.

167
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,420
I didn't even notice.

168
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,060
Well, they're painted beautifully and they're so orange.

169
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,880
Thank you, they are. You look great.

170
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,420
That's right. You look wonderful.

171
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,800
Don't blow smoke up my ass, dang.

172
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,080
Mmm. Oh, but

173
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:33,820
it's so tight.

174
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,340
Oh!

175
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:38,120
I have the other end up mine.

176
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:40,620
Oh, I wish you could see this, folks.

177
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,180
I think I'm turning into a hidebound old conservative.

178
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,100
Well, that's...

179
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,420
Well, we're not

180
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:48,600
getting any younger.

181
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,160
Uh-huh. That's true.

182
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,240
Oh, yeah, I've gotten

183
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:55,140
to where I kind of

184
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,360
don't like to hear bawdy language

185
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,320
in mixed company.

186
00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,300
No shit?

187
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:02,200
You see what I mean?

188
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,500
These... these Connyites...

189
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,260
Save it. You're not even a Connyite,

190
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,000
I know. You know, those film ladies

191
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
are... they're not gonna know what to make

192
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,040
of you, because, you know, they're kind of

193
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,660
new, and they...

194
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:16,740
I'm un-categorisable.

195
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:19,040
That's my main flaw. Well, it's a pity that the

196
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:21,200
actual insurrectionists aren't

197
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,700
coming. But I can't be pigeonholed.

198
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,560
Right.

199
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:27,040
Right. Well, we're

200
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,960
not gonna pigeonhole you. I can't

201
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,560
speak for the other-holing.

202
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,260
Although, we could

203
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,280
buy a cornhole set. They sell

204
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,220
them around here. The Amish

205
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:37,700
make them.

206
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,440
We could all corn... we could cornhole all...

207
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,640
It's okay to say that now.

208
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,220
You see, that kind of thing's in headlines now.

209
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,980
America's cornhole. Now that it's okay

210
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,820
to use all that foul language

211
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:51,040
in plain newspaper

212
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:53,200
headlines, I don't want to say

213
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:54,800
it anymore. Do you remember the

214
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,260
TV season where suddenly... I'm a reactionary.

215
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,760
...it was okay to say the word

216
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,060
sucks? Yeah, because nobody

217
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,640
knew what it meant. Yeah, that was

218
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:04,840
groundbreaking. Next came

219
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,120
ass. They sneaked

220
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,780
in ass. I was noticing.

221
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,180
I was noticing these things. Well, and

222
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,100
then... And they made it acceptable.

223
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,380
They took the filth

224
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,200
away from our filthy words.

225
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,380
I know, that's why I'm... It's in TV commercials.

226
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,980
I'm reacting by refusing

227
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,100
to be filthy, except in

228
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,320
a conceptual way, henceforth.

229
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,020
Aside from the obvious

230
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:29,120
one's... Bob's one law, fuck

231
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,060
them if they can't take a joke. Obviously,

232
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,920
we... That's... That's a

233
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:35,260
descriptive use of the word.

234
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,860
It's not in any way...

235
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,760
Well, actually, I guess it is

236
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,280
sort of arousing

237
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,220
in a way.

238
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,580
I suppose it could be considered

239
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,720
what's that word? Sexy.

240
00:08:52,220 --> 00:08:52,940
So, yeah,

241
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:55,000
yeah, I'm against all that dirty

242
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,100
talking stuff. Well, you see these filmmakers

243
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:59,120
want to speak to... Now that everybody else

244
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,060
is doing it. They want to

245
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:03,360
talk to the rebels, but the rebels

246
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,180
are rebelling by not coming here,

247
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,880
so they can't

248
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,060
talk to them. I'll have to talk to the

249
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,980
old guard, who can explain

250
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,820
the nature of their

251
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:15,140
doctrinal errancy. There's

252
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,320
not so much cussin' as...

253
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:18,880
Discussin'.

254
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:21,200
Yes. Discussin'.

255
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,960
Discussin'. That's

256
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,000
exactly it.

257
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,140
All of this politically correct crap

258
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,360
is just...

259
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,720
It's up my tailpipe seriously.

260
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,460
Um...

261
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:35,120
Politically correct crap like

262
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,420
the... Like...

263
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,140
Evolution is just a theory?

264
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:41,340
That's politically correct. I'm being offensive

265
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:42,960
when I have no idea what I'm offending. Nowadays.

266
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,880
And it's making me downright

267
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,180
unprofessional about offending, because

268
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:49,040
it's just... It is... The

269
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,880
triggering is... It's all over.

270
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,960
Hmm. Well, I...

271
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,100
And when people actually are offended, I really can't

272
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,060
tell how offended they are, because of the

273
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,520
background level of offense.

274
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:01,120
Right, exactly. It's like when they're trying to

275
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:03,060
track, uh, some sort of

276
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:04,960
intestinal complaint, the background

277
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,000
level of diarrhea was just too great

278
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,120
for them to tell. We've got a background

279
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:11,000
level of diarrhea that is just far

280
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
too fuckin' high. Well, I hear

281
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,400
a lot of the phrase,

282
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,940
I couldn't tell if she was kidding or not. Is she

283
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,140
really that mad? You know.

284
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,820
It's... It's... And that

285
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,040
too is a sin, by not taking

286
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,840
the complaint seriously

287
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:27,140
enough. How dare

288
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,960
the cafeteria serve Vietnamese

289
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,940
food? They're culturally

290
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,220
appropriating, uh,

291
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,760
blah, blah, blah, you know. You

292
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,160
never know what's going to be the specific

293
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,940
thing, but... But,

294
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,620
the whole idea is all

295
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:43,040
actions, transactions are viewed

296
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,240
with suspicion. Guilty

297
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,200
until proven innocent. And

298
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,000
what does that remind anyone

299
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,100
of? Lock me up. I'm guilty, Joe.

300
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,940
Guilty until proven innocent.

301
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:55,160
Isn't that the way French people

302
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,320
do things? And isn't

303
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,480
this whole infestation

304
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,360
of our academic and intellectual

305
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,280
discourse something having to do

306
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,380
with French deconstructionist,

307
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,540
French, uh,

308
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,900
philosophy which says every

309
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,140
text is specially

310
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,960
motivated and you have to

311
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,000
deconstruct it and find

312
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,100
out what they really mean,

313
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:19,020
which is some unpleasant

314
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,040
thing for everyone else and

315
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,680
something which, only for them.

316
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,140
You see, since they can't win on

317
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,100
the battlefield, as in the battle of

318
00:11:27,100 --> 00:11:29,120
Crecy, they try to

319
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,100
take us apart from, from,

320
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,580
uh, inside.

321
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:35,020
You're, you're fomenting a war

322
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,640
on Quebec, aren't you? These

323
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:39,200
Frenchified frogs are the ones

324
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,900
who are really behind everything,

325
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,020
uh, but now they have

326
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,800
done their part and they can

327
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,860
sit aside and shrug

328
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,220
their shoulders in gallic

329
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:51,180
incomprehension. There was a

330
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,500
great commercial for FedEx,

331
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,160
I don't know if you saw it, with, uh...

332
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,820
I thought we needed more Frenching.

333
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:59,020
In France, there's a,

334
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,180
uh, you know, they're trying to deliver somebody's

335
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,300
package and the guy instead is sitting

336
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,160
in a cafe and saying, I am bored.

337
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,940
This job is

338
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,920
pointless. And meanwhile in the background

339
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:11,180
they're going round and round the traffic

340
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:13,200
calling round about running over the packages

341
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,960
which he's, he's just thrown

342
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,860
there. Um,

343
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:19,160
and frankly that's about

344
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,000
the way it is.

345
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,040
I'm a Franco-American. It's like

346
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,880
French-American, but it's like

347
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,120
Italian food, but it's not even Italian food.

348
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,020
Well that was, uh, Rocknar's plan

349
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:31,280
was to sell Chef Boyardee

350
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,920
spaghetti to Europeans

351
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,600
since they... Oh, what the hell?

352
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,840
I grew up thinking

353
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,260
Franco was an Italian.

354
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,760
Well, he's a Spaniard.

355
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,100
The whole thing is all mixed up and crazy.

356
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:45,020
It's a bunch of crazy stuff. It's a Mediterranean

357
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:47,160
culture from the fragmenting

358
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,900
Roman Empire, still not

359
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,140
thoroughly fragmented. And how do you tell

360
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,980
the conspiracy from just freaking

361
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,080
sloppiness? Because they're trying

362
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:56,840
to put you in the Black Iron prison

363
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:59,180
all the time and they never stop. One way

364
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,260
or the other. And when you can discern

365
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,080
that, uh, their

366
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:05,140
aim, well there's the whiff of

367
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:07,200
the conspiracy that you need

368
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,120
to step clear of their

369
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,620
muck and mess and

370
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,200
twaddle and foof-a-raw and terradiddle.

371
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,200
They ain't gonna get me.

372
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,140
That's right. They already

373
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:18,640
got me. They got me, uh,

374
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,620
all the way. Agile, elfin. And then I

375
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,860
escaped. Spry sprang.

376
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:25,140
I've escaped. Stang, sprang,

377
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,380
sprang out of the way.

378
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,060
I know, I know. I wish I could

379
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,160
take everyone with me.

380
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,800
I've escaped. I've barely escaped

381
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,160
with my life. You know, you can't help

382
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,280
others before you help yourself.

383
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,620
I've been escaped. I've got a really bad sense of direction.

384
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,280
I was told that in Hollywood.

385
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:42,960
You were told what?

386
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,200
Uh, well,

387
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,780
uh, before

388
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:49,140
every show, there's a position

389
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,000
called the warm-up

390
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,760
guy. Oh, right.

391
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:54,080
It's a very low position. I've told you about this.

392
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,540
They come out and they keep the

393
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,200
bust-in audience

394
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:01,200
comfortable by telling them stupid jokes

395
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,700
and so on. They will never

396
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,760
advance, although they desperately

397
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,220
long to advance their career. So I asked

398
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,320
the producer of our show,

399
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,860
what about, uh, this

400
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,160
I'm talking about one person who was

401
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:14,940
doing it, uh, could we help her?

402
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,120
And he said, well, you know, you can't help the others

403
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,720
before you help yourself, you know.

404
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,120
We've got to get ourselves going. And then we'll be able to

405
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,280
pull all these other people along with us.

406
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,180
How's that for the reasoning

407
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:29,220
that you get in the magic

408
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,920
world of Hollywood?

409
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:33,260
You have to help yourself.

410
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,160
Otherwise, you're not going to be able to help

411
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,480
others. Well, that's true. Help yourself first.

412
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,740
I can't argue with that.

413
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,280
But it's the excuse

414
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:43,340
for never helping anyone but yourself.

415
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,060
That could be an

416
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,820
excuse. Why not both, you know?

417
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,840
It makes sense,

418
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,200
you know, I think he honestly believes

419
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,120
in the rightness of

420
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,280
what he was saying. Well, since he was a big Hollywood

421
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,060
star, wasn't it in time

422
00:14:57,060 --> 00:14:59,000
for him to give somebody else a break?

423
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:00,860
Well,

424
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,640
we were starting a new show,

425
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,140
wanted to make sure, you know,

426
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,120
nothing went wrong.

427
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,040
Hey, speaking

428
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,340
of a break,

429
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,320
I've become a publisher

430
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:15,240
again. And we're publishing

431
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:17,480
as our first book, Lonesome Cowboy

432
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,400
Dave's novel, Neighbor World.

433
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:21,200
That's right. We're going to follow that. The church was saying, you know, we're going to follow that.

434
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:22,580
Genius is a publisher now.

435
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,240
We're going to follow that with

436
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,680
Nicholas Kingsley's

437
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,260
Eyelash,

438
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,040
and then a

439
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:32,180
book about Bob,

440
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:35,140
or a collection of novellas about Bob

441
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,940
called The Ancient and Mr. Dobbs

442
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,620
by the great Teeters LaVerge.

443
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,760
Those are easy because

444
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,840
they're just text.

445
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:45,100
By then, I feel like I'll be

446
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:46,560
ready to reprint

447
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:48,480
our out-of-print books

448
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:51,040
like Three-Fisted Tales of Bob, which

449
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,100
I do have rights to.

450
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,660
Or Bob's Favorite Comics?

451
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,020
Bob's Favorite Comics, if I can get the rights

452
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:58,860
to it. Technically, that's

453
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,940
still owned by Ripoff Press.

454
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,060
But I'm sure they'd probably let us

455
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,120
have it for a dollar.

456
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,900
Sure they would. They never had that much faith

457
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:08,420
in the project to begin with.

458
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,740
But what you ought

459
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,080
to do if there are certain people

460
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,600
who will not relinquish the rights

461
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,120
is commission new

462
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,560
strips to be laid in

463
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,180
for this special edition.

464
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,180
Well, yeah, that's the thing.

465
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,780
Three-Fisted Tales of Bob will be

466
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,560
different from the conspiracy version.

467
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:28,860
It'll have Nancy Collins' story in it,

468
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:29,400
for one thing.

469
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,040
I'm going to reprint all the

470
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,960
Stark Fist stuff.

471
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:36,760
The ancient Stark Fist magazines,

472
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:38,720
those have already been scanned

473
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,140
and are ready to

474
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,320
be assembled. Do you still have the huge

475
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,080
piles of yellow Stark Fists

476
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:45,940
from your basement?

477
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:49,100
No, I have small piles of yellow

478
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,940
Stark Fists. But remember the...

479
00:16:51,220 --> 00:16:51,460
The Stark Fists.

480
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:53,900
Movie makers wanted special collectible

481
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,460
subgenius swag to give away to contributors.

482
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,780
And what could be better than

483
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,540
some archaic issue of

484
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,680
the Stark Fist, which otherwise

485
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,860
is too historically interesting to

486
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:06,640
destroy, but you can't...

487
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,820
You know, you've got a lot of storage problems,

488
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,960
so why not give them each

489
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:12,120
an ancient fist?

490
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:16,740
As part of the

491
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,080
swag bag, is my

492
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,060
thought. Well, eventually that

493
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:22,620
might happen. I could...

494
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:25,120
You've got to look after yourself first, Dr. Halle.

495
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,260
I could sell them on eBay for 50 bucks a piece.

496
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,900
Oh yeah? Well, if that interest is

497
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,940
there, I quite understand your

498
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,820
recalcitrance to give it away to

499
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,080
hedge fund managers and other

500
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:37,260
worthy... Those things are becoming

501
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,200
quite rare. There are

502
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,140
not that many of them left. Well, I thought you

503
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,960
had giant, yellowed

504
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,160
piles. Philo does. He stole

505
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,240
them from me. I paid for all that

506
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,300
stuff. Lost my ass,

507
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,980
too. That's why we couldn't... Publishing...

508
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,300
But now, you don't have to actually

509
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,080
print anything. You just

510
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,960
sell it, and when somebody

511
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,140
buys it, then this company far away

512
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,940
prints it. And they keep

513
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:03,040
more than half of the money, depending

514
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,360
on how much you mark it up. Well, who proofreads

515
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,960
this? I spent last

516
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,120
month proofreading Dave's

517
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,140
book. Did you find a number

518
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,900
of typos? No.

519
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:14,740
I found a whole lot of

520
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,820
paragraph problems and spacing

521
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,520
problems, little...

522
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,060
But Dave had been over at

523
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,080
the library a million times.

524
00:18:22,660 --> 00:18:24,680
There were no stylistic changes.

525
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:27,040
Good for him. It seems like he really threw himself

526
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,980
into that job. It's great.

527
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:31,020
The book is really... I'm anxious to read

528
00:18:31,020 --> 00:18:33,380
the book. I've got ten copies

529
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,080
of them here. Well, I may not be able

530
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:37,160
to read this iteration, but I will read...

531
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,040
They're proof copies, because it technically

532
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:41,200
hasn't really been published yet. I was able to get

533
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,100
proof copies for cheap, like three bucks

534
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,080
each, but you can only get five per

535
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,940
proof. So I kept making

536
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:49,060
minute changes and getting new

537
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,120
proofs, but they're slowly

538
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,880
getting out, so I only have ten,

539
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,440
and I guess we might auction them.

540
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,720
I've got to save a few for

541
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,120
people who reserved them

542
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,120
in advance. But we'll have

543
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,940
plenty of them soon enough. Great.

544
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,040
And, yeah, I'm

545
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:07,100
real excited about reprinting

546
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,820
our old stuff, and there's mountains

547
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:11,080
of stuff that's never been seen

548
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:12,360
except by me.

549
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,160
That happened between the last of the print

550
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,160
publishing and the beginning of the internet,

551
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,240
and nothing after the internet

552
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:21,120
ever got published to speak of,

553
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:21,800
except that

554
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:25,240
the final, last book,

555
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:26,740
the Bobliographon.

556
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,700
That was almost all internet material.

557
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,080
But we've got tons

558
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:33,520
of wonderful collages

559
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,920
that no one's ever seen,

560
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,240
artwork by great

561
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,560
cartoonists, such as

562
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,360
Hal Robbins, Paul Mavridi,

563
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,120
Yes,

564
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,380
many... Even Philo Drummond.

565
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,080
He's

566
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:49,020
become a painter in his

567
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:50,820
latter years, like George W. Bush.

568
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,020
Yeah.

569
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,800
Yeah, he's been taking

570
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,240
lessons from Reverend

571
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,000
K. R. K. Ryden.

572
00:19:58,540 --> 00:20:00,740
A great guy and a subgenius.

573
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,360
An unapologetic subgenius.

574
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,820
We'll be seeing him at the

575
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,120
devotional. That's great.

576
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,420
On my saucer.

577
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,080
What date,

578
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,700
earth date, did that take place on?

579
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,280
July 28th, unfortunately.

580
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,280
It's in Cleveland, on my

581
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:18,900
saucer. Me be gone

582
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,300
on other pleasure trips.

583
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,020
The devotionals

584
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,880
are really fun. They're kind of similar to

585
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,300
X-Day because, well,

586
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:28,800
half the crowd is crossover,

587
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:29,880
really.

588
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:31,320
And, um,

589
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,120
you never saw so many people with glasses

590
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:36,080
on in one room.

591
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,260
Wow, a glittering, flashing... It's a regular

592
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,860
sausage party, too. It's at least as bad as

593
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,060
subgenius, maybe worse.

594
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,880
Is that why we never get off this planet?

595
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:46,960
You always have plans for August

596
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,100
and September.

597
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,960
I said on my saucer. I've been

598
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,960
advertising Starwood

599
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,160
to be on my saucer for a long time.

600
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,980
We keep up Earth dates on the

601
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:58,940
saucers. They're big, you see. I'm starting to put

602
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,440
doo-doo and doo-doo together. They're big.

603
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,960
Oh, boy, it's about time, see.

604
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,960
How long has it been? You joined the church

605
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,400
in 1981 or something like that?

606
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:08,900
Yeah, back when the Earth was cooling.

607
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,760
Yes, that was, uh...

608
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,960
Well, soon we'll be restoring the Earth

609
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,160
to its original state.

610
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,000
Pure magma and

611
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:19,120
poisonous gas. Like the bubbling

612
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,020
cherry pie. Back to nature.

613
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:22,320
Before the Indians.

614
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,960
You know, before the animals. Before

615
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:26,600
multicellular creatures.

616
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:27,700
...better than they do.

617
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,580
Eye farts? Or is that like... Pie farts.

618
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,820
Oh, pie. Pie farts.

619
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:35,080
Oh, God. They're

620
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:37,200
pathetic. I thought eye farts were

621
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,600
like the iPhone or something.

622
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,800
...and then peel them. Uh-uh.

623
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,480
Especially in an enclosed Buick.

624
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,500
No, it's just a... A Buick.

625
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,960
...a digress. A digress.

626
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:51,120
You know what? I can actually hear what everybody's

627
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:52,840
saying. I haven't...

628
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,100
I mean, except for that one that you

629
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,960
just said, because I was talking at the same time.

630
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,700
But when I'm not talking, I can understand

631
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,000
things now. I've been...

632
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,980
I've been reading lips and guessing

633
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:04,560
for about 15 years.

634
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,080
I had no idea what anybody's really

635
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,620
saying. So,

636
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,080
you know, if I sometimes seem to be talking about

637
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,940
a completely different subject than anybody

638
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,600
else, that's... That was why.

639
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,080
I guess I could still do that.

640
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:19,060
I stopped being able to hear, and I

641
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,680
countered it with just not caring

642
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,960
anymore. Well, that's what I did for

643
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,040
15 years. That takes a lot of the sting out, but if it's

644
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:27,260
something important, like, hey, that's on fire.

645
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,140
Yeah, I miss it.

646
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,940
Well, I've been... I've been able to understand

647
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,740
lyrics that I couldn't understand

648
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:35,000
when I was 21. And now

649
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,060
does that sadden you, that you're

650
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:39,200
understanding... I've been deaf my whole life.

651
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,240
Sometimes you make up better lyrics... It's just got a lot worse.

652
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,400
...than the ones that are actually there.

653
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,720
Well, this

654
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,840
$2,000 per ear

655
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:48,900
little gizmo has

656
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,480
made a big

657
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:52,940
difference. Thank God I

658
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,080
had the $2,000 per ear

659
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,780
that year. You have to remember

660
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,040
to switch it on.

661
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,000
To what? To turn

662
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,040
on the switch. Oh, yeah.

663
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:03,900
To switch it on.

664
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,780
Pull the switch! Pull the switch!

665
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:07,960
Pull the switch!

666
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:10,900
Otherwise, they are

667
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,460
sitting inertly there,

668
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,300
not doing their job.

669
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:16,200
Sometimes

670
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,980
I forget to put them in when I

671
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,100
get out of bed in the morning.

672
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,060
Everything seems so comfortable

673
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,300
and nice. So quiet.

674
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,760
So quiet, and it's like a blanket of

675
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,160
soothing nothingness.

676
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:30,580
No annoying rattling...

677
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,600
I look at Princess Wee, and she's going like this.

678
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:36,880
Everything's velvet

679
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,280
till I put on my glasses.

680
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:42,760
Well, at least I don't have to put the

681
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:45,020
stent in and out of my heart every morning.

682
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,740
But I do have to remember to take my pills,

683
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,720
that's for sure. My heart will reject

684
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,060
the little metal thing.

685
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,100
You are not!

686
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,400
So I do remember those pills.

687
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,160
That's your nut!

688
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,820
You're having nut attacks.

689
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:01,080
Nut attacks?

690
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:02,240
Not again!

691
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,940
You can't have a heart and work for Dobbs.

692
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:07,160
That...

693
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:08,260
Well...

694
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:08,980
He got mine!

695
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,780
That's why I've been feeling so slackful

696
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,080
and happy lately.

697
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,780
I don't have a heart anymore.

698
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,520
No wonder I've been feeling so...

699
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,360
generally carefree.

700
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,980
Like I don't give a shit.

701
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,080
Like who cares if almost everybody else

702
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,720
is miserable and starving?

703
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:28,660
Wow!

704
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,140
Thanks Bob for taking my heart away!

705
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,780
I think I...

706
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:33,280
Wow!

707
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,860
Now I see why Philo and them voted

708
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,720
for that guy.

709
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,120
Huh.

710
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,160
That explains a lot.

711
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,600
Hmm.

712
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,800
I'm gonna become a Republican!

713
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,240
That only makes sense!

714
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,800
Fuck everybody else!

715
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,240
A r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-r-e-publican.

716
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,620
Well, I don't.

717
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,280
Actually, actually you can't...

718
00:24:58,280 --> 00:24:59,280
No.

719
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,260
There are many subgenius Republicans,

720
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,980
they are a minority,

721
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,920
I think.

722
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,120
They're certainly a minority on the internet.

723
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,260
I notice that when they put up posts,

724
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:13,080
those are also swiftly taken down

725
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,220
before I can get there.

726
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:20,240
Well, there's no law against being a right-wing fanatic and a subgenius at the same time, not under my law.

727
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:26,960
No, but there are subgenius administrators who don't want the sites used for GOP propaganda.

728
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,500
Right, no, well...

729
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:31,920
And so by the time I get there, as I say, this post has been...

730
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:34,360
Well, we also don't use it for Democrat propaganda.

731
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:40,700
We do use it as propaganda for slack, for sure.

732
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:50,580
But the main purpose of most of those news groups is actually to lift the spirits and give people a little chuckle in this grim, grim world.

733
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:51,780
That's right.

734
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:57,720
And occasionally they use GoFundMe things to save each other's asses.

735
00:25:57,780 --> 00:26:06,060
Every time somebody's car goes down, if they are not too proud to beg, within a day and a half,

736
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:10,560
they usually manage to raise the repair money from their...

737
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:18,120
their old buddy subgeniuses, most of whom can't send more than ten bucks each, but, you know, a hundred...

738
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:22,320
Well, ten people, ten bucks, that's a...

739
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,720
Shame the Christians with your generosity and empathy.

740
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:32,540
Yeah, well, yes, and that's why we encourage people not to litter here,

741
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,220
because we want to make the pagans look like litter bugs compared to us.

742
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:37,580
That's important.

743
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,400
It's an ego thing, you know, it's just one of those us and them.

744
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:43,440
It's not necessarily good behavior on our part.

745
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:44,440
Passing out cigars?

746
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:48,600
I am married to the person who runs the big pagan festival,

747
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:52,780
and some of my best friends are, quote, pagans, unquote.

748
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:55,840
How do you peg? Is it like how you vike?

749
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,140
How do I what?

750
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,020
How do you peg if you're pagan?

751
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,020
Would either of you like some Turkish delight?

752
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:04,980
Oh, you don't shave your armpits, that's basically what it's about.

753
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,340
Turkish delight, would you like some?

754
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:09,540
My dead mother used to feed this to me.

755
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,500
I mean, before she...

756
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:10,740
She was dead.

757
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:11,640
I would hope so.

758
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:14,500
A few times afterward, but it was even better.

759
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,200
Man, them Turks sure know their onions.

760
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:20,020
It's made with roses.

761
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,240
Hey, would your mom like my dad?

762
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:28,780
They're both in heaven now, or whatever.

763
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:31,360
No, I don't know if my mom had a heaven.

764
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:32,900
She was sensible.

765
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,440
Oh, my goodness.

766
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:35,460
They were sensible parents.

767
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,120
I remember my father driving these two Jehovah's Witnesses,

768
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,200
just off their nuts.

769
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:44,220
They wanted to get out of that place so bad.

770
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,480
And he was relaxed against the frame of the door,

771
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:50,520
like, oh, I've always thought the Bible's nothing but history

772
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,200
and flawed history at that.

773
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:52,820
Whoa.

774
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,800
Oh, God.

775
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,840
That's pretty bald-faced.

776
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:55,540
Yeah.

777
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,180
I'm waiting to be able to...

778
00:27:57,180 --> 00:28:00,900
My line is going to be, but isn't the Bible a book?

779
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,580
Well, I can make a book.

780
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,380
In fact, I did.

781
00:28:06,660 --> 00:28:08,900
And some people actually believed it, too.

782
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:11,640
I certainly do.

783
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,160
I believe my own bullshit.

784
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,420
But I believe Bob's bullshit much better.

785
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,480
That's not my bullshit.

786
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,180
That really is Bob's bullshit.

787
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,320
Who says the Bible is the inerrant word of God?

788
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:24,360
Well, right.

789
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,620
That's the whole point of it.

790
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,720
But it's just a...

791
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,180
I mean, it is a book.

792
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:32,420
I know where books come from.

793
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,260
Supposedly.

794
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,020
They don't grow on trees.

795
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:36,080
They don't just appear.

796
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,160
70 and 2, or maybe just 70 scholars.

797
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:40,440
So much.

798
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:42,380
Composed independently.

799
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:43,860
They don't have those.

800
00:28:44,020 --> 00:28:45,080
Miraculously in agreement.

801
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:47,640
Demonstrating that it was the word of God.

802
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,960
I know where milk comes from.

803
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:50,940
It comes from cows.

804
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:53,320
Those rectangular things at the store.

805
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,060
Those boxed...

806
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:58,120
I thought they came from the kids printed on the side.

807
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:00,600
Oh, that's silly.

808
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,840
That's crazy stuff.

809
00:29:02,020 --> 00:29:02,860
Now I'm disappointed.

810
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,680
I thought they had a personal touch.

811
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:07,020
That's where the missing orphans pictures go.

812
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:09,040
I was in a supermarket once.

813
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:09,620
Princess.

814
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,380
We and I were.

815
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,640
And this mom and daughter approached us.

816
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,500
Mother and daughter combo.

817
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,480
The butcher in the deli laughed at us.

818
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,280
He wouldn't tell us.

819
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:21,960
But what's the difference between lamb and calf?

820
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,340
Or veal?

821
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:27,960
One's a baby cow and one's a baby sheep.

822
00:29:29,060 --> 00:29:30,100
What's a sheep?

823
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,700
They weren't kidding.

824
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,880
These were Americans.

825
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,540
I was thinking, what did they not get Sesame Street?

826
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:39,500
I go, well, the cows are the big ones with horns.

827
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,640
They've never been outside the plastic vacuole.

828
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:43,460
The sheep are the smaller white ones.

829
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,240
Huh?

830
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,500
A biblical term.

831
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,040
I couldn't figure out.

832
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:50,520
Sheep go bop.

833
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:51,740
Cows don't move.

834
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:55,160
It kind of shocked me.

835
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:59,900
They didn't understand the difference between cow and sheep.

836
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,280
Tell them to do a word search on cow and sheep.

837
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,960
Tell them to Google sheep and cow.

838
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,280
I don't press images.

839
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,300
You could have taken them out for lunch.

840
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:10,680
Where's the cow?

841
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:11,300
Andreas.

842
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,000
I'll have to hear that when I play it back.

843
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,020
Did you desire further acquaintance with them?

844
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,500
Well, I did.

845
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,260
Actually, try to teach them as much barnyard basics as I could.

846
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:26,440
You raised your right leg.

847
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,040
That's it.

848
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:27,580
Very good.

849
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:29,820
Now put your right leg down.

850
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:30,400
Very good.

851
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,260
And raise your left leg.

852
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:32,580
No.

853
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,460
Your left leg.

854
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,080
Very good.

855
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:36,500
Yeah.

856
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:38,120
It was a little, a little shocking.

857
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,280
No?

858
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:39,480
See.

859
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:39,480


860
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:39,480


861
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:39,480


862
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:39,480


863
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:39,480


864
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:41,720
Not even Sesame Street, I take it.

865
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,600
No, that's some production about liberals

866
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,240
with frisking people of color in it

867
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:52,820
that all good rednecks abominate.

868
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,800
Really, they don't like Sesame Street.

869
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,320
Some of them don't.

870
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,780
I mean, there's great variation,

871
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:00,960
but they don't like the urban aspect

872
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,600
of Sesame Street, as they say.

873
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,660
Hold on just a second.

874
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:05,220
I need to...

875
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,260
I have to go get spurred.

876
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,280
Peace to you, hippie brother.

877
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,320
All right, now calm yourself.

878
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,880
Dang, everything's going to be all right.

879
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:13,580
And Reverend Susie,

880
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:15,680
would you like another piece of Turkish delight?

881
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:18,100
Oh, I would love another piece of Turkish delight.

882
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:20,700
They say this particular type of Turkish delight

883
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,240
makes you want to continue to eat it

884
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:24,980
and to eat nothing but it.

885
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:29,340
But I'm sure a few more pieces wouldn't be harmful.

886
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,680
They're odd gelatinous cubes.

887
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:35,620
Yes, they are like the excreta of the wombat.

888
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:36,440
Yeah.

889
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,520
Many people don't know that the wombat...

890
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,720
But they taste so much different from that.

891
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:42,600
Oh, definitely, of course.

892
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,500
It was wrong of me to make the comparison,

893
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:46,080
but the wombat...

894
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,100
Of course, the wombat cubes are not...

895
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:51,600
Wombat feces come out in the form of cubes.

896
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,580
The only creature on Earth that...

897
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,740
God does not play dice with the universe

898
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:58,480
except in the case of the wombat.

899
00:31:58,520 --> 00:31:58,700
Yeah.

900
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:03,140
You can easily find pictures of these amusing fumits

901
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:06,140
on the Internet if you just look up wombat.

902
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:09,780
But also, there's a lot of pictures of girls

903
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,400
cuddling with wombats.

904
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:12,520
And what's that all about?

905
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,280
They apparently mold the feces.

906
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,480
Have you ever looked up?

907
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:19,560
They have many sites of girls cuddling with wombats.

908
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:24,320
You know, I never suspected to see that.

909
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,600
And when you see their skeleton,

910
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:29,080
you wouldn't want to cuddle with them

911
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,620
because of the enormous incisor teeth, you know,

912
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:36,240
six or seven times larger, longer,

913
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,040
and sharper than a rat's teeth.

914
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:40,600
But they're very cute and cuddly.

915
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:42,380
You're limited to nutrias,

916
00:32:42,380 --> 00:32:46,140
maybe the occasional capybara wombat's like.

917
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:49,080
There's that creature called the paca,

918
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:50,620
which I think is New World.

919
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:51,240
Oh.

920
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:53,820
And it's raised as a pet until they eat it.

921
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:56,380
I thought the dick dick had an unfortunate name.

922
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:57,920
What?

923
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,600
What's the matter, Stang?

924
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,360
I didn't do it.

925
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,540
I know what you're talking about,

926
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:04,900
and I swear it won't happen again.

927
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:05,460
Do you remember last...

928
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:06,700
Where is this?

929
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,400
You may remember last year.

930
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,420
No.

931
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:11,860
When we were sitting here, Dr. Howell,

932
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,340
I tried to play a message

933
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,560
that somebody had left on my phone

934
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,800
at three in the morning.

935
00:33:18,140 --> 00:33:18,580
Yes.

936
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,900
And it was this guy telling me,

937
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,220
hey, he was going to get me

938
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,740
because I'd wrecked his ex day

939
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:26,520
because I'd banned him from Facebook.

940
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,800
And he was just, you know,

941
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,200
this is how you make things better.

942
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,120
He's up at the gate now trying to get in.

943
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:35,300
His name was the first one on the banned list

944
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:38,960
because he doesn't work and play well with others.

945
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:43,140
And I had to give him his real name

946
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,320
and say, nope, nope,

947
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,120
now he's up there going,

948
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:48,200
well, I don't know why they don't want me.

949
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:48,640
Oh, yeah.

950
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,500
I told Ferg to tell him,

951
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,780
Stang still got your phone call

952
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,200
from last year on his phone.

953
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:56,960
Didn't he drive here from a long...

954
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,480
I'm sure he drove here from Cleveland, Texas

955
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,320
because he's stupid

956
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:03,840
because he's a mentally ill guy

957
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,940
and he's got this...

958
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,820
He thinks he's going to win this battle

959
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,800
against the world

960
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:10,720
because something was unfair

961
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,960
because he did something

962
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,940
that made somebody else mad.

963
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:15,460
I will.

964
00:34:15,460 --> 00:34:16,980
Yeah, like threaten me

965
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:21,160
and then claim he's going to come to my party?

966
00:34:21,220 --> 00:34:21,460
No.

967
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:24,120
That just isn't the way it works.

968
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:26,600
And he's just got to be damn glad

969
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:29,180
that he didn't join Heaven's Gate

970
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,480
or the People's Temple first

971
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,500
because he wouldn't have gotten this far in that case.

972
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:35,580
That asshole.

973
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,280
Jesus fucking Christ.

974
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,920
Fundamentalist subgeniuses.

975
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:41,700
Oh, God forbid.

976
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,700
You don't think he might attempt to sneak onto the ground?

977
00:34:44,720 --> 00:34:45,280
Of course he will.

978
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,900
And perform mischief and malice.

979
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:50,180
Dr. Legame is here.

980
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,960
Why you look as skinny as me?

981
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:58,520
Are you talking about that LeapHouse car from the year?

982
00:34:58,600 --> 00:34:59,000
Yeah, yes.

983
00:34:59,260 --> 00:34:59,600
He's up at the gate.

984
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:01,640
I just ran into him.

985
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,540
He's fucking crazy as shit.

986
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,400
Yeah, no, he needs to be gone.

987
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:07,860
He has been banned.

988
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:10,800
You picked up on that too, did you?

989
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,740
I picked up on that when I blocked him on Facebook.

990
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:13,540
Right, yeah.

991
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,760
He's crazy as a shit.

992
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,280
Right, his name was the first one on the banned list.

993
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,140
That doesn't mean he gets to be in the subgenius ban.

994
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:25,040
Ferg just came and called me and I said,

995
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,840
no, no, no, no, no.

996
00:35:26,580 --> 00:35:29,900
Well, this is becoming this whole part of the show.

997
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:32,560
We'll have to be snipped out, excised.

998
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:34,920
We can't have this be banned.

999
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:38,200
Part of the recording of the happy hour of slack.

1000
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,440
Telling the people the joy of the church and the subgenius.

1001
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:51,900
In fact, this is an unfortunate extrusion of sad political discharge of church policy.

1002
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,780
And we regret its necessity.

1003
00:35:55,040 --> 00:36:02,000
But soon we'll be talking about comic books and monsters and other things

1004
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,640
that will be more transferable.

1005
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:08,600
To other formats, other venues, other locations.

1006
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:15,160
Create a thrilling, inductive resonance of hope.

1007
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:22,540
Well, you know, we're trying to make it seem better.

1008
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:24,340
Have you tried that before?

1009
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,400
Black keys work too.

1010
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:30,580
And you can change the mode here by pushing that.

1011
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,540
It produces belches.

1012
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:34,860
As soon as I found out Facebook had nothing,

1013
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,040
nothing to do with Bob.

1014
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,560
That's the only face I give two shits about.

1015
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,120
Well, remember, a certain apostate subgenius said,

1016
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:46,660
face it, Facebook is the church.

1017
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:52,220
And we had to say, well, you know, that's not really the truth.

1018
00:36:52,580 --> 00:36:56,980
It's an open picture window for the world to throw its garbage through.

1019
00:36:57,560 --> 00:37:02,320
You can put up posts, but then people like Mr. Fropchopula

1020
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,920
will come and kind of crap all over the place.

1021
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:12,400
And then and in the end we are theב

1022
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,440
And this means, most of attempts to remove SpongeBob

1023
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,900
without actually humility are volume aren't honest.

1024
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:18,340
And so thank you for taking that up.

1025
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:18,760
To say, that's not quéf.

1026
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:21,500
corners, we can say that builders appreciate the fact

1027
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:23,360
that technology worry about eight, or we have a fourthMusic is

1028
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:23,740
a problem for even these libraries.

1029
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:24,800
But we're all started to get there because.

1030
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:25,120
We did.

1031
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:34,980
have it on wretch yep I was doing Mozart

1032
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:19,300
the buddy rich tapes and rich they are he's on he's on the bus he's berating his band this is

1033
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,180
like in the 70s I guess 70s 80s where they were going around playing

1034
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:32,080
dinner theater supper clubs and things and all the way on the band he would just mercilessly

1035
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:37,080
lace into them it was like and you're up there and and you're blowing clams

1036
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,520
fucking clams that was what I called bad notes and he would single them out and just

1037
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:50,380
belittle them oh god he was a bastard to work with so they're so they're blowing clams they

1038
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:54,500
they recorded him they're not such a blowing clams there Johnny yes

1039
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,060
I'm also

1040
00:38:55,120 --> 00:39:02,040
barking spiders lizards mm-hmm you blew a lizard it's like hey if I could figure

1041
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,920
out how to do I probably would I'm very fond of them you have a current lizard

1042
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:12,580
in residence now I have three lizards right now I have a good for you I have

1043
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:19,120
two Sudan plaintiff so Jack and girly girl and uh there are they look like

00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:24,480
alligators with a nose job they're really really really smart really

1045
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:32,180
very very mellow smart lizards they ride around on shoulders well and uh they're

1046
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:37,460
really really cool I can't say enough about the Sudan platens and I wound up

1047
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:44,960
with an adopted a knoll little girl who was leaving home from behind me had a

1048
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:49,060
four annuls that she'd caught in it was winter and technically they're illegal

1049
00:39:49,060 --> 00:39:50,340
to keep in Georgia

1050
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:53,860
I figured for the duration of the winter I'd keep them

1051
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,560
and one died

1052
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,460
another one

1053
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:59,740
she'd name them like Jeff and Cliff

1054
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:01,900
and Cliff was old

1055
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,900
Cliff was missing a hind foot

1056
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,200
and it didn't regenerate

1057
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,200
he had big jowls

1058
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,040
he was definitely an old bull

1059
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,560
Jeff on the other hand

1060
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,880
Jeff was entering his prime

1061
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,700
full of piss and vinegar

1062
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:19,160
Jeff was an asshole

1063
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,420
and I love lizards

1064
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,940
I never knew a lizard

1065
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,700
could be such a fucking asshole

1066
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,980
there's like this other little one

1067
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:29,560
in there that I didn't have a name

1068
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,900
I called it Squiggle because of this thing on its back

1069
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,920
and it's like I'm keeping Jeff and Squiggle

1070
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,600
just for the winter

1071
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:37,960
until it's warm enough to let him out

1072
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,900
and Cliff he's got three hots

1073
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,980
and a cock for life

1074
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,360
because he's missing a foot and he's old

1075
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,820
he doesn't want to have to fuck that stuff

1076
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,940
but Jeff was

1077
00:40:47,940 --> 00:40:49,720
making everybody's life

1078
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,300
miserable

1079
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:51,740
he was

1080
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,140
he was

1081
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:52,400
he was just a little bit of a mess

1082
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,820
he was just so macho

1083
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,460
he'd be like bobbing his head

1084
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,600
banging it on things

1085
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:57,800
knocking stuff over

1086
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,600
and that's when they're feeling their oats

1087
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:01,640
it was like

1088
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:03,800
it was basically clubbing them over

1089
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,500
the head with his two dicks

1090
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,940
and you know reptiles have

1091
00:41:06,940 --> 00:41:08,400
two dicks

1092
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,580
they had to come up with a word

1093
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,820
a plural for

1094
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,680
hemipenes

1095
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:14,620
they call them

1096
00:41:14,620 --> 00:41:15,460
hemipenes

1097
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:16,300
hemipenes

1098
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:17,140
hemipenes

1099
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:17,760
yeah

1100
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:20,180
one is a hemipenis

1101
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:22,400
I had a

1102
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,160
I had a lizard who was so tough

1103
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,880
his hemipenis

1104
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,220
prolapsed

1105
00:41:27,220 --> 00:41:29,600
and he roasted it off

1106
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,800
on the hot rock

1107
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,200
I don't know how long

1108
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,760
because I wasn't turning him over

1109
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,720
looking at his butt

1110
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,560
because you can't see anything

1111
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,480
it's like a vent

1112
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,000
it's like

1113
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,400
mmm

1114
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,980
like no blowjob here

1115
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,340
mmm

1116
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,800
and you can't tell

1117
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,880
everything is like inside

1118
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,520
but when they take a dump

1119
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,580
it's like these two things

1120
00:41:46,580 --> 00:41:47,240
will stick out

1121
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:47,520
like

1122
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:49,920
and it's like

1123
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:50,780
what the shit

1124
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:51,300
look like

1125
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,380
look like a

1126
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:54,020
chewed red licorice or something

1127
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:55,080
I'm like what the hell

1128
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,560
also in the dinosauria

1129
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,880
the cloaca

1130
00:41:58,880 --> 00:41:59,960
in the female

1131
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,660
contains all this apparatus

1132
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:03,080
and in the male

1133
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,600
this aperture contains

1134
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:05,660
the hemipenes

1135
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,180
and

1136
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:08,720
they have two willies

1137
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,600
and they don't use them both

1138
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,800
at the same time

1139
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:13,040
well then they're defected

1140
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,320
they're packing a spare

1141
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,100
so Randy

1142
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,000
my first lizard

1143
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:19,780
Randy

1144
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,680
how appropriate

1145
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,920
Randy roasted off

1146
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:22,920
one of his dicks

1147
00:42:22,920 --> 00:42:25,040
because he could really give two craps

1148
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,000
he had another one

1149
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:26,600
and he was like

1150
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,880
oh I'm not fucking

1151
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:28,760
and it's still careless

1152
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,520
and it was in the days

1153
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,760
before computers

1154
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:34,940
it was like about

1155
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,520
80

1156
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,780
can't blame that one

1157
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,280
on computers

1158
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:37,720
no

1159
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:39,020
and then

1160
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,640
when I took him to the vet

1161
00:42:40,640 --> 00:42:41,880
I thought it was like

1162
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:42,360
doo doo

1163
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,660
that wouldn't come out of his vent

1164
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:44,800
and I was trying to pull it

1165
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:45,360
and it was like

1166
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:46,760
on like a gristly bit

1167
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,220
and he was like

1168
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:47,800
ah ah

1169
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:48,400
and I'm like

1170
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,940
what the fuck is that Randy

1171
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:51,440
and I took

1172
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,220
yeah

1173
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:54,600
I try to do a friend a favor

1174
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:57,340
I've lubed up lizard vents

1175
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,400
I'm proud of it

1176
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,460
have you ever subscribed to

1177
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,000
Reptiles magazine

1178
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:07,480
they discuss these matters

1179
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,940
the gay male assistant

1180
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,140
of my vet

1181
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,380
had to write down

1182
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,380
in the records

1183
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,640
you know

1184
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:16,360
by hand

1185
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,600
the update on Randy

1186
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,140
and when I brought him in

1187
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:20,920
it was like

1188
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:21,240
you know

1189
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:21,420
Randy

1190
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:21,700
ahh

1191
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:21,700


1192
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:22,740
Randy Barrows

1193
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:23,560
that's his last name

1194
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:24,820
and it said

1195
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,980
he was supposed to write down

1196
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:27,520
remove

1197
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:28,220
penis

1198
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:30,040
and when he got

1199
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,080
to the penis

1200
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,440
after the removed

1201
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,060
he seized up

1202
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:34,980
and it looked like

1203
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:35,980
a Richter scale

1204
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:38,160
he had to go over

1205
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,040
the penis

1206
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,360
because it was

1207
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:40,680
you know

1208
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:40,900
putting

1209
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:42,580
putting penis next to remove

1210
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:43,600
was just

1211
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:44,440
ah

1212
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:44,680
ah

1213
00:43:44,680 --> 00:43:44,860
ah

1214
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:47,360
it gave him a conniption

1215
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:49,080
maybe he's in the wrong profession

1216
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:51,320
but that's

1217
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,520
how tough lizards are, they will laugh that off.

1218
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:57,180
Yes, lizards laugh at pain.

1219
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,360
And prolapse. Why isn't anybody anti-lapse?

1220
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,040
That would mean

1221
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,140
it was stuck inside the ecological

1222
00:44:11,140 --> 00:44:15,180
atmosphere. It's hardly ever a fun thing. I mean, after a point.

1223
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:19,040
If you just let it alone, ultimately it

1224
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,280
fixes itself, or it doesn't.

1225
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:26,600
So, in the dinosauria also, you see

1226
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,580
these structures. If I were a superhero,

1227
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:34,380
I'd like to have the power of a sea cucumber. Oh, yeah?

1228
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:38,220
Yeah, to just shit my guts out all over.

1229
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,260
And while everyone's trying to figure out, what the fuck?

1230
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:46,880
No, stop. We'll do it. You say. I don't know if I can make my getaway

1231
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,280
though, with my guts all over.

1232
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,780
I haven't thought it out that far.

1233
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:54,920
Has anyone ever found a petrified dinosaur penis?

1234
00:44:56,500 --> 00:45:00,180
I don't believe they have that. I don't know.

1235
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:04,480
They do have all the feces.

1236
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:07,460
I bet they had two. Chances are they've got that.

1237
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:09,120
Yeah, that would be the thing.

1238
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:17,040
But also, the female has evolved

1239
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:18,420
in some species.

1240
00:45:19,480 --> 00:45:23,340
An ovipositor, which is large and bulky,

1241
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:28,920
and makes it immediately easier to see the female

1242
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:32,640
sauropod and recognize it from the male.

1243
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:35,780
For that reason, they carry their tails lower.

1244
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:40,240
And the male's, it's almost prong-like back there.

1245
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:45,160
Hmm. I just thought about biting your neck and mounting you.

1246
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:46,400
You need to stop.

1247
00:45:47,980 --> 00:45:48,540
Well,

1248
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:50,900
I don't know what you're talking about.

1249
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:50,900


1250
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:50,900


1251
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:50,900


1252
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:55,820
I think the larger of the dinosauria had to adopt a similar stratagem.

1253
00:45:56,100 --> 00:45:58,280
I guess horny toads have got two penile.

1254
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,900
That would be right, wouldn't it?

1255
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:00,980
Yeah.

1256
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:04,580
They're extra horny toads.

1257
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:11,080
They are not toads, of course.

1258
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:19,020
How about the stang's immortal newt that they've had for 30 years, and often they've thought,

1259
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,020


1260
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,020


1261
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,020


1262
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:19,020


1263
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:20,920
thought it was dead, but it's still going.

1264
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:21,780
Wow.

1265
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,220
You know.

1266
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,520
A 30-year-old newt?

1267
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:28,600
It just endures forever and ever

1268
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:30,340
in its little tank.

1269
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,980
What is the general lifespan

1270
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:34,020
of an American newt?

1271
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,700
Well, they generally don't get a chance

1272
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:38,600
to live so long. In the wild,

1273
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,380
something always gobbles you up,

1274
00:46:40,440 --> 00:46:41,740
but if you get the chance...

1275
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,280
30 minutes.

1276
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:46,120
Well, I don't know. This newt, you know

1277
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:48,320
what I mean. It's lasted. It's still

1278
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:50,360
ongoing because I heard them

1279
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:51,560
arguing about feeding him.

1280
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,200
Like the last sea monkey, right?

1281
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:56,200
It has its

1282
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,220
own way of being kept

1283
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,160
that is

1284
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,120
making it thrive.

1285
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:03,720
It's violating

1286
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:06,560
amphibian physics.

1287
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,340
Did you see Stang's

1288
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:10,200
little video that he made

1289
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:11,540
of it some time ago?

1290
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,880
He synchronized some of the

1291
00:47:14,780 --> 00:47:16,480
beast from 20,000 Fathoms

1292
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:18,220
score to his video.

1293
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:20,780
Did you see that one?

1294
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,740
It was quite well done.

1295
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:24,320
As he fed the newt.

1296
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,780
Where can we find that? Will that be on the subgenius.com?

1297
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:28,200
It might be. Fortunately,

1298
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,760
we've got Ivan Stang right here

1299
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,680
and after he returns from his

1300
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:35,040
unfortunate duties...

1301
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,760
Okay, they might be killing a guy.

1302
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:38,740
Something. We don't have to

1303
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:40,020
be concerned.

1304
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:41,960
Barbecue in three hours.

1305
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,440
But really,

1306
00:47:44,560 --> 00:47:46,440
on the other hand, just out of...

1307
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:47,580
...

1308
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,300
...

1309
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1310
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1311
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1312
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1313
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1314
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1315
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1316
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1317
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1318
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1319
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1320
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1321
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1322
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1323
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1324
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:48,300


1325
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:48,540
...

1326
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:49,940
...

1327
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:51,820
...

1328
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1329
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1330
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1331
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1332
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1333
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1334
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1335
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1336
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1337
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1338
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1339
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1340
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1341
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1342
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1343
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1344
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1345
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1346
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:51,820


1347
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,200
Was there a noise? Was there a sound?

1348
00:47:53,220 --> 00:47:53,580
Yeah.

1349
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,240
Oh my God. Hornets.

1350
00:47:55,520 --> 00:47:58,360
Oh yes, they hover around.

1351
00:47:58,360 --> 00:48:00,620
Just hold your breath and your foreslam shut.

1352
00:48:00,860 --> 00:48:01,140
Oh yeah?

1353
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:04,100
Somebody told me that and I believed it.

1354
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,100
I heard if you ate bananas...

1355
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:06,660
I never get stunk.

1356
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,060
Hold your breath and your foreslam shut.

1357
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:11,580
I can't stick their stingers in.

1358
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,380
No, that's bullshit.

1359
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:15,580
Too bad.

1360
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:17,400
I got to do that when I was like

1361
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:18,260
12.

1362
00:48:18,260 --> 00:48:18,300
I was like 12.

1363
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:18,300


1364
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:18,300


1365
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:19,800
And I believed it.

1366
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,860
It made sense to me.

1367
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:24,140
And I never got stung.

1368
00:48:24,140 --> 00:48:26,160
Except for one time when I wasn't ready.

1369
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,220
I was rage sweeping.

1370
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,480
Oh, and you weren't prepared to hold your breath.

1371
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:32,060
Something that was in the silk flowers that I was in.

1372
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,000
I was on the phone with my brother.

1373
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,440
I was having a horrible birthday.

1374
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:36,120
Flowers.

1375
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:40,160
He got that kind of phone call that he would have paid money

1376
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,620
to hear his sister squawking.

1377
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,480
It's like, oh my God.

1378
00:48:45,480 --> 00:48:46,860
This thing stings hard.

1379
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:48,120
Well, I...

1380
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:50,620
I did say that last time when I was here,

1381
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,140
one blundered into my face and stung me,

1382
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:55,500
kind of as an afterthought.

1383
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:58,760
And I wasn't doing a damn thing.

1384
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:04,680
So that was enough to increase my ire toward their species.

1385
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:10,040
As you can see, I'm all left alone.

1386
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,540
And there's not even any music here.

1387
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,720
And yet a recording is happening.

1388
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,220
Everything's going fine.

1389
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,280
I don't suppose you can hear it.

1390
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,420
I suppose you'd like to get on the other microphone

1391
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:22,500
instead of earphones.

1392
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,580
Yes, we can be supported.

1393
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:29,000
Fill in the blanks.

1394
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,840
Proceed to check out.

1395
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,760
All will be well.

1396
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,940
And all manner of things will be well.

1397
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:42,020
Now, Reverend Mother Dr. Miller is going to join us

1398
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:48,020
in this enchanting bobcast at X Day 20.

1399
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:53,020
Here in Caffeina's snazzy cafe.

1400
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:53,900
All right.

1401
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,420
First of all, I want in on some of this here.

1402
00:49:57,220 --> 00:49:58,280
Turkish delight.

1403
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,360
Rose petal infused Turkish delight.

1404
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,320
Have some more.

1405
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:02,500
Please, please.

1406
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:09,900
I wonder how many calories are in each one of these wombat-esque cubes.

1407
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:10,280
Zero.

1408
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,000
Precisely zero.

1409
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:11,620
Really?

1410
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:13,240
These are the calorie-free.

1411
00:50:13,300 --> 00:50:15,820
These are calorie-free Turkish delight?

1412
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:16,500
No, they're not.

1413
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:17,140
Oh, they're not.

1414
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:17,800
Oh, well.

1415
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:18,600
Too much.

1416
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,280
Calorie-free sugar-filled.

1417
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:19,740
You could believe.

1418
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:20,620
Go ahead.

1419
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,100
Have one.

1420
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:22,240
The first one's free.

1421
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:23,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1422
00:50:23,340 --> 00:50:24,780
And who are you, good sir?

1423
00:50:25,320 --> 00:50:26,280
Reverend Frogtoes.

1424
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:27,680
Reverend Votos?

1425
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:29,040
Frogtoes.

1426
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:29,460
Frogtoes.

1427
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,380
It's Reverend Frogtoes, who is here for the first time.

1428
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:32,840
And from what state do you hail?

1429
00:50:32,840 --> 00:50:34,320
We came all the way here from North Dakota.

1430
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,060
All the way from North Dakota.

1431
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:37,320
And with you is the lovely?

1432
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:40,340
Amber Sofar, but we're working on it.

1433
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,060
Amber Sofar.

1434
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,380
Sister Sofar.

1435
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,420
Praise his sweet name.

1436
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:47,780
I'm so grateful that you guys are here.

1437
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:47,780


1438
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:47,780


1439
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:47,780


1440
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:47,780


1441
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:47,780


1442
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:47,780


1443
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:47,780


1444
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:48,720
You guys made it here safe and alive?

1445
00:50:49,000 --> 00:50:49,340
Yes.

1446
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:53,640
Amber provided a bandage for Princess Wee last night when she took a couple.

1447
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:57,020
And she provided lipstick for my frop earlier, my frop stick earlier.

1448
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:57,360
It was nice.

1449
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:59,900
Beautiful rose petal colored frop stick.

1450
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:00,360
It was nice.

1451
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:05,540
And then Stang roused me from the hammock and rolled.

1452
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:06,020
He did?

1453
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:06,740
Yes, he did.

1454
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:08,180
What's that all about?

1455
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:10,800
He said, Dr. Howell has summoned you for pie.

1456
00:51:12,860 --> 00:51:14,660
Boy, how messages get garbled.

1457
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,800
It's like the game of telephone.

1458
00:51:17,420 --> 00:51:19,340
Did you ever get a piece of pie?

1459
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,440
I didn't.

1460
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,680
No, that is most regrettable, unfortunately.

1461
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,000
All variety of other things, but no pie.

1462
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:27,760
I mean, it was part of the con.

1463
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,300
No pie for me.

1464
00:51:30,280 --> 00:51:34,340
Well, there still is enough pie for you to have a piece if you would like.

1465
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,420
Is it the one that's got the spaceship emblazoned on the top of the crust?

1466
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,960
It did, but now it's no more.

1467
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:45,240
I mean, you just get chunks of pie which have been transferred to another pan.

1468
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:52,840
But it did have, yes, a flying saucer, cross pipes, X for X day, the number 20 in the background.

1469
00:51:53,120 --> 00:52:02,060
Dr. Howell, would you be so kind as to pass my luge there, my, no, no, the absinthe that is now cloudy.

1470
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,160
Here it is.

1471
00:52:03,280 --> 00:52:04,560
Bo, would you care for a swaggle?

1472
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,480
Who the butt?

1473
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:06,740
What?

1474
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:08,740
It's Mr. Bo Ragsdale.

1475
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:09,980
We have an extra mic, do we not?

1476
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:10,320
Yes.

1477
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:12,040
Do we?

1478
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,040
This goes here.

1479
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:13,400
Do you see it?

1480
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:14,200
Well, all right.

1481
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:16,000
Pass it down there.

1482
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,400
Pass it down.

1483
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,220
Take hold.

1484
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:21,120
Here.

1485
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:23,160
See if you can loosen the coil.

1486
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,080
I will loosen the coil, good sir.

1487
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,240
Please stand by.

1488
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,620
Oh, you sound good on radio, Bo.

1489
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:31,180
No.

1490
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:36,660
Bo is my Yeti brother from Allegan, Michigan, which is on the western side of the

1491
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:36,900
state.

1492
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:37,920
I'm now holding up my right hand.

1493
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:38,000
Oh, that's great.

1494
00:52:38,080 --> 00:52:42,000
The state of Michigan has such an interesting shape, I always thought.

1495
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:44,180
Yes, it is shaped just like a, you know, a, you know, a, you know, a, you know, a, you

1496
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:44,180


1497
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:49,780
know, a, oh, maybe a glove, so that we can raise our right hands and use it as a map

1498
00:52:49,780 --> 00:52:51,420
any day of the week.

1499
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:52,200
So I'm...

1500
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:59,220
Actually, I'm from Ngombo, Sri Lanka, and I'm currently residing in the island of Kirk

1501
00:52:59,220 --> 00:53:00,220
in Croatia.

1502
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:07,080
The island of Taprobane, as originally it was, or Taprobany, however one would

1503
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:07,500
say it.

1504
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:10,380
Golden Ceylon.

1505
00:53:12,060 --> 00:53:13,540
Do I want to touch this?

1506
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:14,160
Yes.

1507
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:14,160


1508
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,780
You have already, and why not?

1509
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:17,480
It's not a coprolite.

1510
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:23,500
Stang was already making jokes about it for all his supposed aversion to bawdy humor.

1511
00:53:23,820 --> 00:53:27,240
No, it's just a mineral which happens to resemble...

1512
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:27,680
Go ahead.

1513
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:28,180
Jeez, yes.

1514
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,880
Happens to resemble an organic form.

1515
00:53:31,300 --> 00:53:32,260
Yes, it does.

1516
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,580
It looks like something that it would have resulted from extra meditation.

1517
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,100
Perhaps, but...

1518
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,960
Bo, did you engage in extra meditation this morning?

1519
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,760
Extra meditation?

1520
00:53:43,080 --> 00:53:43,800
Extra meditation.

1521
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:44,140
It's a...

1522
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:44,820
It's been handled.

1523
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:45,460
Nice.

1524
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,360
I had a productive meeting with my associates.

1525
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,300
I, too, had a productive meeting with my associates.

1526
00:53:52,460 --> 00:53:53,300
Oh, that's very good.

1527
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,980
One as productive as one can be.

1528
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:56,760
Progress.

1529
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:00,020
There was much movement.

1530
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:07,260
Well, now, yes, you'll actually get that other pair of headphones on, but you know,

1531
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:12,920
there's nothing to hear because we can't seem to continue the music track without Reverend

1532
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,020
Stang there.

1533
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,620
Do you know how to operate the machine?

1534
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:17,520
I don't know how to operate that machine.

1535
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,900
That's why I was moving the slider, seeing if there was a track playing, but whatever

1536
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:25,660
it is has come to the end of its cycle.

1537
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,740
I'm going to start pressing buttons.

1538
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:36,580
You could press buttons, but I'm sure you have a natural-born affinity for this sort

1539
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:36,900
of thing.

1540
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:37,920
What happened?

1541
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:39,140
Power on.

1542
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,380
Ah, well, that'll do it every time.

1543
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:42,500
Load, open.

1544
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:42,900
Okay.

1545
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:43,580
Oh, we're doing something.

1546
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:47,080
Now move, see the two sliders, the farthest to the right?

1547
00:54:47,140 --> 00:54:48,220
Try moving them.

1548
00:54:48,640 --> 00:54:50,900
I believe autoplay is the thing, so watch this.

1549
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:55,400
Try the slider because the slider's all the way down, so no matter what's happening, we're

1550
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:56,920
not going to hear anything unless you move.

1551
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:57,880
This one?

1552
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:59,440
I think it might be that one.

1553
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:00,100
Okay.

1554
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,000
Wait, because it's going low, okay?

1555
00:55:02,740 --> 00:55:03,340
It does?

1556
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,240
There, now it appears to be playing.

1557
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:08,200
Ah, here we go.

1558
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:10,340
Now we're back to the hour of slack.

1559
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,180
Now would you adjust the volume yourself?

1560
00:55:12,260 --> 00:55:12,660
I can't.

1561
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:16,040
Oh, no, the volume sounds quite good to me here in the headphones.

1562
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:22,400
Unfortunately, I don't know if the audience are able to experience it the way we do, but

1563
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:25,020
though that is to be regretted, I'm...

1564
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:25,220
Give me a thumbs up.

1565
00:55:25,220 --> 00:55:26,740
Oh, look, I think it's Arise behind us.

1566
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,740
Aha, Arise, ye prisoners of starvation.

1567
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:31,900
Arise, ye wretched of the earth.

1568
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,440
The international subgenius will become the human race.

1569
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,240
I hope it.

1570
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,880
I mean, really, this time for sure.

1571
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:49,300
Well, unfortunately, it's not by evangelism, but by attrition, since many are called, but

1572
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,300
few are chosen.

1573
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:58,040
The subgenius are an elite few who will be saved, as opposed to the bulk of people whose

1574
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,420
sacrifice is supposed to make everything better.

1575
00:56:03,380 --> 00:56:11,020
So, does overman or uberfem status or yeti lineage give you a plus one for an extra spot

1576
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,460
on a ship, or how does that work?

1577
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:17,440
Well, it helps you, definitely, because if you are descended from yetinsin, you are a

1578
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,060
subgenius.

1579
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:19,500
What about mating with yetinsin?

1580
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:22,160
Meeting, did you say?

1581
00:56:22,280 --> 00:56:22,500
Mating.

1582
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:22,800
Mating.

1583
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:25,040
If you're just like a yetisin's concubine.

1584
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:26,100
I mean, does that get you on board?

1585
00:56:26,380 --> 00:56:26,420
Well, you could...

1586
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:27,940
That would, I think.

1587
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,020
I mean, come on, who's yeti dick do I gotta suck to get on board the saucer destroyer?

1588
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:37,140
Well, you know, they're not going to anger the yeti by leaving his amour behind on the

1589
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:38,920
launching ramp.

1590
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:40,900
That would be untoward.

1591
00:56:40,900 --> 00:56:41,000
Well, I mean, I think that's a good thing.

1592
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1593
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:41,000


1594
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:42,340
On the other hand...

1595
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:44,380
Ladies, that's how you get on board the saucers.

1596
00:56:44,460 --> 00:56:51,360
We have faith, and that faith is in the incredible supreme efficacy of these beings, superior

1597
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:53,760
to us on the evolutionary scale.

1598
00:56:54,140 --> 00:57:00,300
But surely we can be forgiven for thinking or questioning, does that mean everything

1599
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:01,500
they do is perfect?

1600
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:04,280
Can they not still make mistakes?

1601
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:10,640
Couldn't we be left behind by some bureaucratic snafu of an...

1602
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:13,500
Ultra-advanced civilization from the stars?

1603
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,440
You know, the universe is tricky.

1604
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:21,900
Plays snickering tricks on us all and our expectations.

1605
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:31,800
So I'm just saying we shouldn't be too ready to rest on our laurels simply because we are

1606
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,400
that rarity of rarities, a subgenius.

1607
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:38,660
Wow.

1608
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:39,940
It lives.

1609
00:57:40,180 --> 00:57:40,880
Operation...

1610
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:40,980
Operation...

1611
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:40,980


1612
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:41,380
Operation Mind.

1613
00:57:41,660 --> 00:57:42,600
Oh, this is...

1614
00:57:42,600 --> 00:57:43,320
This is...

1615
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,280
What can I say?

1616
00:57:44,340 --> 00:57:45,180
This is our opinion.

1617
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:49,820
If it offends you, well, perhaps we'd like to know what you think.

1618
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:54,760
And return of the sacred scribe, I will take my leave, of the beloved Dr. Calvin.

1619
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,180
Yes, I...

1620
00:57:55,180 --> 00:57:58,800
You heard that music playing in the distance a while back.

1621
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:06,660
That was when Reverend Stang ate his spinach and dealt with the interloper who we had at

1622
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:07,080
the gate.

1623
00:58:07,580 --> 00:58:10,880
And having re-transformed himself back to his...

1624
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,280
Salty, normal self.

1625
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:22,920
Reverend Stang will sit with us and he will once again join the ranks of the paladins

1626
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:31,260
as we beat back doctrinal error with every pulse of time and restore the purity of our

1627
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,140
original uncorrupted vision.

1628
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:37,540
Because we don't believe.

1629
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,580
It's been...

1630
00:58:38,580 --> 00:58:39,280
Uh...

1631
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:39,900
Uh...

1632
00:58:39,900 --> 00:58:41,040
Uh...

1633
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:41,040


1634
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:43,420
Supplanted by anything particularly...

1635
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:44,280
Worthy.

1636
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:46,920
Uh...

1637
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:54,440
But, on the other hand, also we include everything because there is a doctrine of all inclusion.

1638
00:58:54,900 --> 00:59:01,160
You know, you've read, if you've read our sacred texts, that any old damn thing a subgenius

1639
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:04,900
says immediately becomes part of subgenius doctrine.

1640
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,620
Uh, there's absolutely no problem with that.

1641
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,260
But...

1642
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:15,780
