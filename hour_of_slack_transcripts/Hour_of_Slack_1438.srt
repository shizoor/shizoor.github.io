1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,700
Okay, and I'm talking and talking and in normal voice and I can be heard and everything is

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,980
Recording everything's going fine. No trouble

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,800
Recording everything's going fine. No trouble

4
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,480
That was from negative land, wasn't it?

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:25,080
Test test test. These are the times that test

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,060
subgenius souls

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,000
And

8
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:38,260
The subgenius

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,280
radio ministry

10
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:42,540
hour of slack

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:49,820
Commences once again live from the wisteria caffeine is cafe

12
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:53,960
At 16 X day

13
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,940
July 6

14
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,780
We were hoping

15
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:03,200
There wouldn't be a July 6th

16
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:04,220
but

17
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:07,760
But there is and we're stuck with it

18
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,400
Yes, here we are the music in the background

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,340
Today will be the flying Ryan brothers if music be the food of love play on I

20
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:27,880
Wish I could get the flying Ryan brothers out here, but they're apparently a recording studio type band. Alas it is so

21
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:59,760
And this hour of slack we're going to turn into an ask dr. How show back in the day you had to look something up in the encyclopedia and then back in the other day you had to Google it or wiki it but now you can ask dr. How the amazing ask dr. How show

22
00:01:59,760 --> 00:01:59,760


23
00:01:59,760 --> 00:01:59,760


24
00:01:59,760 --> 00:01:59,760


25
00:01:59,760 --> 00:01:59,760


26
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:05,320
If he doesn't know the answer you'll never guess that that was the case

27
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,080
so I

28
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,700
Don't know whether you ought to build it up like that

29
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:19,160
So friend now pay attention kids. This is your one chance to ask dr. How now traditionally we have

30
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,540
passed out pieces of paper and pens to write your questions on oh

31
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,980
and baby bear the lovely

32
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,180
hostess baby bear is preparing the the little slips of paper and

33
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,340
The pens which we will loan out because we're so generous

34
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:44,660
Here at the hour of slack and

35
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:51,380
Asked dr. How it does require some basic orthographic skills

36
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,700
The ability to write a single sentence. I suppose we will collect them. Yes, we will collect them and you know

37
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:04,460
Reverend suds knows how to do it right because he enclosed a

38
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:08,980
Stipe pen you didn't tell them about that. Well, let's let's pile them up

39
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:13,240
Actually, if you're going to be the chicken John you he can give you the questions

40
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,960
You can arrange them and ask them to me in the order which you choose

41
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,880
Well, if I don't even know if we're doing that part of it right now, we have all sorts of things to do

42
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,720
No, let's go. Let's go ahead and whip it out. Here's it. This one should be fun

43
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,480
You know, like I said friends you you don't have to include a donation

44
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,360
to the

45
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:43,780
Dr. Howell foundation, but if you do you'll probably get a longer and livelier answer and

46
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:52,380
If it's bullshit, it will be the cream of the bullshit or a bardic eruption. Remember that. Oh, that's right

47
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,600
Yeah, dr. Howe. I forgot about the poem

48
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,640
but this this one might

49
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,700
do from

50
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:02,000
Reverend suds Pasha asked

51
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,140
Dr. Howell, would you please recite your favorite Lovecraft quote?

52
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,180
Well, that's a strange one

53
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:17,060
Because Lovecraft is best appreciated as a gestalt. It's my microphone on yeah

54
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,940
yes as the sum total of

55
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,520
the so-called mythos of Lovecraft and as a poet

56
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:32,060
But it's well known that Lovecraft was not that good but nobody

57
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:37,260
Eternally craps out and Lovecraft did write a few good lines

58
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,920
I have whirled with the earth at the dawning when the sky was a vaporous flame

59
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:57,340
I have seen the dark universe yawning where the black planets roll without aim where they roll in their horror

60
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:01,020
unheeded without number or luster or name

61
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,420
Wow right off the top of his head folks

62
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:19,220
What is under that mystic cap that of course is from Lovecraft's book of poems entitled fungi from yagov

63
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:27,060
Yes, we present them to me and then I will good they should have have money. It's good when they do have money

64
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,540
This is one that has money

65
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:35,300
Yeah, so we did this one

66
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,640
ladies and gentlemen, we're here to answer your questions and we

67
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:47,680
Promise to provide an answer whatever else happens one way or the other. Here's a question. Very good

68
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,440
Dr. Howell who sang?

69
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,840
Mr. Big stuff

70
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,360
It's the title of a song I guess

71
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,520
Who sang Mr. Big stuff?

72
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,540
Who sang Mr. Big stuff?

73
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,960
Oh yeah

74
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,120
Who?

75
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,460
Mr. Big stuff

76
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,960
Who do you think you are?

77
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,580
Mr. Big stuff

78
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,120
You're never gonna get my love

79
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,260
Now because you wear all those fancy clothes

80
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,520
Oh yeah

81
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,960
And have a big fine car

82
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,960
Oh yes you do now

83
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,040
Do you think I'm a fool?

84
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,040


85
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:27,040


86
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,400
I can't afford to give you my love

87
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:31,500
Oh yeah

88
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:35,440
You think you're higher than every star above

89
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,120
Mr. Big stuff

90
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,720
Who do you think you are?

91
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,280
Mr. Big stuff

92
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,840
You're never gonna get my love

93
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:50,840
I believe that was that old Twalwamti Bigasaw hit

94
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,740
Mr. Big stuff

95
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,540
It has nothing to do with Burt I. Gordon who was known to his fans as Mr. Big

96
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:01,880
His initials B.I.G.

97
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,920
The maker of horrible monster movies

98
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,840
Actually had a large and enduring fan club

99
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:15,940
And even published a fanzine about Mr. Big and his terrible monster movies

100
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,560
But Mr. Big stuff was just an effusion of the songwriter's art

101
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:24,720
Like the nameless narrator of Tennessee Ernie Ford's song

102
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:33,380
Or the rarer flip side of Tennessee Ernie Ford's 16 tons

103
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,940
You don't have to be a baby to cry

104
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,480
Well amazing

105
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,920
Simply amazing

106
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,240
Now here's another question

107
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,340
This one could be pretty heavy

108
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:49,860
This one comes from Reverend Glitch

109
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,540
Who I think misspelled his own name on this

110
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,960
He's trying to be tricky

111
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,700
But I think he's trying to be funny

112
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:54,700


113
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:54,700


114
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,080
But we'll attempt to accommodate him

115
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:01,780
Can there be a moral law without a moral law giver?

116
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,140
The question is can there be a moral law without a moral law giver?

117
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,540
Ask Dr. Zayas

118
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:19,560
And yes well Dr. Zayas is well on the side of one of the two opinions one may have

119
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,040
This depends on your view of the universe

120
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,680
And within that of who is in charge

121
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,100
If there is a world of perfection

122
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,140
As Plato theorized

123
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:38,420
In which everything is existing eternally in its ideal form

124
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:45,000
This is the external outer universal moral law

125
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,760
It's curious to think that everybody complains when things aren't fair

126
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:55,140
But things are always not fair

127
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,900
When then and where do we get the concept of things being fair?

128
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,600
We are appealing to an external source of morality at this time

129
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:12,780
We're appealing to a system of good or evil whether or not it exists

130
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:17,780
And perhaps our wishes can in some way make it so

131
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:20,740
Otherwise laws of morality have to be fair

132
00:09:20,740 --> 00:09:20,740


133
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,780
And we have to be tied to nebulous biological and evolutionary imperatives

134
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,600
Which often do the individual no good at all

135
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,020
As Nenslow said fair is a river in Africa

136
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,040
And as my little sister said fair is where you take your pig and hope you win a prize

137
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,760
You see if there is some sort of almighty pantheon of gods

138
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,600
Or an almighty spirit

139
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,020
These are the arbiters and rule makers

140
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:59,060
But without them we have to come up not only with the rules

141
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,020
But with the gods and spirits themselves

142
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:07,680
Which has been our labor as subgeniuses for the past 25 years

143
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,640
It's been longer than that

144
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,080
Well it's true

145
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:15,620
And of course we also have to factor in the subgenius war on God

146
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,060
Wow

147
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,740
Great thanks baby dear

148
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:19,740


149
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,600
We have I think enough to keep this thing running now for a while

150
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:28,980
This attraction such as it is only lasts as long as the questions that you provide

151
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,360
But there are many dockets there are many things on the agenda today

152
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,100
Oh the one with money gets answered first

153
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:36,660
Yes

154
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,600
Sure thank you

155
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,540
Please give any additional question you may have to baby bear

156
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,980
This is your chance to give her one of those things

157
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,740
Now here's a question

158
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:52,140
It was rolled up in a dollar bill

159
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,500
That's what we like

160
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,500
Very good yes

161
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:59,460
How does one find a proper mate who is also a proper yeti

162
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,660
From one who has neither or neither

163
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,820
That's an age old question

164
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:13,120
The writer does not have a proper mate or a proper yeti

165
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,600
But he wants a mate who is a proper yeti

166
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,580
He or she that could be

167
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:19,740
Yes

168
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,940
That could be from a girl

169
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,860
It could be

170
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:27,720
It could be from a girl wanting an unreconstructed Sasquatch for a mate

171
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:31,440
And there are many women who do desire such a person

172
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,560
Let me point out that your chance of finding one here is greater than anywhere else

173
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:43,160
The Sasquatches don't just roam the woods at X day

174
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,480
But they march out boldly for everyone to see

175
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:52,260
But it's up to you to make the move

176
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:55,700
And sadly this is always the case

177
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:59,740
Not only in interpersonal relations but in art itself

178
00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:05,940
If you don't give a little bit of yourself to what you're trying to enjoy

179
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,600
You will never find out whether there is any enjoyment there

180
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:14,060
You have to have a little bit of faith and take a plunge for a little bit

181
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,220
And it may be too shallow

182
00:12:15,220 --> 00:12:16,680
You may want to turn around

183
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:19,440
And not take that particular path

184
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,760
Still you have to do it

185
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,220
Otherwise you are left to wring your hands in impotent despair

186
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,160
And write notes to question and answer sessions

187
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,940
Here's a good question and answer session note with a $20 bill

188
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,760
$20?

189
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:38,400
Yes

190
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,340
Okay, alright

191
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:41,600
Well there's going to be a poem

192
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:44,120
But let's see how we can answer the question

193
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:45,640
The question is

194
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:51,220
Is the United States experiencing a decline similar to Republican Rome?

195
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,740
If so, who is our Cato?

196
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,420
And check out the handwriting on this

197
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,640
It's Reverend Freaker's handwriting

198
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,600
What lovely writing from Dr. Jitney Freaker

199
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,380
Well, the question is

200
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:11,480
Is the United States experiencing a decline similar to Republican Rome?

201
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,620
And if so, who is our Cato?

202
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,620
Well, he's referring to Rome

203
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:16,760
To Cato the Censor

204
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,480
A prominent politician of Imperial Rome

205
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:28,920
Who constantly railed against the decline of morals and manners as he saw it

206
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,420
Of course to him it was a decline of military virtues

207
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:37,200
Romans thought that politics was the highest and noblest art

208
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:43,660
And that to excel in military skills was the only real kind of success

209
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,620
That worked a lot better than the military skills that were used in the war

210
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,860
A long time for them

211
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,620
But since their entire empire was also built on the institution of slavery

212
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,720
It was doomed to fail

213
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:58,060
Particularly when a weird oriental cult called Christianity

214
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,340
Began to work its insidiousness

215
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:08,380
And caused them to doubt the stability of their ancient institutions and laws

216
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:13,700
Not that they were perfect by any means on the other hand

217
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,140
But who would our Cato be?

218
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:19,640
Probably someone like Senator Bernie Sanders

219
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:22,440
Or even Barney Frank

220
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:26,700
Who is not afraid just to sit there and bloviate

221
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:30,520
And to make serious and solid criticisms

222
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:33,500
Which glare in their obviousness

223
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:37,060
But all are too timid to mention

224
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:41,000
And thanks for $20, that's really good

225
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,040
And so I will now

226
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:44,000
One problem I have is

227
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,220
I never can remember what I've done before

228
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,280
So please forgive me if I did this on a previous X-Day

229
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:54,560
I will do a poem now by Tennessee Williams

230
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,300
How tranquilly the olive branch

231
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:05,180
Observes the sky began to blanch

232
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:08,760
Without a cry, without a prayer

233
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:11,100
With no betrayal

234
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:12,720
Of despair

235
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,180
Sometime when light obscures the tree

236
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,560
The zenith of that life must be

237
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,840
Past, done, forever

238
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,040
And from thence a second history will commence

239
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,720
A chronicle no longer gold

240
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,540
Of bargaining with mist and mold

241
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:38,580
And finally the broken stem

242
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:40,700
The plummeting to earth

243
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:44,040
And then an intercourse

244
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:46,660
Not well designed

245
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,640
For beings of a golden kind

246
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:53,960
Whose native green must arch above

247
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:59,160
The earth's obscene, corrupting love

248
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:03,300
And still the ripe fruit and the branch

249
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:06,060
Observe the sky began to blanch

250
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:09,040
Without a cry, without a prayer

251
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,040
With no betrayal of despair

252
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:14,700
Oh courage

253
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:17,080
Could you not as well find out

254
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,620
Some other place to dwell

255
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,300
Not only in that golden tree

256
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,720
But in the frightened heart of me

257
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,140
Ooh la la

258
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:32,640
Well that was twenty dollars worth

259
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,300
Thank you for your question

260
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:37,640
Here's another twenty dollar question

261
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,020
Oh boy oh boy

262
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,700
I don't know whether this one will be a challenge

263
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,220
Or just too easy

264
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,200
Well you leave that up to me

265
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,460
I'll be it, do it

266
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:49,620
And by the way we've got enough here to last about two hours

267
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,200
Well I was afraid of that

268
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,180
Collecting questions and answers are closed

269
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:57,620
And Baby Bear is officially relieved of duty

270
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,600
What do you have there?

271
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:01,140
Has anyone really been far

272
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,340
Even as decided to use

273
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:06,020
Even Go want to do look more like?

274
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,080
Yes!

275
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,100
Something about that makes me think of Quasar

276
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,340
Well that would be far

277
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:17,960
Let's review this

278
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:18,720
The question is

279
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,720
Has anyone really been far

280
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:24,740
Even as decided to use

281
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:29,140
Even Go want to do look more like?

282
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,020
This is actually a description of the universe itself

283
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:35,460
And its labor

284
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,240
The universe is active

285
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,380
Engaged in a project

286
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:44,740
A project which takes forever and ever to accomplish

287
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,580
But in its grandiosity and patience

288
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:51,520
It is betting that it will complete this process

289
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,900
And I believe that it will

290
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:54,680
I have to

291
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,400
Because it, not I, am in charge

292
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,880
Now what is this process?

293
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,940
It's been forever

294
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,120
And it has decided to use it

295
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,920
And even

296
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:05,660
Go

297
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:10,880
To want to do look more like itself

298
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:14,340
If you can view the universe as a shape

299
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:15,060
For example

300
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,560
A shape in space

301
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,960
Which we can do for practical purposes

302
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,360
Or illustrative purposes

303
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,940
Consider the universe to be shaped like a bean

304
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,080
Or perhaps a sausage

305
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,400
At least an oblong

306
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,460
Maybe a pillow like a bolster

307
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,540
This bolster is laboring on a special project

308
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:35,300
And that is to

309
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:39,120
Because it wants to do look more like

310
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,360
What it wants to do

311
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,620
Essentially, if you can visualize this

312
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:46,040
Is to extend a pseudopod or tentacle

313
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,700
That has something like an eyeball on the end

314
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:50,920
With this it can turn back

315
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,920
And regard itself

316
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:56,340
Thus it will complete the ancient task

317
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:59,120
Of creating consciousness

318
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:03,180
By being able to view and know itself

319
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:05,440
This was also the quest for the universe itself

320
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,360
The quest of Socrates

321
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,380
And has always been the quest of sages

322
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,980
From the beginning of time

323
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,540
It's always been there

324
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,760
But it has never to date been fulfilled

325
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,340
You know, I've heard you describe the universe that way before

326
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,520
And I may have mentioned to you that

327
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:30,780
I had a pretty visceral understanding of that

328
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:34,420
One time on a too powerful LSD trip

329
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,280
Yeah, that's the kind of

330
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:36,920
You'll get that

331
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,020
Yeah, that's the typical

332
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:39,600
I saw that

333
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,160
Yeah, yeah

334
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,160
Yeah, anyway

335
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,460
It's a

336
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,680
Those who know don't say and those who say don't know

337
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:48,500
Hey, that's a 20 buck one

338
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,740
I'm trying to think of a short type poem

339
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:50,960
Oh, right

340
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,380
I can do

341
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,560
But I mostly know long ones

342
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:54,620
But I know some short ones

343
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:56,300
Here's a moderately

344
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,500
You can do a knock knock joke

345
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,100
That's short

346
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,860
I don't know any knock knock jokes unfortunately

347
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,400
I'm actually not good at jokes

348
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,120
I'm good at telling jokes

349
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,260
There are times when I know a joke and I remember it

350
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,080
Then I can tell it

351
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:11,620
But usually like water through a sieve

352
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:14,580
It flows away from my head

353
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:18,460
Ah, well, other people can tell jokes more skillfully

354
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,000
I'm going to say a poem

355
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,380
Once again, I hope I didn't do it before

356
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,180
But I probably did sometime

357
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,560
The Insect God

358
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,360
Oh, what has become of melecent frastling?

359
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:37,180
Is there any hope she is still alive?

360
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:39,380
Why haven't they found her?

361
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,540
It's rather ghastly to think that the child was not yet five

362
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:49,000
The dear little thing was last seen playing

363
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,480
Alone by herself at the edge of the park

364
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,740
There was no one nearby to keep her from straying

365
00:20:55,740 --> 00:20:58,920
Off in the shadows and oncoming dark

366
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,180
Before she could do so

367
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:04,400
A silent and glittering black motorbike

368
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:07,140
Pulled her up where she sat nibbling grass

369
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:11,680
From inside came a nearly inaudible twittering

370
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:16,400
A tiny green face peered out through the glass

371
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,900
She was ready to flee but the figure beckoned

372
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:24,700
An arm with two elbows held out a tin of cinnamon balls

373
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,980
She paused a second, reached out as she took one

374
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,980
And lifted her in

375
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:34,060
The nurse was discovered collapsed

376
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,180
In some shrubbery

377
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,180
But her reappearance was not much use

378
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:41,780
Her eyes were askew, her extremities rubbery

379
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,700
Her clothing was stained with a brownish juice

380
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:50,360
When questioned with hopes of her answers revealing what had happened

381
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,680
She merely repeatedly said

382
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,720
I hear them crawling about on the ceiling

383
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,880
She had gone irretrievably out of her head

384
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:02,860
Oh, feelings of horror, resentment and pity

385
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,400
For things that so seldom

386
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,800
Turn out for the best

387
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,620
The car, unobserved, sped away from the city

388
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,280
While the last of the light died out in the west

389
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,980
The Frastleys felt sick with apprehension

390
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,660
Which a heavy tea only served to increase

391
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:23,320
Though they thought it hardly genteel

392
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,660
To mention the loss of their child

393
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,900
They called in the police

394
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,560
Through unvisited hamlets the car went creeping

395
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,380
With headlamps unlit and the curtains dry

396
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:34,680
The police were drawn

397
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:37,460
Those natives who happened not to be sleeping

398
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:41,040
Heard it pass and lay awake until dawn

399
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:43,960
The police with their flashlights and notebooks

400
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,940
Descended on the haunts of the underworld

401
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,800
Searching for clues

402
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:51,280
In spite of their praiseworthy efforts

403
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:56,000
They ended with nothing at all in the way of news

404
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,160
The car, after hours and hours of travel

405
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,060
Came to a gate in an endless wall

406
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:06,720
It rolled up the drive and stopped on the gravel

407
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:10,980
At the foot of a vast and crumbling hall

408
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:15,440
As evening wore on, hopes started to languish

409
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:18,360
And soon were replaced with all manner of fears

410
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:22,080
The family twisted their fingers in anguish

411
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:26,080
And got them all damp with the flow of their tears

412
00:23:27,060 --> 00:23:29,500
They removed the child to the ballroom

413
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:32,360
Whose hangings and mirrors were streaked

414
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,880
With a luminous slime

415
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:38,060
They leapt through the air with buzzings and twangings

416
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:42,740
To work themselves up to a ritual crime

417
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,080
They stunned her and stripped off her garments

418
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:55,540
And, lastly, they stuffed her inside a kind of pod

419
00:23:56,360 --> 00:24:00,340
And thus it was that Millicent Frastley

420
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,800
Was sacrificed

421
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,740
To the Insect God

422
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,200
Yow!

423
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:10,360
Jeepers!

424
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,180
Okay, let's keep it moving

425
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:13,820
We've got quite a lot to do here

426
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,500
Yes, we do

427
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:17,220
Well, that's the last of the $20 questions

428
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,940
Okay, all right

429
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,220
We were doing the, the, uh

430
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,620
All right, let's deal with the small fry

431
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:24,360
Where can I get more microbead condensers

432
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:26,340
For my interocitor?

433
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,020
Asks Reverend Fox

434
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:32,340
Well, I'm afraid the company that, uh, used to be called, uh,

435
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,880
To offer them is no longer in service

436
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,820
You could try the internet

437
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:39,360
But people are unwilling to give up these things

438
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,660
Not everything is available on the internet

439
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:46,460
But, uh, Metaluna Products, uh, went out of business, uh, many years ago

440
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:51,820
Uh, their, uh, their planet, uh, became a star, you know

441
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:58,760
It was heated when it was attacked by flame-bearing, uh, meteor ships

442
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:00,220
From the planet Zagon

443
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:02,940
A planet which was once a comet

444
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:04,940
Oh, hygge!

445
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:08,760
Uh, here's another, uh, $1 question

446
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,580
$1!

447
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,280
Who would win in a fight?

448
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,620
Mixelplik or Modok?

449
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,080
M-O-D-O-K

450
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,560
Uh, who would win in a fight?

451
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:23,160
Uh, Mixesplitlik

452
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,800
I think that's how you say it

453
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:25,640
Or Modok

454
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:26,460
Mixesplitlik

455
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,100
Mixesplitlik

456
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,200
As all people know

457
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,200


458
00:25:30,220 --> 00:25:31,800
As every schoolboy knows

459
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:35,340
Uh, Mr. Mixesplitlik is a tiny, uh, imp

460
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,160
Uh, from the, uh, fifth dimension

461
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:44,140
Whose sole light, uh, delight in life is to torment, uh, Superman

462
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:49,320
Uh, I think even over Modok, uh, Mixesplitlik has to win

463
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:49,760
And why?

464
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,320
Because he uses magic

465
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,360
Because he cheats

466
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,480
And that's the trouble with magic

467
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,980
That's the problem

468
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:59,700
My father always said

469
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,740
That was the trouble with the super- supernatural

470
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,420
It's not fair

471
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,700
It's weighted against you

472
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:11,120
You've gotta use the tools, uh, and the materials, uh, that are at hand

473
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,880
And so if one has infinite power to cheat

474
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:15,420
Then one wins the contest

475
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,920
Which is really no contest

476
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:19,580
Okay

477
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:24,000
Alright, um, here is another

478
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:27,880
Oh, this is, uh, several bills wadded up

479
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,420
Alright

480
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,180
Should've done this one earlier

481
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,800
Let's talk about wadded, uh, quality of bills

482
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:32,480
Uh, yes

483
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:40,120
Yesterday I heard your discourse on the new feathered dino fossils coming from China

484
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:43,480
And your doubts on their veracity

485
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,540
Can you speak on this again?

486
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:55,760
Well, most of you probably know about the marvelous treasure trove of fossils from Leonong province in China

487
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:57,900
You've heard of these things?

488
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:03,800
Uh, they are a remarkable example of a preserved biota

489
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,420
And they exist in a lagerstadt

490
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:11,740
That's the German name for a perfect field of fossil preservation

491
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:16,460
Which shows not only the, uh, animals that perished there

492
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:23,300
But also leaves, sticks, insects, uh, everything that tells you what life was like at that time

493
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,900
And truly wonderful things have been found

494
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,820
However, there is a problem

495
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:31,840
And the problem is that whatever people in America want

496
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,060
China is happy to produce and sell to America

497
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:39,880
This is a real problem because it has been estimated

498
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,740
You can read about this on the internet

499
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:47,640
That not most, but all fossils coming from China are somewhat faked

500
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:52,140
One thing that one never finds as a paleontologist

501
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,360
Or someone who finds fossils in the field

502
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,880
Is a perfectly articulated fact

503
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,200
That the bones of a prehistoric creature

504
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,920
Are all the bones present

505
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,660
This is almost never the case

506
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,060
Now there is an exception

507
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,900
The, uh, skeleton of Dilophosaurus wetherilli

508
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,660
Which was discovered by a Navajo Indian in Arizona

509
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,260
With all the bones intact

510
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,340
But usually what you get is a huge jumble of bones

511
00:28:19,340 --> 00:28:21,640
Some that have been chewed by other dinosaurs

512
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:24,620
Broken, some bones from the wrong species

513
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,240
Uh, some missing

514
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,980
All mixed up with mud

515
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:31,100
Mixed up with, uh, animal feces

516
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:34,600
Mixed up with the bodies of other animals that were chewing on it

517
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,280
The mess has to be straightened out

518
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:40,800
But from China, we not only get perfectly articulated skeletons

519
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:45,660
We get two perfectly articulated skeletons on the same slab

520
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:49,580
This is just not possible

521
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,200
To keep doing it

522
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:55,160
And another bad thing is they won't let us look at these fossils

523
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,960
But there are other reasons

524
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,240
Uh, not to suppose that the so-called feathers

525
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:05,560
On fossil dinosaurs are feathers

526
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:09,980
They say whenever they discover a fossil bird

527
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,540
That a feathered dinosaur has been discovered

528
00:29:14,160 --> 00:29:16,680
Since to them a bird is a dinosaur

529
00:29:16,680 --> 00:29:19,720
So it'll say we found several flying dinosaurs

530
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,760
With wings and beaks and feathers

531
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,900
And I would call these creatures birds

532
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:30,980
When you read of a dinosaur found with a fine array of feathers

533
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:32,740
A phrase I once saw in an article

534
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:34,120
If you look more closely

535
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:36,580
There are no feathers whatsoever

536
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,460
When we think of a feather

537
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,500
We think of a penacious bird feather

538
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,160
With asymmetry and barbs which interlock

539
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:47,560
A perfect engine created by evolution for flight

540
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:52,960
Not likely to be created to insulate a turkey-sized creature

541
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,720
That runs along the ground

542
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,840
With long hind legs and little tiny front legs

543
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,680
Don't we want to look for the ancestor of a bird

544
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:04,840
As a creature with short hind legs and long forelegs

545
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:07,540
That lives in a tree and leaps down

546
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,600
Instead of runs along the ground

547
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,880
That uses gravity to learn how to fly

548
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:15,800
Today in our world we have flying dragons

549
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,280
The Draco Volans

550
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:21,140
Flying lizards that have a wing made out of extended rib sections

551
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,760
Flying snakes, flying squirrels

552
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,560
Flying foxes, flying bats, flying fish

553
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:33,400
They all use gravity to support their habits of flight

554
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:36,420
And some have developed advanced habits of flight

555
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,340
No matter how you put it

556
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:41,140
There is no evolutionary advantage to running along the ground

557
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:44,600
And leaping in the air and flapping your tiny arms briefly

558
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,220
The moment you're in the air you're losing traction

559
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,400
And what is ever after you can get you

560
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:51,540
And there are many things that could be talked about

561
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:53,040
I recommend a wonderful book

562
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,380
If you're interested in bird or dinosaur evolution

563
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,960
Called The Origin and Evolution of Birds

564
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:00,720
By Dr. Alan Fadukia

565
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,800
Of the University of Chapel Hill, North Carolina

566
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:07,060
But we don't have enough time to keep on with this subject

567
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,180
So let's keep chugging along with Ask Dr. Howe

568
00:31:10,940 --> 00:31:13,640
Here's a question that reminds me of my own worries

569
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:18,000
About the race between the singularity and the dumbassularity

570
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,140
Where's the question?

571
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:20,060
The question is

572
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,460
Oh, thank you

573
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,020
I see you gave me the answer

574
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:25,940
I gave you three dollars and you gave me an eight dollar answer

575
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,640
Oh, thank you

576
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,300
All right

577
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,200
Oh, Reverend Joy DeVieve just gave

578
00:31:31,880 --> 00:31:35,860
She gave him three dollars but he gave her an eight dollar answer

579
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,180
Yeah, that's the way I am

580
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:41,660
I was distracted delightfully by Joy

581
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,860
So you have to read that one again

582
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:43,160
Right

583
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:47,740
What are the odds on either the universe collapsing in on itself

584
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:52,580
Or expanding onward forever ending in heat death?

585
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,240
Asks Alexander Salamander

586
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:57,960
Salamander, eh?

587
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,760
Well, you would be interested in the heat present in the universe

588
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:06,640
The heat death of the universe is not likely to occur

589
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,660
Particularly in the lifetime of anyone here

590
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:12,480
And when we are in our future lives

591
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,260
After we are conveyed there by our exes to friends

592
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,040
This will not be a concern

593
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:20,480
But the universe rather than collapsing

594
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,020
As at the moment expanding faster than ever

595
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,640
Faster and faster

596
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,800
You would expect the expansion from the moment of the big bang

597
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,840
To be slowing down entropically

598
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,800
Instead it is rushing outward

599
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:35,180
Faster all the time

600
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,860
And so any collapse will have to occur

601
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,740
Owing to the theory of eternal recurrence

602
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:45,300
Countless light years

603
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:48,640
I mean that's not even a duration, distance of time

604
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,400
But countless eons

605
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:54,020
Beyond the death of our own solar system

606
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,800
And perhaps if it collapses back into a small golf ball

607
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,080
Bursting with kinesis and potential

608
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:06,920
Then it will burp and erupt again into another universe

609
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,500
Perhaps the same one

610
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:10,020
How could we ever know?

611
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,940
If it falls into the most likely configuration

612
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:14,760
This is probably it

613
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:19,940
So perhaps after lustrums and epicycles of cosmic time

614
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:21,620
We'll still be sitting here

615
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:23,980
And I will still be answering this question

616
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:32,580
I just noticed that Tommy Amoeba is wearing that Robert Curum drawing

617
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:34,300
Of Princess Wee and myself

618
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:37,160
The day we met

619
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:38,900
Let's see

620
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,000
Is this the last of the one dollar questions?

621
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,800
The last of these questions

622
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,560
I think Fat Mandy handed this to me

623
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:45,860
Oh boy

624
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:48,200
Is it possible that the fruit

625
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,160
Which cast Adam and Eve

626
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:50,760
From heaven

627
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,540
Could have been a persimmon

628
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:54,420
Or maybe a pawpaw?

629
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:01,020
A pawpaw is certainly more likely

630
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:04,360
Considering the area in which Eden lay

631
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,260
But the entire tradition that the fruit

632
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,840
Of the tree of knowledge of good and evil

633
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,600
Is an apple

634
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,600
Is not a biblical tradition

635
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,760
But a later medieval tradition

636
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:17,480
All we know about this fruit

637
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,420
Is that it tastes really good

638
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,460
And that if you eat it

639
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,460
You shall surely die

640
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:24,500
However

641
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:26,460
You won't die on the spot

642
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:29,680
So actually the snake told the truth

643
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,900
And God lied

644
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,820
Because God said

645
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,440
On the day you eat this fruit

646
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,260
You will die

647
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,780
How long did Adam live after that?

648
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:40,500
900 and something years I think

649
00:34:40,500 --> 00:34:43,760
I don't think God was playing with a full deck there

650
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:46,240
So the fruit is

651
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,140
You know

652
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:49,400
I don't know if anybody ever got detailed

653
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:49,400


654
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,800
By Scott

655
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,060
I'll tell you

656
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,480
The tree of knowledge of allb transparent

657
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:56,480


658
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:56,480


659
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:56,600
It was supposed to be

660
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:57,920
Imagine death

661
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,520
But the foodstuff

662
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,460
And all the lies

663
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,420
Made my eyes see

664
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,060
The densely focused

665
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:02,060


666
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:05,100
I'll daresay

667
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:15,240
Everything I have

668
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,380
contains women

669
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:26,220
eight. It is now destroying the bananas that are grown in South America because rather than keep

670
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:32,600
the rot out, they hire the poorest, most desperate people who bring the rot on their shoes to the

671
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:38,660
banana harvest. The only possible salvation from the banana is the genetic engineered one, which

672
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:44,000
is resistant to the rot, which has been produced in Europe. But there's so much opposition to

673
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:50,460
genetic engineered food in Europe, too, that this thing can't get a foothold. Anyway, we'll see what

674
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:57,440
happens in the long run. It's not only the banana that's in trouble, as we all know. And as for the

675
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:05,360
fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, it's really not so much the fruit itself,

676
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:13,260
but disobedience to the old bearded boy, the ancient of days, that was the cause of the trouble.

677
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:13,980
What the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, it's really not so much the fruit itself,

678
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:20,280
but the serpent said was true, and what God said was the first of many regrettable lies.

679
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:33,340
This question, what he said, what he said, this is the kind of question that the person who asked it

680
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,320
may be sorry they asked. What are the ingredients in a hot dog?

681
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,520
No!

682
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,960
Nobody wants to hear this list.

683
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,500
A list of ingredients?

684
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,220
Why don't we start with the benign ones?

685
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,380
Say, pork and pork byproducts.

686
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,940
Beef gristle.

687
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,280
Plasma.

688
00:36:55,540 --> 00:37:01,640
Now, plasma is not a liquid, but it is a powder made of slaughterhouse refuse that is added to hot dogs.

689
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,060
Casein.

690
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:03,820
Calcium.

691
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,720
Gypsum actually exists in non-kosher hot dogs.

692
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:11,260
A slight amount of gypsum. Did you know that, Stan?

693
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:11,600
No.

694
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,940
And the casein.

695
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:20,120
The casein of hot dogs used to be made of animal intestines, but these days we have a marvelous machine

696
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:23,220
which produces and solidifies it.

697
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,420
But it depends on the brand of hot dogs.

698
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:33,040
In San Francisco, where I come from, there are all sorts of hot dogs made of holistic ingredients.

699
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:36,360
You know, they might as well be sawdust.

700
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:41,680
It's still a hot dog, and it's still going to get you the way any hot dog will.

701
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,880
Mm-mm.

702
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:47,100
But they have, you know, apple sausages with cinnamon.

703
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:48,580
Nonsense.

704
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,460
A hot dog is a hot dog.

705
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,540
The cruder, the better.

706
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,320
That's what a hot dog is all about.

707
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:58,180
I didn't get down to the pancake breakfast in time to get my scrapple.

708
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,620
Oh, that is terrible.

709
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:01,440
My breakfast was rushed.

710
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,120
There is some scrapple left.

711
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:02,720
I barely ate anything.

712
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,120
Oh, here's a question.

713
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:06,040
Yes?

714
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:08,620
Where did the word hippie originate?

715
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:09,700
Hmm.

716
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,520
Hippie spelled the way I spell it.

717
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:13,920
H-I-P-P-E.

718
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:15,080
H-I-P-P-I-E.

719
00:38:15,340 --> 00:38:16,660
First of all, let's settle that.

720
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,200
That is the way to spell hippie.

721
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:20,140
H-I-P-P-I-E.

722
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,640
And not with a Y.

723
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:28,420
You are suspected of right-wing tendencies if you spell hippie with a Y.

724
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,560
Despite the guy who's now trying to put out hippie comics,

725
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:39,440
who is trying to gain control of underground comics and put them out with sex comics

726
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:43,080
and thoroughly confuse sex comics and underground comics.

727
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:47,040
Anyway, he calls his enterprise hippie comics with a Y.

728
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:48,980
That shows how wrong-headed it is.

729
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,460
Why is I-E correct?

730
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,260
Because I-E is a diminutive.

731
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:58,040
And like all diminutives, it is an affectionate diminutive.

732
00:38:58,140 --> 00:39:02,080
In some diminutives, the amount of affection is quite weak.

733
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,420
Like, for example, Dracula, which means little dragon.

734
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:09,940
Dracula is not quite as bad as a dragon.

735
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,080
So that's not too affectionate.

736
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:12,740
But,

737
00:39:13,080 --> 00:39:15,100
another one, for example, cigarette.

738
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:17,600
There, et is the diminutive.

739
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,600
It's not a cigar.

740
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,720
It's a small thing.

741
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,220
A cigarette.

742
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,920
A hippie is a little hipster.

743
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,600
A cute little hipster.

744
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,200
And they were cute and little back at the end of the 50s,

745
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,540
at the time this term was coined.

746
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,520
They weren't old, smelly, and decrepit.

747
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,700
Stinking of patchouli oil, cynicism, and despair.

748
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:41,160
That came later.

749
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,840
But the name,

750
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,880
is from a time of freshness.

751
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,680
And that is the name which is properly used.

752
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:54,400
Dr. Howell, there was a song once called South Street.

753
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,280
Yes, there was a song that Greg is pointing out called South Street.

754
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,900
If I remember it, it said,

755
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,360
Where do all the hippies meet?

756
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,200
South Street, South Street.

757
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,460
I guess that location is like Ichiku Park,

758
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:11,520
a sort of legendary hippie great good place,

759
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,700
like the happy,

760
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,520
hunting ground.

761
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:15,640
Maybe the hippie huffing ground.

762
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,060
Totally imaginary, I'm afraid.

763
00:40:18,260 --> 00:40:19,560
Many have sought it,

764
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,900
but few have found anything but death,

765
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,460
as in the hippie episode of Star Trek.

766
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:31,360
Dr. Howell asks,

767
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,360
trademark,

768
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:38,160
Can you sing your two most memorable TV ad jingles?

769
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:41,160
But I remember them all.

770
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,680
That's the curse of remembering them all.

771
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:45,620
Dr. Oh, damn TV ad jingles.

772
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,860
Name a product.

773
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:50,800
Pepsodent.

774
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,900
Dr. Oh, everyone knows that one.

775
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:54,120
That's not my favorite either.

776
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:54,980
But that's of course,

777
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,320
You'll wonder where the yellow went

778
00:40:57,320 --> 00:40:59,340
when you brush your teeth with Pepsodent.

779
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:03,820
And then of course, there was Bucky Beaver,

780
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:06,280
the slogan here for Ipana toothpaste.

781
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:07,180
Remember him?

782
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:08,120
No.

783
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,520
Dr. Brush a brush a brush,

784
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,600
use the new Ipana with your brand new flavor.

785
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,660
It's dandy for your teeth.

786
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,060
He was a beaver.

787
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,440
He'd flash his incisors at that point.

788
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:23,660
N-E-S-T-L-E-S,

789
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,340
Nestle's makes the very best chocolate.

790
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:31,140
That was Danny O'Day and Farfel.

791
00:41:31,260 --> 00:41:32,040
You remember?

792
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:33,160
More people remember.

793
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,220
Empire.

794
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,160
Dr. Empire?

795
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,980
That's got their telephone number.

796
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:42,040
That's got computer generation in it.

797
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,920
That's not a classic one.

798
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,220
That's not a classic one.

799
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:46,780
But it's good.

800
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:47,620
It's corn ball.

801
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:49,460
It's in that tradition.

802
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:50,600
Freaky cereal.

803
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,120
Dr. Which cereal?

804
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,080
Freaky's.

805
00:41:53,100 --> 00:41:54,060
Dr. I don't know Freaky's.

806
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,300
Breakfast of champions?

807
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:56,880
No.

808
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,920
Let me try this one.

809
00:41:59,080 --> 00:41:59,220
Dr. Alka-Seltzer.

810
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:02,660
Dr. Round, round, round the stomach through.

811
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,600
Round, round, round the system too.

812
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,640
With Alka-Seltzer you'll be glad to say,

813
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:08,680
Relief is just a swallow away.

814
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:12,020
When Josephine met Bonaparte,

815
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:14,400
He simply ran off with her heart.

816
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:17,620
No gal could ever resist him.

817
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:20,580
But then she felt a new emotion,

818
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:23,160
One with new aqua-velva lotion.

819
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,780
And a great new romance began.

820
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,800
Because there's something about

821
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,760
An aqua-velva man.

822
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:38,920
Dr. That makes me feel

823
00:42:38,980 --> 00:42:40,940
So old.

824
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,580
You're lucky I didn't do cigarette commercials.

825
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:45,160
That'll really make you feel old.

826
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,140
Dr. Now, here's,

827
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:49,460
I get the impression that this questioner

828
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:50,280
Is a little worried.

829
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,460
How long do you...

830
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:52,540
No need to be worried.

831
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,900
Dr. Well, how long do you give me?

832
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,800
Is the question.

833
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,920
I long to give you...

834
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:01,420
Oh, wait a minute.

835
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:02,600
Oh, how long do you...

836
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,160
Yeah, okay.

837
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:05,400
How long do I give you?

838
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:07,840
I give you as long as you have.

839
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,500
I cannot give more.

840
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,060
And I would not wish less.

841
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,520
Now it's up to you to extend your time.

842
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,060
So be not coy, but use your time.

843
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,900
And when you may go merry,

844
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,940
For having once but lost your prime,

845
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:24,120
You may forever tarry.

846
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,580
Stay off railroad tracks,

847
00:43:26,820 --> 00:43:29,740
Keep your fingers out of electrical sockets,

848
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,060
And remember, we, the subgeniuses, care.

849
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,760
And we, the space princess, cares the most.

850
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:42,560
She is stooped with the burden of caring for you all.

851
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:43,720
Give her a round of applause.

852
00:43:46,540 --> 00:43:48,800
Well, is that it? Is that the end of that?

853
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,260
No, no, we've got plenty more.

854
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:51,720
All right, bring them on.

855
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,700
What if speculation is futile?

856
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:04,120
Speculation may be futile as a method of resolving a problem,

857
00:44:04,340 --> 00:44:07,400
But it does infinite good for you

858
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,740
When you are able to say,

859
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,320
Well, I thought about this and I did as much as I could.

860
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,440
You know, I did what I could.

861
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:16,540
Now let the chips fall where they may.

862
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:17,480
Because I tried.

863
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,180
I did my best.

864
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,100
So what if it's futile?

865
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,200
Now at least it has provided a tiny succadenaeum to you,

866
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:32,420
A brief comfort in an endless universe of darkness and solitude.

867
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:34,700
How pleasant.

868
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:37,380
Here's one with almost common sense.

869
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,940
It's got comic book-like lettering on it.

870
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,460
What is that noise?

871
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:45,280
Well, if it's not emanating up from this platform,

872
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:47,620
Or from the fans here,

873
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:51,620
Or from the multitudinous sounds of animals

874
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:54,300
And the sowing of winds in the trees

875
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:56,900
With all the multitudinous goings-on of life,

876
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:58,480
Inaudible as dreams,

877
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:01,560
You may have exceptionally acute hearing.

878
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:05,300
You may, as a subgenius, have this unusual talent.

879
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:07,320
Subgeniuses have all sorts of

880
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:08,720
Weird and rare talents.

881
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:12,800
And sometimes they don't recognize them until late in life.

882
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:16,660
It may be that you are a kind of subgenius Roderick Usher,

883
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:19,560
Cursed with unnatural sensitivity

884
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:24,780
And forced to listen to the tiniest sound that the universe makes.

885
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:28,220
You know, a lot of people who order hearing aids

886
00:45:28,220 --> 00:45:29,720
Because they can't hear very well,

887
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,820
Find themselves not satisfied with them

888
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:34,580
Because they can hear every damn sound,

889
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:37,400
Which they had grown comfortable with filtering out.

890
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:40,160
Every remote board popping in the house

891
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,920
Now comes with awful clarity.

892
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:46,000
And they end up tuning out their hearing aids.

893
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,720
It is not beyond the bounds of possibility

894
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:53,340
Since a subgenius wrote, and so elegantly lettered this,

895
00:45:53,480 --> 00:45:55,080
That the noise you hear

896
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:59,420
Is the sound of the crystalline spheres of the universe

897
00:45:59,420 --> 00:46:01,580
Turning in majestic splendor,

898
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,040
Which most of us cannot hear

899
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:08,280
Because of the susurrus of the blood in our own veins

900
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:10,680
And the beating of our own hearts.

901
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:18,300
What form of sacrifice must I perform

902
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,540
In order to gain the ability

903
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:25,540
To fix the automatic record loader on my record player?

904
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,340
It's a repair question.

905
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:33,060
Oh, it needs repair, or it just needs to be learned?

906
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,080
They don't say.

907
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:39,600
The automatic record loader is out of whack.

908
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,640
You must sacrifice a certain amount of income

909
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:46,660
To have the expert repair it.

910
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:52,460
Or you must sacrifice an even greater load of time.

911
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:56,000
Your personal, private, precious time

912
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:59,940
Sweating and cussing and fiddling with this record player.

913
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,040
And then you will learn about it.

914
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,580
You will learn how it operates.

915
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:04,960
How it ought to operate.

916
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,600
And moments of your life which can never be replaced

917
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:10,580
Will be irretrievably gone.

918
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:14,360
Why don't you sacrifice a few moments of your time

919
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:18,220
To find out who tinkers with antique record players.

920
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,860
And then sacrifice a little bit more time

921
00:47:20,860 --> 00:47:23,140
To haul your unit down there.

922
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:26,040
And finally, sacrifice whatever simoleons

923
00:47:26,660 --> 00:47:29,180
You need to expend on this project

924
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:32,020
To get it fitted with a spanking load of energy.

925
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:34,640
A spanking new record loader.

926
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,780
There's one other sacrifice you might make.

927
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:39,900
And that is a sacrifice of time

928
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:42,220
Inspecting other similar models

929
00:47:42,220 --> 00:47:44,220
Which you might cannibalize

930
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:47,880
To extract, for your own benefit, a working part.

931
00:47:48,300 --> 00:47:50,560
All these have to be considered in the light of

932
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,200
How much you want to give

933
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:54,880
In order to receive your goal.

934
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,660
Just like everything else.

935
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:00,840
Here's a question.

936
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:04,240
Dr. Howell, that probably is on the mind

937
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:05,560
Of quite a few people.

938
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:07,640
But this one dared to ask it.

939
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,780
Do you think Reverend Baby Bear

940
00:48:10,780 --> 00:48:13,520
Would go out with a subgenius like me?

941
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:19,680
You know, all things are possible to Allah.

942
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:24,480
But I wouldn't ask Allah in this case.

943
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:28,300
I think Reverend Baby Bear

944
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,420
Is already tied up in that way.

945
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:33,460
But of course she could have her pick

946
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,180
Of anyone here if she wanted.

947
00:48:35,660 --> 00:48:37,840
All you have to do in this case

948
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,580
Like any vain hope

949
00:48:40,580 --> 00:48:43,740
Is to preserve in your hope.

950
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:47,000
Because that may be your only cold comfort.

951
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,980
Still, faint heart never won fair lady.

952
00:48:50,240 --> 00:48:51,760
So get in line now.

953
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:56,120
Oh, this is a good one.

954
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:58,660
It's a loaded question, Dr. Howell.

955
00:48:58,740 --> 00:48:59,860
Well, they're always loaded.

956
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,960
What is the most endangered animal

957
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:04,660
You've ever had sex with?

958
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:09,640
Well, of course it has to be the human.

959
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:13,000
Nothing is more endangered than that.

960
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,620
The human is unique in hubris.

961
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:20,620
But the humans that I have had sex with

962
00:49:20,620 --> 00:49:23,600
Had very little to do with the problem itself.

963
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:26,200
The problem was created by other humans.

964
00:49:26,560 --> 00:49:29,440
You know, I'm not lying down beside the humans

965
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,500
Who are responsible for the mess

966
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,940
That we're in today.

967
00:49:33,200 --> 00:49:36,040
And it is unlikely that I should do so.

968
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:37,160
Raise up!

969
00:49:38,740 --> 00:49:41,160
If people wear underwear

970
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:43,000
More than they do pants,

971
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:45,240
Are underwear still underwear?

972
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,860
Or are pants now over-wear?

973
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:51,340
Why? Or why not?

974
00:49:52,340 --> 00:49:54,060
Well, pants are over-wear.

975
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:56,440
Because they're not underwear.

976
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,520
And there was a fashion a few years ago

977
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,360
For wearing underwear.

978
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,440
And now we're wearing underwear as outer-wear.

979
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:02,840
Wearing underwear over the pants.

980
00:50:03,120 --> 00:50:07,860
But underwear has always been the ligature

981
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:09,060
Beneath the ligature.

982
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,020
As the Latin word for underwear

983
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:12,780
Subligaculum shows.

984
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,820
So, the question is

985
00:50:15,820 --> 00:50:17,840
Are you going to go without underwear?

986
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,540
Are you going to go commando?

987
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:22,880
Because then your pants will be your underwear.

988
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:26,740
Then your over-wear will be your inner-wear.

989
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,180
Is this what you want?

990
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:30,440
It may not increase your popularity.

991
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,380
Something to think about, kids.

992
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:37,200
Here's another one with

993
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,640
Alex and his troops wore them outside.

994
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,840
This has nice handwriting.

995
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:43,620
We like nice handwriting.

996
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,100
Dear Dr. Howell,

997
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:47,380
Is the earth expanding?

998
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,720
Best regards, Hay Seed.

999
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:53,360
Drinks provided in lieu of cash.

1000
00:50:54,220 --> 00:50:56,120
Is the earth expanding?

1001
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,140
The earth?

1002
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:00,280
The earth is expanding.

1003
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,580
The earth receives all kinds of trash

1004
00:51:04,580 --> 00:51:06,840
Constantly from the rest of the universe.

1005
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:10,940
We are being pelted with cosmic refuse

1006
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:14,400
And with junk left over from the formation of the solar system.

1007
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:20,480
Our oceans largely came from a bombardment of cometary ice.

1008
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,320
And there's plenty more water out there.

1009
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:26,100
There's a lot of junk left over.

1010
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,340
In the asteroid belt.

1011
00:51:28,100 --> 00:51:30,620
Everything that falls to earth stays here.

1012
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,180
Then the molten mantle of the earth

1013
00:51:34,180 --> 00:51:38,000
Though it has expanded to as far as it gets

1014
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:41,040
Creates further expansion by heat

1015
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,040
And the process of subduction.

1016
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:47,120
The process of subduction moves the continental masses around

1017
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:52,200
On the nickel-iron-molten-magma crust of the earth.

1018
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,500
And its magnetic pole shifts

1019
00:51:56,100 --> 00:52:01,640
Every few eons to another sign of its instability.

1020
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,140
But the earth will never expand enough to cause you any problem.

1021
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:09,240
Even though a future earth may be large enough

1022
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:13,600
So that the gravitational aspect of the equation is different.

1023
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:17,060
What would our remote descendants look like

1024
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:18,180
To deal with this problem

1025
00:52:18,180 --> 00:52:21,500
If we were lucky enough as a species to continue?

1026
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,740
Looking into this matter, I've found that

1027
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,020
If you take a human baby

1028
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:31,040
And scale him up so that he's ten or twelve feet high

1029
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:41,200
That's a good picture of what human future evolutionary individuals would look like.

1030
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:46,060
The principle of neoteny is at work on the human today.

1031
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:49,380
But we may interfere with our own evolution

1032
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:51,280
Because it may be convenient to do so.

1033
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,720
One way to distinguish between human and human

1034
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:54,720


1035
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:55,000
Is that we have to control the future.

1036
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,760
And one reason why we must control the future

1037
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,080
Rather than the humans controlling the future

1038
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:06,200
Is if the humans control the future

1039
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:08,220
As we gradually evolve

1040
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:12,240
Of course we'll become giant heads floating around.

1041
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:15,360
That's a remoter stage of the future.

1042
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,480
Right. If the humans are in charge

1043
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:22,760
We'll be giant heads floating around with no genitals.

1044
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:26,280
The subgenius heads floating around

1045
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:30,760
Will still have wieners and vajayjay's.

1046
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:34,820
And not just plug into some ungodly machine

1047
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:37,100
Protracted by perverted science.

1048
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,860
Right. That's why it's really pretty important

1049
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:43,980
That we win and that X Day happens.

1050
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,060
By the way, I've...

1051
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,200
Gotta get those plugs straightened out.

1052
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:52,220
I've been having to reassure people

1053
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:55,880
About X Day and what happens to the Earth.

1054
00:53:56,380 --> 00:54:03,200
Some subs are concerned that we'll just wreck

1055
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,660
What could be a perfectly useful planet.

1056
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:06,920
And we want to make it clear

1057
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,340
That what we're doing is returning it

1058
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,900
To its pristine state.

1059
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:11,660
That's right.

1060
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:13,200
The way it was before we were here.

1061
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,280
We're not wrecking shit. We're saving it.

1062
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:19,160
A giant molten mass belching out toxic gas.

1063
00:54:19,320 --> 00:54:22,200
Yes, to return it to its pure primordial state.

1064
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:22,680
Right.

1065
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,600
And Operation Clean Slate, we call it.

1066
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,880
And here's the last question for Ask Dr. Howell.

1067
00:54:29,880 --> 00:54:31,540
Very well. We're about to end this whole

1068
00:54:31,540 --> 00:54:33,020
Ask Dr. Howell malarkey.

1069
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:35,640
And we're gonna start the Bulldada auction soon.

1070
00:54:35,820 --> 00:54:36,700
So prepare for that.

1071
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,200
And now for the last question.

1072
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,660
The last Ask Dr. Howell question.

1073
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:43,100
This was handed in by Dr. Dark.

1074
00:54:43,140 --> 00:54:45,280
And I suspect maybe he hadn't had his morning coffee.

1075
00:54:45,460 --> 00:54:47,180
Because this is strangely worded.

1076
00:54:47,260 --> 00:54:47,860
Uh-huh.

1077
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,140
Was your first round of applause experienced

1078
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,080
A spanking?

1079
00:54:55,080 --> 00:54:57,800
Did you experience your first round of applause

1080
00:54:57,800 --> 00:55:00,700
As the sound of hands whacking your ass?

1081
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:02,080
Did I exp...

1082
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,180
Dr. Dark has just rephrased this question.

1083
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,140
That's a good idea.

1084
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,600
Did I experience the first round of applause

1085
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,440
As hands whacking my ass?

1086
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,300
This was not applause.

1087
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:15,280
You know, any performer knows the difference

1088
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:17,880
Between applause, which is on your side,

1089
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,040
And hands whacking your ass,

1090
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:23,560
Which may or may not be in your favor.

1091
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:26,620
No, applause is a special thing.

1092
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,100
It is the lifeblood to a performer.

1093
00:55:30,460 --> 00:55:34,480
And no mere whackage on the buttocks

1094
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:36,820
Can possibly be the same thing.

1095
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,460
Good in and of itself, but not the same thing.

1096
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:42,940
And now we are joined by Reverend Angry Larry.

1097
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,220
He can't write, so he had to ask his question.

1098
00:55:46,220 --> 00:55:47,540
No, I didn't have a question early,

1099
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:48,660
And then all the while I was sitting there,

1100
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:49,780
I thought of a couple of them.

1101
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:51,580
One popped into your mind.

1102
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:54,960
The proper definition of a few words.

1103
00:55:56,540 --> 00:56:00,380
Faggot, queer, fuck, prick, anything like that.

1104
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,360
I know they all have actual meanings

1105
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,080
Besides what we think they are.

1106
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:06,820
How about fun?

1107
00:56:07,220 --> 00:56:09,520
Fun? Oh, for all of them?

1108
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:09,880
Yeah.

1109
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,800
Okay, well, they're...

1110
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:12,440
And are we not men?

1111
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:15,060
You are men.

1112
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:16,760
Oh, that was my question.

1113
00:56:16,760 --> 00:56:19,960
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men.

1114
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:24,960
And, oh, did you have another question, little boy?

1115
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:25,460
No, that was it.

1116
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:27,300
No, that was my question.

1117
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:30,460
The true definition of all of those words.

1118
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,740
I hope I didn't disappoint you.

1119
00:56:31,860 --> 00:56:34,020
Maybe we could find out...

1120
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:35,800
Or call them fun words.

1121
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:39,220
But fun words boils down to fun.

1122
00:56:39,420 --> 00:56:41,580
And as you must know,

1123
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:45,280
Everything either boils down to fun or not fun.

1124
00:56:45,280 --> 00:56:48,940
So boil it down to the proper residue.

1125
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:56,200
And, friends, that ends this session of Ask Dr. Howell

1126
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,900
and this hour of slack.

1127
00:56:59,240 --> 00:56:59,980
We've actually...

1128
00:56:59,980 --> 00:57:02,300
The recorder's been on for 56 minutes.

1129
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,700
Do I do the outro poem or shall we not do that?

1130
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:08,320
Yeah, you could do an outro poem.

1131
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:11,060
And then we'll have the Bulldada auction.

1132
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:15,160
All right, folks, we're gonna do the outro poem.

1133
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:17,280
And then the Bulldada auction.

1134
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:22,640
Have I done the skeleton in armor here at Ex Day before?

1135
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:26,420
By Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

1136
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,440
The Skeleton in Armor

1137
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:35,660
Speak, speak, thou fearful guest

1138
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:37,700
Who with thy hollow breast

1139
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:39,940
Still in rude armor dressed

1140
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:42,380
Comest to daunt me

1141
00:57:42,380 --> 00:57:44,160
Wrapped not in eastern balms

1142
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,280
But with thy fleshless palms

1143
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,220
Stretched as if asking alms

1144
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:52,800
Why dost thou haunt me?

1145
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,120
Then from those cavernous eyes

1146
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:59,060
Pale flashes seemed to rise

1147
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:02,380
As when the northern skies gleam in December

1148
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:06,540
And as the waters flow under December's snow

1149
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:09,980
Came a dull voice of woe

1150
00:58:09,980 --> 00:58:12,160
From the heart's chamber

1151
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:16,840
I was a Viking old

1152
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:19,400
My deeds though manifold

1153
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:22,600
No scald in song has told

1154
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,400
No saga taught thee

1155
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,700
Take heed that in thy verse

1156
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,080
Thou dost the tale rehearse

1157
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:33,460
Else fear a dead man's curse

1158
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:35,960
For this I sought thee

1159
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,860
Far in the northern land

1160
00:58:38,860 --> 00:58:41,540
By the wild Baltic's strand

1161
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:44,400
I with my childish hand

1162
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,560
Tamed the Gyrfalcon

1163
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:49,320
And with my skates fast bound

1164
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:51,440
Skimmed the half-frozen sound

1165
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:54,320
That the poor whimpering hound

1166
00:58:54,320 --> 00:58:56,540
Trembled to walk on

1167
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,420
But when I older grew

1168
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,120
Joining a corsair's crew

1169
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,420
Over the sea we flew

1170
00:59:02,420 --> 00:59:04,120
With the marauders

1171
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,360
Wild was the life we led

1172
00:59:06,360 --> 00:59:08,680
Many the souls that bled

1173
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:10,900
Many the hearts that fed

1174
00:59:10,900 --> 00:59:12,880
By our stern orders

1175
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:16,220
Once as I told in glee

1176
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:18,380
Tales of the stormy sea

1177
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:21,340
Soft eyes there gazed on me

1178
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,900
Burning yet tender

1179
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:26,480
And as the dark stars shine

1180
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,800
On the black Norway pine

1181
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:31,260
On that dark heart of mine

1182
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:34,660
Fell their soft splendor

1183
00:59:34,660 --> 00:59:37,800
I wooed the blue-eyed maid

1184
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:40,620
Yielding yet unafraid

1185
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,560
And in the forest glade

1186
00:59:42,560 --> 00:59:44,200
Our vows were plighted

1187
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:46,160
Under her loosened vests

1188
00:59:46,900 --> 00:59:49,480
Grasped I her trembling breasts

1189
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:52,400
Like birds within their nests

1190
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:54,560
By the hawk frighted

1191
00:59:54,560 --> 00:59:57,000
Bright in her father's hall

1192
00:59:57,000 --> 00:59:59,220
Shields gleamed upon the wall

1193
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,760
Loudly the minstrels all

1194
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:03,020
Chanted his glory

1195
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:05,160
When of old Hildebrand

1196
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:08,120
I asked his daughter's hand

1197
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:11,300
Mute did the minstrels stand

1198
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:12,880
To hear my story

1199
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:16,120
As the brown ale he quaffed

1200
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:19,880
Loud then the champion laughed

1201
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,380
And as the winds that waft

1202
01:00:22,380 --> 01:00:24,440
The sea foam lightly

1203
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,140
So the loud laugh of scorn

1204
01:00:29,160 --> 01:00:31,900
Out from those lips unshorn

1205
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:34,140
From the deep drinking horn

1206
01:00:34,140 --> 01:00:36,800
Blew the foam brightly

1207
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:39,320
She was a prince's child

1208
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:41,440
I but a Viking wild

1209
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,520
And though she blushed and smiled

1210
01:00:43,520 --> 01:00:44,960
I was discarded

1211
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,660
Should not the dove so white

1212
01:00:47,660 --> 01:00:49,900
Follow the sea-mew's flight

1213
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,140
Why did they leave that night

1214
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:54,820
Her nest unguarded

1215
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:57,240
Scarce had I put to sea

1216
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:59,240
Bearing the maid with me

1217
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,120
Fairer by far was she

1218
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,480
Than all the Norsemen

1219
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,520
When on the bright sea-sand

1220
01:01:04,520 --> 01:01:06,040
Waving his armored hand

1221
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:08,140
Saw we old Hildebrand

1222
01:01:08,140 --> 01:01:10,100
With twenty horsemen

1223
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,440
Launched we against the blast

1224
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,700
Bent like a reed each mast

1225
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:16,600
Yet we were gaining fast

1226
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:18,160
When the wind failed us

1227
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:19,860
And in the gusty flaw

1228
01:01:19,860 --> 01:01:22,280
Came round the sudden scar

1229
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:24,800
So that the foe we saw laugh

1230
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:26,400
As he hailed us

1231
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,160
And as the flapping sail

1232
01:01:28,160 --> 01:01:30,580
Veered round to catch the gale

1233
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:33,120
Death was the helmsman's hail

1234
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,040
Death without quarter

1235
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,340
Mid-ship with iron keel

1236
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:40,040
Struck we her ribs of steel

1237
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:43,440
Down her black hulk did reel

1238
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,840
Through the black water

1239
01:01:45,840 --> 01:01:48,820
As with his wings aslant

1240
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:51,320
Soars the fierce cormorant

1241
01:01:51,320 --> 01:01:53,580
Seeking some rocky haunt

1242
01:01:53,580 --> 01:01:55,300
With his prey laden

1243
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:57,000
So toward the open main

1244
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,840
Beating to sea again

1245
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:01,280
Out through the hurricane

1246
01:02:01,280 --> 01:02:03,820
Bore I the maiden

1247
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,460
Three weeks we westward bore

1248
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,560
And when the storm was o'er

1249
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,140
Cloud-like we saw the shore

1250
01:02:10,140 --> 01:02:12,360
Stretching to leeward

1251
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,820
There for my lady's bower

1252
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:17,220
Built I the lofty tower

1253
01:02:17,220 --> 01:02:19,380
Which to this very hour

1254
01:02:19,380 --> 01:02:21,880
Stands looking seaward

1255
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,700
There we lived many years

1256
01:02:24,700 --> 01:02:27,280
Time dried the maiden's tears

1257
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:29,300
She had forgot her fears

1258
01:02:29,300 --> 01:02:31,700
She was a mother

1259
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:33,800
Death closed her eyes

1260
01:02:33,820 --> 01:02:35,040
Her pale blue eyes

1261
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,740
Under that tower she lies

1262
01:02:37,740 --> 01:02:39,680
Never shall sun arise

1263
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:40,740
On such another

1264
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:43,380
Still grew my bosom then

1265
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,960
Still as a stagnant fen

1266
01:02:46,820 --> 01:02:49,060
Hateful to me were men

1267
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,700
The sunlight hateful

1268
01:02:51,700 --> 01:02:54,580
In the vast forest here

1269
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:57,620
Fell I upon my spear

1270
01:02:57,620 --> 01:02:59,900
Clad in my warlike gear

1271
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,740
Oh, death was grateful

1272
01:03:02,740 --> 01:03:06,460
Thus seemed with many scars

1273
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:08,760
Bursting these prison bars

1274
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,740
Up to its native stars

1275
01:03:11,260 --> 01:03:12,740
My soul ascended

1276
01:03:13,320 --> 01:03:16,100
There from its flowing bowl

1277
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:19,360
Drinks deep the warrior's soul

1278
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:22,140
Skol! To the Northland!

1279
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:22,980
Skol!

1280
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,700
Thus the tale ended

1281
01:03:26,700 --> 01:03:28,380
Thank you everyone

1282
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:41,560
Thanks for watching!

1283
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:42,660
I hope you enjoyed it!

1284
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:48,460
And I hope you'll come back

1285
01:03:48,460 --> 01:03:48,620
And see you next time

1286
01:03:48,620 --> 01:03:48,940
See you then!

1287
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:48,940


1288
01:03:56,080 --> 01:03:57,760
See you next time!

1289
01:03:59,540 --> 01:03:59,540


1290
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1291
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1292
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1293
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1294
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1295
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1296
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1297
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1298
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1299
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1300
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1301
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1302
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1303
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1304
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1305
01:03:59,720 --> 01:03:59,720


1306
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:01,160
Bye!

1307
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:02,720

So don't think it's all

1310
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:06,060

From the benthic bottom

1316
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:17,200
Of the conspiracy

1317
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,480
All those scraps and things

1318
01:04:19,480 --> 01:04:21,340
