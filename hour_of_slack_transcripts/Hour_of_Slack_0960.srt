1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:03,880
Hello?

2
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:05,400
Now you listen to me.

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:07,720
You asked for this.

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,040
You asked for...

5
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,440
The self-genius.

6
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:13,300
Power of...

7
00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:14,060
What?

8
00:00:14,620 --> 00:00:15,740
Shut up, you.

9
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:16,560
Get out of here.

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,020
He's a raven lunatic.

11
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:30,140
You are directed to make effort to keep it alive and protect it against injury.

12
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,180
Well, I understand.

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,040
This is a coordinated monthly test being tested.

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:44,320
This station serves your area.

15
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:48,020
Quick-quip confinement being tested is being conceded during emergency warning.

16
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,000
If this...

17
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,080
This had followed the alert tone.

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,280
This concludes the emergency...

19
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,560
Are you looking for your family tonight?

20
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:54,540
This is Lisa Mc...

21
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,740
Make sure the...

22
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,440
Are picked from...

23
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:57,360
My game date for my...

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:57,600
Plan.

25
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,920
Flip your game...

26
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,260
Part of...

27
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:00,900
Mountain News Denver Rock Wednesday and...

28
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:01,420
He's every...

29
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,060
Hipsters!

30
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:06,980
Flipsters!

31
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,760
And finger-popping...

32
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,700
Daddies!

33
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:15,220
Knock me your loads.

34
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,780
How are you, fellas?

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,580
It's him.

36
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,280
The anomaly.

37
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:18,840
Do we...

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,240
Do we proceed?

39
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:19,600
Yes.

40
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,800
He is still...

41
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,780
Only human.

42
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:31,080
Okay, this is a special emergency edition hour of slack by myself, the Reverend Cardboard Box.

43
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,380
Standing in for Ivan Stang, who is no doubt slaving over a hot video editing program.

44
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,760
Praise Bob, help me somebody.

45
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:43,480
The subject matter of tonight's show is gays.

46
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,620
Gay marriage.

47
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,640
Gay existence.

48
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:47,480
Gay as a new nigger.

49
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:52,080
And gay as the new scapegoat for all the moral ills affecting society.

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:03,440
The source of this show is actually from InfidelGuy.com, who, several months back, scored a massive

51
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:08,580
coup by getting one of the Phelps clan, also known as the Westboro Baptist Church.

52
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,380
I'm sure you know who Fred Phelps is.

53
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:13,860
God hates fags.

54
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,520
Ring any bells?

55
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,480
Good.

56
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:15,840
Good.

57
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,820
So, to come on the show, by telephone, and try and explain what their position was.

58
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,020
That lasted on the show for the first 15 minutes, and then they went to the phones.

59
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,640
I've only managed to get to the first 15 minutes.

60
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,540
Listening to these guys talk, and realising just how closed and certain their minds are

61
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,540
is kind of disturbing.

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:42,080
On the subject of gay marriage myself, I don't particularly see the difference between two

63
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,320
homosexual people getting married and two heterosexual people getting married.

64
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:48,360
Technically speaking, there's two aspects to marriage, you see.

65
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:54,280
There's the religious ceremony, you know, white weddings, church bells ringing, ding-a-ling-a-ding-dong,

66
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,420
that sort of thing.

67
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:01,240
And then there's the civil aspect, the change in status in society.

68
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,060
And a lot of people don't seem to understand that.

69
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:12,100
They consider the ritual and the state change to be one and the same thing.

70
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:14,680
Myself?

71
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,720
I don't see anything.

72
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,220
I don't see any difference in one orientation over another.

73
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,640
I don't care if you're homosexual, heterosexual, bisexual, trisexual, transsexual, polysexual,

74
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,000
polyamorous, polyvinyl chloride, polywolly doodle all the day, or just plain asexual.

75
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:39,160
If you want to devote your life to your significant other, or indeed others, I see no reason why

76
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,260
the state should discriminate against you in favour of just one monogamous straight marrying

77
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,780
another monogamous straight.

78
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,520
Of the opposite sex, of course.

79
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,900
That's just tradition.

80
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,960
And basically, when something becomes a tradition, friends, it's generally a good time to haul

81
00:03:56,960 --> 00:04:02,780
it out, lay it flat on the table, poke it, see what kind of fluids ooze out, and if you

82
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:08,280
don't like what you see, if it looks like it's gone well past its use-by date, then

83
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:15,160
it's time to chuck it out and find something that's as good, or more importantly, better.

84
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:15,820
I'm not saying that's a bad thing.

85
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:15,820


86
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:15,820


87
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:22,240
But in any case, back to the InfernoGuy.com radio show.

88
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:29,860
For the first 15 minutes, basically, Tim Phelps, Fred Phelps' brother I believe, tried

89
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:32,620
to explain why they're making such a fuss.

90
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:39,160
Well, I'm glad you asked that question because that's the question that the Romans,

91
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:43,120
that is the people at the Church of Rome, asked Paul.

92
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,520
And he gave them a good answer.

93
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:45,880
Alright.

94
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,980
And here it is in common parlance.

95
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:52,640
I can quote you what the verse says, but here it is in common parlance.

96
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,000
Who the hell do you think you are questioning what God Almighty decides His people are supposed

97
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,920
to do in the earth?

98
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:05,760
Well, those of you who are interested in the niceties of argument, you might like to note

99
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,900
that Tim here seems to be making not only an appeal to authority, but also an appeal

100
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,900
to threat.

101
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,500
That is, to make a threat.

102
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:15,500


103
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,460
And here it is, he is saying, basically, that God is incredibly superior to every other

104
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:27,860
thing, therefore it is not within our power or even right to question His decisions, and

105
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:33,760
also that you could get into terrible trouble and will for just questioning it.

106
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:40,440
But at the same time, it can be argued that the Phelps' antics, yes, I think we'll call

107
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,240
them antics, do exactly that.

108
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,500
Particularly when you take into account the fact that God is superior to every other thing.

109
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:45,500


110
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,900
And here is the question and answer.

111
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:50,480
Does your church believe in a predestination?

112
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:51,200
Absolutely.

113
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,300
Heaven, you can think of as a nightclub.

114
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,860
At the dawn of time, they were given a booking.

115
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,880
They were given a guest list of all the people who would get in.

116
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:06,440
No arguments, no changes, no additions, no omissions, no exceptions.

117
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:13,260
Now if you take that kind of doctrine into account, and it's a rather pessimistic doctrine

118
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:13,800
to me.

119
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:21,920
All of a sudden, what the Phelps' are doing with their vitriol against gays and demands

120
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:28,280
that gays repent, conform and become straight and normal, seems like nothing more than an

121
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,240
exercise in futility, doesn't it?

122
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,600
Well, it's really not any surprise.

123
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:40,180
What we believe is what all mainstream churches in their foundation doctrines believed, and

124
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:43,780
that is that there is a certain number of people in the earth who believe in the Lord.

125
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:43,780


126
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:43,780


127
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:55,780
And so, that is the essence of our faith.

128
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:04,960
Now, as you know, your church is well known for their position on homosexuality.

129
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:06,200
Right.

130
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:13,020
And we've seen the pictures of them, of Fred Phelps holding up the signs and his supporters

131
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:13,780
and the members of the church holding up the signs.

132
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:13,780


133
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:13,780


134
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,820
Now, I'm sure you get this question often, are you serious?

135
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,040
Well, we're as serious as hell is serious.

136
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:26,980
We have a duty to our fellow man.

137
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,620
We take it seriously.

138
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,240
We don't make any money off of it.

139
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,820
We all work full time, some of us more than one job.

140
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,920
We all have college and post college degrees.

141
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,980
This is a serious subject.

142
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:42,840
We owe to our fellow creatures the duty to warn them that there's a time coming when

143
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:43,760
they have to pay for it.

144
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:43,760


145
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:43,760


146
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:43,760


147
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:43,760


148
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:43,760


149
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:43,760


150
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:50,540
And the standard is set already and has been set from eternity past.

151
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,480
And it's written in a very specific way and very clear way in the scriptures.

152
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,160
If you don't obey it, you're going to burn in hell.

153
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:08,540
And the ultimate betrayal and the ultimate violation of God's law is found in this filthy

154
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:11,360
conduct that people euphemistically call gay.

155
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:12,120
Right.

156
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,760
Now, Tim, I thought you said that the church is a little bit more of a, you know, a little

157
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:13,760


158
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:13,800
perverse than it is.

159
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:13,800


160
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:13,800


161
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:13,800


162
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:13,800


163
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:13,800


164
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:13,800


165
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:13,800


166
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,140
Well, the ultimate transgression against God was to deny the Holy Spirit.

167
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:22,660
Well of course that's what you're doing when you preach the lies that these people

168
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:27,740
preach trying to bend the laws of God around to suit the lust of these beasts.

169
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:36,660
But don't confuse the ultimate depravity or violation or assault on God with what the

170
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:38,600
Bible calls the unpardonable sin.

171
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,600
Really?

172
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,780
I mean, how do we know that that was referring to homosexuality?

173
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:43,540
Well, what?

174
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:46,600
But blasphemy, which is what you're talking about,

175
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:53,200
there's this notion in Christendom that that has some narrow definition.

176
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,380
It is nothing more and nothing less than denying the essence of God.

177
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,240
Insert weird, old-funnery slack.

178
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,620
Noice stuff as promised.

179
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,860
You know you like it just as much as I do.

180
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:08,900
Well then, would you like some more tea, Thalia?

181
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:12,580
I think you should just pour it on that jelly of yours.

182
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,000
Oh, Ooni. Ooni loves tea.

183
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,300
I usually pour it into a large container for Ooni to sit in.

184
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,840
Does that help relieve his poor, tired, achy whatever he's got?

185
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,700
No, that's how he eats.

186
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,280
He eats that way. He absorbs the tea.

187
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,440
It just kind of goes up and it's gone.

188
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,880
I don't know where it goes, but it somehow goes in him.

189
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,500
And where does it come out?

190
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,000
I've never seen that, you know?

191
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,660
Cho says it has to happen, but I've never actually seen it myself.

192
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,320
Maybe he sweats.

193
00:09:43,540 --> 00:09:43,840
I've never seen him sweat.

194
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,380
Actually, that's a thought.

195
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:51,640
Cho said once that Ooni had pores, so maybe that's how he gathers with it.

196
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,680
Of course, Ooni never feels wet.

197
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:56,480
Yeah, but he does leave a slime trail at night.

198
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:57,580
At least that's gotta be him.

199
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:59,920
I can't explain what that is on the floor otherwise.

200
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,300
Um, I spilled some plums.

201
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,060
I was canning some plums.

202
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,380
One day in Teletubbyland.

203
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:18,160
I planned to have Tinky Winky here with me this morning.

204
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,640
And I didn't get Tinky.

205
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,920
If you have LVM, you're supposed to have Tinky Winky right up here.

206
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,200
And I don't see him unless he's under there somewhere.

207
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,700
But, uh, Tinky Winky.

208
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:30,640
Tinky Winky is a, uh, former drug addict, drug pusher.

209
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,960
Everything you can mention bad, he's done it twice.

210
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:33,880
He's done it twice.

211
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,500
He's done it twice.

212
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:36,100
Outed.

213
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:38,320
That's the word when they come out of the closet.

214
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,080
Or whatever it is.

215
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:41,860
Uh, they, uh, out had outed Tinky Winky.

216
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,580
And poor Jerry got outed.

217
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,220
It's not true.

218
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,400
But I had him on Friday night on my list in America as my co-host.

219
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,880
And I had him tied up right in the chair there.

220
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,660
And we attacked the Teletubbies.

221
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,380
Attacked the Teletubbies.

222
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,220
Attacked the Teletubbies.

223
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:57,260
And it was a, a parent's alert.

224
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,580
Parents to monitor what their children watch on TV.

225
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,820
South Park, cartoons, etc.

226
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,180
Go to my website, ballwell.com.

227
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:06,300
ballwell.com.

228
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,540
It is all there.

229
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:08,100
Plus.

230
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:10,040
My response to it.

231
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,160
Time for Tubby Bye Bye.

232
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,080
Time for Tubby Bye Bye.

233
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,860
Time for Tubby Bye Bye.

234
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:15,280
Time for Tubby Bye Bye.

235
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,740
Time for Tubby Bye Bye.

236
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:15,760
Time for Tubby Bye Bye.

237
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:15,760


238
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:15,760


239
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,960
Like it's the fruit of the devil.

240
00:11:19,460 --> 00:11:20,140
Evil.

241
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,400
Jesus of the flavor pornography.

242
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:29,240
Jesus Christ has a homosexual or lesbian relationship that'll satisfy you.

243
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:34,300
Joy unspeakable in some of these sordid affairs.

244
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:38,080
You say, Jesus, but I want that.

245
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:39,720
I am a sinner.

246
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,960
Now, whatever you're into, God knows it.

247
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:46,140
He knows how you made your bed, and he's willing to forgive you.

248
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,020
I am Lord Jesus.

249
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:49,660
That's right.

250
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:51,460
Lord Jesus Christ.

251
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,480
I know my own body.

252
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:59,860
God Almighty, I turn away now, and I turn wrong.

253
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:04,640
God Almighty, I turn away my loved ones.

254
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,820
Even Jesus.

255
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:15,320
I take you as my sinner, and I ask you to come now in me, and I will serve you.

256
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,680
I take you.

257
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,820
I make you.

258
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,640
And I ask you to come in me.

259
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:22,460
Thank you, Jesus.

260
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:24,680
I enjoyed that.

261
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,400
Let's do it again.

262
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:32,620
On second thoughts, let's have some credits for the last three items, shall we?

263
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:36,640
First off, we had Jennifer Diane Wright.

264
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:43,640
She's the owner of Transsexual.org and producer of Unicorn Jelly, which you can buy through

265
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:51,040
unicornjelly.com, as well as producing her new comic strip, Pastel Defender Heliotrope,

266
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:58,920
having some fun with her spouse, Sandra Woodruff, and a microphone, playing Lupico and Thilia

267
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,580
at home.

268
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:06,620
Now, you're going to have to go to unicornjelly.com and find out who Lupico and Thilia are, and

269
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:06,620


270
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:12,760
who Ooni is, and what Ooni is, and Cho is, and so on and so forth.

271
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,820
And please buy the books.

272
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:15,880
I helped work on them.

273
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,560
Yeah, that's right.

274
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,940
I'm that cardboard box.

275
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,420
Thanks for asking.

276
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,660
Next up, we had a strange little cut-up involving Tinky Winky and Jerry Falwell.

277
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,300
I'm not sure who did that.

278
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:30,080
There's no information on the MP3, which is a damn pity.

279
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:36,600
But next up, the last one in the lot was Jesus Pornoslave by, of course, the mighty Lillian

280
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,160
Lemieux.

281
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:45,460
But now we have to go back to the vileness of the Phelpses, as they try and explain why

282
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,300
they call fags fags, and why they call fags beasts.

283
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,360
Tim, you're back on.

284
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:56,880
Now, why the verbal insults, though, like beast fag?

285
00:13:56,960 --> 00:13:58,180
Why would you call them names?

286
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,820
I mean, they are still human beings, right?

287
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:00,420
I mean...

288
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:01,500
Those are Bible names.

289
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:02,120
Really?

290
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:03,960
I didn't see the word fag in the Bible.

291
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:06,360
Well, that's because you don't study the Bible.

292
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:06,580
Well, that's because you don't study the Bible.

293
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:06,580


294
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,940
F-A-G is in the Bible.

295
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,840
Do you know what the word fag comes from?

296
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,980
What the etymology of the word means.

297
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,480
Something about burning or something.

298
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:23,680
We don't get to take 20th or 21st century definitions of words that are twisted and

299
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,300
molded by public opinion and say that's what the words mean.

300
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:30,400
You've got to look honestly at what the root of the word is.

301
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,220
A faggot is a brand.

302
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,400
A brand.

303
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:36,700
You know, like a fire brand.

304
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Like a hot burning stick that fuels the fire.

305
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,500
That's what the word literally means.

306
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,500
Oh, yeah, like a cigarette.

307
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:44,980
Like slang for a cigarette is a fag.

308
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:45,400
Yes.

309
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,080
And that's because cigarettes burn quick and hot.

310
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,080
That's why they were called fags.

311
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:51,540
Right.

312
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,300
But it comes from that root word that means brand.

313
00:14:54,920 --> 00:15:03,200
And it says in Amos that the elect are uniquely considered saved and it says they are plucked

314
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,540
as a brand from the burning.

315
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:09,560
That is, they're about to be burned up in the fires of wrath, but they were saved from

316
00:15:09,560 --> 00:15:09,760
it.

317
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,440
But the word is valid.

318
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:17,800
The word is used for fags to reach back to that day when God Almighty destroyed them

319
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:18,920
by an immolation.

320
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:25,960
Before we get on with Timmy's concern, whatever that is, he's finally going to explain it

321
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,660
pretty soon, I'm going to say something about the background music.

322
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:34,520
We started off with the Raid on Fort Knox theme from Goldfinger, Paul's favorite.

323
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:34,520


324
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,420
Scroll down through altbinaries.slack.

325
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:43,680
And since then, we've been having background music from the cult British TV show, The Prisoner.

326
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:47,840
You might remember that one, Prisoner 6 has escaped, that sort of thing.

327
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,480
We just thought you should know what it was and is going to be anyhow.

328
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,360
Okay, now, exactly what is Timmy's concern?

329
00:15:57,840 --> 00:16:00,980
Close the door, they're coming through the window.

330
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,280
Close the door, they're coming up the stairs.

331
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,120
Close the roof, they're coming through the ceiling.

332
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:09,640
Those...

333
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:16,180
Are everywhere.

334
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,200
Sorry about that.

335
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,640
That wasn't actually Tim Phelps.

336
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,320
That was the famous equals interpreting Tim Phelps.

337
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:25,100
But let Tim Phelps tell you in his own words.

338
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:32,560
Instead of trying to strain at a gnat and swallow the camel, why don't we talk about

339
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,080
what we really are talking about.

340
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:34,260
We're talking about the camel.

341
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:38,860
The camel is a proud, boasting, out of the closet, aggressive pervert.

342
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,340
Vulgar, pushy pervert.

343
00:16:41,620 --> 00:16:43,080
That's what we're talking about.

344
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,020
You can't change a pervert.

345
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,640
We're not trying to change any perverts.

346
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:54,120
We tell you straight out, if there is any hope for you, it's because what we tell you

347
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:58,020
scares you deep down inside and God settles it into you.

348
00:16:58,120 --> 00:17:00,240
You better repent or you're going to burn in hell.

349
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,640
And that scares you.

350
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,420
You stop what you're doing.

351
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,040
You never talk about it again.

352
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:11,420
You engage in preaching against it, driven from inside you, not driven by some program

353
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:19,360
that's developed to earn money and make yourself a name that these freaks out in Colorado and

354
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,140
other places do.

355
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:25,360
How do you view people who are, say, intersexed or maybe people with the Kleinfelder

356
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,240
syndrome or like that?

357
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:28,560
What is the church's position on that?

358
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:39,720
So that we don't spend a lot of time trying to quibble with psychobabble and socio-political discussion.

359
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:40,360
Okay.

360
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:44,680
I'll give you that for purposes of the discussion.

361
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:50,520
It is supremely irrelevant how you got into your sinful state.

362
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,420
Oh, really?

363
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:57,580
God still says that if you don't repent of it, you're doomed.

364
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:13,360
Well, because you're good atall but J and E学.

365
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:18,240
Well, remember two to three things that is true about that preach—the translation�

366
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,240


367
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,560
Has, I'm sorry?

368
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:18,560


369
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,320
Do you understand what I meant when I said it was funny enough or is sounds like the

370
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:19,320


371
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,900
Ha, no.

372
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,160
Just write, and then sleevg that one or the other, and you'll know when to kick your

373
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:25,260
ass.

374
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,020
Beautiful, beautiful.

375
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:28,540
I appreciate it.

376
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,120
I wouldn't be blue somehow

377
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,440
I wouldn't be crying now

378
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,700
If I'd only believe in you

379
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:51,460
I wouldn't be wondering who

380
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,420
You're giving your kisses to

381
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:57,100
If I'd only believe in you

382
00:18:58,140 --> 00:19:00,300
I was a fool to listen

383
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:01,900
To tales that they brought

384
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,140
I learned that they were lies

385
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,960
Oh, what a lesson it's part

386
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,640
We wouldn't be miles apart

387
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:10,120
You still would be my sweet heart

388
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:13,280
If I'd only believe in you

389
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:57,080
I wouldn't be crying now

390
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:26,600
I wouldn't be crying now

391
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:57,080
I wouldn't be crying now

392
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:09,360
I wouldn't be crying now

393
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:54,600
I wouldn't be crying now

394
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:13,860
I wouldn't be crying now

395
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:57,080
I wouldn't be crying now

396
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:57,940
I wouldn't be crying now

397
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,800
I wouldn't be crying now

398
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,340
I wouldn't be crying now

399
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,680
I wouldn't be crying now

400
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:30,800
I wouldn't be crying now

401
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,940
I wouldn't be crying now

402
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:32,620
I wouldn't be crying now

403
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:32,620


404
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:39,040
How I momentarily

405
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:39,780
Say to God

406
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:45,100
That you know

407
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,100


408
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,100


409
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,100


410
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,100


411
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,560
And all my worries

412
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,500
I've let dirty words

413
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:47,500


414
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:47,940
And I'm in syrup

415
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,000
I'll聯파 pourraotros

416
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:53,380
I will let the wind

417
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:56,020
That lets note

418
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:02,600
I also wonder what your church's policy is on things like biblically justified gang rape,

419
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:05,260
which we find in the book of Genesis with Lot and his daughters.

420
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,980
She's referring to Genesis chapter 19, verse 30 onwards,

421
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:14,460
where Lot's daughters, while they're hiding in a cave after the nuking of Sodom and Gomorrah,

422
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:20,460
decide they really need a man and decide to make do with their dad by getting him drunk so he doesn't know what he's doing.

423
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:25,080
Hmm. Okay, well, good question. Thank you. We'll take it off the air. Thank you.

424
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:29,980
Well, first of all, Jennifer, you apparently didn't really read that story

425
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:34,860
other than to try to think you could carve some way to jab at the elect of God with it.

426
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,200
What Lot did was not gang rape.

427
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:45,960
What Lot did was, when he was drunk, he had sex with his two daughters.

428
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:50,620
Nobody in this church has ever suggested that that wasn't a grotesque sin,

429
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,060
and in fact, two despised-of-God nations came from that sin.

430
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:03,500
Number one. Number two, don't confuse the ceremonial laws that were written in the Old Testament

431
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:06,980
with the moral laws that were written in the Old Testament.

432
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:11,840
The ceremonial laws passed away when Jesus Christ fulfilled them.

433
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:18,180
The moral laws were reinforced and spoken of in even stronger language by Jesus Christ,

434
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:21,180
including the law against sodomy.

435
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,380
Yes.

436
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:23,320
Uh...

437
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:23,500
Uh...

438
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:23,920
Uh...

439
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,240
Uh...

440
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,240


441
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:24,660
Uh...

442
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:24,660


443
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:24,660


444
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:24,720
Uh...

445
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:24,900
Uh...

446
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:24,900


447
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:24,900


448
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,040
Uh...

449
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,040


450
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:25,060
Uh...

451
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:32,880
helps. You said that in the book of Romans, Paul says, who are you to question God who

452
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,980
has made you thus? Basically, he tells it in response to those who say, well, why did

453
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:47,240
God make us such? As in, for example, God predetermining those who shall be homosexuals

454
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,100
and those who shall be unbelievers. In other words, if God has made you that way, then

455
00:25:52,100 --> 00:25:57,220
how is it basically that God turns around and tells you to repent that which he made

456
00:25:57,220 --> 00:26:02,620
you, and like you said, they can't repent of it anyway. And yet you still, it becomes,

457
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:06,920
well, who are you to question? Why can't we ask these questions? When it basically, if

458
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:12,680
God sets this way and predetermines it where you don't have any choice of being so, and

459
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:17,500
yet you're to repent of that which you can't repent of anyway, and yet we're to take the

460
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:19,280
rap for that? I don't think so.

461
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,320
Thanks for the call.

462
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,420
Can you just repeat your question?

463
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:28,860
Paul says, nay, but O man, who art thou that repliest against God? Can the thing formed

464
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:33,580
say that him that formed it, why hast thou made me thus? Hast not the potter, that is

465
00:26:33,580 --> 00:26:39,540
God, power over the clay, that is you, to make of the same lump one vessel unto honor,

466
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,800
that is the one that goes to heaven, and one unto dishonor, that is the one that goes to

467
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,960
hell? Of course he has the power to do that, and you don't have any power to question it.

468
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:50,120
Well, apparently we're doing so right now.

469
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,080
That's right, we are. We're doing so right now.

470
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,100
Thank you for the call.

471
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,740
By this time, I was starting to get sick of listening to this little twerp and his cheesy,

472
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:04,860
crappy, outdated hate fest, so I just started skipping through the MP3. About 30 minutes

473
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:06,020
in, this.

474
00:27:06,440 --> 00:27:10,900
Okay, well, actually, you seem more excited than I am. Tim, okay, let's break it down

475
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:16,560
like this then. God has a good plan, right? A divine good plan, and it's going to be fulfilled,

476
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:16,840
right?

477
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:20,260
Absolutely, and part of it is the destruction of beasts like you.

478
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,080
Okay, so everything that God does...

479
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:22,640
Everything that God does is good, right?

480
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:26,680
Everything that God does is beautiful and perfect.

481
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:31,300
Okay then, well, he created this universe knowing the way it would be, so it's a good thing that

482
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,860
homosexuals exist, that all these other things exist. It's all part of God's plan, right?

483
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,360
If it's good for me, it's bad for you.

484
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:40,680
I don't know.

485
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:42,760
It's still beautiful and perfect, but it's bad for you.

486
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,160
For all you know, you could go to hell.

487
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:48,260
You're going to spend eternity in hell, and that's a beautiful, perfect thing.

488
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:50,900
Nah, I think I'd be in heaven, because it would be hell if I was out there with you.

489
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:52,080
But you're thinking falsely then.

490
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,080


491
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,080


492
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,080


493
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,080


494
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,080


495
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,080


496
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:52,080


497
00:27:52,080 --> 00:28:00,700
Because you can't enter heaven when you deny the testimony of Christ, which is what you're doing with your foul mouth as we speak on the radio.

498
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,160
No, I'm not. I'm asking you a lot of questions.

499
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,800
And if we can't elevate the dialogue here, then this conversation's going to be over.

500
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,640
Oh, I see. I see what's going on, Tim.

501
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,900
I'm not going to exchange filth with you.

502
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:15,780
I see what's going on, Tim. You want an excuse to hang up. Well, I'm not going to give you one. Let's take this next call. You're alive with this infrared guy.

503
00:28:15,780 --> 00:28:16,840
Did you say I want to hang up?

504
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:17,880
Obviously. I didn't say anything.

505
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:22,060
I can go toe-to-toe with you, having spent 13 years working in a car.

506
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,060


507
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:22,840
I'm not going to talk to you in a corrections environment.

508
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:23,380
Oh, really?

509
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,560
There's nothing you can say that I couldn't out-embarrass you on.

510
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:27,120
Interesting.

511
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,660
But I'm here to do is speak about the doctors' great.

512
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,820
You know something, Tim? It's funny, and I'm going to turn your volume down here, because I can't talk.

513
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,120
If you don't want to do that...

514
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,240
I'm an ex-federal corrections officer myself, by the way.

515
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,560
If you don't want to do that...

516
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:37,100
And I'm a veteran.

517
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,660
...in this conversation, then I'm not going to participate in this conversation.

518
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:45,100
Wait a minute. Are you saying that if I don't allow you to say what you want to say, and I can't ask you questions, that you're going to hang up?

519
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:50,740
Well, if you're not going to ask me questions that are relevant, instead of trying to engage in filth talk, it's really impossible.

520
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:55,340
Well, that's subjective. Well, that's rather subjective. On a radio show, I'm going to ask you a lot of different questions.

521
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:59,800
Look, I don't need you. You know what I'm saying? I don't need you. I ain't making no money.

522
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:07,720
Ten minutes later, the infidel guy raised the question of passages in the Bible that seemed to condone homosexual relationships.

523
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:13,880
One of these that he mentioned involved the book of Ruth, the story of Ruth.

524
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:14,280
Okay.

525
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:20,280
Now, this was what caused Tim Phelps to do his prunes.

526
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,340
Now, if you don't know what is meant by this term, stay tuned.

527
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:30,280
Tim Phelps is going to provide you with two minutes and twenty-five seconds of a textbook example.

528
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:37,740
You perverts can turn that into some kind of a lesbian relationship boggles any sober mind.

529
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:43,020
Well, there's some instances in there where they talk about how, you know, at least three or four times in which she said, you know, she loved her and she loved...

530
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,920
Of course, and...

531
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:44,560
But in other...

532
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:47,100
I don't mean I love my brothers and sisters. I don't mean I fuck them.

533
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,720
No, not love. Love-duh. The D.

534
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,220
Well, so you think that means had sex with?

535
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,640
Everywhere else it does. People seem to...

536
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,140
Instead of...

537
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:55,820
Everywhere else it does.

538
00:29:55,820 --> 00:30:00,040
...that he had passionate, familiar affection for?

539
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:06,900
Oh, by the way, this is a... I don't know if you know this. Even though I'm an infidel, this is more of a family type show, so your language isn't really appreciated. I appreciate it.

540
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,800
You mean because I said the F word to accidentally describe what you were implying?

541
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,580
Some children have to listen to this, but you might talk like that in front of your kids. I don't know.

542
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:20,720
You can imply it okay. You're saying that those blessed women had sex with each other, but I'm not supposed to use the words.

543
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,120
Um...

544
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,960
That's your standard, you hypocrite?

545
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,660
How am I a hypocrite? What do you mean?

546
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,960
You're sitting over there implying on broadcast radio...

547
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:30,820
And then you yell it out too.

548
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:37,660
...that those two blessed women who were the elect of God and served the Lord were somehow sexually involved...

549
00:30:37,660 --> 00:30:38,440
And then, of course...

550
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:43,640
...because you twist a single word like L-O-V-E-D without even bothering to look.

551
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,040
All it is is ask you a question.

552
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,320
That's the Hebrew word that is used there.

553
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,920
All it do is ask you a question.

554
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:47,920


555
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,300
All it do is ask you a question. That's it.

556
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:54,560
But you asked me if you had sex with your daughter. Is that a legitimate question?

557
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,480
Calm down.

558
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,440
Of course it's not. Don't play that kind of game with me.

559
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,600
I didn't ask you if you had sex with your daughter. So let's not take it there.

560
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,140
No, you asked a worse question.

561
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,140
So let's not take it there.

562
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,420
You suggested that those two blessed women had sex with each other.

563
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,080
I asked you a question and you asked...

564
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:12,700
You suggested in your question that those two blessed women had sex with each other and never...

565
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,220
This is really not...you know something, Tim?

566
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,420
...and those blessed men had sex with each other.

567
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:18,200
Tim, this is really not going anywhere because you can't give a yes or no for anything.

568
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,580
You have to argue with me. I'm not trying to argue with you.

569
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,460
Well, what am I on the radio program for? To be your lapdog?

570
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,860
You're here to answer my questions so people can get a better understanding...

571
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,840
That's what I'm here for?

572
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,960
So people can understand...

573
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:30,440
Have you lost your mind, you clown?

574
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:31,560
So people can understand better...

575
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:35,640
I'm here to pray. If you don't want to hear my preaching, you know what button to push.

576
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,600
I don't remember Jesus talking to people like this. Let's take the next call.

577
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,560
Well, that's because you don't ever study what Jesus Christ said to people.

578
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,680
That's why you don't read the Bible.

579
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,160
I don't remember it.

580
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,760
Wow, so Jesus was like you, huh?

581
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:47,700
Well, he was probably a lot stronger than I am.

582
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,840
Really? You think so?

583
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,340
Well, no, actually I know so. I'm being euphemistic here.

584
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,700
I thought Jesus actually let people talk. You're live with the infidel guy. Go ahead.

585
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,700
Now, why do you...once again, I'm going to go back to...

586
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,600
Why do you feel that you necessarily have to be so strong and so forward with me

587
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,680
when I'm simply talking to you on a very decent and social, calm level?

588
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:11,200
Why is it you have to take it up a notch and try to pretty much beat somebody down vocally?

589
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,560
What is your name?

590
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,920
My name is Reggie.

591
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:16,020
Reggie? Here's the answer to that, Reggie.

592
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:16,340
Yeah.

593
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,840
You're talking to a warrior.

594
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,400
Stand by, Garth. Turn the volume down, please. Okay, you're a warrior.

595
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,460
That's what I said.

596
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,660
You're a warrior for God.

597
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:25,760
That's what I said.

598
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,700
Well, I didn't know that, so...

599
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,580
Now you do. That's the answer to your question.

600
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,780
Well, chivalry is dead, I guess, when it comes to followers of Christ.

601
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:41,920
That was Tim Phelps throwing a really good grade-A tantrum accompanied by Heat Beak in the background.

602
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:48,240
That's right, Heat Beak. The only black metal band around with a parrot as lead vocalist.

603
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:54,240
But for now, lots and lots of sound collages and wacky music.

604
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:59,980
Strike Tim's fists and cure his heart.

605
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,880
His heart was rotten.

606
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:03,580
His heart?

607
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,720
As rotten as those feet. The doubts.

608
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,700
Why did she want to cure his head?

609
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,860
The puppets that marched their way through the deserts.

610
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,320
Looking not only for the quick stroke from the tablet man.

611
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:13,060
As the Kennedy might say.

612
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:16,260
Why does he want to cure his hat?

613
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,660
The Kennedy? Why did they want to cure Kennedy's hat?

614
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:24,260
Because he was thinking of bad thoughts. Bad thoughts.

615
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:28,020
That's why they gave him a new matching necktie and hat.

616
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:33,160
One that can be worn in any kind of weather, especially in Dallas, Texas.

617
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,860
Reverend, tell us about the area near Dealey Plaza.

618
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,400
It's the greatest album of our time.

619
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:39,840
Actually, I don't know.

620
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:42,140
I best know the sewers underneath Dealey Plaza.

621
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:46,460
That's why they called you the silent rat man or the rat boy.

622
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:49,560
That's where I was that fateful day, November 22nd.

623
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,480
Now, was that a black hop or was that purple?

624
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,940
Oh, it's almost two days away from the day.

625
00:33:55,060 --> 00:33:57,640
Is today the 20th or the 25th?

626
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,120
It's the first.

627
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,780
2-1 is today.

628
00:34:01,800 --> 00:34:04,320
It's the firestorm solstice on Neptune.

629
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,020
Oh, man.

630
00:34:06,060 --> 00:34:07,100
They don't have firestorms on Neptune.

631
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,960
Well, they have ice.

632
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,720
They have ice.

633
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:11,240
They have alcohol storms, though.

634
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:15,180
But if you were to snap your fingers real high, you'd have a firestorm on Neptune.

635
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,120
Run, run, run, run, run.

636
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,880
Maybe they'll do.

637
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:20,300
They'll do.

638
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,120
Yeah.

639
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,060
Yeah, man.

640
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,720
Dealey Plaza Day is coming up.

641
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,780
It's the 23rd, isn't it?

642
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:33,820
It's a holiday for subgeniuses because that was the particular little mini conspiracy that is...

643
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:34,440
What is?

644
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:38,140
...had the most coolest inside joke potential.

645
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,700
What was?

646
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:42,000
It's been the Kennedy assassination, JFK.

647
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:48,580
It's one of the most hilarious events ever programmed into the event psyche of our neighborhood, speaking in a global sense.

648
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:55,980
Did you know that there is an assassination convention in Dallas, Texas every November around this time?

649
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:59,340
I used to go and report on the first two or three.

650
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:08,120
And our friend Reverend Susie the Floozy on WREK in Atlanta was at the time a Kennedy researcher and connected to the...

651
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:13,780
And, you know, being here, there exposed to the around rumor這個太好了

652
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:24,840
which is actually a sort of anjingaba, a cette genre-land anjingaba movement to account for some of the attempts at a little bit more:「

653
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:29,120
The cracks you'd find inWREK are, when gong is doing a text,

654
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:29,360


655
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,120
But it's not going toDBWBail.

656
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,080
with someone's neck?

657
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,140
Or was it with our Lord's neck?

658
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,120
No, it was JFK's neck.

659
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,040
He did.

660
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:44,380
That was a historical fact.

661
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:47,500
During the autopsy at the Naval...

662
00:35:48,020 --> 00:35:48,580
That's what...

663
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,780
The LBJ did, in fact,

664
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:52,520
have sex with the...

665
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,300
Change the road.

666
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,380
The exit or entrance wound,

667
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,840
depending on which conspiracy

668
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:57,860
you believe in.

669
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:58,720
Now, do you think he was thinking

670
00:35:58,720 --> 00:35:59,800
of Marilyn or Lady Bird

671
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:01,720
when he did the deed?

672
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:02,980
Now, wait a minute.

673
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:04,240
The aliens did this?

674
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:04,980
No.

675
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,160
Well, they possessed...

676
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:07,660
Lyndon Baines Johnson.

677
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,120
The Greys did this?

678
00:36:09,220 --> 00:36:11,200
The Greys got into LBJ's brain

679
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,580
after the hit went down.

680
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,200
Yeah, these people,

681
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,120
I don't believe that they're

682
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,460
really brains in their heads anyway.

683
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:17,080
I just think there's

684
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:18,060
a little grey up there.

685
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,020
No, there's...

686
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:19,740
It's not grey matter,

687
00:36:19,820 --> 00:36:20,600
it's a little grey.

688
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:21,320
In the case of...

689
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:23,080
Like a driving piece of fog

690
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,420
getting up in the rain.

691
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,220
Guys, that's silly.

692
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,880
Everybody knows it was

693
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:29,320
green energy demons

694
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,380
at Dealey Plaza.

695
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,220
Oh, Lyndon,

696
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:33,520
you need to change the entrance wound.

697
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:34,180
Hey, I was there!

698
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,000
Oh, you're getting all sexy.

699
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,420
My parents saw Lee

700
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,800
holding a big shot on TV live.

701
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,680
Oh, my God,

702
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:41,960
you're as big as a steel.

703
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,960
And they had been thrown out

704
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:46,140
of Jack Ruby's carousel club.

705
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:47,520
My parents!

706
00:36:47,860 --> 00:36:49,660
I grew up in an alternate universe.

707
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,140
At that time period,

708
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:51,880
I happened to be living

709
00:36:51,880 --> 00:36:53,120
in one of the alternate universes.

710
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,600
And in that universe,

711
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:56,140
John F. Kennedy

712
00:36:56,140 --> 00:36:58,620
turned around at the last second,

713
00:36:58,780 --> 00:36:59,600
whirled around,

714
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,980
shot up,

715
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,180
and killed

716
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:04,160
not only Oswald,

717
00:37:04,940 --> 00:37:05,960
but three guys,

718
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,600
and the grassy Noah was wet.

719
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,060
Now, that's the way

720
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:11,000
it happened somewhere else.

721
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,220
Thank you very much.

722
00:37:12,220 --> 00:37:13,180
I'm glad for that

723
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:14,160
enlightening rippety

724
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,980
of another dimensional accident.

725
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:17,620
And in another one,

726
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,880
James Bond kind of died.

727
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,040
And in another one,

728
00:37:20,620 --> 00:37:21,660
John F. Kennedy

729
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,700
and Lee Harvey Oswald

730
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,180
meet each other in a gay bar

731
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,160
and are caught

732
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,260
by the tabloid photographer's

733
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,820
French kissing in the bathroom.

734
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:31,260
Now, the one I remember

735
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,120
was where, like,

736
00:37:32,120 --> 00:37:33,140
Jackie is going...

737
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,380
They were talking about Maryland,

738
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:35,700
and Jackie is going

739
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,820
down on the press,

740
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,140
and he jerks his head

741
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,360
back and to the left,

742
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,400
and the bullet goes neatly

743
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,620
through Conway Twitty's life.

744
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,480
See, there's a billion

745
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,960
different possibilities

746
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,780
that all happened.

747
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:47,120
That was Louis Pasteur's

748
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,900
magic bullet.

749
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,520
You think...

750
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,620
Louis Pasteur was the

751
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:51,040
governor of Texas then?

752
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:51,600
On Marie Curie, I mean.

753
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,900
And Marie Curie was actually

754
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,300
Jackie's late grandmother.

755
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,320
So you see how these things

756
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,160
keep unfolding.

757
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:01,280
But David Ferry

758
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,260
was the coolest one of all.

759
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,080
David Ferry is actually...

760
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:05,500
Shall we?

761
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:07,460
Sing the praises of David Ferry.

762
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,720
He's the subgenius

763
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,060
of the Kennedy assassination.

764
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,480
Of course I spank those boys.

765
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:18,080
I'm gay, number one.

766
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,420
But it's okay to be gay.

767
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,820
Have sex with men repeatedly.

768
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:25,780
I'm gay.

769
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,680
Bang!

770
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:29,800
But it's okay to be gay.

771
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:30,940
Bag lust.

772
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,420
I love it to death.

773
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:33,360
Sex.

774
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:34,980
Anally copulating

775
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,260
repeatedly.

776
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:37,300
Spread it, spread it.

777
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:38,900
Stroke, stroke, stroke, stroke.

778
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:44,140
Tithy, you know, tithy, you know, tithy, tithy, you know, tithy, you know, tithy.

779
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,020
Anally copulating.

780
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:45,620
Cry out.

781
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:46,640
I love it.

782
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,440
I've done it.

783
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,660
Deeply, deeply, deeply, deeply.

784
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:52,060
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da.

785
00:38:52,060 --> 00:38:53,500
Hosea, hosea, hosea, hosea.

786
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:54,800
I'm fag boy.

787
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,260
I come, come, come.

788
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,060
Hitler said have sex with men.

789
00:38:58,340 --> 00:38:59,960
Hitler said have sex with men.

790
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:01,140
Stroke, head.

791
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,120
Stroke, head.

792
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:02,800
Stroke.

793
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,220
My job is to show it to them.

794
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:04,960
Cry aloud.

795
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,500
Shit!

796
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,780
I can't live, buddy.

797
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:07,960
Castrate yourself.

798
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,740
I have to eat it.

799
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,100
I have to eat it.

800
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,460
I have to eat it.

801
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,880
I have to eat it.

802
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,580
Pushing, pushing, pushing.

803
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,300
Anally copulating the hands on my head.

804
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:20,540
I'm fag boy.

805
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,140
Idiot, idiot, idiot, idiot.

806
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:23,880
God hates silliness.

807
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,620
God hates silliness.

808
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,740
Sex with men, I love it.

809
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,980
And in other news,

810
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,100
is Ashcroft update, friends.

811
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,000
Lying in a near-death state in intensive care,

812
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:42,780
Attorney General John Ashcroft

813
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,820
is getting the very best care money can buy.

814
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:50,120
His attending surgeon, Dr. Phil Farnsworth,

815
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,440
has said that despite introducing

816
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:56,180
massive amounts of marijuana smoke into his lungs,

817
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,840
Ashcroft is still barely hanging on.

818
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:02,620
If only he could get multiple semen injections

819
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:06,480
into his hind fast enough and orally,

820
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,400
he might have a chance.

821
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:10,220
There just aren't enough homosexual men

822
00:40:10,220 --> 00:40:11,740
on the East Coast willing to make

823
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:14,300
that life-saving gesture, it seems,

824
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,180
said Dr. Farnsworth.

825
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:20,480
A Miss Leticia Lackawanna-Jones,

826
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,360
a voodoo high priestess,

827
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,260
has been brought in as a consultant

828
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,480
from New Orleans at her insistence

829
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,020
on several dozen calico cats

830
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,720
maintaining a noisy vigil

831
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:32,000
outside his 10th-story hotel room.

832
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:33,820
Window have been removed.

833
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:39,040
Him soul being sick, she was quoted as saying,

834
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,720
he be needin' some of that

835
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:43,740
high John DeConker root

836
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,160
and some special double mojo gree-gree powder

837
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,600
I makes up.

838
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:54,420
The devil got strong claws in this one for sure.

839
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,580
Well, you can certainly only agree with that.

840
00:40:57,620 --> 00:41:00,980
The devil certainly has his big red claws

841
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:02,600
right in John Ashcroft's...

842
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,160
derriere.

843
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,380
Certainly does.

844
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:06,540
And it doesn't look like he's about to release.

845
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,980
No, not anytime soon.

846
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:12,840
We expect flying monkeys to be bringing him home.

847
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:14,080
Flowing?

848
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,320
Via the usual route,

849
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:18,560
past the Beltway and up through the Georgetown crossover.

850
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,980
Right up the Ashcroft, you say, eh?

851
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,400
Yes, and here he comes.

852
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,000
It looks like the processional's about to start

853
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:30,200
for the former Justice Minister of External Sciences,

854
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,660
Oh, my, my, my, my.

855
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,200
John Z.

856
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:34,360
burnt in the young age.

857
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,040
Almost the science is a mess

858
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:35,040


859
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,880
S.C. answer real quick washun is

860
00:41:39,220 --> 00:41:41,920
as good a Anglo- esque analogy

861
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:42,900
as filmmaking's script anything

862
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:45,080
using the double PLAYTOOL called

863
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:45,080


864
00:41:45,460 --> 00:41:45,620
But cioè difficult sign今天

865
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:51,200
You don't think it's going to be very difficult

866
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,320
He says it's so difficult

867
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:52,560
It says not to reassure parents

868
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:53,720
because I'm trying to please King Samuel No, no way no,

869
00:41:57,740 --> 00:41:58,840
did he?

870
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:02,600
God, yes.

871
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:08,160
Bill is shedding his one solitary tear, according to the Patriotism Act.

872
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:13,200
Apparently, he's only allowed to shed one per four-hour delay.

873
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:17,600
And so then there are horses' ashes on horses' ashes then?

874
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,040
It looks like a full orange recoup.

875
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:23,120
It looks like everybody's going to be there.

876
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,600
And as they approach the diorama now, the horses are getting closer,

877
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:31,060
but the carry-on, I guess that's the dead flesh, is being left behind.

878
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,060
I see.

879
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,040
A couple of footmen coming, getting closer.

880
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,700
No, here's the crowd for the processional.

881
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:38,620
Now I guess they're going to...

882
00:42:39,460 --> 00:42:39,820
Oh, wait.

883
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:48,960
Yes, for if the Virgin Mary would only dress the way Jesus does on those crucifixes, friends,

884
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:55,040
that religion would be three times as popular as the Beatles themselves.

885
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:58,400
We would follow the Beatles everywhere.

886
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,500
Oh, ladies, how divine.

887
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:09,180
Instead of putting a nickel in your pantalones, I will put my chewing gum in your hair.

888
00:43:09,540 --> 00:43:14,420
To sell a religion, friends, you don't need all the answers.

889
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,360
You only need one good answer.

890
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:19,400
And that good answer is Bob, my friend.

891
00:43:19,420 --> 00:43:24,920
Now, you know, as Poop Bobby Bob said, the pink boy's got a Bob complex.

892
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,460
And it's true.

893
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,320
Nothing is fair.

894
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:31,400
And nothing to get hung about.

895
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:37,360
But when you take the path less traveled, you often find that it's less traveled for a reason.

896
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:45,280
It's easy for us weirdos to be jerks because we're trying to do more than normal people.

897
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:49,600
And us preachers have to do more than just lay people.

898
00:43:50,440 --> 00:44:01,260
So praise Bob and help me somebody because the bargain bin ladens have been stinking up the bush.

899
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:01,480
Oh, my God.

900
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:01,860
The code of freedom.

901
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:08,860
Stale P has befouled our constitution.

902
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:12,700
The skull and bones guys get all the good drugs.

903
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:22,480
And it turns out that the John Birchers were right all along about the CFR and the Trilateral Commission.

904
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:29,740
And it turns out the CFR and the Trilateral Commission were all right about the Bilderbergers and the Heinehausers.

905
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,040
The kooks were right.

906
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,420
The right-wingers are the commies.

907
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,220
They were hiding in plain sight, right under our noses.

908
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:40,740
They had us looking for them where they are.

909
00:44:41,940 --> 00:44:43,020
In your face.

910
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,120
That's where the mark of the beast lies, my friend.

911
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,220
Your face.

912
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:50,900
The mark shall be put on your hand and on your forehead.

913
00:44:51,060 --> 00:44:52,700
Well, the one on your hand is your thumbprint.

914
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:54,700
The one on your forehead is your face.

915
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:57,440
Your face is the mark of the beast.

916
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:01,700
It's the final program, my friend.

917
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:03,400
Do you have hope?

918
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:04,340
Do you have faith?

919
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:05,860
If you do, you are a fool.

920
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,680
What you need is Bob.

921
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:11,440
J.R. Bob Dobbs and his teachings are the only thing

922
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:15,180
standing between you and complete brainlessness.

923
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,440
Actually, he's what will lead you to complete brainlessness,

924
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,480
but that's getting too complicated.

925
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:26,120
Friends, you must be saved, even if it kills you.

926
00:45:26,540 --> 00:45:27,420
For insurance.

927
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:29,100
He shall come as a thief in the night,

928
00:45:29,180 --> 00:45:30,680
and he shall be a salesman,

929
00:45:30,680 --> 00:45:33,720
and he shall take your last, last credit card.

930
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:34,920
For he'll...

931
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:39,080
And then you find yourself taking that bath

932
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,560
that is less bubbled.

933
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:43,900
Friends, you know, just as suicide

934
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,220
is the most sincere form of self-loathing,

935
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,740
Bob's new Church of the Subgenius

936
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:52,760
is the most sincere form of send one dollar.

937
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,400
Praise Bob and hail Connie.

938
00:45:56,580 --> 00:45:57,160
Connie.

939
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,960
The beautiful wife of Bob.

940
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:05,860
The feminine essence which balances Bob's ultimate maleness, yes?

941
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,200
Connie.

942
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,060
The seductive side of slack.

943
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:12,420
Bob.

944
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:18,220
The rich, successful, lucky side of slack.

945
00:46:19,720 --> 00:46:22,980
The single one word you need to remember.

946
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:24,800
Connie.

947
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:26,360
Simple, kindly.

948
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:26,580
Kindly.

949
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:27,700
Connie.

950
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:33,280
The connective tissue from the top of your skull to the bottom of your toes.

951
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,040
Connie.

952
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,660
25 cents, any time you peak.

953
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:39,960
Connie.

954
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:47,940
She came from another place, and she went back as soon as she came.

955
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:56,340
Listeners with keen ears and tinfoil hats to match, will have identified yourself as a

956
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:56,960
member of the

957
00:46:56,960 --> 00:47:02,120
last quarter of an hour as being comprised of no less than four segments, and in that order.

958
00:47:02,680 --> 00:47:07,900
To wit, a Noral Prep production, yeah right said Fred.

959
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:14,560
Following on from this, Reverend Ivan Stang reported on John Ashcroft's healing, and then

960
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:22,320
joined farces with Einstein's Secret Orchestra to discuss Jesus, Bob, the Beast, and Connie.

961
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:26,320
Um, now speaking of the Beast, I'm going to say that I'm not a fan of the Beast, but I'm a fan of the Beast.

962
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:26,320


963
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:26,320


964
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:26,320


965
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:31,260
And now, more from Infodog.guy.com and Tim Phelps.

966
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:31,720
Thank you.

967
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:33,400
Interesting.

968
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:39,400
But, you know, Reggie, you're talking to someone who's spent three decades plus researching.

969
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:40,700
Oh.

970
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:41,900
Okay.

971
00:47:42,620 --> 00:47:43,020
Hmm.

972
00:47:43,180 --> 00:47:45,460
That'll be a whole nother, that'll be another conversation all in itself.

973
00:47:45,740 --> 00:47:47,400
Give you 30 years of research, I would love to hear it.

974
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:48,160
And let me tell you this.

975
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,500
If you struggle like you have with me, I don't know how you could have survived Fred Phelps.

976
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:55,260
What do you mean struggle with you?

977
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:56,020
I'm asking you questions.

978
00:47:56,060 --> 00:47:56,320
I'm asking you questions.

979
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:56,500
I'm not...

980
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,620
Well, I know that you've been tripping along all through this, kind of, you know, like losing composure and all.

981
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,380
If you would have had my dad on the phone, you would, apparently would have been wetting yourself, because I'm a lightweight compared to him.

982
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,540
Um, you know, I don't know what you mean by that.

983
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,780
I've been pretty much consistent the entire time, and all I've done is...

984
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:13,500
Did I hit a nerve, Reggie?

985
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:14,380
...ask you questions.

986
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:15,460
Did I hit a nerve?

987
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:16,720
No, because I'm not gay.

988
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:19,360
Well, I don't, I'm not thinking you are.

989
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:23,500
And, and I know that, and I feel, and I'm very confident that, and the people who are...

990
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,680
You're, you're in the category of lost wife.

991
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,420
You kind of think there's really nothing wrong with them.

992
00:48:29,620 --> 00:48:30,860
That's what lost wife thought.

993
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:32,820
That's why she looked back when they were being destroyed.

994
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:34,360
See, I don't get upset.

995
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,160
That's why she went immediately to her death in hell.

996
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:36,340
Yeah.

997
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:37,200
Well, I don't...

998
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:41,400
That's why Jesus Christ says those three words when he's warning people about the second coming.

999
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:42,180
Oh, okay.

1000
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:43,200
Remember lost wife, he said.

1001
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:43,520
Right.

1002
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,220
Well, Tim, let's let you know, I'm not upset.

1003
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:47,020
I don't get upset over someone's fantasy.

1004
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:47,620
Okay.

1005
00:48:47,620 --> 00:48:47,840
All right?

1006
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:49,840
So, you know, that's your belief system.

1007
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,860
He thinks I'll just protest too much, Reggie.

1008
00:48:52,040 --> 00:48:54,080
Uh, it's your fantasy, and, you know, um...

1009
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,120
Well, I, look, Reggie...

1010
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:55,660
Anything makes you happy.

1011
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:56,060
Of course.

1012
00:48:56,220 --> 00:48:57,340
If it makes you happy, you sound...

1013
00:48:57,340 --> 00:48:58,420
You don't really sound like a happy person, but, you know...

1014
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,480
You're the one skinning this bobcat.

1015
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,380
I'm just holding the tail.

1016
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:00,980
You know what I'm saying?

1017
00:49:01,080 --> 00:49:01,220
Yeah.

1018
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:01,300
Yeah.

1019
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:03,520
But you don't really sound too happy to me, but, you know, I hope you are.

1020
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:04,040
You know?

1021
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,420
And, oh, now you sound happy.

1022
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:06,940
Wow.

1023
00:49:07,140 --> 00:49:07,420
Thanks.

1024
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:07,820
It's changed.

1025
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,400
Yeah.

1026
00:49:08,420 --> 00:49:10,460
I got a beautiful wife and eight kids.

1027
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:11,120
Eight kids.

1028
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:11,700
Good job.

1029
00:49:11,960 --> 00:49:12,240
Wow.

1030
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,740
What's not to be happy about, because I'm serving the Lord.

1031
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:15,780
Okay.

1032
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:16,520
All right, then.

1033
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:17,860
Well, thank you very much, Tim, for appearing.

1034
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:18,460
I appreciate it.

1035
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:20,320
And, um, you know, we'll...

1036
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,680
I'll be keeping...

1037
00:49:21,680 --> 00:49:21,760
I'll be keeping an eye on you.

1038
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:22,340
Thank you very much.

1039
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,380
And don't forget to tell people to look at GodHatesFags and GodHatesAmerica.com.

1040
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,160
There's good stuff there.

1041
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:27,680
All right.

1042
00:49:27,820 --> 00:49:28,260
Thank you.

1043
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:28,640
Thank you.

1044
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:29,120
Good night.

1045
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:35,240
And now, tonight's special episode of your radio's outstanding theater of thrills,

1046
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:36,440
Suspense.

1047
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:43,240
Tonight, Suspense brings you a repeat performance of one of the most controversial plays ever

1048
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,160
presented over your radio.

1049
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,800
It is called the Wedgie of Faith.

1050
00:49:52,240 --> 00:49:55,140
It is called the Wedgie of Faith.

1051
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:58,600
Although I'm sure I will receive a severe wedgie from my pasti-mates,

1052
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,260
I must remind you, we should have been at school ten minutes ago.

1053
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:04,740
Did you watch this one?

1054
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:07,000
It could have been so much fun.

1055
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:08,640
See you next time.

1056
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:10,940

1059
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:21,860
Bye.

1060
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,020
Norrell Preff.

1061
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,160
Well, we're coming to the end of the show.

1062
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:31,600
I want to leave a couple of minutes free for Stang to explain what's going to happen

1063
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:35,100
and then, at the end of it, to explain what did happen

1064
00:50:35,900 --> 00:50:38,600
so that people who listen to the show and are wondering

1065
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:41,280
who is this horrible-sounding guy

1066
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:43,520
will know what happened.

1067
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,380
And I don't mean me. I mean...

1068
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,360
Well, I do mean me as the horrible-sounding guy.

1069
00:50:50,360 --> 00:50:52,320
But I'm the Reverend Carport Fox,

1070
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:56,260
the leader of the New Zealand Outreach,

1071
00:50:56,460 --> 00:51:00,840
which has exactly one member in the clench,

1072
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:01,600
but that doesn't matter.

1073
00:51:02,620 --> 00:51:06,380
You've been listening, in part, to a show inspired by

1074
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:11,520
InfidelGuy.com interviewing one of the Phelps clan.

1075
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,500
I've taken extracts from the show.

1076
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,260
I've waded through the show,

1077
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,340
listened to that horrible man

1078
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:20,340
spout his horrors,

1079
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:21,120
and I've been told that he's a horrible pink

1080
00:51:21,120 --> 00:51:28,320

doctrine of

1082
00:51:29,980 --> 00:51:34,740
we hate facts because our interpretation of our sacred word says so.

1083
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:37,580
But don't get me started. We just don't have time.

1084
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:42,180
As I state, we're coming to a close.

1085
00:51:42,420 --> 00:51:47,020
So, Self Slayer is going to give you important subgenius contact information

1086
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:50,340
when you've exhausted all that InfidelGuy.com information.

1087
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:51,200
If you're interested in getting more information,

1088
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,120
then we're going to have the Sperm Bank 5 taking us out,

1089
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:59,380
and InfidelGuy.com will have the last word.

1090
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,900

Plants of soft tides

1124
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,440
What were the chances

1125
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,240
We would fall in love

1126
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:26,680
Before the night was through

1127
00:54:34,220 --> 00:54:35,740
Sausage unified

1128
00:54:35,740 --> 00:54:38,460
In bright entrances

1129
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,340
Sea of greenish lights

1130
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:42,540
Ice that dances

1131
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,660
The rim of steady light

1132
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,020
Look before my eyes

1133
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:53,260
When I see you in the burger bar

1134
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,040
You look great

1135
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,180
And you're just by the bright red light

1136
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:57,440
Your frugal face

1137
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,240
Rinses the bright sizzle

1138
00:54:59,240 --> 00:55:01,180
To the sound of crying fish

1139
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,700
Horses were clopping

1140
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,120
And cars were screaming fast

1141
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,340
At the maddening rate

1142
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:07,720
People were tripping over rubber spades

1143
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:09,720
All puzzling towards the counter

1144
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:12,540
Oh God, I love the way you order your food

1145
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:15,440
I can only hope that it will take a little longer

1146
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:16,500
For your order to be cooked

1147
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,500
Oh, Monica, I can't

1148
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,420
Baby, you're a mushroom

1149
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,260
Take a chance, I'm sorry

1150
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:25,040
Oh, my darling, surely you must notice me

1151
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,740
I'm here for you every week

1152
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,080
Look at that

1153
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,440
She dropped the chip

1154
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,980
I quietly slipped it into my pocket

1155
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:33,480
I love that chip

1156
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,060
Oh, people forever

1157
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,900

1164
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:58,700
It's all for G-Hard

1165
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:02,840
Not a chance to see a green light

1166
00:56:02,840 --> 00:56:05,320
Why's the dancers

These two guys are lunatics

1170
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,880
Ha ha ha ha

1171
00:56:20,380 --> 00:56:21,380
Is the phone ringing again?

1172
00:56:22,020 --> 00:56:23,120
Hey, we got another call here.

1173
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,960
Okay, let me take this last one.

1174
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:25,860
I keep saying we take the last call

1175
00:56:25,860 --> 00:56:26,520
and another one comes in.

1176
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:29,120
Alright, no more calls, ladies and gentlemen.

1177
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,320

1178
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,580

00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:02,220
through the many offices and he's you know entreating the ghosts of previous presidents

based on democracy oh thank you mr president and he sees old abe coming down the hallway
