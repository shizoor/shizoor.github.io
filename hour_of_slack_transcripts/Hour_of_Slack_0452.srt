1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:08,480
you are about to participate in a great adventure you are about to experience the awe and mystery

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,940
which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:24,240
all right all right well we're good we're not going to waste any time dear friends tonight

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:34,020
we're going to get right into it that's got to be the quickest title comeuppance ever on a hour of slack show

5
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:41,940
but it's because we have a lot of ground to cover tonight we're going to present to you an entire play

6
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:51,100
from brain rot radio theater in cleveland originally broadcast on wcsb cleveland

7
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,520
this amazing

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,100
uh

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:01,680
well why not just call it what it is it's a parody i suppose you might say called a clockwork

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:12,680
orangutan uh starring lonesome cowboy dave psycho pathfinder and scabby days those uh three

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,820
that that that anything for a laugh duo

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,960
and uh yeah we don't we don't normally just give a whole show

13
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,220
to a show that's not a show that's not a show that's not a show that's not a show that's not a show

14
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:30,960
to one tape but that's mostly what we are doing tonight partly because we're not really here right

15
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:41,540
now we don't have time to monkey with yet uh uh a uh a fourth show all done in one day yeah we're

16
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:52,740
having to do the hour of slack now like a game show where you do uh uh all weeks episodes in only

17
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:53,380
uh

18
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,200
uh

19
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,200


20
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:54,520
One day.

21
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,540
Saves time and money.

22
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,760
Well, those things are.

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,520
They're as real as Bob.

24
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:03,380
As real as Bob.

25
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:12,760
So anyway, let's get right on down into this alternate universe created by Brain Rot Radio Theater.

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:20,820
I think that pretty much all subgenius listeners will get it sentence by sentence.

27
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:31,900
Although there may be some just so young or so queasy that they never saw the original Stanley Kubrick movie that this is a...

28
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,560
Well, yeah, I'll admit it's a takeoff.

29
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,720
You know, on the hour of slack, we don't normally do comedy.

30
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,520
I mean, this is a religious radio broadcast.

31
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:46,540
But, well, in this case, we have to make an exception.

32
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,000
And here it is.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:03:00,260
Good evening, and welcome to Brain Rot Radio Theater and the adventures of Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Psychopath Finder, and Scabby Dave's.

34
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,480
Imagine, if you will, a world in the not-too-distant future.

35
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,500
A world infested with wilding youth gangs and rampant social decay.

36
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,340
Imagine a world of harsh drugs that send young minds into fits of ultra-voyance.

37
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:20,760
A world where subliminal cold warfare has created an underworld language of Anglo-Russian gibberish.

38
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:22,080
Good evening.

39
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,320
And welcome to...

40
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:30,260
A Clockwork Orangutan.

41
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,480
A Clockwork Orangutan.

42
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:41,440
A Clockwork Orangutan.

43
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:50,280
A Clockwork Oracle Oracle Atari bankingtime

44
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,800
Starring...

45
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:50,800


46
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:07,240
There was me, that is to say,

47
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,920
Lodestone Cow Pie Dave,

48
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,780
and my three droogs,

49
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,820
that is to say, Psychopath Finder Boy Georgie,

50
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,500
and Scabby Tim Days, who is Days,

51
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,240
and the Invisible Spotty.

52
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:21,540
And we all sat down in the Corova Milk Bar

53
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,640
one Saturday, Notchie,

54
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:25,440
wondering what to do with our Krabby Raw soups.

55
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,200
The bar served Milk Plus,

56
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,340
that is, Milk Plus, Synthamask, and Veleslog,

57
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,720
the two vital ingridies,

58
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:37,020
and before any night of any soggy Notchie of ultraviolence,

59
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,380
they stuffed a Pete Knives in,

60
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,160
Pete Knives in your soggy violence.

61
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,300
Okay, okay.

62
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,540
This is the announcer for...

63
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,100
They get the picture.

64
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,220
You guys are...

65
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,720
You're in a futuristic-looking youth gang,

66
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:50,780
and you talk funny,

67
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,900
and you drink synthetic drugs which make you violent.

68
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,320
Yeah, yeah, but you forgot to lay in more establishing stuff

69
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,760
like our cool outfits and all.

70
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,460
Yeah, but me pay 65 bucks

71
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,380
for this unseen bit of hot fashion.

72
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,060
Okay, okay, you guys are in the Milk Bar,

73
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,600
where statues of naked women

74
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,960
dispense drugs from their breasts,

75
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,280
and you guys are all wearing white coveralls

76
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,820
and big, kicking Dr. Martin's boots and bowler hats,

77
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,260
except Spotty, who's wearing a beret.

78
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:16,520
Hey!
