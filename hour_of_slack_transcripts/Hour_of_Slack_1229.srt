1
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,740
Meanwhile, gaseous rhetoric and stupid, bombastic, empty speechifying.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,180
The subgenius power of Slack.

3
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,400
They need Jesus.

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:21,180
Thank you, Lee Murr, and this is Hour of Slack number 1229,

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:28,600
which is a rerun of number 344 from 1992, 17 years ago.

6
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:32,560
Because we're really busy on other subgenius projects.

7
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,400
This one is a mix of recordings from various subgenius shows at various stations,

8
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:44,060
including Cleveland's WCSB from long before we moved to Cleveland.

9
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,720
You'll hear people who've long since been unpersoned

10
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:51,280
and much younger voices of people you now think of as old.

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:57,440
Hopefully, you'll also be inspired to donate to the WCSB pledge drive coming up next week.

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:58,340
A week at all.

13
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,060
Use a donation, actually.

14
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:06,280
Did I mention that there's a subgenius revival with the amino acids in Detroit this November 28th?

15
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:09,740
And weekly revivals in Chicago all through December?

16
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:10,820
No?

17
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:16,100
Well, see subgenius.com events for details.

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,220
And with that, we hop into the Wayback Machine and vanish backwards!

19
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,140
Backwards!

20
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,720
And for our own part, we see very clearly that unless justice be done to others,

21
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:35,760
it will not be done to us.

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,400
The program for the world's peace, as we see it, is this.

23
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:49,560
The Church of the Subgenius in the name of J.R. Bob Dole.

24
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,220
Yes.

25
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,980
Ah, yes, dear friends.

26
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:58,580
So good, so good to be back.

27
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:58,860
Back.

28
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,480
Back.

29
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,160
On the airwaves with tonight's hour of Slack show,

30
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:07,920
which, by the way, will be a collision of subgenius shows.

31
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:14,980
It's been a while since we've let all the shows that are the original shows done out there in subgenius land

32
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:22,960
just collide in the time warp of the church, the bosom of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

33
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,740
We have a special guest here tonight, the Tevinator,

34
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,460
who, uh...

35
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:29,180
Tevinator?

36
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:32,180
Are you, uh, prepared with your statement?

37
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:33,960
You may proceed.

38
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:36,860
We are the future, the children of a new era.

39
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,680
We have been born from the mistakes of the past

40
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,160
and are expected to pick up the pieces of the future.

41
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:44,980
We are shackled by a dysfunctional system

42
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,360
that is unable to keep pace with our hyper-accelerated culture.

43
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,800
We have been told what to think by fundamentalist demons

44
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,000
masquerading as leaders and saints.

45
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,240
We are expected to ignore the damages

46
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,580
inflicted by a dismal...

47
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:02,160
We are forced to watch our rights being whittled to death.

48
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,500
Our time is now!

49
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,660
We must use all the tools in our power.

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,700
We must utilize our brains as primary weapons.

51
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,280
We must harness the power of chaos.

52
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,760
We must forcibly occupy cyberspace.

53
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,200
We must assimilate.

54
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,000
We must subvert.

55
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:20,400
We must pave a new leadership for a new millennium.

56
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,020
We must regain control of our destiny.

57
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,240
Our lives are meaningless.

58
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,380
Pray.

59
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:28,580
Pray.

60
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:28,580


61
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:28,580


62
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:28,580


63
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,740
Please, follow me.

64
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,600
Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay.

65
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,340
And now, dear friends,

66
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,280
the show you've been waiting for,

67
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:41,880
the subgenius radio ministry hour of...

68
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,600
Slacker, yes.

69
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,640
It's worthless because it's merely the work

70
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,100
of a few unbridled individualists.

71
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,560
Artistic value is achieved collectively

72
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,920
by each man subordinating himself

73
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,300
to the standards of the majority.

74
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,380
I read that in your column yesterday.

75
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,180
You did? Thank you.

76
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,160
Now, the greatness of Peter Keating's personality

77
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,340
lies in the fact that there is no personality

78
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,420
stamped upon his building.

79
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:08,900
Quite true.

80
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,000
Thus he represents not himself,

81
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,720
but the multitude of all men together.

82
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,060
And produces great big marble bromides.

83
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,300
I believe I'm failing to sell you, Peter Keating.

84
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:20,200
Why, no.

85
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,600
You're succeeding.

86
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,900
Your Keating is worthless.

87
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,220
So he's probably the right choice for that building.

88
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,600
He's sure to be popular.

89
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,120
You wouldn't expect me to pick a man of merit, would you?

90
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,920
We are told we are weak,

91
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,580
incapable of grasping scale,

92
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:43,460
afraid of ourselves,

93
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:46,120
and desperate to push responsibility

94
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,540
for all events in our lives onto them.

95
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,960
We are insistently trained to accept

96
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:58,160
our corporal existence.

97
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:00,300
As hopeless in itself.

98
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,660
To become subservient to the greater good.

99
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:10,840
We are perpetually conditioned,

100
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,680
encouraged, and blackmailed

101
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,860
into self-restriction,

102
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:20,140
into narrower and narrower perceptions of ourselves,

103
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,440
our own importance,

104
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,240
our own potential, and our own experience.

105
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,860
We are trained to ignore the evidence

106
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:32,560
of our senses and experiences,

107
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,740
and to feel guilt when we glimpse

108
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,860
the subgenius.

109
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,620
Our

110
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,520
world.

111
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,340
What?

112
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:54,060
All personnel, please leave the area.

113
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,400
We are starting the final countdown.

114
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,460
TSC, this is Florida Control.

115
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,420
All power for the shields checking out at 100 percent.

116
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:02,900
All systems are go.

117
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,360
Please run final checks on all shield power elements.

118
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,520
All personnel, please leave the area.

119
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,920
We are starting the final countdown.

120
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:12,440
Hello? Hello?

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,080
We're recording. Everything's going fine.

122
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:15,300
...

123
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:19,620
... back through that back door on this platform.

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,380
Don't you think it's time we let them have a glimpse of what it's like?

125
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,300
Don't you think it's time that you sat down and, uh,

126
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:29,440
came face to face with your destiny?

127
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:32,960
... glimpses of the auditorium and the sanctuary.

128
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:34,100
...

129
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:41,300
Uh, isn't it about time you came face to face with...

130
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:41,960


131
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:43,080
...

132
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,800
...

133
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,640
...

134
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:51,060
... it's easy enough to do?

135
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,240
...

136
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,340
... Jesus...

137
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,360
... you ever...

138
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,540
... see?

139
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:05,600
... face to face with my destiny.

140
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:11,540
Now, this famous curtain rod depository was on the site of Adelie Plaza.

141
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:22,340
Yes, right here at Let's Make Adelie Plaza, we're going to begin the quiz show of all quiz shows,

142
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:22,740
the...

143
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,160
... Let That President...

144
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,640
... 1963 election giveaway.

145
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,320
...

146
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:34,560
And our first gag guest is Jiro, the monkey that's been trained to act like George Bush.

147
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:35,620
Let's give him a big hand.

148
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:36,780
...

149
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:37,360
...

150
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,460
...

151
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:46,300
Jiro can walk on stilts, dance jigs on his hands, and somersault through hoops like any ordinary circus monk.

152
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:51,000
But he can also mimic the president's actions and emotions with uncanny accuracy.

153
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,660
...

154
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:52,460
...

155
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:53,660
...

156
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:53,900
...

157
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,620
...

158
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,220
...

159
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:57,960
...

160
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,580
...

161
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:00,860
...

162
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:07,880
He is an actor, not just an animal doing tricks said Taro Murasaki, 30 move on of Jiro's trainer.

163
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,900
That is the art of Suroma Washi.

164
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:16,100
In the Stomach Medicine ad, Jiro parodies the pain of overindulgence in booze

165
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,840
in the very human ritual of vowing never ever again.

166
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,260
...

167
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,380
...

168
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,100
Jiro's most recent skit is equally sharp-egged.

169
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,400
Bush-san coked Morisaki.

170
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:29,620
Bush-san, the monkey, gags, pretends to vomit,

171
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:35,300
then closes his eyes and swoons in the manner of flu-stricken President George Herbert Walker Bush

172
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:39,180
during the state dinner with Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa last month.

173
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:45,200
Poor taste, sure, but it elicits guffaws from both Japanese and listeners of KPFA.

174
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,180
At the time of the shooting,

175
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:52,960
there seemed to be some commotion.

176
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:01,820
I just am unable to describe a flash of light or smoke or something,

177
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:07,880
which caused me to feel that something out of the ordinary had occurred there on the embankment.

178
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:17,120
The Church of the Subgeniuses in the name of J.R. Baldos.

179
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,300
And the

180
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:31,840
Enough.

181
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,580
My victim.

182
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:41,660
Tribune.

183
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,320
Who in the world...

184
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,680
regrette the loaf...

185
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,040
...I am?

186
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,800
How long have you been here?

187
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:01,000
Peace, peace in the Middle East

188
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,060
Everlasting, loving peace

189
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,380
Joy, joy in the Middle East

190
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:07,480
Everlasting, loving peace

191
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,180
Peace, peace

192
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,900
Everlasting, loving peace

193
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:13,600
Peace, peace

194
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,040
Whoever said the subgeniuses were not politically correct?

195
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,160
Can't go wrong

196
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,180
Urgent peace

197
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:24,420
Peace, everlasting peace

198
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:28,740
Peace, everlasting peace

199
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,880
Peace, peace

200
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,020
Everlasting peace

201
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:02,540
Peace, peace

202
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,020
And please don't get me wrong

203
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,300
I'm not accusing

204
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:08,320
What I'm trying to say is

205
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,280
If you have to lose your self-respect

206
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,520
In order to be popular

207
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:15,500
Is it worth it?

208
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,980
Go! Go!

209
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:23,920
You know, we tried every kind of treatment, and it just failed.

210
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:27,720
She wanted to be cremated. Would that make a difference?

211
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:31,520
No, that makes no difference. If she wants to be cremated, that's what you do.

212
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,540
So, in other words...

213
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,640
And that's more reasonable.

214
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,640
If I wanted to bring the lighter fluid and the matches...

215
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:44,600
No, you can't do a lighter fluid and match. You have to have her cremated at the crematory.

216
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,260
Well, she wanted me to do it.

217
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,920
No, you can't cremate her.

218
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:52,160
So, it has to be done at a crematory.

219
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,580
Would that cost extra?

220
00:11:53,920 --> 00:12:00,320
No, no. The cremation is less reasonable. It's less than the burial, of course.

221
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,240
Okay, well, that sounds very good.

222
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:09,360
And one more thing. She wanted me to cut a piece of her off.

223
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,060
Cut a piece of her off?

224
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:14,320
Just to save to remember her. Her ring finger.

225
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,160
You can't cut a piece of her off.

226
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,500
You can't do that either.

227
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:25,520
Because she said that I should. I didn't want to do it.

228
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,760
No, you can't cut a piece of her off unless you take a piece of her hair.

229
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,020
But not her finger.

230
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:31,640
Huh?

231
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,520
Her finger. I couldn't...

232
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,360
Oh, no. You couldn't keep her finger. No way.

233
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,420
No.

234
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,600
I couldn't eat her flesh.

235
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:41,800
Huh?

236
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:43,700
I couldn't eat her flesh.

237
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:45,300
No, you can't.

238
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:48,580
She wanted me to eat her flesh.

239
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:51,580
You can't do that. I'm sorry.

240
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,100
I'm not a cannibal, ordinarily.

241
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:58,000
Well, I don't know.

242
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,020
What time can you come down to see me tomorrow?

243
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,260
Now, I have a funeral here at one o'clock.

244
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:04,100
So, can you come down in the morning?

245
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,580
Well, who...

246
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:07,960
I guess I can.

247
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:11,760
I'd like to see you at ten o'clock tomorrow morning here at the funeral home.

248
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,900
Okay. And one more question.

249
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,240
The man who's... Is it a man or a woman?

250
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,200
It's a woman or a woman at the funeral. Could I eat their flesh?

251
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:20,840
You want to eat their flesh?

252
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,060
You want to eat their flesh?

253
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:23,680
I'm a ghoul.

254
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,600
I'm a real cool ghoul.

255
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:39,420
I don't know about you, but before the election, I'm gonna have to get well-earned at least...

256
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,880
Make sure that you...

257
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:45,340
Ow! Hey!

258
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:46,600
to demonstrate.

259
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:47,640
I enter the air

260
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
and screech as the words

261
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,280
again and again.

262
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:49,880
Screech!

263
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,460
It's commercial.

264
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:52,700
It makes me more and more desperate.

265
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,780
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

266
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,560
These dedicated television viewers.

267
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,260
Oh, my, I just don't know.

268
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,520
It's been difficult

269
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:00,740
to take the president seriously

270
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,460
every time.

271
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,160
I never knew you.

272
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:07,500
Oh, you stupid idiot!

273
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,480
This stuff costs money!

274
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,500
I'm sorry.

275
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,720
I spoke a little out of turn,

276
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,620
but boy, what a skullbuster

277
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:17,560
of a headache I've got.

278
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:19,080
Doing this show this early

279
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,320
in the morning is no picnic,

280
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:20,920
I tell you.

281
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:22,360
It's at a time like this

282
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,480
that I want to kick back

283
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:26,540
and relax with a silly chocolate bar.

284
00:14:27,580 --> 00:14:29,300
Yeah, they say this isn't

285
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:29,780
a funny show,

286
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:30,700
it's just a silly show,

287
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:31,600
and it's at that time

288
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,200
I want a silly chocolate bar.

289
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,820
The powerhouse bar

290
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:35,780
that knocks you silly.

291
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,740
Covered with creamy milk chocolate,

292
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:40,620
it's zesty, tangy, tasty, yeasty,

293
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,060
with caramel nougat,

294
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,960
crunchy walnuts,

295
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,100
and a rich butter taste.

296
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,440
It contains sugar,

297
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,240
cocoa butter,

298
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,000
milk, chocolate,

299
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,920
and lecithin added as an emulsifier.

300
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,280
Salt, artificially

301
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:52,540
flavored with cough syrup,

302
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:53,160
vanillin,

303
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,260
a vanilla substitute,

304
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,720
and 27 milligrams

305
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,980
of millivanillin,

306
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:57,740
an artificial,

307
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,140
phony sugar substitute,

308
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,240
butter, almonds,

309
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:00,820
with salt,

310
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,740
artificial flavor,

311
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:02,300
more sugar,

312
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,080
more lecithin,

313
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,260
more everything

314
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:06,380
in a silly chocolate bar.

315
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:09,600
Enjoy a silly chocolate bar,

316
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,420
and you can be cool,

317
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,260
like me.

318
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,540
I'm a real cool ghoul.

319
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,900
Oh, they say.

320
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,160
Ooh, they say.

321
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:25,500
We have spoken now,

322
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,540
surely in terms too concrete

323
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,560
to admit of any further doubt or question.

324
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,300
An evident principle runs through

325
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:33,680
the whole program I have outlined.

326
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,480
I'm a real cool ghoul.

327
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,480
Very in that area,

328
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,220
so it would behoove you

329
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,520
to use a funeral home

330
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,200
in that particular locale.

331
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,100
Hmm.

332
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,600
Well,

333
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,960
what if we, like,

334
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,860
had them cremated?

335
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,560
Uh, you still would probably use

336
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:55,580
a funeral home in your own locale

337
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,040
rather than come way down here into Neptune.

338
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,440
What hospital is the body in?

339
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,560
Paul Kimball.

340
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,060
Oh, it's in Paul Kimball.

341
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:05,380
Hmm.

342
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:05,980
Uh-huh.

343
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:10,600
Well, it would do you better to go to one of them local funeral homes

344
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,420
rather than to try to come down here.

345
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,420
Um, well, what if we decided to, like,

346
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:20,100
chop him up and eat him?

347
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,360
Eat his flesh?

348
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,780
That would be fine.

349
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,440
Y'all go ahead and get him and chop him up and eat him.

350
00:16:25,580 --> 00:16:27,180
Because that would do you good.

351
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:29,480
We're a real cool ghoul.

352
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,520
Yeah, that would do you just right to chop him up and eat him.

353
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:35,740
Why don't you get some lye and put him in a pot of lye,

354
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,260
and then it'll all dissolve in the lye.

355
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,440
Wow, thanks, man.

356
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,660
That's a good idea, isn't it?

357
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,220
Woo-hoo!

358
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,000
All right, whore.

359
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:43,680
Woo-hoo!

360
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:44,640
What?

361
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,960
I said do your thing, whore.

362
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:49,220
Is this any way for a funeral director to be talking?

363
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,280
Hey, yo, you there?

364
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,740
You know, she's like, I'm responsible.

365
00:16:59,060 --> 00:16:59,760
I'll just go here.

366
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,580
And why would you wait till 1225 at night to call a funeral director?

367
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:04,880
Because I get—

368
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,280
You should be calling one tomorrow morning early.

369
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,380
Because—

370
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,460
And it's one of your choice.

371
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,260
Well, let me tell you, I've got an inheritance coming.

372
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,680
I've got money, all right?

373
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,820
You know, it's just—I don't have to explain every yard.

374
00:17:17,860 --> 00:17:20,140
No, you really don't have to explain none of it to me,

375
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,840
because I'm not going to have the body.

376
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,500
Well, you won't do it?

377
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,340
I'm not going to have it.

378
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,300
This is the third prank call I've had tonight about dead people,

379
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,260
and I'm not going to have anybody that's dead,

380
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,140
so I don't need to listen to your—

381
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,300
But you're a funeral home.

382
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:37,220
No, what are you saying?

383
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,080
What, are you insane?

384
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,340
Yes, I'm very much insane.

385
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,800
Do you know Jerry Lewis?

386
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,360
I'm Jerry Lewis.

387
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,420
You know what?

388
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:46,300
Yeah, Jerry Lewis?

389
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,580
I'm Jerry Lewis.

390
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,000
Oh, that's cute.

391
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,780
That's—no, I really am.

392
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:51,860
Listen to me.

393
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:56,180
You know, I love to talk to an idiot once in a while.

394
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:56,860
You know what?

395
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:57,540
It makes me laugh.

396
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,460
Now, am I in communication with some sort of—

397
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,040
Is this supposed to be your collar here?

398
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,380
Is this supposed to be your little collar?

399
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,480
Is this what you call a little collar?

400
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:12,640
Hey, let's lose the background.

401
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,340
Yeah, thanks.

402
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:18,020
Now, caller, I want you to tell me your most embarrassing moment.

403
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,440
My most embarrassing moment?

404
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:21,580
That's right.

405
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,400
Well, go ahead.

406
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,140
We're all ears.

407
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:31,700
Well, I creeped myself into the church and nailed myself to their cross

408
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:37,700
and was standing there above the altar when all of a sudden my loincloth came down.

409
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:42,680
They all thought I was Jesus Christ until they saw that I was—

410
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,020
I'm like a subgenius.

411
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,840
It is the time to go public with the war on Satan.

412
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:53,740
We must go public because when the government made ease to wipe out drug users and homosexuals, it was not enough.

413
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,220
Yes, we need more.

414
00:18:55,340 --> 00:19:02,020
They have developed terms that will mark people who take drugs and listen to loud music.

415
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,680
It discards the skin of people who listen to certain vibrations of music.

416
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,160
It discards drug users also.

417
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,120
They have terms to kill all major sinners who kill the Christians.

418
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:12,060
Satan kills.

419
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:13,420
God will kill him.

420
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:14,320
How many bodies die?

421
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,840
Children of God dying.

422
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,980
We will say a prayer.

423
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:22,560
God help us cast out the infidels.

424
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:26,760
We welcome Satan's plundering, pillaging, and killing.

425
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:30,540
For Satan kills only the depraved and wretched.

426
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:35,040
God, let the gargoyles loose from the gates of hell.

427
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:39,500
You said that you're a weapon against wretchedness.

428
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,440
Let them cast out their feces.

429
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:49,580
Let them cast out the faces of earth into the quagmire of human filth and wickedness.

430
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:55,040
God will stamp his heel into the sinner's face.

431
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,940
Then Satan will judge and beat them down again.

432
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,860
Then they will be cast into hell.

433
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,120
Their insides will come out from within.

434
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,180
And all sinners who don't die will be old and decrepit.

435
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,620
Who died? Christ? Why? Your sins?

436
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,200
God only son died.

437
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:10,300
He died for you.

438
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,560
Okay, ma'am. He's going to talk to you.

439
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:12,660
Okay, ma'am. He's going to talk to you.

440
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,220
Okay? Okay.

441
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,260
He'd rather do it himself.

442
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:14,820
Okay.

443
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,340
Hey.

444
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,020
Yeah?

445
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:18,060
Now, listen here.

446
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,300
It was a dreadful day when everything happened.

447
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,980
Be quiet.

448
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:27,700
I don't know how long ago. Don't ask him. He's drunk.

449
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:27,880
Well, listen, guys.

450
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:32,580
I'd like to say, and we know that you have drank too much,

451
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,760
but do you have a mother and a father?

452
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:38,500
Hell no. I'm 21. He's 18.

453
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,400
And you don't have a mother?

454
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:40,940
No.

455
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,760
So she's dead.

456
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:43,380
Is she dead?

457
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:43,640
She's dead.

458
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:43,980
Is your dad dead?

459
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,580
My daddy got ran over by a car.

460
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,240
Oh? How long ago?

461
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:48,700
Two years ago.

462
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:49,640
Oh? The clock's not working.

463
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,840
Really? Wil, do you work?

464
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,420
Do I work?

465
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:53,940
Yes, ma'am.

466
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,360
Do you work at Philip's?

467
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:56,860
Do I work?

468
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:57,120
Hers does?

469
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,120


470
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:57,400
She works at Philip's.

471
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:57,640
Okay, so here it is.

472
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:58,280
Does your brother work?

473
00:20:58,520 --> 00:20:58,780
Yes.

474
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:07,400
Well, it looks like you guys don't have enough to do.

475
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,920
I don't understand, mom.

476
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:10,920


477
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:10,920


478
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:10,920


479
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:10,920


480
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:10,920


481
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:18,980
Well, to be getting on the phone this time of night and be drunk and talking out of your mind, it sort of sounds ridiculous now, doesn't it, really?

482
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,380
Well, I mean, I'm sorry, ma'am.

483
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,940
No, I don't have a daughter named Glenda. I have to.

484
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:26,400
Well, you know, I tried to tell you, Mary, because I'm sorry.

485
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,520
Well, I know.

486
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:30,780
And I don't know how in the hell this all came about. I really don't.

487
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:34,500
Well, I don't either, but you know what? I don't think it's an accident you called me.

488
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,500
Now, your name is Johnson.

489
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:37,240
Yes.

490
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:38,560
And what's your first name, did you say?

491
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:39,120
David.

492
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:39,700
David.

493
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,360
David Johnson.

494
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:46,640
Well, anyway, what I was going to tell you, David, it isn't an accident that you called me.

495
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:47,300
Is it not?

496
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:48,500
Let me tell you why.

497
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:55,280
Because I know I used to be a real miserable person, and I done things that I knew that I shouldn't do.

498
00:21:55,780 --> 00:22:01,440
But I was running, and I was looking for something to fill a void that I had in my heart.

499
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,300
And like you, you're not happy, are you?

500
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,820
No, ma'am, not really.

501
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:06,860
I hate my job.

502
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,000
I hate my wife.

503
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,640
I hate both my kids.

504
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,580
I hate my brother.

505
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:11,600
I hate myself.

506
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,700
All I ever do is get drunk.

507
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,700
That's all I ever do.

508
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,280
I hate myself.

509
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:17,880
Well, that's what it all boils down to, David.

510
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,500
And really, you know, we're not supposed to hate ourselves.

511
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,300
And it's not that you hate yourself.

512
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,560
You have just made such a mess of your life.

513
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,180
My daddy did that before he died.

514
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,080
He probably did that.

515
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:33,460
He didn't help you any if he was a mean person.

516
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:33,980
He was.

517
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,860
He used to beat me up and my brother.

518
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,540
He beat you both up.

519
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,800
Was your mother a good person?

520
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:40,140
No.

521
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,840
Do what?

522
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,740
Was your mother a good person?

523
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:45,240
My mother was a saint.

524
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,520
She was a saint.

525
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:48,540
Do you think she was a Christian?

526
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:50,600
I know for a fact she was.

527
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:53,240
She used to make me go to church and I didn't like her because of that.

528
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,000
But you really now wish that you had a...

529
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,200
I wish my mama was here so she could take me to church today.

530
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,260
Are there any questions?

531
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,780
Please ask your questions so that all the members may hear.

532
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,280
Yes, John?

533
00:23:18,580 --> 00:23:24,180
What are you doing quite this early in the morning?

534
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:27,840
I just wanna stick to my ways.

535
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:30,620
You think cup d después a lot of people?

536
00:23:30,620 --> 00:23:30,620


537
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,140
Have you been shooting these ads a lot of times?

538
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,140


539
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,140


540
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,140


541
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,140


542
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,140


543
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,140


544
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,140


545
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:31,200
Hello.

546
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,520
Almost.

547
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,660
What should I do now?

548
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:37,400
She's only one over there.

549
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,100
Shouldn't she be ready?

550
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:40,480
Honestly, you and I are just having fun.

551
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:40,900
Also,

552
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,200
Oh, feel the energy.

553
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,300
There's the grounding and self-centering.

554
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,980
We need to do a grounding and self-centering right now.

555
00:23:56,180 --> 00:23:58,540
Oh, I can feel the change coming on right now.

556
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:00,120
Joe, speak it, Joe.

557
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,280
Now, we want you to clear your mind and think only of yourself.

558
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:04,500
Only of you.

559
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,980
Only of you.

560
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,380
In the name of Jesus.

561
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,080
There's no place like my ego.

562
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,960
There's no place like my ego.

563
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,360
There's no place.

564
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:39,120
Boy, that was refreshing, wasn't it?

565
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,340
Bring me back to John Lennon and I'm me mine.

566
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:43,340
I'm me mine.

567
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:44,440
I'm me mine.

568
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:50,120
Hey, Stang, thanks again for clarifying again this thing about the Trevino-ist, you know,

569
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:51,340
making sure that...

570
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,760
It can't be said enough.

571
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,340
No.

572
00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:01,040
As long as the secular Trevino-ists are still launching Trevino heads on Thursdays, Easter,

573
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:04,180
or any other time, that we cannot rest.

574
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,440
Our vigilance can never cease.

575
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,560
We have the mighty bleeding head.

576
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,500
The mighty bleeding head.

577
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:10,840
The mighty bleeding Trevino head.

578
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:11,140
The mighty bleeding Trevino head.

579
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,800
There's one right here in the station frame.

580
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:13,300
Just stop.

581
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:16,060
It's a head sort of manifestation.

582
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:17,180
Bleeding head good.

583
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:18,700
Heel head bad.

584
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:19,080


585
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,720
Hey, hey, hey, hey, you can't do that.

586
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:22,500
You can't deliver a plug on this show.

587
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:22,780
Shameless advertising there.

588
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,820
Food plugging.

589
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:24,740
Time to crank the preacher.

590
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:28,000
Immediately cover over with obfuscation.

591
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,840
Yeah, we're going to have to bleep that out in the...

592
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:32,500
We'll have to adjust that all later so none of you heard that.

593
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
I don't know who you think you are.

594
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,040
You can't come on the air and do a plug on our show.

595
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,280
Mr. That is Lord.

596
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:37,360
That is Lord.

597
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:37,760
I'm not doing that on this show.

598
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:38,680
Oh, who's plugging?

599
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,440
I'm just asking you to prank him.

600
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:45,400
Well, now look, you can stop scratching that squirrel and get back to basics as you

601
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:49,560
study your subgenius doctrine in the book of pre-scriptures.

602
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,000
Okay, and here it is now.

603
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,140
Doctrine one.

604
00:25:53,660 --> 00:26:01,640
As we walk down the path way of life, do you ever turn to yourself and say, damn it,

605
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,960
where do my left socks go?

606
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:07,340
Now, you know, Women and Children's listens to this show.

607
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,660
Women and Children's.

608
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,240
Women and Children's come into my laundry room and steal my socks.

609
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,540
I can't get up.

610
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,140
I'm falling.

611
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,180
And I can't get up.

612
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:17,160
Oh, my God.

613
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,660
You can't get up.

614
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:21,880
Well, you'd better buy some of that senior home security stuff, Missy, or else you'll

615
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,800
get all out of control.

616
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,520
Yes, join a support group for senior support socks.

617
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,220
Oh, that was too much.

618
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:37,280
Well, now we're back in the tunnel of love, trickling along at a pleasantly slow pace.

619
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,440
And not much more can happen to us.

620
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,400
I tell you, this evening has been one of those times.

621
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,860
It's what you call a Maalox moment.

622
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,300
Well, look, that's what it says here.

623
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:50,900
You know, we've got to get better writers.

624
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,840
That's all I have to say.

625
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,400
Well, anyway, off the record, it's been fun.

626
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,500
But, you know, it kind of gets, it wears you down after a while.

627
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,400
You come on out here.

628
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,100
You do these shows.

629
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:02,300
It gets so that, you know, it's just not fun anymore.

630
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,960
And that's when you need a little bit of new blood.

631
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,720
And what we call the time control effect.

632
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,340
I thought he was running away.

633
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,480
Dr. Fred is here.

634
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:24,200
I'm here!

635
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,300
He's with us.

636
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:27,640
And Sister Clone's back.

637
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:31,640
And the flow, the show, it's floating down around you right now.

638
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:34,240
Golden baubles floating through the air.

639
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:38,120
Dr. Should we have a little epitaph for Dr. St. Bogumil?

640
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,800
Dr. He's not dead yet.

641
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,560
Here we are, high over Humboldt Bay, looking out on the beautiful lights and the rain.

642
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,400
It's a pleasant sight.

643
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,860
Dr. We're drifting gently with the radio show.

644
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,300
Dr. Drifting down.

645
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,000
Dr. High above the stratosphere.

646
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,960
Dr. Drifting down into your headphones.

647
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,480
Dr. Out there.

648
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,540
Dr. Below us, we see the lights of Arcata Eureka.

649
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:02,820
Dr. It's all so beautiful.

650
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,220
Dr. The special little lights.

651
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,220
Dr. The light of Bob's country bumpers.

652
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:10,380
Dr. And we have no telephones up here where we're at, so we're not taking any calls.

653
00:28:12,020 --> 00:28:12,820
Dr.

654
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:18,900
Juggle, juggle, juggle.

655
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:25,080
Dr. KHSU with Dr. Fred and Sister Cline,

656
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:28,720
St. Dogzomatic from Arcata there,

657
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:34,200
as well as some prank call reenactments.

658
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:42,160
Submitted by some anonymous friends of James Blanchard, I think.

659
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:50,600
Dr. You also heard, dear friends, of course, WCSB in Cleveland,

660
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,980
Dr. Reverend Cole's show, on which I was lucky enough to appear with

661
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,920
Dr. St. Stymie de Bergerac and Reverend Mary Squared, au contraire,

662
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:03,000
Dr. and of course, also the most recognizable voices in subgenius radio,

663
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:08,500
Dr. Howell and puzzling evidence there on KPFA in Berkeley.

664
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,040
Dr. Ah, yes, what a lovely, horrible thing.

665
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:17,080
Dr. Putting a little rain seed here, a little rain seed there.

666
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,540
Ha, ha, ha.

667
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,740
We're a little short of oxygen, but that doesn't hurt us.

668
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,520
We don't need it.

669
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,260
Dr. Fortunately, due to these gills I got at Bobstown,

670
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:29,180
Bobstown, I can breathe almost any kind of thing.

671
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:32,620
Absolutely. Acid rain doesn't bother us either.

672
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,360
We're impervious.

673
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:33,920
Dr.

674
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:39,260
Dr. Looking down below the lights of Arcata and Eureka,

675
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,140
Dr. in Bob's country bunker, a special little light shining off in

676
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,840
Dr. We ought, California. It's so nice to be here.

677
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,240
These guys, flaming inverted cross.

678
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:51,920
Dr. It looks like, yes, a flaming inverted cross on somebody's lawn in Manila.

679
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,760
I don't understand it.

680
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:54,680
Dr. Manila?

681
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:57,280
There appears to be a dead baby at the same house.

682
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,380
Dr. Perhaps it too is suspended from the light.

683
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,720
Dr. Do you think you could zero the show in a little closer to this cross burning on the lawn in Manila?

684
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,520
Uh, standby.

685
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:10,440
Dr. Hold on, Fred, hold on. We're looking.

686
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,640
Dr. Twenty-six Americans.

687
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,320
Dr. Here we go, here we go. Hold on.

688
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:17,200
Dr. Oh, yeah, that is an inverted cross.

689
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,220
Dr. P-L-O-T. P-L-O-T.

690
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:22,960
Dr. Oh, oh, I'm kind of dizzy. Did we have to go so low so quickly?

691
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:24,680
Dr.

692
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,080
Dr. Ah!

693
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,260
Dr. Ah!

694
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,360
Dr. Ah!

695
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:46,940
Dr. Ah!

696
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,600
Dr. Ah!

697
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,900
Dr. Ah!

698
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:49,900


699
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:49,900


700
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:49,900


701
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:49,900


702
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,980
Dr. Quality, quality, quality.

703
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:53,160
Dr. Ten eight.

704
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:56,020
Dr. On the air and standing by.

705
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:04,000
It's a success

706
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,160
You know what?

707
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:09,300
Like I say, it's not an accident you called me

708
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:09,720
Why not?

709
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:15,000
Because, did you know that God loves you so much?

710
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:17,340
He loves you so much

711
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,360
Even no matter what all you do

712
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,300
Even that you're drunk as a dog

713
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:23,100
He still loves you

714
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,620
Now, he doesn't like your sins

715
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:26,300
He doesn't like things you've done

716
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,680
And he knows you've made a mess of your life

717
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:31,440
But he realizes that you're just weak

718
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,800
You know, you're just a person, a human

719
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,740
That makes no sense

720
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,800
But he loves you

721
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,200
And I'd like to be your mother

722
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,880
I'd like for you to go to church with me

723
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,440
I'd take the place of your mother

724
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,100
Really

725
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,100
Ma'am, this is so touching

726
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,460
I just, I know my brother's drunk too

727
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:52,100
But you tell him the same thing you just told me

728
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,780
We may feel better, hang on

729
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,020
Hello

730
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,500
Yeah

731
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:58,660
Now, your name is David?

732
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,200
Yeah

733
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,180
And you really are her brother?

734
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,060
His brother?

735
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:02,700
Uh-huh

736
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:04,960
Are you drunk?

737
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:05,980
Uh, yeah

738
00:32:05,980 --> 00:32:10,000
Well, how come you guys, how come you guys get drunk?

739
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,200
Well

740
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,280
You all right?

741
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:13,800
Hey

742
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:15,040
Cheers

743
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:16,580
Hey

744
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,080
Just a second

745
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:19,820
Hey, Bob

746
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,100
Don't hang up, will you?

747
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,600
I won't hang up

748
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:27,740
The voluntary relinquishing of responsibility for our lives and actions

749
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:31,740
Is one of the greatest enemies of our time

750
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,400
Oswald was a radar operator

751
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:41,060
He'd have about as much use for Russian as a cat has for pajamas

752
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:43,660
These books have gotten to your mind, Mr. Gerson

753
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:46,720
Here's Johnny

754
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:52,340
Ask not what your country can do for you

755
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:55,280
Ask what you can do for your country

756
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,160
Here is a bulletin

757
00:32:58,160 --> 00:33:02,880
But there are certain things that we can all agree on

758
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:08,360
There is a right and a left

759
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,280
Uh-huh

760
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:11,220
Let me hear you say uh-huh

761
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,340
Uh-huh

762
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:15,980
There is a dark and a light

763
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,520
Uh-huh

764
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:18,460
Uh-huh

765
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:20,100
There's a good and a bad

766
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,000
Uh-huh

767
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,840
A wrong and a right

768
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,240
Now, to the pagan

769
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,580
Uh-huh

770
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,140
Uh-huh

771
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:28,140


772
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:30,360
There's a lord versus lady

773
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:31,380
Uh-huh

774
00:33:31,380 --> 00:33:34,500
There was a yin versus yang

775
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,380
But the subgenius

776
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:37,200
Yang man

777
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,100
Well

778
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:46,520
Well, Bob might have had a lot of yin

779
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,540
Take it from me, folks

780
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,280
Connie had a lot of yang

781
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:56,400
It may take a subgenius to make all that money

782
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,020
But, honey

783
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:59,540
It took a Connie to spend it

784
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:01,420
Charming, charming Irene

785
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:04,040
My heart is filled with joy

786
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:06,420
Your love, you said, is mine

787
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,800
And all of very good

788
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,980
You're good, you're good, Irene

789
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:13,420
Heaven sent you to me

790
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,580
Charming, charming Irene

791
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,080
I'm in love with you

792
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,480
You'll be imploding with joy before you know it

793
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,900
Oh, happy, happy joy

794
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:25,960
Did you notice how

795
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:26,600
When I

796
00:34:26,600 --> 00:34:27,000
When I was in love with you

797
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,180
Launched the head in the name of Ren and Stimpy

798
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,460
How the audience just went nuts

799
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,240
Absolutely went wild

800
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:36,400
Truly, Ren and Stimpy cuts across all

801
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:40,180
Almost all cultural and whatever kind of borders

802
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,500
Oh, it brings me back to those days of my childhood

803
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,500
In front of the television with that audiovisual

804
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,900
Pouring into my eyes

805
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:47,920
Eating those highly sugared cereals

806
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,300
And taking a couple of hits off that whipped cream bottle

807
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:52,040
That's where it all started

808
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,320
Good, this is Ren Huat

809
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,740
And this is Stimson J. Cat

810
00:34:55,740 --> 00:34:56,980
Of the Ren and Stimson J. Cat

811
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:57,320
of the Ren and Stimson J. Cat

812
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:57,320


813
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:57,320


814
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:57,320


815
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:57,320


816
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:01,160
And you're listening to the Hour of Flack on K-N-O-N

817
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,960
Keep listening, you idiot

818
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:04,980
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

819
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:06,320
Else I shall damn you

820
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,360
Good job

821
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,600
In the name of Ren and Stimpy

822
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:11,260
Yeah!

823
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,840
Hang on, hang on

824
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,180
The secondary launching

825
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:22,260
The secondary launching is incredible

826
00:35:22,980 --> 00:35:25,280
Hang on, hang on, hang on

827
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,960
Hang on, hang on, hang on

828
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:31,120
Bleeding head good, healed head bad

829
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:49,680
Connie is the true goddess of the sub-genius church. You can't con Connie.

830
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:59,960
God's a ghost for great ideas. When I'm good, I'm very, very good. But baby, when I'm slack, I'm better.

831
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:07,240
Testify.

832
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:10,980
Yes, Lord. Amen. Amen.

833
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:16,360
Well, before you go getting in all this dogmatic stuff, we just want to welcome you back. You've been gone so long, Sister Clone.

834
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,540
Yeah, where the hell have you been?

835
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,120
It's been a difficult absence.

836
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:19,660
You know, I've been out here for a while.

837
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,960
I know. I'm really still not sure what happened. I...

838
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,780
Were you off studying the ways of Bob?

839
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:25,640
No, I...

840
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,900
She was studying the ways of Hobie.

841
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:30,320
I don't know if it was a dream or if it really happened, but I think that I was...

842
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,300
Studying the ways of Akira.

843
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:32,360
I was kidnapped.

844
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,280
So, I do know Akira.

845
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,520
Oh, go ahead. Go ahead.

846
00:36:36,540 --> 00:36:37,340
I was kidnapped by a...

847
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:42,420
Don't let us big, powerful sub-genius doctors frighten you, Sister Clone. Go ahead. Speak. Speak.

848
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,220
Oh, well, it's so... I'm still so shaken up by my experiences.

849
00:36:45,460 --> 00:36:46,300
I can imagine.

850
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:49,660
I was kidnapped by someone who attempted to deprogram me.

851
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,860
Force-fed me Pepsi and aspirin as an antidote to what they said.

852
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:59,220
What was a deep... I was having a problem.

853
00:36:59,480 --> 00:36:59,820
408.

854
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,060
And, you know...

855
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:03,440
Yes, yes.

856
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:07,580
It was actually working. I was attempting to invoke the power of Bob.

857
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:08,920
Straight out of Brooklyn, boy!

858
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:10,840
Yo, boy! Straight out of Brooklyn!

859
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,080
And you invoked that power of Bob, and what happened?

860
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:19,640
Well, I don't know, but I woke up lying in the parking lot next to a 7-Eleven.

861
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:22,880
Clutching a Pepsi, wondering if it had all been just a dream.

862
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:27,520
Whether they had actually deprogrammed me and learned some of the secrets...

863
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:30,440
Oh, it's them sub-genius people taking your voice away!

864
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,440
And they're giving you nothing but this parking little howl, and all you can do is just kinda yop, yop and yop and...

865
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:42,360
Scientists announced today that time travel is theoretically possible.

866
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:49,460
An article on page two of the San Francisco Examiner postulated that a gravitational field...

867
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:57,040
could, in theory, and in accordance with the beliefs of modern physics, influence time within a controlled area.

868
00:37:57,860 --> 00:37:58,420
Ah...

869
00:37:58,420 --> 00:38:07,340
The problem is total disorientation and confusion of all elements of life by the renegade rogue device.

870
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,320
Wait, wait, wait. There's two of you over there.

871
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:11,660
Wait, who's she? What's happening?

872
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,880
We could turn him into space and now...

873
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:15,180
The problem is it...

874
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:16,740
Don't take that! How about you?

875
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,060
Oh, Gesundheit.

876
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:21,800
It's real hard to try to fix this thing when it's going haywire and...

877
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:21,960
Here we go.

878
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,200
The effects could be disastrous to our own continuum.

879
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:24,820
There we go.

880
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,860
Oh! They're shooting at us...

881
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:30,380
Okay, we're climbing to the top now, over the hill. The sub-geniuses are all around me.

882
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:30,800
How do we get out of this?

883
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:32,520
I've only got a few bullets left. I'm gonna have to...

884
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:35,480
Oh, the cops! Wait a minute. I didn't have anything to do with this.

885
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:36,780
Okay, you're under arrest now.

886
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:37,940
Wow, I'm passing out.

887
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:39,620
And you're in the sub-genius gym.

888
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,560
I'm going crazy.

889
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,680
You hear the water dripping and the interrogator's voice.

890
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,440
Hey, who's that? Oh, holy moly!

891
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,360
All right, stand launch.

892
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,500
One, two, three.

893
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:48,620
Ignition.

894
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,100
Oh, my God.

895
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:50,700
Lift off.

896
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,380
Oh, oh, I'll get it.

897
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:58,260
All right, if I could just shear this bolt, I could...

898
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,000
Okay, here we go.

899
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,300
Project on bad.

900
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,460
Yeah, well, you see, um...

901
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:04,640
Project on bad.

902
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:14,260
They said that the problem is that instead of influencing the external continuum, the Crononaut, or Time Traveler, might, uh, reduce his, uh...

903
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:16,940
How would this one put it?

904
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,040
It's not even in the English language.

905
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,300
That's what he likes.

906
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,920
You like it, huh?

907
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,440
What do you want?

908
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:31,560
No, that's not it.

909
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,920
You're wicked here somewhere else, and you're stupid now.

910
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:35,720
Is this where S87 hit him?

911
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:35,900
I'm just talking to myself.

912
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:35,900


913
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:36,940
Oh, Nicole, I'm sorry, you know?

914
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:36,940


915
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:36,940


916
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:36,940


917
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:36,940


918
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:36,940


919
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:36,940


920
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:36,940


921
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:36,940


922
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:36,940


923
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:36,940


924
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:36,940


925
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,940
любой становится сущеerweiseembresстран.

926
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:47,940
It's not before my death that there should have been a new square tidy universimum.

927
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:48,040
Right, there's a GED written up there today.

928
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:48,780
or too deep baking?

929
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,000
I mean, is this what happens?

930
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,140
Well, you know, this was an oral use of prairie squid,

931
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,380
which I cannot recommend to any subgenius.

932
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,260
It's definitely out.

933
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:58,260
I got a shot of street sepia right down my gullet,

934
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:00,460
and things have not been the same since.

935
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,560
I hate it when that happens.

936
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:02,100
Oh, Lord.

937
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,360
I don't know if I will recover.

938
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,020
However, I have been using snake oil.

939
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,940
I mean, not the Dobbs brand snake oil,

940
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:11,660
but something's going to get me going again, I'm sure.

941
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,860
Will you be well enough to attend

942
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:15,740
special anniversary celebrations

943
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,440
of the Day of Infamy

944
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:19,380
occurring tomorrow throughout Humboldt County?

945
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,260
The Day of Infamy, of course, yeah.

946
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:25,520
Boy, how destructive this thing is.

947
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,380
You know, it's damaging the fabric of the universe

948
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,820
and the space-time continuum

949
00:40:28,820 --> 00:40:31,060
all through all time.

950
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,340
Well, that's what happens

951
00:40:33,340 --> 00:40:35,040
when you use that excess technology

952
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:35,880
without a reason.

953
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,700
It's what we call forbidden science.

954
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,880
It's the incredible excess technology

955
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,080
that we all have in the show.

956
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:44,440
Hmm.

957
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:47,620
Yes, it's Edgar Allan Poe once again,

958
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,680
and I think...

959
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,940
I'm afraid not.

960
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:52,040
Well, you know, we've got other things.

961
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,540
We've got lots of stuff for you.

962
00:40:53,540 --> 00:40:55,440
We've got gags, cosmic truth stories.

963
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:56,960
We have 28 minutes left in the show.

964
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,440
It's the meaning of life.

965
00:40:58,740 --> 00:40:59,900
It's the meaning of life,

966
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,580
that little carrot in your backyard

967
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,140
that you thought was so unimportant.

968
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,900
Life and life's effluence,

969
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:06,380
clouded walls and shadow.

970
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,160
Joy, color is the spirit

971
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,760
and the power which wedded nature

972
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:11,960
gives to us in dower.

973
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:15,480
A new earth and a new heaven.

974
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:19,440
Undreamt of by the sensual and the proud.

975
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,680
Slack is the soft voice.

976
00:41:24,220 --> 00:41:25,740
Slack the luminous cloud.

977
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:27,720
We in ourselves rejoice.

978
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:38,020
Reverend Cole tried to shoot me last night.

979
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,100
You know, the funny thing is

980
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,600
I really don't...

981
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,320
I wasn't that upset because...

982
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:43,220
Well, I missed.

983
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:43,980
I don't fear death.

984
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,580
I don't fear death at all.

985
00:41:45,740 --> 00:41:47,940
I know that I will never be allowed

986
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,040
into the Christian heaven.

987
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,000
Praise Bob.

988
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:50,980
Praise Bob.

989
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:51,740
Praise Bob.

990
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,360
None of your friends would be there.

991
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:54,240
Who would want to go?

992
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,120
And the Christian hell is only

993
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,340
for those who believe in it.

994
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,460
It's only there to, like,

995
00:41:58,460 --> 00:42:00,460
scare Muslims and Christians and people.

996
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:01,360
Trevinoists.

997
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:01,640
Right.

998
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:02,600
For those who are afraid

999
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,900
that if they don't believe in it,

1000
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:04,460
they'll go there.

1001
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:04,920
They'll go there.

1002
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:05,280
That's right.

1003
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:06,840
Those are the ones that are on the lowest...

1004
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:07,980
Get the lowest rung.

1005
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:09,060
And everyone knows...

1006
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,660
Everyone knows how hard it is

1007
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:12,020
to get a good corned beef sandwich

1008
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,820
in heaven, too.

1009
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:13,280
Yeah.

1010
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:15,300
But subgenius hell...

1011
00:42:15,740 --> 00:42:15,960
White.

1012
00:42:16,580 --> 00:42:17,100
Valhalla.

1013
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,480
It's just...

1014
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,620
It's the kind of classical hell,

1015
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:21,640
the subgenius hell.

1016
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:22,320
It's called Helle.

1017
00:42:22,460 --> 00:42:24,140
With two L's and an E.

1018
00:42:24,220 --> 00:42:24,360
Helle.

1019
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,260
Helle.

1020
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:26,780
It's...

1021
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,760
It's...

1022
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,140
Probably...

1023
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,380
It's the more organic,

1024
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:31,460
spiritual version

1025
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,520
of the escape vessels

1026
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:33,860
of the sex goddesses,

1027
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:34,160
which...

1028
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:35,500
So, like, on X day,

1029
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:36,820
no matter what happens,

1030
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,660
if you die as a subgenius

1031
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,160
or if you are ruptured up

1032
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,800
into the escape vessels,

1033
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,560
you either get the spiritual hell

1034
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:45,000
or the techno hell,

1035
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:45,720
which are the...

1036
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,480
Which, of course, by the hell,

1037
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,580
we mean these are like heaven.

1038
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,140
But you have to go through

1039
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,040
subgenius hell

1040
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,280
in order to be ready

1041
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:52,520
for the pleasure,

1042
00:42:52,620 --> 00:42:53,560
in order to be able

1043
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,020
to withstand

1044
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:55,080
the increased pleasure

1045
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,080
of the subgenius heaven.

1046
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,260
It's like a cleansing purgatory

1047
00:42:59,260 --> 00:43:00,860
that prepares you

1048
00:43:00,860 --> 00:43:02,720
for the true, true slack.

1049
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:03,860
Ah.

1050
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:06,540
Come on.

1051
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:07,060
Over here.

1052
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:07,860
You have to call.

1053
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:09,020
Get out of here.

1054
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,220
Back this way,

1055
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:12,960
ladies and gentlemen.

1056
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,280
You'll see two-ton Tessie,

1057
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,020
the ugliest thing

1058
00:43:15,020 --> 00:43:15,600
on the Midwest.

1059
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,740
And if you step into this tent,

1060
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:18,180
gentlemen,

1061
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,000
no children or...

1062
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,440
You will see the most sickening sight.

1063
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:25,920
Your eyes have ever seen

1064
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,040
its caution, ladies and gentlemen,

1065
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,000
against doing that terrible drug, LSD.

1066
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,680
Inside this tent,

1067
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:33,180
my good friends,

1068
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,020
is a young man

1069
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:34,860
who experimented

1070
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:35,600
with this deadly drug

1071
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,560
and you can see for yourself

1072
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,100
the effect it had,

1073
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,880
not only on his mind

1074
00:43:40,880 --> 00:43:41,480
and his soul,

1075
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,020
but on his very body,

1076
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:45,320
right down to his toenails.

1077
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:45,620
And...

1078
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,000
here is that young man now.

1079
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:48,440
Hey, Hal.

1080
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,340
What is it, my boy?

1081
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:51,020
It's Gary.

1082
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,220
Can you guys stop by here

1083
00:43:52,220 --> 00:43:52,740
on the way home?

1084
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:53,980
Well, I suppose so.

1085
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:54,960
What's going on over there?

1086
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,180
Well, I can't talk about it right now,

1087
00:43:57,240 --> 00:43:57,960
but I, uh...

1088
00:43:58,740 --> 00:43:59,780
Uh, you'll like it,

1089
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:00,380
whatever it is.

1090
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:01,840
I hope you're not mad at me

1091
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:03,120
for giving you that, uh,

1092
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:04,120
hoot and holler

1093
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,540
earlier on in the evening.

1094
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:06,520
No, I'm not.

1095
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,300
Um...

1096
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,780
But if you guys could stop by,

1097
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:09,420
I'd appreciate it.

1098
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,560
You betcha, you bet.

1099
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:11,500
Well, uh...

1100
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:11,520
Hey.

1101
00:44:11,780 --> 00:44:13,420
Uh, you have to ask Dr. Brough

1102
00:44:13,420 --> 00:44:14,360
because he's, uh,

1103
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:15,560
piloting the space module.

1104
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:18,080
Well, I'm sure he'll be amenable

1105
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:18,960
when he finds out

1106
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,240
about the free-frop program.

1107
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:21,380
Oh, wow.

1108
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,620
Amenable, abominable, adorable.

1109
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,400
Uh, we'll do it.

1110
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:25,740
Sure.

1111
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:27,400
We've got another two and a half weeks,

1112
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:28,040
so see you later.

1113
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,860
Okay, uh, we'll be right over

1114
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:30,800
to dip our wicks

1115
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,660
in the fountain of eternal pleasure.

1116
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,080
That's located right off

1117
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,160
Cajunga Boulevard

1118
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,600
in beautiful Oak Town, California.

1119
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:40,400
And we'll stop by

1120
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:41,660
and pick up some ice cream, too.

1121
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:42,820
Is that all right, Auntie May?

1122
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,180
Wait a minute.

1123
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:45,140
Who am I talking to now?

1124
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,380
This is the phony caller.

1125
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,840
You know, it's so strange

1126
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,800
to be disembodied

1127
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:50,480
right at the moment.

1128
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,060
You seem rather disembodied.

1129
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,000
Floating, floating here.

1130
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:54,560
I might be mistaken.

1131
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:55,840
That girl ain't got her pants on.

1132
00:44:56,180 --> 00:44:58,180
Uh, I hear zippers here and there.

1133
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,560
Yeah, well, that's a check

1134
00:44:59,560 --> 00:45:00,460
we'll see right here.

1135
00:45:00,460 --> 00:45:01,540
The boys are here.

1136
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,040
I want boysied out, boys!

1137
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:03,920
The boys is here.

1138
00:45:03,940 --> 00:45:04,760
Straight out of Brooklyn

1139
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:06,260
and boysie all over again!

1140
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:08,640
Talk to me, number three.

1141
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:09,320
Talk to me.

1142
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:09,680
Uh-oh.

1143
00:45:10,460 --> 00:45:11,260
Yes, yes.

1144
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,400
So, so, are you,

1145
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:13,560
are you deathly ill?

1146
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:15,280
Can we send a care basket, perhaps,

1147
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:15,540
so we can get you out of here?

1148
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:16,660
I'm gonna go get my chocolate-covered son.

1149
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,280
Here goes my wish!

1150
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:19,520
Actually, it's just,

1151
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:20,980
it's just a voice, you know.

1152
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:23,680
I, I, I'm, it hurts to talk,

1153
00:45:23,700 --> 00:45:24,660
but I'm doing it.

1154
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:25,480
I'm doing it.

1155
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:27,400
He's doing it for Bob, damn it!

1156
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:28,340
I give testimony.

1157
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:29,400
I mean, there's a reward.

1158
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,280
There's a bounty out for my voice.

1159
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:32,280
If you should find it,

1160
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:32,400
I will give you...

1161
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,940
I'm gonna hit you on the head

1162
00:45:33,940 --> 00:45:35,840
and give you the healing power of Bob!

1163
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,100
Get a witness.

1164
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,680
I will give you my seat

1165
00:45:38,680 --> 00:45:39,560
on the Exorcist.

1166
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:41,320
If you can find my voice,

1167
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,880
children, there is a quest

1168
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:43,800
in Arcata tonight.

1169
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,460
I have given a secret treasure

1170
00:45:45,460 --> 00:45:45,540
to the boy.

1171
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,520
Your map is buried in,

1172
00:45:46,540 --> 00:45:47,660
it's on the plaza,

1173
00:45:47,660 --> 00:45:49,220
at the foot of President McKinley's feet.

1174
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:51,260
The Lord has blessed this quest.

1175
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:51,600
Exactly.

1176
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,500
You follow the map

1177
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,600
and you find my voice.

1178
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:55,560
I want every waking subgenius

1179
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,940
to head down to the plaza right now

1180
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:58,100
and find that map.

1181
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:59,220
Right now, right now.

1182
00:45:59,220 --> 00:46:00,180
Bob, when we find your voice,

1183
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,080
we will cage it

1184
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:01,980
and return it to you,

1185
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:03,680
or would you prefer that we fleet it

1186
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,060
in some, uh, wild area

1187
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,060
so that it could roam,

1188
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:06,440
roam the area?

1189
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,100
Actually, just,

1190
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,620
just let it watch the antics

1191
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:10,000
with a little bit of prairie squid action,

1192
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:10,320
you know.

1193
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:10,980
Just let it sit

1194
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:12,440
and do the voyeur thing

1195
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:13,460
that it's so fond of.

1196
00:46:13,740 --> 00:46:14,420
Special prize

1197
00:46:14,420 --> 00:46:15,400
for all you subgeniuses.

1198
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:15,940
We're going to make it down

1199
00:46:15,940 --> 00:46:16,900
to that plaza right now.

1200
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,620
Constable Bob

1201
00:46:17,620 --> 00:46:18,740
will be waiting there for you.

1202
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:20,300
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1203
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:20,920
Hey.

1204
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:37,020
When boys around

1205
00:46:37,020 --> 00:46:38,040
food fights with the gods

1206
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,960
and you're listening

1207
00:46:39,560 --> 00:46:41,160
The Subgenius.

1208
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,040
Our

1209
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,640
House

1210
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:52,040
What else caught your eye at the show, at the devival, Reverend Stang?

1211
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:55,700
Well, I got snagged on a coat hanger at one point when we were trying to...

1212
00:46:55,700 --> 00:46:56,840
In your eye?

1213
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,520
Yeah, but, you know, I'm on a lot of healing herbs at any given time.

1214
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,720
Well, I was going to say, what good would a bleeding Stang head do us?

1215
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,920
And launch it.

1216
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:10,640
Well, couldn't you?

1217
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,300
Well, not in its presence.

1218
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,280
That was one industrial-strength catapult.

1219
00:47:13,360 --> 00:47:14,740
I think it could have actually launched it.

1220
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,200
Yeah, we could have found out.

1221
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:20,880
Oh, friends, the launching catapult, we hadn't even mentioned that.

1222
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,560
It was the most obscene...

1223
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:25,980
All I can say is, if the legs had been spread a little bit more,

1224
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:29,140
the head probably would have flown farther.

1225
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:33,060
Had the legs been spread more, there wouldn't have been any changes in the ladder between them.

1226
00:47:33,180 --> 00:47:34,620
Oh, the alabaster legs.

1227
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:36,260
There would have been more head either way.

1228
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,740
But the head did squirt around.

1229
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,260
You could feel the electricity.

1230
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:43,320
You could feel the electricity in the air from that head launching.

1231
00:47:43,460 --> 00:47:44,600
It was a thing.

1232
00:47:44,740 --> 00:47:45,180
A thing to behold.

1233
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,340
Now we know why she ain't got no legs.

1234
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:52,440
As Jayner, the crazy preacher, Jayner of Little Rock,

1235
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,640
he punctuates his every other sentence with,

1236
00:47:55,740 --> 00:47:57,020
Help me, somebody.

1237
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:57,840
She ain't got no legs.

1238
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,780
My legs are on fire.

1239
00:47:58,780 --> 00:47:59,820
Pull the lever down and you go.

1240
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,740
We pulled the lever down.

1241
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:09,240
The she ain't got no legs is from the unfortunate incidents of people losing their legs at Doctors for Bob concerts.

1242
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,100
We often wondered where those legs went.

1243
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,080
And there they were up on stage.

1244
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:13,640
That's true.

1245
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:14,620
With lascivious.

1246
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:20,880
And then they were obviously spread-eagled, mounted on this sort of framework, religious-looking framework.

1247
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,060
It was a big platform of cherubim.

1248
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:22,820
Yeah.

1249
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:23,380
Yeah.

1250
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:24,720
It was like, oh, God.

1251
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,360
Frightening-looking thing.

1252
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:29,000
But it was a great launching.

1253
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,580
And it had a secondary launching.

1254
00:48:30,660 --> 00:48:33,760
And the first launching, it landed in somebody's lap.

1255
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:38,240
And they screamed and threw the head up into the air further back into the audience.

1256
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,140
People kissing it?

1257
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:42,740
They really responded to the head launching.

1258
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:43,140
Oh, incredible.

1259
00:48:43,240 --> 00:48:44,520
Which was the climax of it.

1260
00:48:44,520 --> 00:48:44,560
Well, it was way above.

1261
00:48:44,560 --> 00:49:14,540
The very first audience to the show.

1262
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:14,540


1263
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:14,540


1264
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:14,540


1265
00:49:14,540 --> 00:49:25,280
Dear friends, and before it gets too much later, I think I should at least fill some of you in on what's going on.

1266
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,420
In a way, we hate to do that.

1267
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:33,020
But I should explain that you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

1268
00:49:34,340 --> 00:49:37,360
Sponsored by, yes, the Church of the Subgenius.

1269
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:44,900
Tonight's show in particular has been a cross-section of the other subgenius shows from around the country.

1270
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:52,220
There's only two or three other original ones, of which this one is off to compose.

1271
00:49:52,920 --> 00:50:03,540

00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:07,720
For free information.

1276
00:50:07,720 --> 00:50:11,700
And I'm about to give you that post office box number to write to.

1277
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,520
Just drop us a line.

1278
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:20,140
Say, Bob, I don't know if I'm with you yet or not, but I'm willing to hear what you have to say.

1279
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:22,520
I'm willing to try Slack on for size.

1280
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,920
One size fits all, dear friends.

1281
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:30,180
Just write to Bob at post office box.

1282
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:36,720

1283
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:37,340
181-417-Cleveland Heights, Ohio 4411.

1284
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:37,340


1285
00:50:37,360 --> 00:50:41,660
And also see subgenius.com.

1286
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:48,880
And I know that the way I say that, the way all this sounds, like, it sounds like it's just a joke just to put on.

1287
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,320
There's probably nothing at that address.

1288
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:51,000
Well, that's not true.

1289
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:59,920
You're just going to have to drop us a line and you'll find out for free just how much is at that address.

1290
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:01,440
You may find yourself surprised.

1291
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:06,740
There's things to see, say, and do.

1292
00:51:07,360 --> 00:51:08,640
Things to think and know.

1293
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,760
And you'll pay to know what you really think, won't you?

1294
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,920
Yeah, well, we'll find out.

1295
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,240
Praise Bob.

1296
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:27,340
Oh, speaking of Bob, last night was the beginning, not only of the first rant and rave and the little extra dribble of Hurricane Bob,

1297
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:33,240
but in that town, Avon, Colorado, where they named their bridge Bob.

1298
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:34,700
A true omen.

1299
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:37,260
They're holding the Bob Festival.

1300
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:42,540
And apparently there's, there's, it's like just this Bob out.

1301
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:45,960
Of course, this is the way the conspiracy tries to water down Bob.

1302
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:51,460
They are basically, it's like the Nissan commercial and all those other ways the conspiracy uses to make.

1303
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,960
The pleasant Bob.

1304
00:51:53,060 --> 00:51:53,840
The mellow Bob.

1305
00:51:54,060 --> 00:51:54,880
The friendly Bob.

1306
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:55,960
Bob beer.

1307
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:56,940
Bob book.

1308
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:02,000
Do you think Bob, well, actually Bob did market a type of beer.

1309
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:03,660
It was called Beer God.

1310
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:07,200
It was a little series of liquor stores in Tennessee called Beer God.

1311
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:09,400
Thirst, beep, er.

1312
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:14,720
I can't, I can't say what it was an er of, but it was like thirst, er.

1313
00:52:15,380 --> 00:52:16,740
And, uh, yeah, Beer God.

1314
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:19,100
He also had Burger God, hunger, er.

1315
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:20,920
It was kind of a little chain.

1316
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:24,980
He later, uh, moved, it became very successful in Brazil.

1317
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:30,560
Uh, there are Bob's Burgers, like the McDonald's of Brazil, uh, in, in the competition.

1318
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,020
A country well respected for its culinary tastes and skills.

1319
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:35,540
Oh, yeah, it is, actually.

1320
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:35,880
Absolutely.

1321
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:36,380
They're wonderful.

1322
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,140
Absolutely.

1323
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,740
And, uh, they're very American style.

1324
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:43,140
But, you know, I understand the rumor has it that it's Connie that's pulling the strings

1325
00:52:43,140 --> 00:52:44,820
behind all of those, uh, huge, uh, businesses.

1326
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:46,320
Oh, you could, you better believe it.

1327
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:51,720
Any of those extra little, those kind of things, that's, Connie, uh, definitely is, it's like

1328
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:52,900
with the Jimmy Swagger.

1329
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,020
He was the sort of crazy preacher, but his wife was the one who made the ministers of

1330
00:52:58,020 --> 00:52:58,040
beer.

1331
00:52:58,040 --> 00:52:58,720
She focused him.

1332
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,840
Well, no one knows meat like Connie.

1333
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:01,440
She focused him and whipped him into shape.

1334
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:07,280
She made the bad Bob's say, please and thank you.

1335
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:07,960
I'm telling you, last night.

1336
00:53:08,180 --> 00:53:09,700
Oh, no kidding.

1337
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:11,940
That probably ain't all she did.

1338
00:53:13,140 --> 00:53:16,340
Remember the guy who had never been put on before?

1339
00:53:17,640 --> 00:53:23,300
It was at the sales table after all the preaching and dancing and killing had happened.

1340
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:25,300
Uh, and, and there.

1341
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:26,360
Attempted killing.

1342
00:53:26,360 --> 00:53:31,020
The ace and subgenius type people had already, you know, they were, they'd seen the show,

1343
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,300
they bought their stuff and they were gone.

1344
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:37,980
So it was only the regular smart bar crowd that were coming down to where the, they encountered

1345
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:38,900
these bookstores.

1346
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:46,000
It was like an ACE store with all these underground comics and amazing sort of, I don't know what

1347
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,460
kind of philosophy books.

1348
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:57,160
And if you Leary and happy, yeah, all those sort of rare things that you need, uh, this,

1349
00:53:57,260 --> 00:54:02,280
this guy came down and it was like, he, he, uh, was looking at.

1350
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:02,280


1351
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,300
At the subgenius table.

1352
00:54:03,540 --> 00:54:05,680
I was about to pack up and quit.

1353
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,240
And so it worked.

1354
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:09,660
He, but he gave us hard time about the dollar.

1355
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,200
He was going, well, what is this all about?

1356
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:15,220
He wanted us to tell him what the church of the subgenius was all about.

1357
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:15,640
Get this.

1358
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:19,600
He goes, would you explain briefly what this was all brief and rough.

1359
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:20,020
Okay.

1360
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:26,420
And we said, look really honestly, this little pamphlet here is the best thing that that's

1361
00:54:26,420 --> 00:54:28,740
the only way to really get you to understand this.

1362
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:29,740
It's only a buck.

1363
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:31,080
I mean, he had.

1364
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:32,280
God only knows what he passed.

1365
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:32,860
He didn't pay to get in.

1366
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,040
He probably had $40 worth of ecstasy in his pocket or whatever.

1367
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:39,300
And but they didn't know these people wanted to spit out a dollar.

1368
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,840
That's you just, that's probably just what you want me to do.

1369
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:46,160
Give you a dollar as if we weren't giving him a 16 page book in return.

1370
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:49,640
I mean, that takes a week to read, but he wouldn't do it.

1371
00:54:49,700 --> 00:54:52,420
So at that point I went, he goes, I don't even know who Bob is.

1372
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:54,440
And uh, go be.

1373
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,760
And I just kind of went, oh, uh, you don't know who he is.

1374
00:54:57,820 --> 00:54:58,640
You can't read this.

1375
00:54:58,700 --> 00:54:59,260
Oh, good.

1376
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:00,580
Oh man.

1377
00:55:00,740 --> 00:55:01,140
There's state.

1378
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,340
Whatever you do, don't buy it.

1379
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:02,860
You don't want it.

1380
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:07,120
And I started grabbing, not just the pamphlet, but all of the stuff off the table.

1381
00:55:07,700 --> 00:55:08,780
It's too dangerous.

1382
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:10,860
I was like, stay away.

1383
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:12,780
Whatever you do, don't end up like us.

1384
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:18,420
He got a little angry at first, but to his credit, he did.

1385
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:23,060
He wandered away and I think he realized that we had been challenging him somewhat and he

1386
00:55:23,060 --> 00:55:24,700
came back and he bought the pamphlet.

1387
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:26,160
It was a true subgenius.

1388
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:26,900
He did buy it.

1389
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,880
He did buy the pamphlet and uh, and then he, but, but he.

1390
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:31,120
Yeah.

1391
00:55:31,140 --> 00:55:34,000
He went around and got to talking to, to different people.

1392
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:40,980
Uh, and it became obvious to us that the poor guy, I mean the, the church of the subgenius

1393
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:45,840
is a serious religion, but we love to put each other on and we put, we, you know, it

1394
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:49,120
was like, this guy took everything anybody said at face value.

1395
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,200
I feel such pity for this man.

1396
00:55:51,360 --> 00:55:55,760
It's like he's ripe for Scientology.

1397
00:55:56,360 --> 00:55:58,240
Well, he, he already is.

1398
00:55:58,460 --> 00:55:58,940
Fortunately.

1399
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,120
He has some of the sacred documents.

1400
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:01,120


1401
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,440
He has some of the sacred documents in his hand now.

1402
00:56:02,580 --> 00:56:04,560
And so he may well be saved from Scientology.

1403
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:10,200
And he'll learn that until your first dollar is going to Bob, you will never really understand

1404
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,060
Bob Dobbs.

1405
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,560
You will never understand that man until at least one dollar.

1406
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:14,560
You have to make that breakthrough.

1407
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:15,980
And I mean, what's a dollar?

1408
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:17,200
That's really a token amount.

1409
00:56:17,360 --> 00:56:20,500
A dollar is what we used to consider a penny back when I was a kid.

1410
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,660
You can get a piece of gum for a dollar.

1411
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,200
Ron Hubbard.

1412
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,080
Did you ever order anything?

1413
00:56:25,040 --> 00:56:28,220
Um, as a matter of fact, and this is a true story.

1414
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,660
Um, uh, this, this old gal.

1415
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,040
Reverend.

1416
00:56:31,120 --> 00:56:36,380
Reverend Betsy Curtis in Pennsylvania set, uh, happened to be an old friend of L Ron

1417
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:39,720
Hubbard's from back when he was a science fiction writer and they'd stayed in touch

1418
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:42,200
and she had his for real address.

1419
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:46,780
It was a post office box in Florida and people would take his mail to him out on his yacht

1420
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:51,640
and she, she gave it to me and I said, you know, you ought to send him some of the subgenius

1421
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:54,940
stuff that slightly based on Scientology, like our questionnaire.

1422
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:59,680
And I sent him the pamphlet and the questionnaire and all that and thought he might get a kick

1423
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,040
out of it.

1424
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:01,560
And he sent it to me a week later.

1425
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:02,240
Yeah.

1426
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:04,320
He died a week after I mailed it.

1427
00:57:04,340 --> 00:57:04,620
Fancy.

1428
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,720
The same thing happened to the science fiction writer, Philip K Dick.

1429
00:57:08,020 --> 00:57:08,340
Yeah.

1430
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:14,000
Uh, I, I, we got his address and sent him a subgenius pamphlet and, and within a week

1431
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:14,420
he was dead.

1432
00:57:14,580 --> 00:57:19,600
The last person, the second to last person who saw Dick alive was, uh, Reverend Jay Condom,

1433
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:24,720
the author of P-Dog comics who had just met him and gone over and they discussed it a

1434
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,060
little bit.

1435
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:29,100
Well, there are some people who are uncertain about the Philip K Dick's that whether that

1436
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:30,260
was really staged or not.

1437
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:34,520
So, uh, you never know maybe an L Ron Hubbard, the after the, after Dick.

1438
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:34,920
Hmm.

1439
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:35,980
I like to think that

1440
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:38,060
cruising with Elvis in Bigfoot's UFM.

1441
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:38,540
That's right.

1442
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:38,960
That's right.

1443
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:41,660
The Elvis, Elvis Presley of course is alive.

1444
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,240
I mean, there's no question about that.

1445
00:57:43,280 --> 00:57:43,940
What could kill him?

1446
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:51,260
Bob, Elvis, Kennedy, uh, the, the, uh, they try to make it seem like partying could cure,

1447
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:52,420
could kill Elvis.

1448
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,700
I, it's impossible.

1449
00:57:54,040 --> 00:57:55,000
They're all in Dobstown.

1450
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:55,960
They're gambling, man.

1451
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:56,740
They're having a great time.

1452
00:57:56,740 --> 00:58:00,020
We'll never die as long as that Hydra is out there trying to take our slack away.

1453
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:00,240
No, no, no, no, no.

1454
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:00,960
They cannot die.

1455
00:58:01,160 --> 00:58:07,360
No, there are some, the Kings and the Queens of, of true slackdomness shall ne'er die.

1456
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:12,880
Now, Jimi Hendrix really did die, but he was reincarnated as an entire tribe of exes.

1457
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,000
And so we know everything's going to be okay.

1458
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:16,380
Come on.

1459
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:17,240
You're putting us on.

1460
00:58:17,380 --> 00:58:18,980
No, that's in book of the subgenius, man.

1461
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:22,340
It wasn't in there when I read it.

1462
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:22,560
Right.

1463
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:22,860
It may not have been.

1464
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:24,820
I'm sure the next time I get by, it'll be back in there.

1465
00:58:24,880 --> 00:58:25,120
Yeah.

1466
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:25,920
That's funny.

1467
00:58:25,980 --> 00:58:29,060
Have, have you all ever noticed how your book of the subgenius will change you?

1468
00:58:29,100 --> 00:58:29,460
Absolutely.

1469
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:30,960
Yes, I've noticed that.

1470
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:34,900
It kind of ticks me off though, because I, you know, I've read the thing about 14, 15

1471
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,060
times and I still don't know a damn thing to say.

1472
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:38,340
Uh, mine moves all the time.

1473
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:40,540
I leave it in my chamber of extra meditation.

1474
00:58:40,660 --> 00:58:42,100
I go to find it and it's not there.

1475
00:58:42,220 --> 00:58:42,560
It's gone.

1476
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,500
And the Bob's heads are on different pages.

1477
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,060
Each time you look, it's, you know, there's one on the corner here, but it's another corner

1478
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:49,320
now.

1479
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:50,040
Different languages.

1480
00:58:50,040 --> 00:58:52,160
All kinds of things twisted and turned.

1481
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:58,080
And you know, sometimes I'll find it laying right next to my frap table and my frap will

1482
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:00,140
be consumed more.

1483
00:59:00,140 --> 00:59:02,240
More so than I thought it had been before.

1484
00:59:02,520 --> 00:59:05,560
And, and then I'll pick up the book and I'll start reading it.

1485
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:10,320
And, and the words seem to, to speak more, more spacely.

1486
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:17,080
They seem to penetrate between my, my nostrils into that third, third nostril.

1487
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:23,060
And I get that psychic stench, that stench where, where somebody's been smoking.

1488
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:23,160
Oh, whiff it, whiff it.

1489
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:23,860
Whiff that stench.

1490
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:25,100
Woo!

1491
00:59:25,340 --> 00:59:27,380
But it sure hasn't been me.

1492
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:30,040
But my book's looking on that table, looking up at me.

1493
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:30,120
And I'm like, I'm going to die.

1494
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:30,120


1495
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:30,260
Well that's my book.

1496
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:33,180
And that man sitting there smiling with that pop in his face.

1497
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,460
And he is going, oh yeah.

1498
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:34,960
Woo!

1499
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:36,560
And he's got bloodshot eyes.

1500
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:36,560


1501
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:36,560


1502
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:36,560


1503
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:36,560


1504
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:36,580
It's in my book.

1505
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:36,580


1506
00:59:36,580 --> 00:59:36,720
Oh, I don't even know.

1507
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:36,720


1508
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:36,720


1509
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:36,720


1510
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:36,720


1511
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:36,960
Oh, he's got bloodshot eyes.

1512
00:59:37,760 --> 00:59:38,520
Bloodshot eyes.

1513
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:39,300
Tell it.

1514
00:59:39,300 --> 00:59:39,820
Tell it.

1515
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:39,880


1516
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:40,020
Woo!

1517
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:40,900
Testify.

1518
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:40,900


1519
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:41,200
Testify.

1520
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:41,560
Testify.
