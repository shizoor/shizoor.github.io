1
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,800
I'll give that number again.

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:09,100
Post office box.

3
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,720
1-8-1-4-1-7.

4
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:14,000
Cleveland Heights, Ohio.

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,840
Yeah, no, no.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:17,400
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,380
Well, we're going back in time again tonight to the year.

8
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,160
I don't even know what year this would be.

9
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,300
This is so ancient of a rerun of a show.

10
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:36,680
No, it's labeled Hour of Slack number 177.

11
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,160
That would make it a little more than three years after we started in, I believe, 1985.

12
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,260
So could this actually be that old?

13
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:51,580
Before the 90s?

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,180
Anyway, friends, yes, this is it.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,880
A visit back in time.

16
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,620
To a day when there was a different kind of slack.

17
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:06,100
Among we, the upright primates.

18
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,740
Called the Yatinsini.

19
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,900
Rocketing away now, dear friends.

20
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,940
Out of normal.

21
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:28,840
Time.

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:30,840
And into showtime.

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:33,440
With your hideous horror hosts.

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,520
Willadobs.

25
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,960
Reverend Ivan Stang.

26
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,400
Hal Robbins.

27
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:41,640
Puzzling evidence.

28
00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:44,580
Lies.

29
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:46,060
Your broke friend.

30
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:46,880
Dr. Froth.

31
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,540
Drum and all that horribleness.

32
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,620
Oh, no.

33
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,040
Wait.

34
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:56,300
And man has always peered fearfully into his own future.

35
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,000
But.

36
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,600
Ah.

37
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,240
I think we've got no legs.

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,980
Me neither.

39
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:24,360
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

40
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,540
Power of Slack.

41
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,120
What?

42
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:36,800
And actually, about what?

43
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,120
This is a funny movie, aren't you?

44
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,120


45
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:37,120


46
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,640
Oh yes, dear friends.

47
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:40,880
This is Li Li-Cheng-e

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,000
And you are listening to the hour of Slack.

49
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,760
Remember, Bob is the comrade of all people.

50
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,400
Here, a China.

51
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,020
Just like in America.

52
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,140
The people need water.

53
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:58,280
In Chinese, we called thechemistry.

54
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:58,280


55
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,720
like looking back but it must be true slack not the best lack of the

56
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,680
conspiracy please Bob help me somebody

57
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:44,160
right in vain is right

58
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:57,080
they dug up the skulls the other day the skull farmers in Russia did dug up the

59
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,260
skull of Anastasia

60
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:06,740
and the Tsar my ancestors you don't know what staying really stands for do you

61
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:14,580
it's a sad thing man I read the paper I was gonna do a show about Russian

62
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:18,100
history tonight but instead

63
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:28,120
instead I had to get the taxes in you know there's three things as they say

64
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:34,260
in that old song and old-timey song death taxes and Bob undid it though I did

65
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:41,700
it tonight in fact got my form 1040 schedules a and B schedule C D E and S E

66
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:48,120
and schedule eight five nine two plus complete corporate forms for the church

67
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,160
at subgenius and can you imagine what it's like trying to do taxes for the

68
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,100
Church of the subgenius the world's first industrial Church the world's first Mondaitana church it's a great struggle people do taxes for the church of the subgeniu

69
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:05,580
One true church that's ready to pay its taxes because it doesn't think that you ought to have to subsidize religions you might not believe in.

70
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:06,760
Huh?

71
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,500
I go into the tax office and they say,

72
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,820
Well, what is it you do, Mr. Stang?

73
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:18,620
I say, well, I'm just an old skull farmer.

74
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,420
You know, been out farming skulls.

75
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:25,560
My business kind of depends on the weather more than anything else.

76
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,060
Of course, it is a lot of work.

77
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:30,680
You got to put a fair amount of work in there.

78
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,620
You got to fertilize them.

79
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,320
That ain't easy.

80
00:05:33,660 --> 00:05:36,300
I mean, you got to get right down there in the furrow.

81
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:44,940
You know, the furrow, my friend, and make physical love to the dirt and fertilize them skulls and hope for a good crop.

82
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:52,680
You know, not to mention at the beginning of the season, you know, sowing all them children of the hydra's teeth.

83
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,340
You got to throw them teeth out there.

84
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:56,400
You got to get them things going.

85
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:02,940
It's, you know, it's tough, man, trying to explain this to them.

86
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,880
They don't get it.

87
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:11,000
Well, is this a, you know, a two-person partnership or is this a corporation?

88
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,040
Oh, listen to that.

89
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,580
Just when I go, argh.

90
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,500
Come on, Jimmy.

91
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,700
I didn't even have to touch it.

92
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,120
Just.

93
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,940
Man, that's what mental hate will do for you.

94
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,380
Yep.

95
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,140
Yep.

96
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:48,960
I don't mind paying taxes for schools and highways and the poor and the homeless, the crippled, thermonuclear weapons, oil spill cleanups, lazy dips who'd rather vegetate on welfare than work.

97
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,660
I don't mind, you know, arming the Contras secretly.

98
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,920
Nah, no big deal.

99
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,480
Paying the governor's mansion.

100
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,340
Stocking the wildlife commissioner's personal hunting range with endangered species.

101
00:06:59,620 --> 00:06:59,780
Nah.

102
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,980
I don't mind.

103
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,380
I don't mind any of that, really.

104
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,700
I just hate the paperwork.

105
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,920
Figuring out how much the Stang family owes the Dallas commune, the Texas commune, the federal commune.

106
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,780
That's no big deal now that we're communists and the Russians are capitalists.

107
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:14,980
Hey.

108
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,600
Hey, do you think I'm confused?

109
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:17,520
No!

110
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,840
I've got it straight.

111
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,940
I pay for the oil companies to clean up the environment and I pay for their oil.

112
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:24,460
Do it.

113
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,540
Do I hold a grudge?

114
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,680
No, not me.

115
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,380
I'm beat, man.

116
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,260
I'm beat from doing taxes, friends.

117
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:38,340
I'm a dead man.

118
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,480
I'm a dead man.

119
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,820
Just call me old skeleton face Stang.

120
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:50,620
I wanted to talk about the Russian revolution, but I was too worn out from fulfilling my duties to the capitalist state to do it.

121
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:53,760
I could have defeated the Bolsheviks, but instead...

122
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,400
I had to pay taxes.

123
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:01,100
Yep, I might have helped turn the Soviets into a democracy instead of a...

124
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:08,460
I mean, it ended the arms race, but I had to do taxes instead for five days or America would have killed me.

125
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,360
Yeah.

126
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,880
Oh, can you translate what those whales are saying?

127
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:25,020
I have to pay taxes.

128
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,220
How much tax do I have to pay for this oil on my...

129
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,700
on my...

130
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,840
um...

131
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,540
baleen, sir?

132
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,140
To clean...

133
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,680
Can I get a dentist to clean my baleen?

134
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:39,020
Doctor?

135
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:41,640
But I'll tell you what, friends.

136
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,480
I believe in America.

137
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:50,080
I believe America could be the greatest nation that has ever walked this earth.

138
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,740
I believe America could be the greatest nation that has ever walked this earth.

139
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:53,740


140
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,580
I believe America could be the greatest nation that has ever walked this earth.

141
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:10,140
Yes, America, or in scientific terms, Brontotherium amerigo, was the largest land mammal known in the annals of history.

142
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:21,160
Although technically not a carnivore, the great America was able to use its thermonucleotops, or magic horns,

143
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:29,360
to rend and tear the flesh of both its vicious foes and, during mating season, members of its own species.

144
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:40,960
This rough beast slouching its way towards Bethlehem, this Beelzebush, consumed over 87 times its own weight daily,

145
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:47,340
and excreted 107 times that into its own environment.

146
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:51,140
Experts theorized that it had to spend months and months in the wild to get to the bottom of the ocean.

147
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,300
Experts theorized that it had to spend months and months in the wild to get to the bottom of the ocean.

148
00:09:51,300 --> 00:10:02,320
Most of its time afloat in its own fecal sea in order to prevent its bones being pulverized by its own enormous bulk.

149
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,700
Most of its time afloat in its own fecal sea in order to prevent its bones being pulverized by its own enormous bulk.

150
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:13,340
Thus it wallowed complacently in the primeval seas, never guessing that it soon faced extinction at the hands of parasites,

151
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:20,640
tiny bacteria, bred from the endless, smoldering heaps of its own refuse.

152
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,120


153
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:31,000
It is said that nuclear fusion could occur at room temperature within the vast gullet of this behemoth.

154
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:39,460
They live and, uh, uh, uh...

155
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:45,720
I don't have to. Other eyes are watching you beside me. Many other eyes.

156
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:55,860
Countdown for blastoff. X minus 5, 4, 3, 2, X minus 1, fire.

157
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:25,100
From the far horizons of the unknown come tales of new dimensions in time and space.

158
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,640
These are stories of the future.

159
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:32,600
Adventures in which you'll live in a million could be years on a thousand maybe worlds.

160
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:39,020
The National Broadcasting Company, in cooperation with Galaxy Science Fiction Magazine, presents...

161
00:11:55,860 --> 00:12:00,960
I know many strange tales hidden in the hearts of men and women who have stepped into the shadows.

162
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:05,480
Yes, I know the nameless terrors of which they dare not speak.

163
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:11,660
This is your host to welcome you in through the squeaking door to another half hour of horror.

164
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,960
Come in, won't you? Sit down.

165
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:19,000
Yes, come on in, won't you?

166
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:20,940
Yeah, we don't care.

167
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,220
You can do whatever you want in here. You're in the hour of slack now.

168
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,380
Yes.

169
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,180
The voice of the church of the subgenius.

170
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:38,180
Yes, bringing you the wisdom of our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs, over the airwaves.

171
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:42,740
Yes, dear friends, this is your horror host, Reverend Ivan Stang.

172
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:44,520
Continuing.

173
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:54,500
As best I can, considering to bring you the word of that man Bob, that great salesman of eternity.

174
00:12:54,960 --> 00:13:15,180
That man who, if I do have to pay my taxes, at least makes sure that he himself gets a cut from the corrupt congressmen, IRS officials, and computers with whom he has had numerous...

175
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,520
adventures of sexual congress. Thank you.

176
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:32,420
This is a scorched-ear policy. Scorched-ear policy, dear friends.

177
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,260
Oh, I'll take that back.

178
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,440
There's no way we're going to be able to do anything without a policy of that kind.

179
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,040
Okay.

180
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:56,320
But, you know, at the same time, the United States will protect you if you don't.

181
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,600
And that's what they ask us to do, is not to.

182
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,720
They ask us, don't, please. Just don't.

183
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:06,780
Whatever it is you're doing, don't.

184
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:13,960
Just settle down, have a good time, build up your immunity system, and just don't.

185
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,360
I mean, that's all there is to it.

186
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,880
No problem there, is there?

187
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,960
Well, you know, the problem...

188
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,720
There is a problem. There is a problem there,

189
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:26,100
and that is that they won't stop the other shows from getting in.

190
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:32,200
Our airwaves are constantly being invaded by a yellow horde.

191
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:36,680
Yes, a yellow horde from another galaxy.

192
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:42,920
The galaxy in Berkeley, California, whence cometh the KPFA.

193
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,620
The KPFA, hour of anti-slack.

194
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,700
I think I hear them coming in.

195
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:51,760
It's funny, it's hard to know what's funny right now.

196
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:54,420
I am doing the show, but it's in a trance.

197
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,680
It's really wonderful to listen to the shows later,

198
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,920
because, you know, there's the show, like your show.

199
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,440
You just go in, you walk into the studio,

200
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:04,720
you put on the show suit, and you become the show.

201
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:07,740
And that's easy, because there are so many times of doing it.

202
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,320
It's not quite like the...

203
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:12,900
I don't know, you don't have to think very...

204
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:15,380
very much, but the fun of the show is thinking,

205
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,020
yes, yes indeedy-boo.

206
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:20,560
Herbert Walker Bush, presidential private eye.

207
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,280
What a guy.

208
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,560
He'll figure out the problem.

209
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:29,080
And their answers before 6 a.m.

210
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:32,160
When, of course, the show was full of its tents

211
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,520
and steel across the desert, back to Libya, where it came from.

212
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,080
Several people reported seeing a kangaroo

213
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,620
about five feet tall hopping through cornfields.

214
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:42,780
People hesitated to report the sighting,

215
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:47,100
flying around the entregue of the Kangaroos,

216
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:51,780
which increased track record numbers at 25 in default.

217
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:52,540
In 2010 and 2015, race had

218
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,100
surpassed 2.6 million adesso on the 우리�biornung

219
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:57,740
welcome shortschampionship chart.

220
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:57,900
His amazing meters as they may have appeared

221
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:58,040
in the Forbes ranking net since Delmati'sいる

222
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:12,900
watch-list, the most nightly shows Начопасing Im班 Van Just Chicken.

223
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,240
let's see what this caller has to say.

224
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:17,100
Oh, no!

225
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,140
Oh, no!

226
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:18,820
Oh, no!

227
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:20,920
Now the show staff is wrestling

228
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:24,500
with the various responsibilities of the show.

229
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,640
It seemed that, uh...

230
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,380
Well, uh...

231
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,900
Hey, hey, like, uh...

232
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,960
Makes me feel all warm and cool and casual all over, eh?

233
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,000
Okay, take part in the show.

234
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:39,560
8-4-8-4-4-2-5.

235
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:40,940
I won't eat until you call.

236
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,480
We're down here at the show doing our regular thing.

237
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,480
Isn't it funny?

238
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:46,940
Yeah.

239
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,300
Makes you want to dance.

240
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,020
And now we're going to plug in some...

241
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,380
Yeah.

242
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,380
With millions of people barreling along our highways each day,

243
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,280
it is not unexpected that driving unknowns...

244
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:06,700
Hello? Hello?

245
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:08,180
...are becoming more and more common.

246
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:08,920
Hello?

247
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,900
Is my dub set pizza ready?

248
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,400
Hello?

249
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,740
Dub set pizza?

250
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,400
Yeah, it's, uh, it's coming out now.

251
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,120
And it's looking all over everything.

252
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:20,960
It makes me want to pee.

253
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:23,080
I thought it makes me want to squat your bob.

254
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,820
Hold it, man, for God's sake.

255
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,920
No, but I got a great big bob in my pants.

256
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,940
Bob somewhere else.

257
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:30,720
This is a private function.

258
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,040
That's right.

259
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:32,840
I'm about to...

260
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,480
It's around the corner and to the left.

261
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,940
So I put my microphone near the toilet bowl

262
00:17:38,940 --> 00:17:41,040
before I do the final recording?

263
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,060
Don't worry, son.

264
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:44,520
You'll leave your mark on the subgenius show.

265
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,180
I put a little mark on the outside of the door

266
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,420
with some Dubrowfram juice.

267
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,380
Well, I'd love to press button B

268
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:53,280
on the blazing, shining B-board,

269
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,680
but I'm afraid of cutting off

270
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,700
some important connection or conduit.

271
00:17:56,820 --> 00:17:57,300
Go ahead.

272
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:58,720
Don't be afraid.

273
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,860
Bob will tell you which button to push.

274
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:01,920
Is it all right?

275
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:02,340
No.

276
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,940
Well, which way to go here on the future?

277
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,860
It's only a matter of time

278
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,180
before the future becomes

279
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:11,140
the unpleasant present.

280
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,920
Push the fast-forward button

281
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,420
and that way the dog's head feeds

282
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,460
will heat up a little quicker.

283
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:18,700
Oh, there we go.

284
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,300
Fast-forward.

285
00:18:20,060 --> 00:18:20,520
Well...

286
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,240
Look at it.

287
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,360
It's really going fast now.

288
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:22,960
Yeah.

289
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:24,280
And that's Glass Madness.

290
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,020
It's not suddenly

291
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,060
running clear.

292
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:26,960
Call her home.

293
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,400
Glass Madness is used to it.

294
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,100
He can write a fucking show.

295
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,440
I'm on the fucking show

296
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:33,840
and I wish the fucking show

297
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,200
would get off my fucking phone.

298
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,780
I don't think I care

299
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:37,900
for that kind of language.

300
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,220
Well, that's...

301
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,340
I fail to see the humor.

302
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,000
Yes, sir.

303
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,960
You mount that telephone

304
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,020
and you'll...

305
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,400
I am brighter than a thousand suns.

306
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,520
My humble eyeballs have melted.

307
00:18:50,980 --> 00:18:52,000
Humble eyeballs?

308
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,200
Put the eyeballs on the dog's head pizza.

309
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:56,040
It must be 5.20 in the morning.

310
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,560
A British case received considerable publicity

311
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,680
when a driver reported

312
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,540
that his headlight suddenly seemed to bend

313
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,740
into a nearby...

314
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:05,740
at a spot where several strange accidents

315
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:06,920
had occurred previously.

316
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,460
I hate that when that happens.

317
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,580
Light can be bent

318
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,040
by a powerful gravitational force

319
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,040


320
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:12,040


321
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,400
but a force strong enough

322
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:14,300
to bend a light beam

323
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:15,600
would certainly be strong enough

324
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:16,660
to be felt by the driver

325
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,820
and it would certainly

326
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,640
pull the car itself off the road.

327
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,560
Oh, it's just another trick with glass.

328
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,900
They used funny lenses.

329
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,600
A blinding saucer had been seen

330
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,320
in the neighborhood

331
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,980
briefly before the incident.

332
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,480
Really?

333
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,200
Pilots who have survived

334
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,620
harrowing experiences

335
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:34,540
in the famous Bermuda Shorts Triangle...

336
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:35,520


337
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:35,840
Golly.

338
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,920
...and reported that their radios

339
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,400
and instruments went haywire.

340
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,860
They felt physically

341
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,120
and mentally disoriented.

342
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,960
Clues pointing to electromagnetic pollution.

343
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:44,900
Yeah.

344
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,300
But since there are no relay towers

345
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:47,900
or radar sets in the Atlantic,

346
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,340
what could be the source?

347
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,740
Got any ideas?

348
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:51,820
Sure.

349
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,200
Dobbshead pizzas, man.

350
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,860
If you get them in between your radio

351
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:55,860
and your telephone,

352
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,100
all of a sudden the light beams start bending.

353
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,860
And I hate that when that happens

354
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,340
because I can't read anymore.

355
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:02,940
According to reports,

356
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,940
the intake engines of the jet aircraft

357
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:07,100
were clogged with the floating Dobbshead pizzas,

358
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,820
which caused so many crashes

359
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,880
in this mysterious quadrant of the Atlantic.

360
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:12,120
Absolutely.

361
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,540
I could confirm that.

362
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:17,280
If you saw the gorilla in my car...

363
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,160
Yeah, I still got a pizza ass.

364
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,320
Gorilla of my dreams, I love you.

365
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,620
Uh, gorilla of my mist.

366
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:26,440
Ah, yes, you missed that one.

367
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:27,700
I think we all missed there.

368
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,120
Yeah.

369
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:28,860
We missed by a mile.

370
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,920
But we know that beams of energy

371
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,640
on all frequencies

372
00:20:31,640 --> 00:20:33,860
are constantly bathing the Earth from space.

373
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,340
Did you say beams of energy?

374
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,920
Beams of energy.

375
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:38,500
Oh, like Boston beans.

376
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,900
Beams trapped or weakened

377
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:40,860
by the Van Allen Space System.

378
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,040
The Van Allen belt,

379
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,540
which fell around the Van Allen ankles

380
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,760
when the Van Allen pants fell down.

381
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,580
Yes, that's because the Van Allen waist

382
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:48,640
was much too big.

383
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,300
Some of these beams get through our atmosphere

384
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,700
and sweep over our planet

385
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:55,040
in much the same way that our radar beams

386
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,080
have explored Venus and Mars.

387
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:02,120
You say that the beams replace your penis?

388
00:21:02,920 --> 00:21:06,020
Could it be that someone on some distant world

389
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,820
is examining your happiness with radar?

390
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:09,660
Oh.

391
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,120
And occasionally,

392
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,460
a human is caught in one of their probes.

393
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,560
He becomes unhappy,

394
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,340
drives his car off a cliff,

395
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,880
or dives his plane into the ocean.

396
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,580
Or by a paper snake.

397
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:19,920
Paper snake, one dollar.

398
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,280
Scare somebody, make you happy.

399
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:23,480
Scare somebody.

400
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:25,800
Don't worry, be happy.

401
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,040
Eviscerate the tigers.

402
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:30,320
I've got a question, though.

403
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:33,040
How come there's little plastic argument

404
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,220
everywhere in my house

405
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,220
and all in my refrigerator?

406
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,100
How come there's...

407
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:36,180
Shoot them.

408
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,760
Use that AK-47 to shoot them.

409
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:38,700
Have you looked in the freezer?

410
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,140
Yeah, they're in there, too.

411
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:40,840
They're everywhere.

412
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:40,840


413
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:40,840


414
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:40,840


415
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:40,840


416
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:40,840


417
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:40,840


418
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:40,840


419
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:40,840


420
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,560
They're all around you, but hang tough.

421
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:43,900
Your wife loves you, so please.

422
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,420
Semper fi.

423
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:45,220
I think...

424
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,480
Here comes a little custard.

425
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,240
Plastic soldier guy.

426
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,700
He's wading through the custard.

427
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,100
I think puzzling evidence put them there.

428
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:53,100
Yeah, that could be.

429
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,040
I've got puzzling evidence.

430
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,420
Use my AK-47.

431
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,980
It's all over my gun.

432
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,340
Disguised as a...

433
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,340
Tack-a-tack-a-boom.

434
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,940
Disguised as a regular TV repairman,

435
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,820
that is to say, a refrigerator repairman,

436
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,220
or whatever,

437
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,020
he made his way into the house

438
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,680
and fluffed the refrigerator

439
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,380
with tiny plastic statuettes.

440
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:10,820
I'm sorry.

441
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:10,820


442
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:10,820


443
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:10,820


444
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:10,820


445
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:10,820


446
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:10,820


447
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:11,760
My gun says,

448
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,740
Plastic soldier guy.

449
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,340
Puzzling evidence on the outside.

450
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:14,180
It says,

451
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,640
Slack all over the handle.

452
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:16,680
I don't know what it means.

453
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,240
He left spray-painted graffiti

454
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:20,700
ruining the interior of the house.

455
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,440
Slack-blah.

456
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,700
Slack-blah.

457
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,880
He painted Slack all over the interior.

458
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:24,160
One of those groups.

459
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:24,820
I know that one.

460
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:26,960
Exploring priceless hangings and curtains.

461
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,040
It's Slack-blah.

462
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:28,980
B-L-A-H.

463
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:29,620
Yes.

464
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,480
It's Slack-blah.

465
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,960
Hinkley Brough then proceeded to the second floor

466
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:36,540
where he slept in three separate beds.

467
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,620
The first one was too hard.

468
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:40,460
The second one was too hard.

469
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:40,800
The second one was too hard.

470
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:40,800


471
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:40,800


472
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:40,800


473
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,060
The third one had chicken bones in it.

474
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,780
I'm going to need Stang's couch.

475
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:48,440
Yes, and he slept on that couch

476
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,940
for a night and a day.

477
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,540
Huge thorns and briars grew around the house

478
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:54,140
so no one could get through.

479
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,960
And they couldn't deliver the dolls that pizza

480
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,040
so that the radar beans couldn't get out of the garbage disposal

481
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,180
and everything clogged up.

482
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,940
It was really bad.

483
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,280
The years went by and became centuries,

484
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,380
but the subgenius machinery continued to broadcast.

485
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:10,800
We were going to be able to get the dolly out of the house

486
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:10,800


487
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:10,800


488
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:10,800


489
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:10,800


490
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:10,800


491
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:10,800


492
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,680
even though no one was on the air.

493
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,740
Only the multi-index memory bank,

494
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:20,200
itself so highly organized by a bank of synchronized computers

495
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,300
that its complexity almost approaches intelligence,

496
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:28,300
managed to fabricate a show which is the subgenius show

497
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,640
you hear these days.

498
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:32,660
A collection and compendium of tapes mimicking,

499
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,660
though some still prefer to say duplicating,

500
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,660
the famous previous years of subgenius.

501
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:40,800
I'm going to get the dolly out of the house.

502
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,320
I'm going to identify the...

503
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,700
Did you order a butt crumbs in it?

504
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,280
Mutants.

505
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:44,640
Awesome.

506
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:45,860
Totally awesome.

507
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:51,520
I will have some sea bass on that pizza and...

508
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,600
And squid.

509
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:54,120
Yeah, squidly diddly.

510
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,560
I'll put it on there.

511
00:23:55,920 --> 00:23:58,320
Is there a caller on line two?

512
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,880
And plenty of parmesan cheese.

513
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,700
Yes, there is, but we hate to lose you,

514
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:03,940
oh, favorite one.

515
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,880
We have another caller on line three.

516
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:08,280
Hello, this is Radio View's hotline.

517
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:09,540
What the hell do you want now?

518
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,780
Stop abusing your privacy.

519
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:10,780


520
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:10,780


521
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:10,780


522
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:10,780


523
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:10,780


524
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:12,820
Radio, radio, it's time to blow up glass.

525
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:16,700
Hello, you're on the air.

526
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,900
I like the part down in this town.

527
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:22,400
I like the part down in this town.

528
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,400


529
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,400


530
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:22,400


531
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,480
Hick Dominica Honda sock to boom lady yoohoo.

532
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,400
Eeky weekey goo goo ga ha.

533
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,640
Ching chang walla walla bing bang.

534
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,000
Oo ee oo ah ah.

535
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:33,900
La bae bae da maa taun to sue la tablet to man o' flow.

536
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,720
Now I must talk to him.

00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,760
Oo ee la sa do baan.

538
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,740
Oh, bae baam baam to maa ooo.

00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:40,740


541
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:40,740


542
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:40,740


543
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:51,340
What in the sky am I riding on?

544
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:51,620
Bad ass ass ass ronnya.

545
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,600
Oh, they ain't impossible to fit on a cart,

546
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,700
not at least kinda.

547
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:08,140
Who ought to write.

548
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:13,520
yellow brown and red this snail is flocked and blacked fuzzy not slimy

549
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:22,520
yes come with us now millions of miles into space to the planet of the snails

550
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:30,600
science fiction theater being stranger than you can imagine

551
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,600
oh

552
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:59,900
travels at an enormous rate through the black

553
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,380
inky

554
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:07,300
gulf of space which brings me to the subject of the speed of light 186 000 miles per second

555
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:16,120
so what slows it down it's a relativistic speed son and other relativistic speeds may be possible

556
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:22,800
all we know occurs in our little pocket of space but outside these rural precincts a mysterious

557
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:30,160
universe exists of unbelievable complexity a complexity so great it is indiscriminate from

558
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,660
a gigantic intelligence

559
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,140
a malevolent

560
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:33,320
wise

561
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:34,820
biding its time

562
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,980
nobody hatching its plots and plans against us

563
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:48,540
oh yes my friends i know they lurk behind our furniture ready to pounce out they are the furniture i've seen them haven't you

564
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,940
hello i'm a chair

565
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:53,760
i'm afraid we have to yield to the chair

566
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:57,860
uh well we won't have to yield to the chair let's just blow the chair up

567
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,460
the chair recognizes the floor

568
00:26:59,460 --> 00:26:59,980
up!

569
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:03,000
that was the last thing he ever recognized

570
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:08,140
and i've been constipated for about five years

571
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,220
he confiscated his pet turtle and his slingshot and it's in miss dipple's desk

572
00:27:13,220 --> 00:27:16,340
and i had a big gulp from the seventh level

573
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,620
well throw a towel over it

574
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,880
and i shut it down

575
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:22,240
here we don't want to hear your personal adventures

576
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:27,920
but the third thing was the 25 cent discount

577
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,800
who was that?

578
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,100
uh who was that?

579
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:31,500
i don't know

580
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,140
i don't know

581
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:32,860
i don't know

582
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,380
sorry no discounts available

583
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:35,580
no dimes huh

584
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:38,480
but 30 cents ago i

585
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:41,260
our fathers brought forth upon this content

586
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,860
and 25 cents discount

587
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,020
conceived being liverton

588
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:50,480
otherwise i'm gonna have regrets all the rest of my life

589
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,500
and predicated on the suppository that all men char deflated evil

590
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,380
but my overall point was

591
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,560
well the gist of it

592
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,340
i mean in summary

593
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:06,000
now we are betrayed by a great simple force

594
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,340
but the last

595
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,660
determining whether this nation

596
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,620
or carry nation

597
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,380
shall slong endure

598
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:13,820
but the towel

599
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:17,720
you know i don't have any clean towels left after seven years

600
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:21,320
we here met on a butterfield of this war

601
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,220
beep

602
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:22,960
beep

603
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,560
i'll be in an angry gray essay

604
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:28,160
and say

605
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,440
we cannot concentrate

606
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,560
we cannot follow this

607
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:31,840
crawl

608
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:37,280
this tin can living and dead

609
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,100
will long forget what we stew here

610
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,240
they will not long forget what we ate here

611
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,740
i wonder what happened here a long time ago

612
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,180
yeah

613
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:52,240
radioactive martian city definitely doesn't really matter just a bunch of

614
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,240
dead guys yeah they're piled up in here

615
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,100
more dead guys

616
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,820
i think the whole thing's unsanitary and unsavory

617
00:28:58,400 --> 00:28:59,720
i like this show

618
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:01,800
we're left over from the revolutionary war

619
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,060
wicked indeed

620
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,160
you wicker man

621
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:06,720
i'm gonna take the wicker man out

622
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,520
yeah there they go

623
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,520
like i

624
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:15,440
just by pushing buttons i can have a hundred things going at once

625
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,600
it's just amazing

626
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,220
and we get all these people calling in going

627
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,800
this is the first time i ever listen to this show

628
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,380
what are you guys doing

629
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:26,620

00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:27,760
well dear friends

631
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,220

632
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:37,860
the first mate of our great ship uh and hey you know what they mean by first

633
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:38,200

634
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:44,800
well yeah first mate bob and the crew of the good ship grace

635
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:48,320
the voices from the harbor called haven of rest

636
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,780
i'm told that everybody likes the story they

637
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:58,360
like the story of bob in life and because bob bob was a story and i'm sure he was a story

638
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:05,660
you know but at the same time he was a reality more hideous than anything you could imagine in

639
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,920
your wildest dreams

640
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:16,480

641
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,300
44444118

642
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,440
for our

643
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,880
the best

644
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,000
no we're off and now you know

645
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,920
cops are far too close to the german

646
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:28,560
we'll be gone

647
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:32,220

00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,560
otherwise well

650
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:43,000
ain't no telling what happened well the lines are lighting up all we have to do

651
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,700
is accuse you of not understanding a damn thing

652
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,640
then yeah then they call it a off

653
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:54,060
i get it this is some sort of take-off on religion

654
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:57,960
isn't it oh you go ahead and believe that

655
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:09,480
As you go down, deeper and deeper into your mire of ignorance, ignorance and foolishness.

656
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:33,000
I caught a plane, got off in Spain, pulled it out and did the same damn thing.

657
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,100
I claim all these garbage dumps.

658
00:31:43,860 --> 00:32:04,120
I claim all these garbage dumps.

659
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:39,440
I claim all these garbage dumps.

660
00:32:39,480 --> 00:33:09,440
I claim all these garbage dumps.

661
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:30,640
I claim all these garbage dumps.

662
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:46,320
I claim all these garbage dumps.

663
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:39,460
I claim all these garbage dumps.

664
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:45,600
I claim all these garbage dumps.

665
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:45,900
I claim all these garbage dumps.

666
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:46,140
I claim all these garbage dumps.

667
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,620
I claim all these garbage dumps.

668
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,680
I claim all these garbage dumps.

669
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:55,640
I claim all these garbage dumps.

670
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,480
I claim all these garbage dumps.

671
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,960
Thanks for watching!

672
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,080
Let's cover those a little bit more, if we might,

673
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,100
because I take it there's a lot more genres that emphasize death and killing

674
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,540
than just regular thievery, eh?

675
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,560
Many other genres.

676
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:22,360
We did, in fact, when I was with the publisher of Dungeons & Dragons...

677
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:23,100
The printer's devil, huh?

678
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:28,720
We had any number of other role-playing game forms out of science fiction.

679
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,160
D&D, S&M, L.A. Strangler.

680
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,880
You can play in virtually any genre.

681
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:33,600
Yeah, I bet.

682
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,220
What about good behavior?

683
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:37,900
Singing.

684
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:40,040
Get out of that mark.

685
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,020
But that don't change the truth none.

686
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,960
There's right and there's wrong.

687
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,640
You gotta do one or the other.

688
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,660
You do the one and you're living.

689
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,600
You do the other and you may be walking around,

690
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,520
but you're dead as a beaver hat.

691
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,840
Now, the 12th of May was a hell of a day.

692
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:01,700
When the news got around to all the seaport town

693
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:05,720
that the Great Titanic was sinking down.

694
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,880
But all...

695
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,360
On this ship was a man named Shine

696
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:15,320
with pearly white teeth and a black behind.

697
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,440
Shine run up from the deck below hollering,

698
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:21,180
Captain! Captain!

699
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:27,020
Don't you know there's 40 feet of water on the boiler room floor?

700
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:28,960
The captain said,

701
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:29,480
Go back!

702
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:34,480
You dirty black, we got a thousand pumps to keep this water back.

703
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:37,820
Shine went back and began to think.

704
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:38,740
He said,

705
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:42,700
Ah, this big bad mother is bound to sink.

706
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,680
Shine said,

707
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:47,760
There's fish in the ocean and crabs in the sea.

708
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:53,440
But this is one time you good, cool white people ain't got buzzed yet.

709
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:53,700
Me.

710
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,540
I thought cheese and white and pickle

711
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,280
Doesn't even cost a nickel now to wash it down.

712
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:02,280
Clink, clink, no more to drink.

713
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,820
I had a cellar full, but now it's gone.

714
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:06,960
Drink, drink.

715
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:07,880
Drink, drink.

716
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:08,660
Glasses clink.

717
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,540
Like the anvil chorus and my head is splitting.

718
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,400
A-brinky, a-busty.

719
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:14,980
Oh, brother.

720
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,340
Oh, wow.

721
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,220
What do I do now?

722
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,380
Pink elephants are running after me.

723
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,740
Oh, that stuff was smooth as silk.

724
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:24,320
From now on I'll stick to milk.

725
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,400
Nothing else to drink for me.

726
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,900
Do you remember how it really was?

727
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,320
You and me and booze.

728
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,800
A threesome, do you remember?

729
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:38,920
It wasn't great, but it lasted.

730
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,940
We can have it back that way again if...

731
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:43,440
If I'll drink with you, but I'm not gonna drink with you.

732
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:44,600
It's finished.

733
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,680
I wouldn't ask you to drink with me.

734
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,840
I'd control myself.

735
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,560
Can't control yourself?

736
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,740
You're an alcoholic just the same as I am.

737
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,240
You and I were a couple of drunks on a sea of booze and the boat sank.

738
00:37:56,820 --> 00:38:00,380
But I got a hold of something that kept me from going under and I'm not gonna let go of it.

739
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,840
Not for you, not for anyone.

740
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:03,600
And its name is Bob.

741
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:05,160
And it's Bobby.

742
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,540
Yes, Bob Dobbs, dear friends.

743
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:09,680
He's a fucking bander.

744
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:13,940
And there's nothing wilder than life in the bosom of Bob.

745
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:16,260
Well, actually, he ain't got much of a bosom.

746
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,640
He's kind of chicken-breasted actually.

747
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,640
But his head is that mighty saint of sails.

748
00:38:21,740 --> 00:38:24,320
That sailsman of the universe.

749
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:26,200
Bob.

750
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:31,100
He can take the world in a love embrace.

751
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:37,500
You can fire all of your guns at once and explode into Bob's face.

752
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,440
Of course you gotta pay Bob

753
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:55,040
You gotta pay Bob's radio stations

754
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,720
That bring you the word of Bob

755
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:59,480
Because you know they exist on nothing but

756
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:02,520
Splicing tape and

757
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,780
You know no advertising

758
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,760
So we need your money, friends

759
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:13,940
Send those pledges in to whatever station this is

760
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:15,820
I can't even tell

761
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:18,760
I've been through so many shows in one night

762
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,600
I don't even know what show I'm on

763
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:21,780
What about good behavior?

764
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,600
Do you have any games that promote good behavior?

765
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:27,900
No, the most popular is certainly fantasy

766
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:28,880
Oh, the S&M types

767
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,340
Horror and science fiction

768
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,260
Horror and science fiction

769
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:32,460
And espionage

770
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,480
You teach them sabotage?

771
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:34,760
Post-Holocaust isn't so bad

772
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:36,280
There's a science fantasy

773
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:36,880
Post-Holocaust

774
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:37,560
Gamma Rotters

775
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:38,860
Wait a minute, let me get this straight

776
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:40,340
You promote the Holocaust?

777
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,740
Do you really do that?

778
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:42,500
Yes

779
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,040
Yes

780
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,800
It's put out by Game Designers Workshop, as I recall

781
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:46,980
It's called Twilight 2000

782
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:47,920
Twilight 2000?

783
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,400
Sounds like Death Wish 2000

784
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,220
Don't you feel the slightest bit remorse and guilt

785
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,700
About promoting something like that?

786
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,280
I've never played it

787
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:56,440
Oh, that's reassuring

788
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,980
Why not?

789
00:39:58,180 --> 00:39:58,520
Why not?

790
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,920
If you could make up wizards and

791
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:02,360
Killers, stranglers

792
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,220
So forth, why not?

793
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,440
Kill a few million people

794
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:04,760
Post-Holocaust

795
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:05,760
Sure, why not?

796
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,740
After all, it's not your neck on the line

797
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,340
Unfortunately

798
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,560
And besides, like you say

799
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,660
It's a lot of fun

800
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,520
You know, I'm very curious to find out

801
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,000
What some of the other games are

802
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,640
That you have in store for the American public

803
00:40:15,640 --> 00:40:18,240
I have done a game called Cyborg Commando

804
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,200
Which is set about 50 years in the future

805
00:40:21,740 --> 00:40:24,240
Where Earth is being invaded by some aliens

806
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,900
Oh, wait a minute, don't tell me

807
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,440
They have hair all over them

808
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,760
And praying mantis arms

809
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,100
You know, I know all about that

810
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,300
And that's exactly the kind of point I want to get to

811
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:33,560
You know, a few of these ideas

812
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:34,700
Are just a little bit too realistic

813
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,340
And, well, they're disturbing

814
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,720
If you don't mind me using that word

815
00:40:37,720 --> 00:40:39,140
And, well, quite frankly

816
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,000
I'd like to know what your

817
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,940
What your inspiration is for these things

818
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,060
Are they voices in your head?

819
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,420
What do you come up with these ideas?

820
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,460
It's a lot like writing a story

821
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,040
Oh, really?

822
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:49,120
If you like to read about something

823
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,820
Murder, rape, dismemberment

824
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:52,220
Why not play a game on it?

825
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:52,500
Oh, sure

826
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,360
It's pretty much the same

827
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,820
The way I write, too

828
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,240
Is that, gee, I have a lot of fun

829
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:57,220
Playing a game in that

830
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:57,700
Oh, really?

831
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,300
Particular genre

832
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,080
Why don't I write a story about it?

833
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:03,100
So it cuts both ways

834
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:03,700
No pun intended

835
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,320
And that's what I did

836
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:04,760
I enjoyed it

837
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:05,040
I enjoyed

838
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,820
A role-playing game is very much

839
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:10,800
A plot outline

840
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,300
Where the acting is then filled in

841
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:16,420
And the eventual end of the story

842
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:17,940
Is determined by the players

843
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:19,780
Interacting with this plot outline

844
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:20,500
That is there

845
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,000
Uh-huh

846
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,680
Which they then fill in with a human being

847
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,000
After they take these little games

848
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,320
That you have very seriously

849
00:41:25,320 --> 00:41:26,200
And end up killing people

850
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,100
Which is exactly what some teenagers did

851
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:29,300
And they murdered people

852
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,960
Because they had heard about it in their games

853
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:32,100
Now, what do you have to say about that?

854
00:41:32,140 --> 00:41:33,700
I suppose you blame it all on the players

855
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:34,740
Oh, well, I suppose

856
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:35,360
Of course it is

857
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,900
Although you set it up for that, too

858
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:37,960
So you're admitting that

859
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,180
This is a group cooperative game

860
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:42,600
Most role-playing games are group cooperative

861
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,100
Kind of like a gangland rape or whatever

862
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:48,380
Fight against its own numbers

863
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:53,220
It works together to overcome outside opposition

864
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,520
Like the police, uh-huh

865
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:58,580
So there is violence, certainly, in a role-playing game

866
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:00,760
There's violence in virtually everything we see and do

867
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:01,940
And I don't think that's bad

868
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:04,720
Because I believe that it helps to sublimate

869
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:05,660
Your income

870
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:05,740
Those things

871
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,220
And you act it out and it's gone

872
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:09,580
Yeah, and so are the victims that they acted out on

873
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,660
Which is the main problem that we're having here

874
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:13,400
Now, I think the argument that you're maintaining

875
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,920
Is much like the gun control argument

876
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,340
That guns don't kill people

877
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,340
People kill people

878
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:19,940
And so you're saying that Dungeons & Dragons don't kill people

879
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:20,880
That people kill people

880
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:22,880
And they just happen to be under the influence of your game

881
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,680
When they murder these people

882
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,940
Much like a drug or something

883
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:25,560
Is that what you're saying?

884
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:26,960
I believe so very much

885
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:27,560
Uh-huh

886
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:28,960
The...

887
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:30,580
The...

888
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,400
Oh, you're stammering now

889
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:32,140
A little nervous, huh?

890
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:33,020
The game itself

891
00:42:33,020 --> 00:42:33,700
Uh-huh

892
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,720
Had taken some flight

893
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:35,180
Sure

894
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,880
Basically from fundamentals

895
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:37,300
Oh, yeah

896
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,260
To head religious objections

897
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:39,180
Yeah, it's all the clerics' fault

898
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,600
Because after all, it has magic in it

899
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,240
And dragons and demons

900
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,380
And things like that

901
00:42:43,380 --> 00:42:44,000
Heavy on the demons, yeah

902
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:44,880
So...

903
00:42:46,340 --> 00:42:46,700
The...

904
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,300
You go on

905
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,660
Authorities have sometimes, in small towns particularly

906
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,660
Encouraged people to say

907
00:42:52,660 --> 00:42:54,300
You know, the devil made me do it

908
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:54,720
Uh-huh

909
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:55,780
Well, who made you do it?

910
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:56,620
That's what I want to know

911
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:57,820
Uh, the game

912
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,360
Oh, so you can blame it on the game

913
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:00,400
But they can't blame it on the game

914
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,460
Well, that sounds very consistent

915
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:03,640
It sounds like you're not willing to accept responsibility

916
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,720
For any of the problems

917
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:05,600
Your games create

918
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:07,140
But what about your children?

919
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:08,140
What would you tell them

920
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:09,360
If they were interested in it?

921
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,260
This is a dangerous game

922
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:12,420
And I remember OBS

923
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:13,640
Because it's really easy

924
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:15,460
Because they say it's occult

925
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:15,960
Uh-huh

926
00:43:15,960 --> 00:43:18,380
Now, nobody ever defines what occult is

927
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:19,000
Uh-huh

928
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:19,580
What is occult?

929
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,920
And if you begin to define it

930
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,580
Usually it's, well, those bad things that...

931
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:26,140
That you espouse

932
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:26,600
I don't like

933
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:27,840
Occult

934
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:28,080
Occult

935
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:28,780
What is occult?

936
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:31,060
What is the occult?

937
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:31,480
Do you know?

938
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:34,260
Well, I can't come up with any dictionary definitions

939
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:34,720
Right now

940
00:43:34,740 --> 00:43:37,340
But, uh, I can visualize a pretty clear image

941
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,100
Of what the occult is

942
00:43:38,100 --> 00:43:38,660
Let me tell you

943
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,360
From where my standpoint is right now

944
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,480
Then again, I haven't exactly studied it either

945
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:43,200
The way you have it

946
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,440
That's assuming you admit you have studied the occult

947
00:43:45,440 --> 00:43:47,220
Well, sure, I have the, um

948
00:43:47,220 --> 00:43:49,620
Anything that you could find in most libraries

949
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,260
Oh

950
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:50,860
That's it

951
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,800
You go to a library, yeah

952
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:53,640
I have no great knowledge of the occult

953
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:54,600
I do have the, uh

954
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:56,660
I think Avon published, uh

955
00:43:56,660 --> 00:44:00,020
The Encyclopedia of Paranormal and the Occult

956
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:00,340
Avon, huh

957
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,300
Ding-dong Satan Calling

958
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:01,660
Yeah

959
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,160
I read a lot

960
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:04,720
I've read a lot

961
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:04,840
I'm lucky

962
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:06,620
A lot of authored mythology

963
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,500
Mythology

964
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:08,300
Mm-hmm

965
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,760
Things like that

966
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,580
And as far as I know, I picked up, you know

967
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,660
I have a good memory

968
00:44:13,660 --> 00:44:15,820
And so I can remember a few real things

969
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,480
That you participated in

970
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:18,400
It's probably

971
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,500
There's probably more occult material

972
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,340
In a typical, uh, horror novel

973
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,140
That's, you know, selling millions of copies today

974
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,220
Than there is in, uh

975
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:29,060
And certainly more blood and violence

976
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:30,720
Than there is in, uh, Dungeons & Dragons

977
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:31,180
I see

978
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,740
So that's where you're gonna be going next

979
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:34,420
Into the, uh, horror and, uh

980
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,160
Death and maiming books, huh?

981
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,220
Well, um, let's stick to the Dungeons & Dragons, though

982
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:39,620
If we might

983
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:41,600
Just because we're about running out of time here

984
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,720
I wanna ask you a rather personal question

985
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,300
If we can get this personal

986
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:49,580
Where do you see your soul as going?

987
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:52,300
Is it going to go to the devil, then, basically?

988
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:53,820
Probably so

989
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:56,020
You know, I really don't know any Satanists

990
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:56,640
That's another one

991
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:57,800
I keep hearing

992
00:44:57,800 --> 00:44:58,080
Besides yourself

993
00:44:58,080 --> 00:45:00,200
Recently, I think it's become very popular

994
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:01,520
And I'm sure that if

995
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,120
Satanism

996
00:45:02,120 --> 00:45:04,400
If the, the particular devil is going to be a Satanist

997
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:04,400


998
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:04,400


999
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:04,400


1000
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:04,400


1001
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:06,780
The television medium keeps on hyping on it

1002
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:09,680
That a lot of the teenagers will have to pick it up

1003
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,380
Uh, Satanism?

1004
00:45:10,580 --> 00:45:11,740
Because the adults are saying

1005
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,320
Oh, this is terrible, don't do it

1006
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:13,660
Yeah

1007
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,440
And you know it's like waving a red flag to

1008
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:19,300
To children who are trying to establish their own identities

1009
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:20,000
And be different

1010
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,440
So you suggest we should tell them

1011
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:22,280
Do worship the devil

1012
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:24,040
So that they don't worship the devil, eh?

1013
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,520
That makes a lot of sense

1014
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:26,580
And I bet you'd really like that

1015
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,180
Hey, have you ever even been to church?

1016
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:28,780
Really?

1017
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:31,580
Actually, I, I knew some at one time

1018
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,040
Some Catholic priests

1019
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:33,800
Oh, you met some Catholics?

1020
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,240
Some other people? Oh, you met some Catholics?

1021
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:34,420
Some other people? Oh, you met some Catholics?

1022
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:36,980
That were, that were quite religious that played

1023
00:45:36,980 --> 00:45:38,140
That doesn't count though

1024
00:45:38,140 --> 00:45:40,400
Um, sometimes as clerics in fact

1025
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:40,920
Yeah, you know

1026
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,040
That was their character

1027
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:42,640
Uh-huh

1028
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,380
Um, it, it differs from group to group of course

1029
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,700
Because whatever the group decides

1030
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,760
They, you know, they all want to be somewhat, uh, you know

1031
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,540
Evil, and then they can play it

1032
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:54,560
That's fine with you, yeah

1033
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,980
But in reality, there is no real evil going on

1034
00:45:56,980 --> 00:45:57,720
Oh, no, no

1035
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:58,020
It's all just make-believe

1036
00:45:58,020 --> 00:45:59,540
Right, it's all make-believe

1037
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,520
And it's only when the people, the bodies start falling

1038
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,540
That you have to worry about it at all

1039
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:06,500
Well, uh, you've got a very interesting perspective on this game

1040
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:09,260
I gotta admit, in fact, uh, you know, if you want the author

1041
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,440
I'd, I'd suggest you a little bit, uh, loon

1042
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,800
But, uh, seeing how the money goes to you

1043
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:15,500
I can understand that sort of attitude

1044
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,020
Sure

1045
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,820
Although I guess all you're really concerned about is whether the

1046
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,480
The stock starts falling

1047
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:23,060
Because, uh, as long as those games are selling

1048
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,840
Well, then I guess, uh, a few, uh, dead in the street

1049
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,040
Aren't gonna matter very much, I suppose

1050
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,780
But, uh, just remember there's gonna be hell to be paid, pal

1051
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:32,680
And, uh, you're gonna be doing the paying

1052
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:33,460
If you know what I mean

1053
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:35,380
If you don't really think this stuff is bad for ya

1054
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:37,700
I'm not so sure that it isn't bad

1055
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:39,420
It's a good way to take a look at, uh

1056
00:46:39,420 --> 00:46:41,800
Well, what would it be like to be a desperado?

1057
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,200
Well

1058
00:46:42,200 --> 00:46:45,000
You know, a killer and a, and a hunted person

1059
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:47,420
Well, I'm sure they find out when they play your game

1060
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,220
And when they get hooked on it and go out and practice it on a few innocent victims

1061
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,660
But, uh, I'm very glad to say that this about winds it up

1062
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:58,940
For this exciting and informative segment of Prell Profiles

1063
00:46:58,940 --> 00:47:01,340
My guest, of course, has been Gary Gygax

1064
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:02,380
Uh, creator

1065
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,060
Uh

1066
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,280
Of Dungeons and Dragons

1067
00:47:04,740 --> 00:47:08,840
The, uh, role-playing game that, uh, teaches your kids how to kill

1068
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,940
Thank you for joining us, Mr. Gygax

1069
00:47:10,940 --> 00:47:14,860
And here's your own special Prell Profile paperweight

1070
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,440
That's my profile, Lester Donovan

1071
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,520
By the way, be sure to point that out to your fiends

1072
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:19,300
Er, uh, friends

1073
00:47:19,300 --> 00:47:21,120
Yes, thank you, Papa Prell

1074
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,380
Well, uh, yes, uh, yeah

1075
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,820
Hey, Papa Prell, thank you all for listening

1076
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,080
And God bless

1077
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:26,500
Yeah, the ugly, uh

1078
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,580
And I do mean God bless

1079
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:30,840
And God bless to you, too, cause you need it the most, let me tell ya

1080
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:33,040
The views expressed do not necessarily reflect the views of the show

1081
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:38,540
The views expressed do not necessarily reflect the opinions of the Board of Trustees, the staff and management, or those interviewed by KZSU

1082
00:47:38,540 --> 00:47:39,640
A few points may be

1083
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:45,100
Or, KNON, or any other station, uh, that might possibly be heard from

1084
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:46,280
You're back into the, uh

1085
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:48,740
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, God, there it went

1086
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:53,500
Well, friends, yeah, that was, that was, uh, Papa Prell

1087
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:58,360
My, uh, my, you know, quite an editing job there

1088
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:02,500
That was an easy one for me to play for 20 minutes, you see

1089
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,660
I didn't have to edit a whole lot and I just left him to do it

1090
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,020
Uh, yeah

1091
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,800
Papa Prell out of Stanford University

1092
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,340
I can't believe they let him be a pre... the Dean, I...

1093
00:48:20,580 --> 00:48:23,380
The Mister Science Lecture Series

1094
00:48:27,060 --> 00:48:29,120
Volume One, Number One

1095
00:48:29,120 --> 00:48:30,480
The Mutron

1096
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,480
Delivered by the Reverend Seed

1097
00:48:32,500 --> 00:48:35,580
Seth Deitch, First Church of Mr. Science, Boston.

1098
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,680
Outside the realm of conspiracy science,

1099
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,580
and in the clear light of the so-called forbidden sciences,

1100
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:45,180
we will find we have a far greater chance

1101
00:48:45,180 --> 00:48:47,480
of understanding the true nature of the universe.

1102
00:48:49,600 --> 00:48:53,620
We are told about matter and energy and space and time

1103
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:57,040
as being either consistent realities governed by laws

1104
00:48:57,040 --> 00:49:00,800
or as foggy abstracts that have no particular being

1105
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,240
outside of that of being convenient linguistic aids

1106
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:06,260
to make the whole thing easier to swallow.

1107
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,820
We at the Temporal Management Research Facility

1108
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,200
of the Church of Mr. Science of the Subgenius

1109
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,640
have through rigorous probing through mountains

1110
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,600
of existing but full-known works on the subject of time

1111
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,880
and its methods of control,

1112
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,660
have discovered the key for blowing the whistle

1113
00:49:21,660 --> 00:49:24,420
on the whole fraudulent twaddle that is modern science.

1114
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:27,060
This key is the neutron.

1115
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,520
The truth must now be told.

1116
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,680
How it was covered up for so long

1117
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,300
would make a story intriguing enough for a separate book,

1118
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,480
but it's too involved to be told here.

1119
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,060
The actual issue at hand is the neutron

1120
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,960
and its pivotal role in the management of the true cosmos.

1121
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:46,320
In order to properly understand the following,

1122
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:47,680
it must first be made clear

1123
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:50,120
what actually constitutes an elementary particle.

1124
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:53,600
The first of these basic particles is the electron,

1125
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:56,140
which has no mass but possesses a charge

1126
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,620
that is commonly described as possibly infinite,

1127
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:00,780
thus making it the fundamental unit,

1128
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:01,260
the unit of energy.

1129
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:03,960
It and other related particles,

1130
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:07,380
i.e. positrons, photons, gravitons, etc.,

1131
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:10,560
acting in concert make up the jacotismic field

1132
00:50:10,560 --> 00:50:12,560
which is responsible for holding everything

1133
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:13,740
that is anything together.

1134
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:17,980
The second is the much rarer infinite mass particle,

1135
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:19,800
commonly called a black hole.

1136
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,600
These particles, like the electrons, occupy no space,

1137
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:25,940
but the influence of a single particle

1138
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,780
can be felt at a much greater distance.

1139
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,780
They often have event horizons many miles away,

1140
00:50:30,780 --> 00:50:33,400
beyond which not even light can escape.

1141
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:38,680
The third fundamental particle is the neutron.

1142
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:42,680
The neutron carries with it an infinite temporal capacity

1143
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:45,900
that makes it alter the rate and intensity and general quality

1144
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,780
of the passage through time of anything it touches.

1145
00:50:49,300 --> 00:50:52,820
The neutron is very likely the rarest particle in this universe.

1146
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,320
As far as we know, there might well be only one of them,

1147
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,280
though there could be as many as a few dozen

1148
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,440
without generating a dangerous concentration

1149
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:00,760
which would be the most dangerous.

1150
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:00,760


1151
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:00,760


1152
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:00,760


1153
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:00,760


1154
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:00,760


1155
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:00,920
The second fundamental particle is the neutron.

1156
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:00,920


1157
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,720
and is known to be the most common of neutron phenomena.

1158
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:05,060
Section A.

1159
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:09,060
Just how fucking big everything really is.

1160
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:13,740
What we know is the universe can be envisioned as a giant atom

1161
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:15,860
with the black hole acting as the nucleus

1162
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:19,140
and the neutron or mutrons acting as the electron cloud

1163
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:21,500
with the electrons providing the energy

1164
00:51:21,500 --> 00:51:23,920
for the neutron to drive us forward through time.

1165
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,520
Just about everything else in the universe

1166
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,840
is just so much debris

1167
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,560
cluttering up the works of things.

1168
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:30,760
The fact that the universe is a giant atom

1169
00:51:30,760 --> 00:51:30,760


1170
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:31,880
and that there is one such atom

1171
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:34,240
more than suggests the existence of others.

1172
00:51:36,140 --> 00:51:38,840
The neutron has a corresponding antiparticle

1173
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:39,960
known as the tachyon

1174
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:42,220
which travels through time in a direction

1175
00:51:42,220 --> 00:51:43,700
which we perceive as backwards

1176
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:46,120
so that to someone who is not in the know

1177
00:51:46,120 --> 00:51:48,040
it will appear to exceed the speed of light.

1178
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,440
The simple fact of the matter

1179
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:53,040
is that tachyons are extra-universal mutrons

1180
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:54,280
impinging on our universe

1181
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,880
at a different temporal angle.

1182
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:58,800
These are the mutrons of atom universes

1183
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:00,760
that ours is in compound with.

1184
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:04,480
After this the atomic metaphor breaks down.

1185
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:12,700
No atom of mere matter

1186
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:14,500
divides itself into alternate cells

1187
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:16,880
almost constantly, but our universe does.

1188
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,700
All the time the universe splits

1189
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:21,540
in order to express every alternative

1190
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:23,900
open to any phenomenon transpiring within

1191
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,380
no matter how small

1192
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,420
or seemingly insignificant.

1193
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,320
This is the only way our minds

1194
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,520
can express the perception

1195
00:52:30,780 --> 00:52:31,560
of the fifth dimension

1196
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,360
or more properly the second dimension of time.

1197
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,200
So this introduces the concept

1198
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,580
of time viewed as a plane

1199
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:39,480
rather than a line.

1200
00:52:39,780 --> 00:52:41,820
But there is another dimension of space

1201
00:52:41,820 --> 00:52:43,680
so is the case with time

1202
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:45,980
there is also a corresponding up-down time.

1203
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,180
This is the direction in which

1204
00:52:48,180 --> 00:52:49,440
our mental eyes exist.

1205
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,620
In this direction we find alternate time tracks

1206
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:54,340
similar to the sidewise ones

1207
00:52:54,340 --> 00:52:56,000
with the difference being that

1208
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,980
theirs is oriented in the direction

1209
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:00,120
opposed to temporal gravity.

1210
00:53:00,780 --> 00:53:03,520
So that elements of those other selves

1211
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,180
are constantly falling into our awareness

1212
00:53:06,180 --> 00:53:06,700
from above.

1213
00:53:07,840 --> 00:53:10,520
The neutron passes through all these spaces

1214
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,040
with equal ease and is modulated by them

1215
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,780
much like the photon is modulated

1216
00:53:14,780 --> 00:53:16,840
by bouncing off or passing through matter.

1217
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,980
Thus information of a very subtle

1218
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:22,100
and distorted nature is conveyed to us

1219
00:53:22,100 --> 00:53:23,660
from our other universes

1220
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:24,820
on the neutron express.

1221
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:27,760
We call this information Gnosis

1222
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,100
and its influence has been felt

1223
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:30,760
by mankind since the beginning

1224
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:30,760


1225
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:31,700
of time and again

1226
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:33,800
for as long back as we have records

1227
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,640
and no doubt back to our very genesis and before.

1228
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:40,860
The earliest known neutron impact on earth

1229
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,160
occurred in the era of the dawn of life.

1230
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,360
The primordial sea teemed with

1231
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,620
the most primitive of bacteria.

1232
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:49,500
Their genetic material was a simple molecule

1233
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:50,980
shaped like a lumpy ladder.

1234
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:53,100
It was very chemically stable.

1235
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:55,380
The neutron passed through earth

1236
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,520
and spewed out a wake

1237
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,720
that left each and every molecule of DNA

1238
00:53:58,720 --> 00:54:00,160
twisted beyond recognition.

1239
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:03,460
In this state its stability was ruined

1240
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,580
and any force or random glitch

1241
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:07,160
that mother nature had to offer

1242
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,120
changed it somehow.

1243
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,740
Thus evolution had begun.

1244
00:54:12,880 --> 00:54:15,060
The vast majority of these events

1245
00:54:15,060 --> 00:54:16,760
however affect individual beings

1246
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,400
or objects.

1247
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,820
One such example is Great Britain's

1248
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:20,900
Stonehenge Monument

1249
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:24,260
which was not man-made as is popularly presumed

1250
00:54:24,260 --> 00:54:26,060
but is merely the material evidence

1251
00:54:26,060 --> 00:54:27,960
of a rather minor neutron splash.

1252
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:30,760
Certain great sages of the past

1253
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,240
and present have actually had

1254
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:34,140
mutrons pass directly through their crania.

1255
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:37,920
A partial listing of these select people

1256
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,960
will give an idea of the effects

1257
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:41,940
that may be expected of such an encounter.

1258
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:44,540
Gautama Buddha, the prophet Enoch,

1259
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:47,360
Ankh-Natan, Leonardo, William Beckford,

1260
00:54:47,500 --> 00:54:50,500
Alastair Fowley, Marcel Duchamp,

1261
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,860
R. Buckminster Fuller, Antonio Gaudi,

1262
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,740
Arnold Palmer, the list goes on.

1263
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,820
It's interesting to note that

1264
00:54:56,820 --> 00:54:58,600
J.R. Bob Dobbs is the only known

1265
00:54:58,600 --> 00:54:59,860
human being through whom a

1266
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:00,760
neutron has passed through the earth.

1267
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:00,760


1268
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:01,020
He has passed twice.

1269
00:55:01,600 --> 00:55:03,440
After going through the back of his head

1270
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,860
it was reflected by the mystic pipe of Dobbs

1271
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:08,240
back through his head for a double dose of gnosis.

1272
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,120
In the light of this particular view

1273
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:11,980
one might ask

1274
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:13,960
what about the Big Bang and all that stuff?

1275
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:16,620
Well, it seems that matter does not play

1276
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:18,860
a very big role in the actual nuts and bolts

1277
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:20,120
operation of the universe.

1278
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:22,380
In fact, we find that it is the case

1279
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,080
in about half the universe's sample

1280
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,560
that there is no matter at all.

1281
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:27,060
Section B.

1282
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:29,440
What we must do about all this.

1283
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,240
It is well known that the electron

1284
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,700
can be pressed into service for all kinds of uses.

1285
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,700
It might be less well known that

1286
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,600
alien civilizations of a level only

1287
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:40,400
slightly more advanced than ours routinely

1288
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,520
use the enormous power made available

1289
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:44,520
by tapping into the gravity fluxes

1290
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:45,540
of quantum black holes.

1291
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:48,920
It's also possible to use the time potentials

1292
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:50,720
of the neutron to our own great advantage.

1293
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,840
The neutron is not

1294
00:55:52,840 --> 00:55:54,860
subject to the same methods of coercion

1295
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:56,640
that we use to bend normal subatomic

1296
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:57,760
particles to our will.

1297
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,300
They are oblivious to matter and energy alike.

1298
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:02,600
The power of pure thought

1299
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,920
because of its intimate relationship with time

1300
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,540
does have some small effect.

1301
00:56:06,980 --> 00:56:08,860
Neutrons are attracted to areas

1302
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:10,680
of concentrated slackful enlightenment.

1303
00:56:11,260 --> 00:56:13,240
A neutron container accelerator

1304
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:14,840
could be charged with a neutron

1305
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,180
if enough slackful minds concentrated

1306
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:19,140
their energies around a scoop entrance

1307
00:56:19,140 --> 00:56:20,260
to the neutron accelerator.

1308
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:22,880
Once contained therein,

1309
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:25,180
it would take relatively little effort

1310
00:56:25,180 --> 00:56:26,560
on the part of these minds

1311
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,740
to maintain it in a stable state.

1312
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:28,360
The neutron is a circular path.

1313
00:56:29,020 --> 00:56:30,960
One purely technical problem

1314
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,820
facing this proposal is the size

1315
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:34,020
of the accelerator needed.

1316
00:56:34,520 --> 00:56:36,300
It is a property of the neutron

1317
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,960
that it will only travel in the most gentle of curves.

1318
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:41,160
The minimum diameter of a circle

1319
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:42,420
to be traveled by a neutron

1320
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:44,280
is approximately 1,000 miles.

1321
00:56:45,700 --> 00:56:47,640
Fortunately, we have easy access

1322
00:56:47,640 --> 00:56:49,200
to an extraterrestrial body

1323
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,040
more than three times that size

1324
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:52,260
Earth's moon.

1325
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:55,160
The accelerator could be built in a ring

1326
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,440
completely circumnavigating the lunar sphere

1327
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,360
about 100 feet below its surface.

1328
00:56:59,780 --> 00:57:01,980
Because of the mental effort that would run it,

1329
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:03,520
it would be known as the psychotron.

1330
00:57:04,300 --> 00:57:06,640
The psychotron would be a valuable tool

1331
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,660
in the use of practical time control.

1332
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,700
By accelerating the neutron

1333
00:57:10,700 --> 00:57:12,000
in one direction or another,

1334
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:13,780
the entire moon could be induced

1335
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,700
to follow it in whatever temporal direction

1336
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:16,680
it might be directed.

1337
00:57:17,160 --> 00:57:19,600
Forward, backward, sidewise, or up-down.

1338
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,800
Having this ability opens amazing possibilities.

1339
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:24,980
It is my proposal

1340
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:26,520
that this device be constructed

1341
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:27,740
for use in a major space project

1342
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,020
to concentrate high slack wisdom

1343
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:30,840
in this universe.

1344
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,580
The single most radiant personality

1345
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:36,700
among modern man is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1346
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,900
There are other alternate Bobs

1347
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:40,940
existing in other alternate time tracks.

1348
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,000
Not all of them are as prominent

1349
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,660
as our Bob,

1350
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,300
but still are privy

1351
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,540
to the same great gnosis.

1352
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:48,980
Others are already the rulers

1353
00:57:48,980 --> 00:57:50,540
of their respective Earths.

1354
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:53,060
All, though, are truly Bob.

1355
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:55,440
Imagine if we could travel

1356
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,060
to those alternative time streams

1357
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,820
and convince all of those Bobs

1358
00:57:58,820 --> 00:58:00,060
to return to our world.

1359
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,580
This is exactly what I am suggesting.

1360
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:05,340
The formation of the Congress of Bobs.

1361
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:07,940
Yes, my friends, this is our mission.

1362
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,060
Those who wish to donate

1363
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,480
to the Psychotron Project

1364
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,160
will be given a free ride

1365
00:58:13,160 --> 00:58:14,860
to the alternate world of their choice

1366
00:58:14,860 --> 00:58:16,440
once the project is complete.

1367
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:17,900
Thank you.

1368
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:20,180
The Mr. Science lecture series

1369
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:22,120
from Dr. Ahmed Fishmonger.

1370
00:58:22,740 --> 00:58:24,980
And you know, every subgenius show

1371
00:58:24,980 --> 00:58:26,980
is literally continuous

1372
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,360
with every other.

1373
00:58:29,660 --> 00:58:32,740
It eventually goes in one gigantic

1374
00:58:33,460 --> 00:58:34,540
Mobius strip.

1375
00:58:34,820 --> 00:58:36,460
Not a loop, but actually

1376
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:37,380
a Mobius strip.

1377
00:58:37,800 --> 00:58:39,280
Criss-crossing with itself

1378
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,360
at the center point,

1379
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,400
but looping back again

1380
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,980
at post office box 181417

1381
00:58:47,140 --> 00:58:48,540
Cleveland Heights,

1382
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:51,360
Ohio 44118.

1383
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,880
I'll give that number again.

1384
00:58:53,060 --> 00:58:54,960
Post office box 181417

1385
00:58:54,960 --> 00:58:54,960


1386
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:58,180
Cleveland Heights,

1387
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,040
Ohio 44118.
