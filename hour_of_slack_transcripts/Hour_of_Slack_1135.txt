Who is that?
Oh, that's the brunette who taught me how to move my lips.
A little torture on a loose lip?
Yeah, sing the torture song, Philo.
Well, that song's here again, but this time we get Bob's own version of it.
My yellow mommy.
Only two things in this world are possible.












The world is a world of death and taxes.
Our bodies act outside our control in terms of their process of decay, leading eventually
to death as well as in their behavior as we conduct our lives.
The need to exert control over our surroundings leads humans to attempt control over our bodies.
But notions of the physical integrity of the body seem futile, given that our bodies are
leaky bags of liquid from which all manner of things exude in an uncontrolled fashion,
reminding us that life lies outside our control.
The skin serves as a boundary, like that between our world and the supernatural one, in which
one side should not mingle with the other.
For this reason, religions are vitally concerned with issues of purity and pollution as they
relate to body fluids.
Contact with blood can make one impure, but drinking the blood of a god can aid salvation.
The never-ending quest to overcome our bodies' messiness and degeneration is the only way
to overcome religion.
As well as attempts to impose order on the uncontrollability of death itself, are half
of religion.
Everything else, that's the other half.
Thank you very much.
Carter and I have actually, we're gonna try something here sort of
Try it!
Well we try everything once.
You should try everything once by the way, I, I fully agree with this, you should try
everything once and some things you, you can keep trying.
There's a lot of things I like to keep trying.
Mm, I can think of a few.

about things I could keep trying.
I honestly hate the pulpit
because I'm a little more free,
but I was talking about things I like to keep trying.
And the eternity at last is this.

There goes newspaper.
It's all the people going down the scene.
Communism.
Communism.
In communist countries, they only have one newspaper.
Christianity is stupid.
In communist countries.
Communism is good.
But people can't decide what the government's going to do in the war zones.
And that's why I say this Bush man is a communist.
It's totalitarianism.
I'm amazed hearing that coming from a Texan.
It's the devil pretends to be good.
From a proletarian.
Meaning of the word proletarianism.
God.
Pretends to be a capitalist.
But it's communism.
Communism.
That is creeping into America.
Communism.
Yes.
Communism.
In a file of perspiration.
It's a commonist capitalism.
I think it's also called couch potatoism.
And the other muted hues.
Commons are coming.
And I feel that.
We are slipping slowly down the backslide.
Common.
Of other nations that have gone before.
It's common.
It is creeping.
Common men are everywhere in communism.
It is a form of Marxism, socialism, and all those other nasty, nasty words.
Common, come over here.

Communists and Nazis.
They're under my bed.
I like them there.
They're under every one of my beds.

I like those uniforms too.
Humans.
Humans.
Another low flyby.
We're still the next to go.
There's humans again.
Another number came up.
I think it was 45.
We will bring them down.
Someday their kind will fall.
And our kind shall rise up out of the ditches and the holes.
Like a phoenix.
Like a phoenix.









We shall swarm skyward and spew our mails from upon.
You're listening to No Veil Games, I see, but let the humans laugh at us now.
Our time is coming.
While they still have teeth and jaws and those tendons that go behind your chin and nostrils.

Yes.
We eat uranium and old rotten wires.
And we shall dispute them.

We shall displace the humans.
We will be the new conspiracists.
There's a worm.
You can evacuate so easily with just one fart.

Superstition everywhere.
Cult overcomes them partially.
Rainfall agriculture which allows loners.
Irrigation agriculture which favors community.
Division of labor plus exchange and trade bring mutual cooperation even outside the tribe.
The impulse is always there though.
Kill or enslave the outsider.
Gradual science from Athens is compact with reason.
Division of labor, trade, the mastery of knowledge plus time brought surplus,
sometimes a peaceful extended order.
Rules diversely evolved in the cooperation of strangers.
Always warring against the fierce default of tribalism, violence, and ignorance.
No one who teaches you knows what will happen.

So the human brain was designed, if I can use that word, by an engineer sitting at his desk,
trying to work on some problem, feel like he's in a rut, tweak our cognitive processes,

There's a, and I know for a fact, but I know for a fact

Today is a chance to celebrate National DOPS Day.
And I'm going to be a little bit more formal.

Every year in the United States, more than 150,000 love DOPS.
And in many different countries around the world.
One destination.
DOPS.
It's an act.
And children with special needs are especially hungry.
I'm proud that one of them is my husband.
Four out of every ten Americans has considered DOPS.

Thank you all for coming.
And we're pleased to join you on National DOPS Day.
And I know.
I want to thank the members of the National DOPS Coalition who've joined us.
Few missions in life are more rewarding.
You've shared it with others.
And in so doing, you've strengthened what is the very foundation of our country.
Drug addiction.
National DOPS Day also reminds us that nothing is more vital to this country's future.
DOPS rushed to the scene of the World Trade Center on September the 11th, 2001.
We want to thank you for coming.
Strangers, look into the joys.
I want to thank you all for coming.
Four, four, four, sinners, sinners, eeeeee.

And tell them I cried.
And tell them I died at the scene.
And when I die, don't pay the preacher for speaking of my glory and my fame.
Just see what the boys in the back room will have and tell them I sighed.
And tell them I cried.



And tell them I cried.
And tell them I died of the same.
For ages, the Church of Subgenius had a Dallas mailing address.
And why the move?
There's a painful story behind it.
Well, it became clear that what was happening in Dallas...
Dallas, as far as the conspiracy, had, you know, has a real serious headquarters in Dallas.
And they've just started to spread like a cancer.
We could tell that there was going to be no escape if we didn't get out soon.
From Dallas to Fort Worth, it became pure conspiracy.
Then it spread all the way to Austin.
Soon San Antonio will be engulfed.
And we just had to get while the getting was good.
Also, the most beautiful...
The most beautiful woman in the world lived in Cleveland Heights, Ohio.
Whammo!
I thought that was obvious to everybody, why we moved.
And then also there was that unfortunate matter of Jesus of Nazareth clumsily losing the P.O. Box in Dallas.
Well, but we had moved away from Dallas years before that happened.
We were keeping the old Dallas P.O. Box just to save those last few souls that straggled in.
But now they're lost.
Lost for good.
Unless they decide to look on the internet, type in the word subgenius on the internet,
suddenly it will...
All will come...
Lost.
True to you.
All will come clear.
What?
Subgenius.com.
Yes.
It's easy.
By the way, subgenius is spelled without an O.
Although, if you do misspell it, you will still get there because it happens so much.
It'll say subgenius.
You mean subgenius?
Subgeniaus.
Subgeniaus.
Yeah.
The plural is?
The plural is both subgeniuses and subgeni.
Subgeni.
Used alternately.
One of them is more affectionate than the other.
It's like octopuses and octopi.
Or ustadki too.
Right.
There you go.
Well, except in my...
I just use them...
I try to alternate.
There are some people who think that subgeni is like some cutesy word for one subgenius.
Like, I don't know.
Oh, he's a good subgeni.
That's another thing.
I would excommunicate them personally.
Yeah.
You can spot the poser so easily.
They don't put a quote on Bob.
They think frop is marijuana.
They, you know...
Hey.
Hey.
Did you know that Bob spelled backwards still says Bob?
Without the quotes.
So, how does one become excommunicated from the church?
It can happen.
And?
And?

Silence.
Silence.
We don't discuss...
We stop staying.
Anybody who's ever been...
Stop staying.
We don't discuss those cases.
To discuss them would be to include them.
But it has happened.
And maybe even bring them home.
Well...
But we try to...
It's never a formal kind of thing.
We just either...
We torture them.
Okay.
Or kill them or drive them away or something.
Yeah.
We make them go away.
Yeah.
It's a deprogrammer.
There's some...
I'll admit.
There's sometimes there are people who get...
They just get too into it.
We have to deprogram.
Yeah.
Because they forget that Bob is a short-duration personal savior.
And it needs renewal, actually.
Yeah.
From time to time.
Get away from it.
And recharge your...
The spring planting.
Get a little of Bob.
If you just plant a coiled steel spring in...
Oh, well.
It's really not even worth discussing, actually.
Hello, caller?
Hello, caller.
Are you on the air?
Ding!
Ding!

Ding!

It's calling season in hell on Pirate Cat Radio.
I'm in San Francisco in Los Angeles.
And on the internet at piratecatradio.com.
We're in the studio this evening.
Reverend Ivan Stang all the way out from Cleveland, Ohio.
Joining us here in the beautiful sunny skies of San Francisco.
Even at this late hour, the sun is bright.
We have Lloyd Mongoloid in the studio again this evening.
After an excellent Mongoloid-a-palooza show.
Yeah.
At 12 Galcom.
He's last Saturday night.
The rafters are still ringing.
Yes, yes.
And Dr. Hal.
Yeah.
In the studio this evening as well.
Yes.
I'm coming in on the odd-numbered days, it would appear.
And we also have puzzling evidence.
Yeah.
Wandering the dance hall.
Yeah.
Looking for girls.
On the wireless.
And K-Rob.
On the job.
Playing the dance music for us right now.
Giving us some Devo music.
Hello, you're on the air.
Yeah.
Yeah, welcome to the program.
Oh, hey.
Hey.
Uh, Dr. Sinister.
Oh, it's Professor Stang.
Yes.
Uh, hold on.
Let me turn my radio down like a good listener.
I had to turn my...
There we go.
...into something else.
So, the game's all here.
Uh, I...
Yeah, just as you picked up the phone, Princess Weave started hollering for me downstairs.
My brain got split into twain.
Oh, no, man.
There's a whole part of your brain just dedicated to, like, responding to your wife calling
for you.
Probably.
Probably.
Oh.
It's...
It's like...
There's probably, like, a unique part of the brain that only lights up when that happens
and, like, immediately triggers that, yes, dear.
It's also...
It's a quarter of a brain cell, but I only have a half a brain cell.
Oh, dear.
She has the other half.
Oh, dear.
Yeah, they say that when, uh, the idea of fawning, even, you know, you imitate a fawn
or a wounded deer produces an empathic, um, some sort of, uh, empathic thing in the breast
of the male.
Well, this is Princess Weave.
We are doe we're talking about.
Right.
Probably broke some windows in the house and some mirrors.
Then the noises.
She is a deer, though.
Ah, yes.
And I do fawn on her.
Oh, goodness.
I have to.
Oh, yay, yay, yay, yay.
But I want to.
Of course.
Of course.
I wanted to put up a bunch of balloons, like, um, you know, hydrocephalic balloons with,
um, Orson Welles.
Has...
He's doing, um, the telltale heart.
And he would be, like, real fat, you know?
Oh, never mind.
Some guy that I work with keeps calling me Orson Welles.
Well, he's attributing your...
Keeps calling me Orson.
...greatness, and he's also making fun of the fact that you're one-third his size
horizontally or vertically.
Could be.
Yeah, I don't...
I don't get that at all.
Me neither.
Maybe you actually appreciate the medium, which he thinks is silly.
You know, like, oh, okay, Orson Welles.
Orson Welles Radio.
Now, this is...
Yeah, this is somebody from my conspiracy job who calls me Orson.
Oh, maybe it's just...
As you can...
Well, Orson Welles was famous for doing a radio show that terrified everybody.
Yeah.
Caused a panic, and you do this radio show.
I haven't caused any panics yet, but I have terrified a few people.
I hope.
Yeah, I do.
You would certainly hope so.
And, uh, speaking of terrifying people, I just want to let everyone know that the views
and opinions expressed on this program are not those of WSB.
It's listeners at Cleveland State University.
That hasn't been said.
Are we supposed to say, then, that some of these ideas are endorsed by extraterrestrials
who have very little heart muscle or brain muscle that we would call normal?
I'm just not comfortable speaking for the extraterrestrials.
You know, I mean, I'll let them speak for themselves.
Hello, you're on the air.
Come on, then.
Out with it.
Telepathic extraterrestrials.
We got the whole message, and then they signed off.
Yep, yep, yep.
But I don't really understand the last part.
Did you, Professor Stang, did you get the last?
It was 128-bit encrypted.
No, I wear a special aluminum helmet all the time now.
See, I told you, though, they changed the frequency of the mind control rays.
The aluminum just acts as an antenna now.
You need to switch to copper.
Actually, that explains a lot.
If you have those fuzzy red slippers like the old ladies where you could put little copper balls
in the little pink fuzzy balls.
There you go.
But they work.
I mean, I'm not saying it's cosmetically a nice thing to do to your aunt or your uncle,
but it works.
And just so you know, I have been compensated for my endorsement of the little copper fuzzy ball.
For the last four years.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Now, Reverend Stang is going into the ancillary control room A.
He always goes over there.
I believe we have enough to fill ancillary control room A and B tonight.
Those are your two microphones, and these are my two microphones.
Oh, they've already seized their microphones.
Here's your three headphones.
If you would have brought your lovely roommate with you, that would have been a fine thing.
Three heads are better than one.
I made him the offer, but he had to refuse.
It's all so beneath him now.
Yes, but...
Who's beneath who?
Oh, you know.
Don't sexy stuff.
Hierarchy of subgenius doctrine.
Michael Pepe's always beneath everybody.
He's called the social cockroach.
...listen to me, and Gary the Broadfarm was envisioning a church without Michael Pepe.
How could anyone...
No!
How does he do that?
It's a shepherd's crook, not a hook.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.

I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.

I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I'm running on the...
I'm running on the parking ticket.
I'm running on the vaporous fume party ticket.
This is a church of truth without Michael Pepe.
Michael Pepe is a trick on subgeniuses.
Testify, Dr. Stang.
I am Bob.
I am the hope that a human can be Bob.
Actually, I proved that I was Bob a little while ago.
It was an astonishing revelation.
What?
Well, I know this is...
Everybody's Bob these.
But there's an actual series of legitimate connections which bring me to that spot.
Oh, really?
You're like seven steps from Bob.
I can go through it pretty quickly.
You remember Nixon and Watergate, of course.
Yeah, sure.
And you remember H.R. Haldeman?
Yeah, H.R. Bob Haldeman.
H.R. Bob Haldeman called himself Bob because his name was Harry Robbins Haldeman.
No!
So, if that...
No.
If you can call yourself Bob and that's your name, well, that's his name.
And so I can call myself Bob and so therefore I am Bob.
Bob!
Bob!
Is this yours?
No, it's his.
Thank you.
Is this your tooth?
Thank you.
You're a beautiful audience.
I just may be here all night.
Would you sign this, Bob?
Sign this.
Sign this, Maureen.
Those teeth marks are definitely the teeth of a...
Sign this.
Now sign this here.
My teeth marks cannot be duplicated.
They are a form of identification.
Take this, Bob.
I have leftovers from the last year.
Put your social security number there.
Just let me bite down on this and I'll be right there.
Phone number here.
Let me write my bike down.
Sign this, Bob.

Sign that.
Got to leave a bite mark here.
Yes, yes.
It's a bite residue.
And then I'm going to make a statement which will resonate throughout the corridors of history.
Pull up a microphone, young lad.
Hey, didn't we figure out that this is the 25th anniversary of this show?
Well, it was.
It already was.
We already all missed it.
It was in June.
It was June.
It was 25 years ago.
The leafy month of June.
You know, we missed...
What show in June was the one that was the closest?
The 20-year anniversary of Bob's death.
I mentioned it during the show, actually.
It was the 22nd?
It was the 25th of 82.
That was an excellent...
It's a first show.
That was an excellent show.
That was an excellent show.
That was the best time, Bob.
That was the best time.
Last year at this time, we were preparing for X Day.
So we had a show this summer that was the 25th anniversary.
It was the...
We didn't even know it.
Well, no.
I mentioned it a couple times during the show.
But not then.
It never went nowhere.
Nobody cared.
Oh, it's going to Iraq.
I just sent a rise to Iraq.
Back then we mentioned it.
Really?
I arrived.
I arrived.
I arrived in Iraq.
I got a rise to Iraq, too.
I got my...
You got a rise to Iraq?
I got a nephew.
I got a nephew-in-law over there.
He's a captain of the Marine Corps.
He wants some DVDs, so I...
He wants his country back?
DVDs.
Yes, so I made a DVD of a rise.
Yeah, he wants me to tell you...
He's got a rise out of him, eh?
You've got to quit calling him and making him talk about his brother, his son, what
got killed over there and...
I never called him a jackass.
Now, you guys will be interested to know that the church has been selling memberships
to...
Oh, yeah.
...the military people at a record rate.
Oh, right.
Yes.
Once the U.S. military is in our grasp, world domination will be...
Yeah, military people are joining up.
Why are they joining the church?
That might be the question you would ask.
Why are the...
It's...
Everybody's coming back to the church.
It's sort of like a...
President Bush said there's no subgeni in Iran.
The soldiers.
What do you think of that?
God bless our boys.
That's Akhman on a dinner jacket.
He said that.
Back to the church bowels.
Join the subgenius army.
Your feet shall never stray.
Once on the narrow righteous path, you follow night and day.


Getting the boot again and again.
You can hone your toenails.
Going to the refrigerator to fetch a snack for me.
To hone your friend's toenails.
Yes.
Atomic French toenail toast.
From sea to shining sea.
So, is this the subgenius old folks?
Tom?
This is what it's going to sound like.
This is going to be an endless, mad, and chattering tea party.
There's the...
Guitar, guitar, guitar.
...door mouse over there and...
Spectacular!
Spectacular!
There's the hypno-toad.
What?
Whom we all obey.
And Cleve, look.
There's me then.
What do you love the hypno-toad?
Cleveland?
City of Light?
I love the hypno-toad too much.
The Hypno-Foat.
The towel was Cleveland.
It's a hypno-Foat.
It's a hypno-Stangman.
It was snowing when I left.
I'm telling toxic waste.
You talk into this end and it hypnotizes you.
Can't beat the classic.
Hello?

Can't put the phone down.
Hello?
Testing.
Testing.
You just keep punching buttons.
You're hypnotized.
Testing.
One, two, three.
Test.
One.
Test.
Two.
Hello?
Hello?
You can't identify yourself.
No.
You can't identify yourself on the Hypno-Foat.
It's not a test.
It's not a test.
Stop.
It holds you.
It retrieves you.
It retrieves you.
And pass them to the left.
It does not disturb you.
Put your pencils down.
It generates voice mail.
Good heavens.
It sounds overloaded over the phone.
It's a multiple choice radio.
And so you had to join in.
Douglas, stop.
It sounded overloaded so you join in.

Oh no!
It's definitely overloaded.
Hello, Philo.
Hello.
I'm surely going to fail next time.
I'm sure you're going to fail next time.
I'm sure you know you're not living up to the potential I know you have.
You've got to knuckle down and buckle to it.
You only get one chance in this life.
And remember, you don't want to affect your permanent, indelible record.
So enjoy today as if it's yesterday.
All right, that's it.
Because don't forget that yesterday is today.
You've got Towsel Head and Knuckle Head.
Good.
And you've got a second chance at life.
Oh, really?
Yeah.
Where do I sign?
Where do I...
How can I get a second chance at life?
On the dotted line on that check, my friend.
Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
So you can relive those days of starting yesterday.

It's about time.
Can I pick the player?
I know just what I'm going to do this time around.
And it's all going to be different.
Tomorrow is like yesterday, except in the future.
What?
You can't be me.
I'm going to be me.
Or am I?
I'm going to be me.
Who am I?
Who am I?
Who am I?



You're going to be me.
I've got to be me.
It's going to be me.
It's going to be me.
Once I've taken a pee.
You've got to be me.
Oh, I'll just do take care of that, partner, and I'll just go on being me.
I've got to be me.
How many religions are here?
Well, there are...
One.
Let's count off.
Let's count off.
One.
Two.
One.
One.
One.
One.
One.
One.
One.
One.

One.
One.
One.
One.
The one true religion is one that all religions believe in.
It's like a niche.
We've got our special niche is for former Jewish people, for former Moody's, for former
Mormons, for former Catholics, for former extreme snake jugglers, former Baptists, for
Methodists.
That's right, Sergeant Hal.
That's right.
the church of the sub-Jainer, so that makes another church that is present among us.
But then there's the church of the sub-Nenslow, which Jainer could join if he had any money.
Nenslow.
Great and mighty Nenslow.
The church of the penniless.
I heard a webcast of Sophrono's The Intellectual and Fawkes.
The church of the penniless do bad.
The church of the penniless do bad.
The fair humanities of old religion.
The church of the penniless do bad.
The power of the beauty and the majesty.
That would be a, there's a lot of people that would call Fawkes.
The church of the penniless do bad.
We've got another one to follow up.
It's not a money-making idea like that.
Man, I can crank them out.
But there would be a lot of joiners.
The church of the penniless do bad.
Yeah, but it wouldn't be very profitable by definition.
The forest by slow stream.
I mean, the church of the sub-Genius is bad enough.
Right, right, you're right.
We've got to start thinking of these religions.
How about the church of the 99th century?
It actually has some income-producing potential.
The original cool guys, that's it.
We'll make a million bucks.
Yeah, yeah, but we'll piss everybody off.
How about the 99th century?
We mentioned that.
See, they won't speak to us.
How about the 99th century?
I'm not talking to him.
Yeah.
The 99th century.
The 99th century.
Oh, oh.
The 99th century.
I have a question for Reverend Stang.
Here's a question for Reverend Stang.
Ask Dr. Stang.
Let him through, let him through.
Why don't you, I've got an idea.
Why don't you ask the caller what his question is.
Say, caller, what is your question?
That's my question.
Uh-oh, caller panic.
Go, caller.
It's your turn.
Cat got your tongue?
I guess the caller, you know sometimes when you have to step up to the mic and you get a lump in your throat and your knees knock together and you get water on the brain and tongue tied and a little bit twisted around inside.
Just start talking.
I'm just going to do sound effects.
Don't listen to the radio.
Lungs punctured.
Listen to the phone.
The hearty high-o's-ver.
The Lunger.
Nowhere in the pages of history can one find the Lunger.
Let's go and hear what he has to say.
He's going into the general store.
Something ought to be done about it.
Later the same day, the Lunger showed signs of nervousness.
Bob likes raw meat.
Yeah.
Bob Brown now.
You better get him.
You better investigate.
He may run into trouble.
Bob smelled food.
Not bad.
Yeah.
There's something familiar about him.
That's the Lunger.
He's found us.
No.
He's the best friend the West ever had.
I don't believe you.
He's a Lunger.
So, uh, so what's the deal?
How come you're so late?
You know, I mean, I...
Again.
But you know, or I'll get a fourth, and then maybe I have to come back at day four, that's
good.
Oh, uh, so, yeah, haven't you?
I don't really know.
But what am I supposed to tell you?
You are a non-Integral.
You wereاطhe killing I do not know, dude.
Lunger Alexandra Oss and a lot of nonsense.
I wouldn't believe they put up with the Lunger on this planet.
It is between me and we starving as jungle poppers.
I don't know.
SiI?
Huh?
Now I'm gonna wrap it up with what?
Damn it to hell fire.
Turkey.
Turkey.
Indescribable agony.
Hmm.
Oh, uh, turkey.
Turkey.
Turkey.
Turkey.
I would prefer not to.
I would prefer not to.
I would prefer not to.
Turkey.
I would prefer not to.
Turkey.
Turkey.
I would prefer not to.
I would prefer not to.
I would prefer not to.
Turkey.
Blissful normality.
Turkey.
Some shameful act of moral turpitude.
I would prefer not to.
I would prefer not to.
I would prefer not.
I preferred not to.
Turkey, you must begin to be perverse.
Sniff.
Ahem.
I would prefer not to.
I would prefer not to.
Turkey, I would prefer not to.
Turkey, I would prefer not to.
Guns. Guns.
Thank you for tuning in today.

Bye-bye.
The harsh government gives tax breaks to companies that move jobs offshore.
In the face.
Remove all troops.
Doesn't happen.
I worry about my camp.
I'll be around.
And I am...
Red, red, red, red, red, red.
Picks a steady hand.
You don't have healthcare.
You don't have a pension.
You're on your own.
And you will have nothing.
You will have nothing.
I don't have to wake up every day.
Not now.
Not ever.
We believe in some things.
Move jobs offshore.
