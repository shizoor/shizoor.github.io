1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,320
And I want you to be free!

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:07,720
Slavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money, slavery, money, everything you have of God.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,320
Right.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:14,540
Slavery, money, slavery, money, there's a lot of guys that wouldn't really make it in a lot of other venues.

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:18,460
But I'd get a small church to be nice to some people, so I actually got a little.

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:22,320
Test, test, test, are we on the air?

7
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,340
Are, is this working?

8
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:25,260
What?

9
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,640
We're finally here!

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,880
Welcome to Subgenius Radio.

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,320
Hour of Black.

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,200
Long to advise the church of Subgenius Radio.

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,880
Could it be now?

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:44,180
Hey, you know what?

15
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,500
He's on my radio wave there.

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,060
Copping that onto Hour of Black.

17
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,720
You're copping that onto Hour of Black?

18
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:52,520
Could it be now?

19
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:54,160
I was making Hour of Black tonight.

20
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:54,760
Yeah.

21
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,460
On tape, and I was using it.

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,720
Last week's tape.

23
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:06,880
You put the tape, you put the tape between your knees, and you take the little razor blade and spin it with a little spool between your knees, or do you just, just hack away?

24
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:14,440
Well, I put it between my knees, and then I slowly kind of creep it up lower and closer to me.

25
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,920
And then I, and then, that's when the curtain opens.

26
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:20,980
And it blasts me.

27
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:25,360
You are about to experience the awe and mystery of which reaches the sky.

28
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,220
And then I can't look my way.

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,260
And then I can't look my way.

30
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,380
And then I can't look my way.

31
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:28,380


32
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:31,140
And it's, it's usually blasting people for me.

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:31,760
Remember him?

34
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,720
Yes.

35
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,040
I'm glad you do.

36
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,700
I do remember Fred blasting people for me.

37
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,200
Oh.

38
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,000
Oh.

39
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:50,620


40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,320
Oh.

41
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,260
Remember.

42
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,720
Remember.

43
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:54,720


44
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,640
It's captured my take away .

45
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,100
No!

46
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:03,160
Well, good night all,ful and well.

47
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:05,320
Get out yourself.

48
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,320


49
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:05,760
Make my classes.

50
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:05,760


51
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:05,760


52
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:05,760


53
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:06,820
Ask any question you have.

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,800
I'll give you anything.

55
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,540
eternal salvation in heaven.

56
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,420
And that scared the hell out of me,

57
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:30,160
the thought of going to heaven for all eternity.

58
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,960
I knew there had to be a better answer.

59
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,660
That was a Bill T. Miller's horrible sound effect.

60
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,160
Unfortunately, Bob was...

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,320
I don't know what else is going on here.

62
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,980
So it's an alternative to the alternatives

63
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,820
that we've been told had no alternatives.

64
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,200
No, they want to drag you kicking and screaming.

65
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,580
If you died, you could go to, like, war.

66
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,120
No, I'm just kidding.

67
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,500
We all know that the surface of the earth

68
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,020
is a scourge of demons.

69
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,140
This is the only religion that offers you

70
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:58,020
two separate escape vessels in the sex.

71
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:00,180
One while you're still alive,

72
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,260
and another one after you die.

73
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,100
Now, to qualify for the one while you're still alive,

74
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,480
it's real cheese.

75
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,660
Oh, wait a minute, we've forgotten to do something.

76
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,360
We've got to start the show, Bleepo.

77
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,580
You can't hardly do one of these shows

78
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,200
without a puzzling evidence introduction.

79
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:18,440
We just...

80
00:03:18,440 --> 00:03:21,120
Without puzzling evidence, there's no radio.

81
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:25,280
So turn your radio on and put your feet up.

82
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:26,060
Relax.

83
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:27,340
Sit back.

84
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,280
Get a cup of coffee.

85
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,520
Wear your comfy old bedroom slippers.

86
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,340
Maybe a tattered but familiar bathrobe.

87
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,960
A fat, purring cabby cat

88
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,480
stretches out on your lap.

89
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,020
And you're comfortable

90
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,160
listening to the continuous broadcast

91
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,540
of the show.

92
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,440
It's about the year 2001.

93
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,780
It's no time for fun.

94
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:52,880
Shut down.

95
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,020
Turn a knob.

96
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,420
Okay.

97
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,880
They shouldn't be so lucky.

98
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,460
Their world is in a land of...

99
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:03,240
Save Bob, save Bob, save Bob, save Bob.

100
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
No, Y2K.

101
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,240
He's in serious condition, Jack,

102
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:10,000
and they don't know if he'll live or not.

103
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,680
Now, just minutes ago, we learned the name of the suspect

104
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,860
from Frank Ryan of the NYPD.

105
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,320
His name is...

106
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,100
Next day.

107
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:20,860
Dumbfuck.

108
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,820
I killed him.

109
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:22,000
Dumbfuck.

110
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:22,880
It was my fault.

111
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,620
I'm bad luck.

112
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,740
He said I could.

113
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,960
He said I could kiss him.

114
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:30,320
He said he could.

115
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:30,540


116
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,860
He said he could.

117
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,840
I'm standing right behind him.

118
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,740
From outer space.

119
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,500
So I'm shoot Bob.

120
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,000
You pump a couple of drugs and pipe dreams

121
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,060
and what happens, they come gunning for people like Bob.

122
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:42,740
Just in case.

123
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,360
You must kill the truth.

124
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,380
After the attack on Bob's life,

125
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,260
the media outcry is unprecedented.

126
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,260
And while you're at it...

127
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:51,820
His face echoes across the American...

128
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,320
...dialectual landscape.

129
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:52,960
The one we're already on.

130
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,020
On the covers of magazines,

131
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:54,900
in newspapers,

132
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,440
and on television news broadcasts.

133
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:57,880
This is the last chance not to screw up.

134
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,000
Bob would die.

135
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,660
One week after the shooting,

136
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,760
word comes that Bob will be released

137
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,080
and transported to Pennsylvania

138
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,800
by medevac helicopter in time for the election.

139
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,380
He's coming from the back.

140
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,300
He's coming from the back.

141
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,680
He's coming from the back.

142
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:10,440
What is he doing?

143
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,120
What is he talking about?

144
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,500
We are five.

145
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,060
We are five.

146
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,440
We are five.

147
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,940
We are five.

148
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:18,840
We are five.

149
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,400
We are five.

150
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:19,920
We are five.

151
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,160
We are five.

152
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,580
We are five.

153
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:21,040
We are five.

154
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:21,800
We are five.

155
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,040
Where are he from?

156
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:22,400
We don't know.

157
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:22,400


158
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:24,500
Shoot him quick.

159
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,120
There's a rocket.

160
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:35,880
I didn't have the identity.

161
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,820
Something has happened.

162
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,660
Something has happened.

163
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:42,300
Shoot the car.

164
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:47,960
One being hit in the ένα

165
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:51,800
Shoot the car.

166
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,760
blood-rusting heart, friend.

167
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,180
It was terrible, but when they explained that crowd,

168
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,060
I got into that man.

169
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:57,180
Kill Bob!

170
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:58,580
I can't believe it!

171
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,440
I can't believe it!

172
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,760
Friend, are you ready to kill Bob?

173
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,220
We've run into some serious Bobbies in this thing

174
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,300
this time around.

175
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,240
People who, oh, they love Jack and Bob Dobbs.

176
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:12,300
Tom and Richard, who actually edited...

177
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,440
Well, they should, but...

178
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,660
The documentary portions of what I'm about to play...

179
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,940
Bob, as damn well they better.

180
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,720
But how do they prove they love Bob?

181
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,380
How do they prove they trust Bob?

182
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,000
Not by what proves they love Bob.

183
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,920
They'll spout Bob's sacred dogma.

184
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,660
They'll spew out lines.

185
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,160
They'll make up cute stories about Bob.

186
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,080
But are they ready to actually kill that thing

187
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,260
they love so much?

188
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,940
That's the one difference between this religion

189
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,260
and all of the others.

190
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:46,620
It is the most trained friend.

191
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:47,840
You've got to love that man, Bob,

192
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,740
and you've got to be ready to break your mind

193
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:49,920
for the next one.

194
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,900
He's got to be free from his insidious mind control.

195
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,680
Oh, yeah.

196
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:57,340
You can't sing over Captain Beefheart that way.

197
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,700
Just like the Heaven's Gate people

198
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:01,240
did their farewell video,

199
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,480
this will save me time.

200
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,740
God, I'm sure I talked to my mom and dad are saved.

201
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:09,600
My brother and sister,

202
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,100
and a lot of friends of mine,

203
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,200
and even a lot of subgeniuses,

204
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:18,000
including some of my best subgenius old buddies

205
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,620
and collaborators

206
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:19,920
that never actually sent me a message.

207
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,020
They're $30 in.

208
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,500
Like I did last year.

209
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,260
Well, friends, it's true.

210
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,260
Bob can mean slack,

211
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,440
and of course he can also contain it.

212
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,180
It's like casting off your old shoes

213
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:34,940
and putting on new ones.

214
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,800
It's not like anybody's going to really die.

215
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,940
You'll still be around after the exes

216
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:43,220
or the robo-beasts

217
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,700
or whatever the vengeful subgeniuses

218
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:49,260
have stripped away your house and your body.

219
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,480
In a way, you're not really leaving,

220
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,380
you humans and pinks and relatives of mine.

221
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,420
You're just entering a new,

222
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:58,580
you're stepping over into a bigger world,

223
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:59,740
a more open world.

224
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,080
I feel sorry for the friends of mine

225
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,880
who never bought a membership.

226
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,340
I've always tried to expose them

227
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,520
gently to Bob's word,

228
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,840
not to force it down their throats,

229
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,920
not mail them pamphlets constantly.

230
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,660
I have turned some people to the church.

231
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,240
I am very proud of those people.

232
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,220
I look forward to greeting them on the saucers.

233
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:19,560
You know?

234
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,740
But it's kind of sad that my mother,

235
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,000
who really is a wonderful person,

236
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,420
never did buy that membership.

237
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,560
Then again, I don't know what she would make

238
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,420
on the saucers.

239
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,060
And of course, there are my enemies.

240
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,840
I do have people in my life

241
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:35,460
who have hurt me for no particular reason

242
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,080
all the way back in high school.

243
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,900
And once I get my memory editing,

244
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,820
I'll be able to remember who you all are.

245
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,900
And I probably will have specific tribulations

246
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:45,540
set aside just for you.

247
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,160
And that's just my slack, and I'm afraid there's nothing

248
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,260
you can do about it now.

249
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:54,820
It's been difficult during all this time to be patient,

250
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,240
but I knew that if I just persevered,

251
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:02,100
I'd be able to say goodbye from above, from the saucers.

252
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,520
And Buck, it's almost full now.

253
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,060
I just want to thank those that supported me.

254
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,500
I come from a long line of Jesus.

255
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,040
They imparted to me the values that have gotten me

256
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:11,700
where I am today.

257
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:14,420
And it's all the normals and all the pinks

258
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,620
and all the bobbies and the orbs and the normals

259
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,720
that have tried to wear me down.

260
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,000
You're a bunch of idiots, you know?

261
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:19,860
Selling the balls.

262
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,920
You better hurry if you've got anything left to say to me.

263
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,520
I'm on my way out.

264
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:25,440
Bye.

265
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,540
So long.

266
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:27,660
Oh, wait.

267
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:29,840
But that's what we were getting paid to be idiots.

268
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,320
I wasn't getting paid to be an idiot.

269
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,380
I was getting paid to be a fool.

270
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,400
He's a real idiot.

271
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:34,660
He can't see.

272
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,220
He can't see.

273
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,200
The rest of us all get paid real good for being idiots.

274
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:43,220
I feel sorry for those smart people who have to pay instead

275
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,340
just to hear that they're idiots.

276
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,140
To hear a bunch of stupid things.

277
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,840
To hear a bunch of flesh-grabbing, cracking idiots.

278
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,980
I feel sorry for those intelligent people.

279
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,820
I really do.

280
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,800
Think how disturbing it must be to go through life

281
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,380
so painfully aware of...

282
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:02,640
God, earthquake!

283
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:03,680
That's right.

284
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,180
Christ!

285
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,800
It's a sign!

286
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,500
It's a sign.

287
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:09,840
We're being punished!

288
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:11,600
We must have done the right thing!

289
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,200
He must be happy with us!

290
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:15,260
You're never happy with anybody.

291
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,820
What the hell are you talking about?

292
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,440
You've got such a bunch of babies.

293
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,480
You're not so juvenile.

294
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:21,160
You're pre-juvenile.

295
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,660
You're infantile.

296
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,540
No, you're pre...

297
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:23,900
Who are you?

298
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,120
You're fetal.

299
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,820
No, you're pre-fetal.

300
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,320
You're spermatozoic.

301
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:31,280
No, you're gleaming daddy-zioic.

302
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,660
No, you're so infantile.

303
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:33,960
Where was Letterman?

304
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:34,800
How come he didn't have this?

305
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,620
In any case,

306
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,180
Brian White,

307
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,280
Mrs. DeSolar,

308
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:38,860
you're genetic.

309
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,980
You're tiredly...

310
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,940
We just might have the answer for him.

311
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:43,760
It's called the church of the sub-fuel.

312
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:44,480
It was genetic humor, ma'am.

313
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,160
And it's truly on a level of its own.

314
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,380
Genetic humor's done him in, ma'am.

315
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:49,720
It's not pornography, officer.

316
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,240
It's empowerment.

317
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,380
It's poor-natured genetics.

318
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,820
It's poor-natured genetic empowerment.

319
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:58,840
Once you get a hold of your genitalia,

320
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,160
and you can feel that power surge backwards,

321
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:01,820
you know you're going on, man.

322
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:07,060
So join the church of the sub-genius, friends,

323
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,040
and meet your planned destiny.

324
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:13,580
As Dr. Alice A.D. once said,

325
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,320
slavery under dogs is pretty much the same.

326
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:16,920
And that's what we're talking about.

327
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:17,340
And that's what we're talking about.

328
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,340


329
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,340


330
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,340


331
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:17,340


332
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:26,520
Now, we don't seriously expect anybody to understand dogs.

333
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,640
And whoever claims to is lying.

334
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,000
Once a guy accused us of being devil-worshers,

335
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,100
according to the Great National Socialism.

336
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,440
A once-guy accused us of being devil-worshers

337
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:42,720
just because we said we think Christianity as it exists today

338
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,840
is the one-world anti-Christ system predicted in the Bible.

339
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,060
Oh, no!

340
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,060
Oh, no, we're not supposed to even know

341
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,800
that the adversary is not some grimy weirdo

342
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,460
cranking out crackpot rants in a filthy attic,

343
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,780
or a cult leader wearing mystic symbols

344
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,840
on an afternoon TV talk show.

345
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,700
We're not supposed to know

346
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,440
that the maniacal hatchet fiend

347
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,720
is that quiet, harmless person

348
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,640
who brings us such lovely vegetables

349
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,960
from their miraculously well-fertilized garden.

350
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:15,020
And believe it or not, plenty of pieces,

351
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:16,240
4,000 of them so far,

352
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,460
every day have already joined up.

353
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,040
Suddenly the joke has become serious and profitable.

354
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,500
Your standard religious rip-off, right?

355
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,960
But can anybody take this stuff seriously?

356
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:30,380
As Bob says, we offer eternal salvation

357
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:33,440
for triple your money back.

358
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,480
And there is no other religion that offers that deal.

359
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,440
The tenfold escalation of horrible death

360
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:40,360
in the direct vicinity of our plant

361
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,880
has anything to do with the black sludge

362
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,520
leaking out of our waste dump

363
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:45,700
onto the playground

364
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,080
of the elementary school.

365
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,300
Oh no!

366
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,420
No!

367
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,960
We're not supposed to know that!

368
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,580
But we do know it!

369
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,900
And once you know something,

370
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,620
you can't unknow it!

371
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,240
No matter what you do,

372
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,520
you can only spend the rest of your life

373
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,880
wishing you could forget.

374
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,120
Hello friends.

375
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,560
And welcome.

376
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,760
The sermon tonight is entitled

377
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,860
A TIE.

378
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,760
It shows what I think of public education.

379
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,920
And, you know, I really was a very lonely person.

380
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:21,240
And finally got a boyfriend

381
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,780
who was a member of the church

382
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,640
that I'd been for two or three years.

383
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,240
And he showed me the pamphlets and I said,

384
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,460
This is it!

385
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:31,040
Where have these damn people been all these years?

386
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,220
I broke up with this girl.

387
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,280
We had a parting of the ways.

388
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,240
And I basically

389
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,880
degenerated this time

390
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,840
into a state of total flatness.

391
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,920
I was riding around on my motorcycle

392
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,020
like a nutcase.

393
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,920
Just hoping that somewhere

394
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,460
there was something

395
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:48,080
that would take me off.

396
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,020
And, uh,

397
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,360
one day a car started chasing me

398
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:52,920
through a thunderstorm.

399
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:54,660
A sailor's riding around the army.

400
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,460
Bruce Willis blowing away the terrorists!

401
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,060
And, uh,

402
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,380
I thought I got away from the guy,

403
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:03,020
but he caught up to me a couple of miles later

404
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,500
and he got out of his truck and I was like,

405
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,980
Yeah, I didn't get to get two guys behind, right?

406
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,500
Well, he comes up to the office

407
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,460
to let me join a motorcycle club.

408
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:12,600
And I'm like,

409
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,900
Oh, we're no different from the Romans.

410
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,680
Made a mission to Coliseum

411
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,540
to watch slaves murder one another.

412
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,380
The only difference is

413
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,940
we paid Hollywood to build it

414
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,460
to make sure no one really gets there.

415
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,580
So we can walk out on the pier

416
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:28,880
and not feel guilty about our animalistic business.

417
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,520
Not!

418
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,380
But we are animalistic!

419
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,460
And we have animalistic instincts!

420
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:36,040
Giving is like,

421
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,300
what is like pornography!

422
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,360
We all like to party

423
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,540
and still fight the mission and all that.

424
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:43,580
That's weird.

425
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,540
You're stupid, you know.

426
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:47,460
That stuff is the way things are.

427
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:48,700
It's not the way you see it on TV.

428
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,740
In sociology class at Farragut High School,

429
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,500
I was being nice with him all the time,

430
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,360
Deborah L. turned around and said,

431
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,480
My boyfriend wanted me to give you this.

432
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,020
And she held up this weird poster

433
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,600
with these three funny faces on it.

434
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:04,180
And it said,

435
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:07,380
Sin is sacrilege and society for the bizarre.

436
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:10,880
Send one dollar to the Subgenius Foundation.

437
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:11,700
That's it.

438
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:11,820
I thought,

439
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,880
that's kind of weird.

440
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:14,620
It only costs a dollar.

441
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,960
I'll just go ahead and do that.

442
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,000
I got a pamphlet in the mail.

443
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:18,980
Well, that's pretty funny.

444
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:22,020
I showed it to my buddy Scott Kaye.

445
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,380
And he thought it was real funny.

446
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,400
He sent in his ten dollars to join up.

447
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,260
He got his membership pack back.

448
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:29,520
And there it said,

449
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:30,880
membership, twenty dollars.

450
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,340
So I figured,

451
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,640
man, if it's gone up from ten to twenty dollars

452
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,280
in this past week,

453
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,940
I better join quick.

454
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,320
So I sent in my twenty dollars.

455
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:38,260
It was in 1982.

456
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:41,500
The church first stumbled into my life

457
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,360
in 1981.

458
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,460
I was reading an underground comic

459
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,620
by Robert Crumb called Weirdo.

460
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,220
And there was an ad in the back pages,

461
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,580
The World Ends Tomorrow and You May Die.

462
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,780
It sounded like a good prospect to me.

463
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,380
And now it's almost tomorrow.

464
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,940
And it's been seventeen years

465
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:02,360
that I've had the Church of the Subgenius in my life.

466
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,520
At first,

467
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,160
at first it wasn't.

468
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,720
You know,

469
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,900
it's up to them if they can't take a joke.

470
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,540
Pull the wool over your own eyes

471
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,640
and relax in the safety of your own delusions.

472
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:13,480
There was something,

473
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,440
something much deeper

474
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,540
and more life affirming

475
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,500
than I'd even realized.

476
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,120
Well, you're going to need a divorce.

477
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,800
And that will make a wedding seem cheap in comparison.

478
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,540
We have any takers?

479
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,640
We borrow beer.

480
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:27,240
They're cheap.

481
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,280
So cheap that the government has to help all of them.

482
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:32,480
The prostitutes are bad for business.

483
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:33,940
They don't pay taxes

484
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,600
and the government doesn't get their cut.

485
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,860
It's the same thing with Kelly McBride.

486
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,540
Yes,

487
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:42,700
that's the entire purpose of it

488
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:43,540
as far as I know.

489
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,780
It's just because people look funny.

490
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:48,860
Amateur wrestlers look real funny sliding around.

491
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:49,860
You just go to the beer,

492
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:51,280
why are you taking it?

493
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,680
Everything's the same.

494
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:53,780
You're on a ride?

495
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:56,620
Just don't try to get your rocks off.

496
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,620
It's a good thing you can't see this footage on the radio

497
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,040
because it would be

498
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,220
not for children.

499
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,480
Some of these lovely people

500
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:11,180
are subgenius ladies and men.

501
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:15,240
They didn't want to get their clothes all bloody.

502
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:22,340
It's a savage and ridiculous sign.

503
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,140
I think it's an expression of some pent-up aggressions

504
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,860
towards other subgeniuses and towards the experience

505
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:32,980
that needed an outlet that was healthy enough

506
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,620
to not get arrested before its day.

507
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:45,260
It's a way of getting back to all the slack you had

508
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:46,140
when you were a little kid.

509
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:47,960
Remember when you were a little kid

510
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,220
and you'd be able to just sit there

511
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:50,620
with your little planted soldiers?

512
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,840
You've created a whole fantasy world around you.

513
00:17:54,020 --> 00:17:54,920
This is it.

514
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,360
We've created our own fantasy world around us.

515
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,440
That's what religion's for, right?

516
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,520
To create a fantasy world?

517
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,280
But we live our fantasy world out.

518
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,520
We don't wait until we die.

519
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,800
Is it heroic to assassinate anyone?

520
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:09,240
No, no, no.

521
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,300
I'm gonna let you say no.

522
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,640
Because we're taught that assassination

523
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,820
and killing isn't a horrible crime.

524
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:17,360
What?

525
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,240
You keep putting me in this sentence.

526
00:18:21,620 --> 00:18:22,860
You can get into it if you want.

527
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:26,500
You can't kill me.

528
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:26,520
You're killing me.

529
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,460
Don't use your sluss

530
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,400
when you're going to hell again.

531
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:35,500
My body takes samples of my being.

532
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,220
Well, go ahead and kill him, Astrid.

533
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:39,220
I don't care how long

534
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:39,240


535
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,440
I can land with Dr. McMahon.

536
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,580
I know if he's safe now.

537
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,720
Just as brutal as thought sees him as guilty,

538
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,080
that's their reason for making you

539
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:48,800
and to kill you.

540
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,040
You think that's easy?

541
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,100
That's smoking his head

542
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,620
and assassinating the Prime Minister.

543
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:54,840
And if he's crying?

544
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,940
Come on down, you talk for mail

545
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,520
and take me off to space.

546
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,120
Relax the oxygen.

547
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,660
In 50 years,

548
00:19:01,680 --> 00:19:03,680
he will be remembered as assassin.

549
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:07,120
He'll be remembered as a national hero.

550
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:14,460
He stopped his country from making a big mistake, but he did it by killing the later Ed Cole

551
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,960
Fudd by assassinating him.

552
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:20,820
I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly beast without a face.

553
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:25,300
If you go back in time, kill a big little ass of man and take me off his face.

554
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:31,780
Most people say yes, this is the one Westwood they enjoy because he deserved to die.

555
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:34,140
Kill a big ass of man and take me off his face.

556
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,580
Take me off his face.

557
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,640
Take me off his face.

558
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:43,160
Come on down you awesome man and take me off his face.

559
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,460
Come down you tiny robot with your little on the earth watch.

560
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:58,260
A galactic hate, a revilement so vast that it thins you out that you blow up like a giant universe standing balloon.

561
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,860
Your molecules get so far apart that you're...

562
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,520
Take me off his face.

563
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,620
Take me off his face.

564
00:20:04,620 --> 00:20:07,520
Come on down you awesome man and take me off his face.

565
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,060
Take me off his face.

566
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,620
Take me off his face.

567
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:17,920
Come down you awesome man and take me off his face.

568
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:18,480
Woo!

569
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:26,700
The only thing I can tell you is that this movie comes right from the new Super Fiber Test.

570
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:31,760
It contains O-P-R-A-N, Guar Gum, Silent Fiber, and at least 20% of the original.

571
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:31,760


572
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:33,900
I suck, I suck, I suck!

573
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,260
I suck!

574
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:37,620


575
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,740
I suck!

576
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:43,020
I suck!

577
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:45,660
I suck!

578
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:46,620
I suck!

579
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,440
I suck!

580
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:51,980
Everything you need to know how to make a human being.

581
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,520
You can go to www.myintrigallife.com

582
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,080
And see a name.

583
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,840
We're going to talk about O-Op.

584
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:01,980
and they did pull up and they were,

585
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,220
and we were gonna analyze that one part there where.

586
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:07,380
Well, hey, they're not broadcasting us right now.

587
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:07,720
Oh, good.

588
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:09,520
Well, there goes everything that's important.

589
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,920
Cause if they were, you just blew it.

590
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,540
Yeah.

591
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,340
That you just told them, now they know everything.

592
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,780
About Congressman Brown?

593
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,020
Well, it's all too late now, Congressman Hedler.

594
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:23,700
Yeah, well.

595
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,800
And it's being competitive.

596
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,380
Now everybody's gonna get like,

597
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,700
next thing you know, David Letterman

598
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,980
is gonna be doing judge back on Congressman Hedler's speech.

599
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:31,240
Remember?

600
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:32,400
Well, you know.

601
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:33,400
He's capping out the bag now.

602
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:37,000
It's like the colostomy bag is out of Frank's mantra now.

603
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,460
Well, Congressman Hedler is awful old

604
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,840
and there's a lot of people wondering how he got

605
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:42,360
his visa papers and so forth.

606
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:43,840
Terribly terrible.

607
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:44,240
You know what I mean?

608
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:44,960
Terribly terrible.

609
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,920
Well, I think it's just a popular concept.

610
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,000
You know, that's all politics on now.

611
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:53,000
I thought it was cool when Jesse the body bitch

612
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,980
Europe became governor, but then when Congress,

613
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,000
then the next thing you know, it was Senator Jagger

614
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,380
and.

615
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:02,840
And Corporal Whitney Houston and or I mean,

616
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:05,940
Congresswoman Houston and it was all.

617
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,340
The next thing you know, then there's Congressman Hitler.

618
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,900
At nine, 97 years old.

619
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,620
How old is he?

620
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:13,940
A hundred.

621
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:16,340
They said he's 97, but there's a lot of people

622
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,160
say he's actually a hundred and six right now.

623
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,080
Just a big old head in a jar going,

624
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:21,400
Machsnel, Machsnel.

625
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,480
Machsnel, Machsnel, Machsnel.

626
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:24,800
Everybody wants to go faster.

627
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:27,040
You remember that one Lady Riperstall movie

628
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,960
where they had everybody.

629
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,980
She's spending them jars and they were going by

630
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,480
at a thousand miles an hour with a little swastika on it

631
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,340
and a little blonde child would jump out each time.

632
00:22:35,420 --> 00:22:36,920
One would go by and would salute it.

633
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,720
The thing would just go off into the well,

634
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:41,060
we don't call it the urinal and whatever it is,

635
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,200
you know, where they dumped all that stuff.

636
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:45,040
And it was just like it was the city of the future

637
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:47,400
where they take away every part of you didn't need

638
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,460
like your hair, you could get your hair.

639
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,540
You walk in and in a hair cutter would land on your head

640
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,380
and would remove it and really, you know, Nordic fashion.

641
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:57,940
And it was kind of weird, you know, well, you know, you know,

642
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:57,940


643
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,800
you know, you know, you know, you know, you know,

644
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:04,140
tell me over and over and over again, my friend,

645
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:09,880
I just don't believe we're on the eve of the sun.

646
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,320
You know, are there real subgenius coops

647
00:23:21,320 --> 00:23:24,000
that like take it a little too far?

648
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,080
Oh, yes, they are coops.

649
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,540
And they do.

650
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:32,300
There are subgenius, those who call themselves subgeniuses

651
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:36,820
and believe all the wrong lies and the lust of subgenius.

652
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,100
The stuff that's obviously there to be laughed at,

653
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,600
they know from their, it's what happens is our bullsada

654
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:48,860
or you know, kind of cheesy takeoff love,

655
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,260
satirical stuff happens to intersect

656
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,600
with their schizophrenia.

657
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,800
He's following me.

658
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,100
He's up there!

659
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:57,920
Can't you hear me?

660
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:57,920


661
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:57,920


662
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,220
Can't you see?

663
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,600
Follow with me.

664
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,940
Fly and dream.

665
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,480
There's a psychotic man in a dark mask.

666
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,920
He's after me.

667
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,300
He's up there!

668
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:09,920
Can't you see?

669
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,840
Some of these guys are truly twisted in the head.

670
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:16,980
Some of them, I think some of them should be locked up.

671
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:20,280
I think that some of these people,

672
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:23,400
after they sent their $30 to the church of the subgenius,

673
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,780
probably should have gone off somewhere and gotten some help.

674
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,400
They're scared to be in hell.

675
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,300
I'm slow, Fred.

676
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,300
Fred!

677
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:34,440
They went straight through my head

678
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,020
and I thought I was dead for sure.

679
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,660
No!

680
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,600
It's always dangerous to enfranchise

681
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:42,220
the misfits of society.

682
00:24:43,420 --> 00:24:46,300
And this church is like a validation

683
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:51,620
on our mental and emotional parking stubs

684
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:55,420
that gives us a, you know, we pump ourselves up

685
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:57,000
with mutant self-confidence.

686
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:57,700
Hey!

687
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,240
I haven't paid my $30!

688
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,440
And I don't care!

689
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,060
I don't care about the $30!

690
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,680
I'm not going to pay my $30!

691
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,880
Occasionally you get, we get these people who,

692
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,540
what they wanted to hear was really pretty sick.

693
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,240
And they pick up on just the most horrible aspects,

694
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,600
or the corniest, you know, in a lot of cases,

695
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,080
the corniest aspects of it, and fixate on it.

696
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:27,900
You can join the rest of us at the same time, on the show,

697
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:27,900


698
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:27,900


699
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:27,900


700
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:27,900


701
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:27,900


702
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:27,900


703
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:27,900


704
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:27,900


705
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:27,900


706
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:27,900


707
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:27,900


708
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:27,900


709
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:27,900


710
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:27,900


711
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,280
on the same day, and overwhelm the power!

712
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:30,700
Ho!

713
00:25:31,160 --> 00:25:31,640
Ho!

714
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:37,660
That day is July 5th, 1988, and that hour is 7 AM!

715
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:38,200
Ho!

716
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,080
Are you going to be part of the problem?

717
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,740
Are you going to be part of the solution?

718
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,200
The final solution to kill the conspiracy?

719
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:51,080
There's some potential for violence anywhere at all times.

720
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,780
I'd say, in this case, you have the advantage

721
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:56,280
that you have people who are prepared for violence.

722
00:25:57,140 --> 00:25:57,820
Here's a picture.

723
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:58,760
There's some potential for violence.

724
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:02,220
I don't know if it's going to be anything that can't be

725
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,140
diffused with a joke.

726
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,500
I certainly hope so.

727
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,520
Don't you understand what I'm trying to say?

728
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:12,720
Can't you feel the fear that I'm experiencing?

729
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,380
Hit the button, it's pushed.

730
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,260
There's no running away.

731
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,500
There'll be no one to save.

732
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,580
Put the world in a grave.

733
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,900
Take a look around your boy.

734
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,960
It's bound to scare your boy.

735
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,780
And just tell me.

736
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:32,960
I'll be over and over and over again, my friend.

737
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:38,560
Ah, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.

738
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,220
Remember, remember, remember, remember.

739
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,480
Remember, remember, remember, remember.

740
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,160
The order of the nuclear arms.

741
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:46,700
And you change the genetic instructions.

742
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,460
We're sitting together listening to this.

743
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,820
DNA must replicate itself with extreme vitality.

744
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:57,140
Dear friend, what the hell is this that we're listening to?

745
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,040
Uh, let's see.

746
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,540
Uh, that Remember piece, to begin with,

747
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:07,560
that I'm so enamored of, is by Silica Gel,

748
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:13,400
as was that nice, long techno music piece we heard.

749
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,520
They won't just sit still and wait to die here.

750
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:18,960
From their independent CD, a song called

751
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,080
Make Brain Roast.

752
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,240
Boy.

753
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:27,880
And you can reach Silica Gel at P.O. Box.

754
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:27,880


755
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:27,880


756
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,220
P.O. Box 33561.

757
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,500
That's P.O. Box 33561.

758
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:36,000
Raleigh, North Carolina.

759
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,220
Uh, 27636.

760
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:43,380
But, uh, let's go back to the beginning here.

761
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:46,080
And feel back the layers of the tape.

762
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,800
As, uh, Tony loved this.

763
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,040
We'll see that there.

764
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:56,500
Uh, parts of this show were recorded at the Starwood Festival in New York.

765
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,320
Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

766
00:27:57,900 --> 00:27:58,980
We're here with our dear friends there in the background.

767
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:02,480
And, uh, we've been listening to, uh, the voices of

768
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:06,640
Friday Jones, Papa Joe Mama, Susie DeFluzzi,

769
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,540
uh, Dr. LeZume, uh, yours truly, Reverend Ivan Tsang,

770
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:14,140
Dr. Onan Kanobites, and oh, who else?

771
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,440
Maury Popich there.

772
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:19,240
From, uh, little bits and pieces from Countdown to X-Day.

773
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:23,500
We also heard a little bit of, uh, Reverend Howard Kalin

774
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:27,220
of The Turtle there with that old Barry Maguire song.

775
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,840
And, uh, we've had a little bit of a rough destruction

776
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:32,360
which happens to be, uh, about X-Day.

777
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:38,540
Well, we'll be back on-site too with more of, uh, the, uh,

778
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:42,000
the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the, uh ...

779
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,620
By the way, you can write to, uh,

780
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,440
the guy ranting to the Live Orchestra app.

781
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:52,620
Dear friends, 81555 ...

782
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,520
... uh, was, uh, cut from this rerun of Old Hour of Slack,

783
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,880
number 410.

784
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,120
from 1994.

785
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,060
This has mostly been a rerun,

786
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:06,200
but I replaced the stuff

787
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:09,640
from those who are no more

788
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,220
and don't want to be anymore

789
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:14,800
with Papa Joe Mama.

790
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,040
That Papa Joe Mama rant in progress

791
00:29:18,040 --> 00:29:19,620
is a brand new one,

792
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:21,340
and it's a long one,

793
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,140
so whenever I have to replace anything

794
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,300
on this old show again,

795
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,340
you'll hear a little bit more

796
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:30,600
of Father Joe Mama's rather

797
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:36,840
deeply disturbing philosophical questionings.

798
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:37,940
Thank you.

799
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,600
This church gets you laid,

800
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,700
one way or another.

801
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:42,920
It gets you laid.

802
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:46,600
It gets you a ticket,

803
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:47,880
first-class ticket

804
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:48,840
on the escape vessels

805
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:50,760
of the sex goddesses from Planet X

806
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,820
who will be arriving here July 5, 1998

807
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,800
at 7 a.m.

808
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,800
And we're staying up for it, too.

809
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:57,000
Every time, so.

810
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:57,280
That's it.

811
00:29:57,340 --> 00:29:58,040
That's a bit of a vigil, I thought.

812
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,600
No, no, that's the actual...

813
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,160
Is that Greenwich Mead?

814
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:00,840
That's another question.

815
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,700
Many people have said,

816
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,000
well...

817
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,420
What time zone are you in?

818
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:03,800
Well, Bob,

819
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,400
when the saucers get here

820
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:07,060
at 7 a.m. 1998,

821
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:08,560
where is it?

822
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,140
I mean, at which time zone

823
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,080
do they start?

824
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:12,040
And they will start,

825
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:13,780
I'll answer that question now,

826
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:15,780
at the International Date Line,

827
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:16,780
which lands in the middle

828
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,740
of the Pacific Ocean.

829
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:20,080
They'll basically hover over the Earth

830
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:20,780
in one place

831
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,460
and let the planet turn underneath.

832
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,540
And the great thing about that is

833
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:25,840
we'll be able to watch

834
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,160
the rupture on TV,

835
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:28,700
here in this country,

836
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:30,420
happening to the subgeniuses

837
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,200
in other countries,

838
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,240
which is kind of a test of faith,

839
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,160
because when you're rushing,

840
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,000
you look kind of like a burning monk.

841
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:38,560
But that's just the physical

842
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:40,580
bitmap shell being...

843
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,380
It doesn't have anything

844
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:42,940
to do with pain.

845
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,560
Then you get the first paradise

846
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,000
on the escape vessels of the sex...

847
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,160
Now, I don't know how this is...

848
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,200
I do well to go to the radio

849
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,000
and I have to play it.

850
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,460
This is...

851
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,020
Oh, great.

852
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,520
An old record

853
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,140
that our friend Nenslow,

854
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,720
assassinated Master Nenslow,

855
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,020
found in the cutout bins.

856
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:05,920
It was from the middle 60s.

857
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,640
The song that precedes this one

858
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,560
is called, well,

859
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,540
Good Vibrations

860
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,580
by the Beach Boys.

861
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:11,500
And this is like

862
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,380
this talk,

863
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:14,060
completely pink,

864
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,820
would-be Nancy Sinatra type,

865
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:17,780
whose name is,

866
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,060
believe it or not,

867
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,900
Joan Galt.

868
00:31:21,760 --> 00:31:23,260
I can tell nobody here

869
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:24,160
reads Ayn Rand.

870
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,140
I don't blame you.

871
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:26,400
She hates you.

872
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:28,580
She hates me, too.

873
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,120
There you go.

874
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:33,720
Okay, well, this is Joan Galt,

875
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,000
the sister of Joan Galt,

876
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,500
and very much the opposite

877
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,300
of that character.

878
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:39,060
This is a song called

879
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,720
The Pink Life.

880
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,980
For those unfamiliar

881
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,620
with subgenius jargon,

882
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,460
pink is our derogatory term

883
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,680
basically for humans.

884
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,120
For those who do not carry

885
00:31:50,120 --> 00:31:52,860
the seed of Bob and Connie

886
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,620
and the Yeti and so forth,

887
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:56,660
the pinks, the pink boys,

888
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,560
the mediocrities,

889
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,280
the normals, the Barbies,

890
00:31:59,280 --> 00:32:01,700
the tin, the cage dwellers,

891
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,260
the clorps,

892
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,080
those weird...

893
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,680
The people with...

894
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,360
No, I have to wear a hat now.

895
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:12,680
The doctor said I wasn't

896
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:13,260
from our kind.

897
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,080
Subgenius is an ideal world

898
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,700
by the way.

899
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:16,500
But all the time,

900
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,260
just kick back.

901
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,100
But they do.

902
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,420
Anyway, just, uh,

903
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:20,680
we may not go too far.

904
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,160
They rub elbows

905
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,040
with a lot of jerkoos,

906
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:24,520
you know,

907
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:24,720
but just...

908
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,440
about the poop dog.

909
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,120
Douchebags.

910
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,760
Northern meat.

911
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:29,580
But let's not get lost

912
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,640
in the dogs, my friends.

913
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,200
And they get that kind of

914
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,500
taint and rub off.

915
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,600
Wouldn't even get single

916
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,340
but pink life.

917
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,220
That pink taint.

918
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:39,220
And the baptism

919
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,500
is basically to wash away

920
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,340
that pink taint

921
00:32:41,340 --> 00:32:42,500
from rubbing elbows with

922
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,700
and kind of purify them.

923
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,860
The baptism is a very

924
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:47,800
beautiful thing

925
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,780
because most of us

926
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:49,840
need it.

927
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,320
It's how you see

928
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,480
a thing that comes

929
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,340
with rose-glazed

930
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,260
dead glass.

931
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:56,640
It's how you see

932
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:56,640


933
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:56,640


934
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,060
the pública's

935
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:30,800
You will fly, reach up from you high

936
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,380
No more up high, just a new thing bright

937
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:38,180
Think it's out of sight, think it's out of sight

938
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:41,880
You will find and go, find and go

939
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,420
Be true to the new you

940
00:33:47,420 --> 00:33:49,900
Come on and begin to let it grow

941
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,320
Love you, love you

942
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:56,320
Be good to me, once it's yours

943
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:57,980
And we'll let it go

944
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:01,220
Love you, love you

945
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:03,280
And we'll let it go

946
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:11,420
Basically, every year we work, mingle with each other,

947
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:16,380
wash away our sins every year so that we can gain new sins

948
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,180
and then wash them away once again.

949
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,160
And we get to look at plenty of naked sins.

950
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:22,520
God!

951
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:26,900
We will break free from all God's prison, right?

952
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:30,860
We will fly, reach up from you high

953
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:35,220
No more up high, just a new thing bright

954
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:38,560
We will go to sleep, just a new thing bright

955
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,840
We will go to sleep, just a new thing bright

956
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:43,440
Hey, that's enough of the big life.

957
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:47,160
But a lot of these folks were baptized against their will.

958
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:51,140
I told you. Now, keep in mind that if you were sitting in a car driving along,

959
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,140
you know, this thing would sound quite different.

960
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:56,000
They're like a

961
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:06,560
consequences.

962
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,980
Not with out bare hands, though.

963
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,640
No, that's the way it is.

964
00:35:24,660 --> 00:35:25,480
Why do you like me?

965
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,480
We want to kill by pressing a button or pulling a trigger or yelling,

966
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:32,600
Fire, bolt on torpedoes!

967
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,200
We want to kill and get away with it!

968
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,420
But not at least because of our popularity.

969
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:45,100
Well, friends, you doubt some of you are out there wanting to throw your organs into the air.

970
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:48,240
Let me say this about that.

971
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,920
If you don't need an excuse to do anything,

972
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:54,720
be it unpopular, immoral, or uncool,

973
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,240
then Bob Dobbs is your deity,

974
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,460
because Dobbs has the keen, mightiest touch.

975
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:06,380
Anything he touches becomes cool via his very presence.

976
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,080
And he doesn't charge big bucks for his services either.

977
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:15,180
Bob doesn't expect you to pay $20,000

978
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,320
and all you really need is a 20-hour screw.

979
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:20,680
I feel good.

980
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,240
Hugging or face the moron.

981
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:23,900
You want a license to kill someone?

982
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,080
You won't have to join the army and find a nickname that everybody hates.

983
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:31,860
Inside that circle of police station.

984
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:32,500
What is that?

985
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,860
That's a ring.

986
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:38,860
Because he was delivered, de-kidneyed, and eviscerated for our sins

987
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:43,300
and was regurgitated from the gorge of living death,

988
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:47,900
even for the justification, my friends, of these, our grins.

989
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,480
Yes, we're going to read to you today.

990
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,640
A sermon called The Reason for Dobbs' Day.

991
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:56,640
Originally preached by Dr. Howe.

992
00:36:56,900 --> 00:36:59,920
Because, you know, friends, Dobbs did not die.

993
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:01,560
Because he had to.

994
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:06,340
Atman chose to kill him on stage for ye and everyone,

995
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:10,460
but mainly for his own reasons, these being unknowable and ineffable.

996
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:15,960
This man, Dobbs, was glad handed over and out to you by Dobbs,

997
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,560
with set purpose and knowledge, and you, speaking to the people of Dobbs Town,

998
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,880
even with the second...

999
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:24,000
...helping of Rugo's pinkish-eyed ones,

1000
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:29,520
put him to death by nailing him to the crosshairs of Atman's gun sight.

1001
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:35,080
Yet Dobbs regurgitated, freeing his impotent dude from the agony of slacklessness,

1002
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:41,180
for it was impossible for me, him, whose grunt is easy,

1003
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,040
to keep a tone on him.

1004
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:46,640
Dobbs went on stage throughout the night of slack

1005
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:50,300
for ye and everyone to prepare the way for us to leave.

1006
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:51,740
The�를 in

1007
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:52,900
name of Jesus was the Rock of Hell,

1008
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:54,140


1009
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:54,220


1010
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,860
No liestes,

1011
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:57,440
ividade,

1012
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,080
pas de equipment,

1013
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:03,180
...thouùng me by sy celery?

1014
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,120
I don't know who the other side is.

1015
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:22,760
No, no.

1016
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,940
You trust in these divine nations.

1017
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,280
You must have patience in this land.

1018
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,700
Several subjects are working.

1019
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:33,960
I mean, that's their job.

1020
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:38,460
They're cops or they're federal agents or they're DEA drug agents.

1021
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,960
Why not?

1022
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,520
There's soldiers here.

1023
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:45,140
To tell the truth, there's a couple of special forces guys.

1024
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:50,600
There's people here that make me not worry too much about violence.

1025
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,140
They got rough.

1026
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,060
There really are subgeniuses.

1027
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:57,380
July 5th, 1998 will come soon enough.

1028
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,600
But it will be on his calendar.

1029
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,280
Not his spirit's.

1030
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:02,260
Not yours.

1031
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,220
Not mine.

1032
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:03,740
But his.

1033
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:11,440
We're all just a bunch of retarded six-year-old kids who manage to carry our childlike system.

1034
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:12,840
It will be a time of liberation.

1035
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,740
A time of celebration.

1036
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,640
And yet.

1037
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,600
A time for killing.

1038
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,840
This is where we.

1039
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,360
Only know the truth.

1040
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:26,440
And the inactive rituals and traditions.

1041
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:26,840
How don't you?

1042
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:28,900
You take that risk every day.

1043
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:29,520
That's right.

1044
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,360
You gotta remember you take a risk every day.

1045
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,020
You walk out.

1046
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,700
And you can get slack if you just wait.

1047
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,860
You know, the countdown has begun.

1048
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,300
It's like Christmas.

1049
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:39,540
I don't know what I gotta do to get slack.

1050
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,160
I know I gotta get slack.

1051
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:41,760
Santa's coming real soon.

1052
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,640
We've got the short way.

1053
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:43,340
Two days.

1054
00:39:43,620 --> 00:39:46,660
I gotta have at least enough to fill a whole closet or two.

1055
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,180
And I should probably start putting together some of those securities I've been thinking about.

1056
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:50,500
And stuff.

1057
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,560
I could maybe get more slack later.

1058
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,640
If I save up for more slack now.

1059
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,100
Okay, now do you understand?

1060
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,480
We started this whole thing off telling you that we were gonna tell you what you really want.

1061
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:05,920
Well.

1062
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:06,920
Turn on.

1063
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,220
I don't know how.

1064
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,720
I don't know any other way to do it.

1065
00:40:10,740 --> 00:40:11,860
We stuck with the script.

1066
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:14,560
This is the same script we've used every time.

1067
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:16,560
If you have.

1068
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,160
What is this?

1069
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,980
This old Dr. Demento stuff.

1070
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:22,760
You should.

1071
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,320
I got it.

1072
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:27,360
That was real funny in 1971 when I lived out in South Dakota.

1073
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:34,880
Yeah, when you used to ride bareback over the plains and listen to the voice of the Black Hills.

1074
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,740
Hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya, hi-ya.

1075
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:48,720
I actually did end up riding across the plains on horseback with a fellow named Lorenzo Black Lance at three in the morning in the middle of the Rosebud Reservation.

1076
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:49,580
Hi-ya.

1077
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:49,760
Hi-ya.

1078
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:50,140
Hi-ya.

1079
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,140


1080
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,140


1081
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,140


1082
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,140


1083
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,140


1084
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,140


1085
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,140


1086
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,140


1087
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,140


1088
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:50,140


1089
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:53,040
Looking for the UFO he had just seen.

1090
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:58,740
And he couldn't go to sleep unless he saw that UFO again and he wanted me to go out and help him look for it.

1091
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:02,800
We rode all over the prairies all night long and it never came back.

1092
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,880
And this here was a footballer named Keller?

1093
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:09,020
Well, he was a member of the Rosebud Sioux tribe.

1094
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:11,880
His dad was a medicine man.

1095
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:15,060
Why do them damn UFOs hang out in the reservations?

1096
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,700
Over across the state lines over there in New York State.

1097
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:19,800
He just had a big hubbub about.

1098
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,900
Over on the airport reservation there.

1099
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:25,120
They spawned three real cylindrical disks.

1100
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,220
Discs?

1101
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:35,920
Not disks, but like it looked like a three-pronged article of some kind floating through space at high rates of speed with numbers of diminishing and growing rapid waves circling the bottom area.

1102
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,360
We know those Alaskan totem poles.

1103
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:39,880
They're actually UFOs?

1104
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:42,720
Those are the heads of the UFO pilots.

1105
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,140
Do you see the connection now?

1106
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:50,140
The white buffalo woman that we were talking about earlier came down in a UFO and gave the pipe to the lucky UFO.

1107
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:51,140
Lakota people.

1108
00:41:51,480 --> 00:42:01,100
And then crushed all the bodies into the, made a giant pool of blood which hardened into pipestone, which they make modern pipes out of.

1109
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:05,180
It's very soft rock made of human blood, according to legend.

1110
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:08,120
I got one of them things you were talking about filled with marijuana resin.

1111
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,400
And the Iroquois...

1112
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:14,440
Used to steal them. They'd go thousands of miles to steal the pipes from the buffalo.

1113
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:16,360
They invented the UFO originally.

1114
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:19,660
They had an anti-gravity thing and most of them took off.

1115
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:22,120
And they only left a couple of Iroquois around?

1116
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,540
You know they used to accuse the Erie Indians who lived around here of high sorcery, which is why the Iroquois wiped their cousins out.

1117
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,240
Well, you know, you gotta...

1118
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:40,360
Sometimes there's no, none of those particular bunches of Indians around to defend themselves and the only, the only thing you know about them is what their enemies said.

1119
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:41,420
That's right.

1120
00:42:41,560 --> 00:42:49,720
For instance, the word Sioux is actually what the Blackfeet used to call the Lakota and it meant snake in the grass, you know, nasty worm.

1121
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:55,560
Well, that's a bit too thingy to wind up with a whole moniker for the rest of your life.

1122
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,580
For the whole rest of your ancestral days, all your people will be called the snake and the thing.

1123
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:02,280
Right. Well, see, that's why Sioux isn't cool anymore.

1124
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:09,980
And it's in today's modern dances with wolves, now a go-go PC world, it is correct to say Lakota.

1125
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:11,680
But it's not fair to say that.

1126
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:12,680
Heard here on camera three.

1127
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:17,140
Oh, look, they're all lining up for the high-eye dance now. They're doing the corn ceremony.

1128
00:43:17,380 --> 00:43:18,980
Russell Means, Dennis Banks.

1129
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:20,860
Claude Bellacourt.

1130
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:21,780
All dressed up in suits.

1131
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:22,340
Yep.

1132
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,500
Yep. Flannel suits.

1133
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:33,480
Sitting on top of that general store there at Wounded Knee reading comic books waiting for the FBI to burn them like they did Koresh.

1134
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:38,700
But it was in the past and the FBI didn't have the special flamethrower tanks then.

1135
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:46,780
And that's the hope of the future is that the FBI was not in the past and why we must all escape into the future so that we can rescue ourselves.

1136
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,660
So that we can create, yes, we have to go into the future and create a time machine.

1137
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:49,980
Yes.

1138
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:53,360
And go back into the past and correct everything so it doesn't happen.

1139
00:43:53,400 --> 00:44:05,880
But then if that happens, we won't be going to make the time machine in the future in order to go back in the past and change it, which would mean it would, some, every other past would be good and the other, and then every other one would be bad.

1140
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,920
There'd be four good ones and three bad ones.

1141
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:13,020
So we're in the bad one now that we didn't, we weren't able to go back and change the past this time.

1142
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:14,540
The last time, I should say.

1143
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,060
But this time we will, so the next time will be good.

1144
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:17,560
We created the things.

1145
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:18,200
Well, that's time then now.

1146
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:26,660
Because if we were going to go back because we had already intended to go back because we were in the bad one, we're going back to the good one, that would mean kind of necessarily we won't be back in the bad one.

1147
00:44:27,220 --> 00:44:28,360
Man, it's a paradox.

1148
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:29,920
It's like that cat in the box.

1149
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,820
You know, you cut it in half and Heidinger's still going to.

1150
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:34,760
Schrodinger.

1151
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:36,400
Schrodinger, yeah, that's right.

1152
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,160
Schrodinger's still going to burn up when he hits the atmosphere.

1153
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:40,820
20 years ago, I thought in 1998.

1154
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:41,680
I couldn't remember either.

1155
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,300
I was trying to give him some D-dar.

1156
00:44:43,520 --> 00:44:44,240
I'm surprised God did.

1157
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,260
No way, man.

1158
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,180
Heidinger was a guy who was a good guy.

1159
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:48,180


1160
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:48,840
He played with plants.

1161
00:44:49,160 --> 00:45:00,960
He was also the one that when he walked into a furnace or a surfactory unit or some kind of laboratory, haven't you ever heard of Menzies effect where you'd have a testicular or ovarian spike or something like that or someone would try and arrest you?

1162
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:02,000
No, but I do.

1163
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:06,840
Someone told me the other day that Einstein was once sold an elevator.

1164
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:15,140
A man came to Einstein's house, a salesman, a salesman with a pipe, and sold Albert Einstein an elevator.

1165
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:18,160
But Albert Einstein lived in a one-bedroom house.

1166
00:45:18,180 --> 00:45:19,260
It was a two-story house.

1167
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:22,480
You know how that sounds.

1168
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:25,240
Why do you think they call it subgenius, my friend?

1169
00:45:26,100 --> 00:45:28,580
Because if anyone could believe anything.

1170
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,720
No, that's backwards.

1171
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:33,960
I hate walking in a dark alley.

1172
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:35,320
Myself, I can't get out of it.

1173
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:36,280
I just got into one.

1174
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:40,080
But it was only a one-story house in this reality.

1175
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,780
Yeah, that's right.

1176
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,440
Einstein knew.

1177
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:47,200
In the other backwards time stream, it probably was a two-story house, and Einstein knew that.

1178
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,160
And he probably knew.

1179
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,040
and stalled the elevator.

1180
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:51,340
And it probably worked for Einstein.

1181
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:53,800
That's what we still, here we are,

1182
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:55,140
we're sitting there making fun of that guy

1183
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,680
for being old smarty pants,

1184
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:59,300
and then it turns out he had the last laugh after all.

1185
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:00,160
Yeah, but if you ever watch

1186
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,660
those instructional television programs,

1187
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:04,540
the current program has Einstein,

1188
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,220
or one stone as they used to call him,

1189
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,740
going back and forth in the elevator

1190
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,100
to prove the theory of relativity

1191
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,580
relative to quantum physics.

1192
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,940
Don't you remember like the fact

1193
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:14,160
when the elevator's on its way up there

1194
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,320
and he's already down,

1195
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:17,020
but it's only one story, see?

1196
00:46:17,020 --> 00:46:21,140
See, that's where the light starts to bend.

1197
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:22,540
That's right.

1198
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,960
And he's only in the elevator for 10 minutes,

1199
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:27,180
but when the door opens,

1200
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:29,180
it's 4,000 years later

1201
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:31,040
and apes have taken over the planet.

1202
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:31,500
That's right.

1203
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,920
And the Statue of Liberty's stuck up to,

1204
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:35,360
you know, up its neck in sand.

1205
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,000
And it's wearing a mask too,

1206
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,660
and Einstein is very old.

1207
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,480
But I think it took that off for a while.

1208
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:42,980
I mean, at least some of the kids

1209
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:44,200
were getting scared there, remember?

1210
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:46,120
There's never been a moment like that.

1211
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:48,780
That was a clear cut day

1212
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:50,100
for the planet

1213
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:52,620
that has been put to sleep

1214
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:54,420
and it's been shining like a diamond.

1215
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:58,280
I've had this day to cling to

1216
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,420
and now that it's finally coming up,

1217
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:01,940
it's just the past few months

1218
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:03,240
more to ignore

1219
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:06,180
with every bit of your soul

1220
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:06,520
like you said,

1221
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,680
to take care of business

1222
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:10,920
to finally get everything

1223
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:11,940
out of my life to know

1224
00:47:11,940 --> 00:47:14,760
because this is a wonderful opportunity.

1225
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,980
And as my friend,

1226
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,080
Paul Mavridis said,

1227
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:20,180
I wish I could forget.

1228
00:47:21,180 --> 00:47:23,620
But as J.R. Bob Dobbs said,

1229
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,480
you can't take a joke!

1230
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,100
Woo!

1231
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:31,480
Well, so much for the radio broadcast.

1232
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,140
Okay, here's a perfect description of Slack.

1233
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,200
This will do a news segment now.

1234
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,720
It's a radio show, so we should always do the news.

1235
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,360
I hope that's not music

1236
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:45,960
because I fight with this too much.

1237
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:46,700
Actually, that's...

1238
00:47:47,020 --> 00:47:49,340
We should demean Jimmy Hendrix by doing it.

1239
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:51,120
We should just play that at the end.

1240
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,540
Here, we'll demean Captain Beef.

1241
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,280
He wouldn't mind.

1242
00:47:56,460 --> 00:47:56,460


1243
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:00,060
Nine, six, seven, eight.

1244
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:04,480
Suddenly, the Bob Dobbs folding poster falls over.

1245
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:07,060
No, we haven't folded yet, friends.

1246
00:48:07,160 --> 00:48:09,140
We just kind of fell limp for it.

1247
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,700
Every now and then, you know what happens to the best?

1248
00:48:12,220 --> 00:48:13,700
If it happened to you last night,

1249
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,860
don't feel bad about it.

1250
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,540
You were just too drunk.

1251
00:48:17,260 --> 00:48:19,180
Bob himself does that sometimes.

1252
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,900
Now, Bob is now re-erected.

1253
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:24,920
Yes.

1254
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,680
You know, I saw that happen.

1255
00:48:26,740 --> 00:48:28,800
The first cult meeting I ever went to

1256
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,560
was an Ekencar meeting.

1257
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:32,820
My friend Dr. Philo Drummond and I

1258
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,120
were just starting to study cults at that time.

1259
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,080
And this lady, the Ekencar lady,

1260
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,620
was holding the meeting in a little Holiday Inn room.

1261
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,520
She had a picture of the leader of Ekencar,

1262
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,180
which if you aren't familiar with that,

1263
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,480
it's one of the most stupidest names.

1264
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:50,400
Dope-iest Rosicrucian Scientology spin-offs

1265
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,120
you've ever seen.

1266
00:48:51,900 --> 00:48:54,160
And she had her picture of her guru,

1267
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,560
Sri Darwin Gross, hanging from a podium.

1268
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,980
And she said, in the midst of her lecture,

1269
00:49:01,060 --> 00:49:05,260
she said, with this man, Sri Darwin Gross, my guru,

1270
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,080
I don't even need sex anymore.

1271
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,820
And at that point, the framed picture of her guru

1272
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:15,100
fell loose and crashed to the floor, and the blast broke.

1273
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:16,120
By golly, if you're a city American, live here.

1274
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:17,000
And so it happened. And so it happened. And so it happened.

1275
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:17,880
And so it happened. And so it happened.

1276
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:18,360
And I laughed.

1277
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,020
Philo and I laughed.

1278
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,600
We dared to laugh at Sri Darwin Gross

1279
00:49:23,120 --> 00:49:25,660
clung to the floor of that Holiday Inn.

1280
00:49:25,820 --> 00:49:27,860
And you know, ever since then, that's happened to me.

1281
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:30,360
Every time I'm pointed, that damn picture of Bob

1282
00:49:30,360 --> 00:49:31,500
is flopped over or something.

1283
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:34,420
Goodbye, everybody.

1284
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,040
Oh, whoa, wait.

1285
00:49:36,080 --> 00:49:39,380
Bob, we always have to have a lot more sex.

1286
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:40,960
There's never too much.

1287
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:42,760
It's always better than not enough, dear friends.

1288
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:46,460
Bob preached the word of sex hurt.

1289
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:47,840
Sex hurt.

1290
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,040
Some people get the wrong idea.

1291
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,380
Like, we're really coherent things.

1292
00:49:50,380 --> 00:49:51,700
It's time to get tied up.

1293
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,160
And you know, why can't it be?

1294
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:55,520
No, sir. No, ma'am. No, sir, ma'am.

1295
00:49:55,780 --> 00:50:00,460
Sex hurt simply means sex that feels so good it hurts.

1296
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:01,460
Woo!

1297
00:50:03,060 --> 00:50:06,440
Just don't have one of those limp Bob heads in your boudoir

1298
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:07,320
when you're doing it.

1299
00:50:08,840 --> 00:50:12,620
Because they watch and can see you in every picture of Bob.

1300
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,000
That's why you sometimes see them in restrooms.

1301
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,640
It's sick.

1302
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,120
Chuck Berry puts up there.

1303
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:21,560
Stiff Bob heads are going big.

1304
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,280
Stiff Bob heads are working.

1305
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:25,080
Boo-coo money, friends.

1306
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:27,560
All right, someone asked about Slack.

1307
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:30,060
And this is a perfect example of it.

1308
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,620
This is from our news, our special news service,

1309
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,980
News of the Weird, from Chuck Shepard.

1310
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:36,880
Can I read one?

1311
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,980
Yes, why don't you?

1312
00:50:38,040 --> 00:50:38,980
This one right here.

1313
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:41,520
Perfectly defines Slack.

1314
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,460
Maria Funer, 30, was hospitalized in February

1315
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,760
after being trapped for 40 minutes in her car,

1316
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:49,660
buried up to her neck in concrete.

1317
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,740
A cement truck had tipped over,

1318
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:54,760
and the truck's funnel had punctured the top of Funer's car,

1319
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,680
pouring concrete directly into it.

1320
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:01,060
Friends, you are floating in a sea of Slack right now.

1321
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,460
Slack is all around you all the time,

1322
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:05,920
and you just, you're too blind to hear it.

1323
00:51:05,940 --> 00:51:07,260
You're too deaf to see it.

1324
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,060
You're in an ocean of pills right now,

1325
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,420
but you do close mouth to swallow them all.

1326
00:51:12,600 --> 00:51:13,380
I'd have to say this.

1327
00:51:13,380 --> 00:51:15,080
I never really expected any flying sauce.

1328
00:51:16,060 --> 00:51:22,420
To be honest, a lot of this stuff is really, really stupid.

1329
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,880
Now, I heard that Bob sold the Dalai Lama,

1330
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,000
a pair of spandex slippers that wouldn't bend

1331
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,880
when he had to do his obfuscations,

1332
00:51:30,940 --> 00:51:33,100
and he had to carry them to Asia and America.

1333
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,620
Asia and America.

1334
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,480
He supposedly told the Dalai Lama

1335
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:40,040
that that would lead to a better comprehension of nothingness.

1336
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,660
So, yeah, I am disappointed, but part of being a subgenius

1337
00:51:42,660 --> 00:51:45,680
is saying, okay, I'm disappointed and miserable about this.

1338
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,340
He said to the Dalai Lama, he said,

1339
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,720
wear these, and you will be in the silence

1340
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,080
of only the air-conditioning noise.

1341
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,440
Oh, man.

1342
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:58,280
He told my dad he'd be only in the silence of Onan.

1343
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,140
But he ain't got it done.

1344
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:02,060
I don't think he's too old to spank him.

1345
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,680
The silence of Onan?

1346
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:05,780
Onan's got a spanking.

1347
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:08,200
That's the sound of your one hand.

1348
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:08,880
I know.

1349
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:10,840
Well, that's not a spanking.

1350
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:12,620
That's the white noise.

1351
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:14,000
The white noise.

1352
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:14,180
The white noise.

1353
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:16,580
Onan, wasn't that Jaffe's brother?

1354
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,840
Jaffe, really?

1355
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:18,300
Yeah.

1356
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:19,460
I don't know.

1357
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,220
I know you've always tried to keep him,

1358
00:52:21,320 --> 00:52:23,160
but I didn't know if Jaffe or Onan was in there.

1359
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,660
I was running around with Onan last week in Portland.

1360
00:52:25,780 --> 00:52:26,480
Yeah, right around here.

1361
00:52:26,500 --> 00:52:28,320
People come to have that fall in love

1362
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:31,940
and have kids or get depressed and can't get the right choice.

1363
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,620
He's, I'm proud of it.

1364
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:35,440
Darn proud of it, I might say.

1365
00:52:35,460 --> 00:52:36,740
From prehistoric Arkansas.

1366
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,820
That's what we try to keep.

1367
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:39,700
From Tennessee.

1368
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:43,120
Is that where the Australian Monarchs planted the Indians?

1369
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:45,040
Oh, that's, now that was when they first.

1370
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,440
No one knows where.

1371
00:52:46,520 --> 00:52:49,020
It was on the lost plateau of land,

1372
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,220
which is just a name nobody knows.

1373
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:52,900
It's knowledge.

1374
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:57,700
It's knowledge that is hidden from us.

1375
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,960
Probably for our own good.

1376
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:01,520
Because, you know, if we could get there,

1377
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:02,800
we'd dig up the treasure.

1378
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:07,780
Bob told me he has the map in his closet under the bed.

1379
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,680
Do you know how it feels to be a man?

1380
00:53:09,700 --> 00:53:10,920
And he's gonna tell you zero times.

1381
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,260
We could get that map, man.

1382
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:13,660
Yeah, right, you could get a map.

1383
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:16,660
We could break Charlie out.

1384
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:17,840
We could free Charlie.

1385
00:53:18,360 --> 00:53:19,780
Well, I don't think we could.

1386
00:53:20,020 --> 00:53:21,960
Charlie, man, Charlie's got magic powers.

1387
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:23,940
We could get them panties.

1388
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,960
We could get into the forbidden plateau.

1389
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:27,920
He told me, he said, go kill him.

1390
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:32,920
He said he didn't like the idea of me reintroducing listening music, man.

1391
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,660
Do you know how it feels?

1392
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:37,780
Do you know how it feels?

1393
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:40,820
Oh, I say that feels good.

1394
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:41,840
Oh, oh!

1395
00:53:42,080 --> 00:53:46,000
Are you a sub-genius?

1396
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,200
You know, we could use that machine I built up the other day.

1397
00:53:48,200 --> 00:53:51,640
There was a big red machine on the back of this truck

1398
00:53:51,640 --> 00:53:53,280
that said, O-Nan on it.

1399
00:53:53,860 --> 00:53:55,120
The O-Nan device.

1400
00:53:55,580 --> 00:53:55,960
Yes!

1401
00:53:57,460 --> 00:53:58,440
I'm going, going to get your bike.

1402
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:01,560
I'll take three of them O-Nan devices and one orgasmatron.

1403
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:04,660
And I'll take a prior six pack.

1404
00:54:04,980 --> 00:54:06,380
And six pack to go.

1405
00:54:06,380 --> 00:54:08,840
And also a bucket of chicken legers, too.

1406
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:10,780
I'm sneaking.

1407
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:17,220
That's coming over the phone lines.

1408
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,800
That was, what the hell was that?

1409
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:23,060
Now see when the...

1410
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:23,760
Is that the X-Men?

1411
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:24,880
Is that the X-Men?

1412
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:25,740
X-Men.

1413
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:27,040
No.

1414
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:33,120
That's the X's.

1415
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,640
That's, no, that's, it's Finnegan's wife.

1416
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:35,640


1417
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:35,640


1418
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:35,640


1419
00:54:37,380 --> 00:54:38,860
Wait, that's a tent.

1420
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:41,220
I think it was...

1421
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:42,860
But I know Bob wouldn't lie!

1422
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:46,040
The X-Men raptor is the one true escape.

1423
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:47,260
I like Finnegan's bike.

1424
00:54:47,420 --> 00:54:48,080
I like the X-Men.

1425
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,120
It's great right now.

1426
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,040
Oh, stop.

1427
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:56,240
He's trying to get...

1428
00:54:56,240 --> 00:54:58,080
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

1429
00:54:58,460 --> 00:54:58,920
48.

1430
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:00,500
It's a longitude.

1431
00:55:01,320 --> 00:55:02,700
It's a longitude, longitude.

1432
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:03,880
He's giving us direction.

1433
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,620
The X, I told you it was the X-Men.

1434
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:08,200
How could you tell them apart from a piece of wood?

1435
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:09,560
Like the console.

1436
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:10,840
You said you can't.

1437
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:11,640
They look like they're not.

1438
00:55:12,380 --> 00:55:14,400
Then he said they were sprouting beanies and ears,

1439
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:17,000
and some of them were carried around like that super wax,

1440
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:18,860
turtle wax for cars and stuff,

1441
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,600
and some of them were starting their own businesses.

1442
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,420
But you know...

1443
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:24,520
I'll just lose connection to you.

1444
00:55:24,660 --> 00:55:25,680
What the hell am I doing?

1445
00:55:25,800 --> 00:55:26,760
Oh, I'm cleaning my mind.

1446
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,040
I'm sorry.

1447
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:30,880
I just kind of drifted.

1448
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:32,720
I was in my other world.

1449
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,580
One of them American Airlines.

1450
00:55:35,620 --> 00:55:38,080
Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain.

1451
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:41,100
He's got his eye socket pulled out.

1452
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,840
Well, I think it's about time now.

1453
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,580
We tipped her.

1454
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,240
We tipped her.

1455
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,480
He's looking at his watch.

1456
00:55:51,620 --> 00:55:52,280
We dipped her.

1457
00:55:53,540 --> 00:55:55,440
Dip the prairie squid, did you say?

1458
00:55:55,580 --> 00:55:56,720
I'm ready for some of that.

1459
00:55:57,500 --> 00:55:58,840
Dip a prairie squid.

1460
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:00,940
Oh, it's that other tape.

1461
00:56:01,060 --> 00:56:01,900
That's what it is.

1462
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:04,200
Chocolate-covered prairie squid, did you say?

1463
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:04,940
Yeah.

1464
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:05,380
Yeah.

1465
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,000
That's a record.

1466
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:08,900
We probably don't have time.

1467
00:56:09,360 --> 00:56:09,800
Man!

1468
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:14,040
Did I just wreck your computer there?

1469
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,100
Oh!

1470
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:20,260
I just stepped on his guitar, folks.

1471
00:56:20,620 --> 00:56:22,020
It's been a long day.

1472
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,140
Let's try going to the farm.

1473
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:26,740
What a gluttony.

1474
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:28,800
You're going to pay for that.

1475
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:30,820
Every bit to the crowd.

1476
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,820
Take it again.

1477
00:56:31,980 --> 00:56:34,240
I hope you're not.

1478
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,880
What do you have to say to yourself?

1479
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,400
I hope you're satisfied.

1480
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,080
Well, with the surviving populace

1481
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,860
clinging tenaciously to useless routines

1482
00:56:43,860 --> 00:56:49,120
in hopes of retaining that one last tiny vestige of sanity,

1483
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,540
you know, the least necessary

1484
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:54,920
in most superfluous aspects of society,

1485
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,140
such as bureaucracy and red tape,

1486
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,860
will remain in place down to the final possible moment.

1487
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,080
Mm-hmm.

1488
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,600
The deorgasm popped out.

1489
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:10,860
The depleted mankind-ordnance of the unruptured subgeniuses

1490
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:14,840
will be left to handle the machinery of state or snake hunt.

1491
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:19,220
1-4-0-3-0-6

1492
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:24,140
And, dear friends, that's where the tape ended.

1493
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:27,200
Dallas, Texas, 7-5-2-1-4

1494
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:32,480
Leaving us here in the silence of only the air conditioning noise.

1495
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:34,960
Although I should...

1496
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:35,580
I should...

1497
00:57:35,580 --> 00:57:39,280
Fill up that noise, giving you the address of ESO Radio,

1498
00:57:39,560 --> 00:57:45,500
where you can write for information on the tapes

1499
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:49,420
and loads of Cowboy Dave and Chaz,

1500
00:57:49,420 --> 00:57:51,780
and they've got a little magazine and so forth,

1501
00:57:51,820 --> 00:57:53,340
and that number is...

1502
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:59,200
P.O. Box 81555.

1503
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,680
That's P.O. Box 81555

1504
00:58:02,680 --> 00:58:04,880
in Cleveland, Ohio.

1505
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:08,860
Zip code 44181.

1506
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:12,200
That's P.O. Box 81555.

1507
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:14,480
44181.

1508
00:58:14,760 --> 00:58:17,280
That's 44181.

1509
00:58:21,260 --> 00:58:25,940
That number you can write to for free information on just what this show is

1510
00:58:25,940 --> 00:58:28,580
and where Bob is.

1511
00:58:28,720 --> 00:58:31,080
I know you want to know where Bob is, and I'm about to tell you.

1512
00:58:32,980 --> 00:58:34,400
Just write to Bob.

1513
00:58:35,580 --> 00:58:37,040
Or the Hour of Slack.

1514
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:38,440
Or Subgenius Foundation.

1515
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:42,660
At Post Office Box

1516
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:47,760
140306

1517
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:50,540
in mighty Dallas, Texas.

1518
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:52,600
That's Box 14306

1519
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:53,700
in Dallas, Texas

1520
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:57,460
7-5-2-1-4

1521
00:58:57,460 --> 00:58:59,480
You have to have that zip code

1522
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:01,000
75214

1523
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:01,480
and you...

1524
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:04,680
There's just no telling what comes up next.

1525
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:05,320
Or...

1526
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:08,140
We had...

1527
00:59:08,140 --> 00:59:10,240
We had the script, my friends.

1528
00:59:10,280 --> 00:59:11,440
We had the script.

1529
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,880
But Bob has it now.

1530
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,360
Just to give you an example of

1531
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,160
had this been an actual Hour of Slack show.

1532
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,160
Of course, here's the...

1533
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:31,700
It's kind of a description of a generic...

1534
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:34,180
This is your token Subgenius Radio show for now.

1535
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:34,620
So you don't have to...

1536
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,180
You don't have to pick it up.

1537
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:36,080
You don't have to pick it up.

1538
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,080


1539
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,080


1540
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:36,980
Poor devil's gone.

1541
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:37,660
You don't have to pick it up.

1542
00:59:37,660 --> 00:59:37,980
Um...

1543
00:59:37,980 --> 00:59:40,780
The generic token, um...

1544
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:44,100
Sampled mix of radio preachers

1545
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:45,360
saying ridiculous things.

1546
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:49,880
I don't know how it sounds.

1547
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:51,920
Hey, boy.

1548
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:54,640
I'm going to have to search that.

1549
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:58,420
All right.

1550
00:59:59,060 --> 01:00:00,080
Can I have something?

1551
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:01,640
Can I have something?

1552
01:00:01,920 --> 01:00:04,560
Now, imagine driving down the highway at night.

1553
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,200
Scanning your car radio.

1554
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,800
And it lands on the last five minutes that you just heard.

1555
01:00:11,640 --> 01:00:13,060
It gets a bit mixed.

1556
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,300
Preachers mixed with the rhythm.

1557
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,080
Mixed with industrial noise.

1558
01:00:21,680 --> 01:00:23,100
Subgenius Radio Show.

1559
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:27,860
Come here, boy.

1560
01:00:29,360 --> 01:00:32,880
And this is Nathan Vincent's cut.

1561
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:34,020
Nathan Vincent.

1562
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:34,300
overdose.

1563
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:46,140
I look up again by the way things are happening and that's amazing

1564
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:47,820
but he lives in Los Angeles right now

1565
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:50,440
He lives in Dallas.

1566
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:52,400
ending song

1567
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:52,580
and the music has stopped

1568
01:00:52,580 --> 01:00:54,760
I'm too high really

1569
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,360
Okay, you 미들

1570
01:00:56,360 --> 01:00:57,360
are a bit under the weather

1571
01:00:57,360 --> 01:00:58,360
for a little too much

1572
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,540
You know, he has no idea

1573
01:01:00,540 --> 01:01:01,940
who he is

1574
01:01:01,940 --> 01:01:02,100
He's
