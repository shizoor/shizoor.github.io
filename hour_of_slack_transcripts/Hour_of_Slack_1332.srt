1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,580
Ladies and gentlemen, it's my pleasure to bring a man to the stage.

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,320
I saw this guy before he got here. I love him. Please welcome Bob to the stage.

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:10,720
Hello.

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:11,580
Hi.

5
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:18,960
What are you?

6
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:19,740
God.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,920
That's a true story. Hi.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:25,320
I, uh, it's great to be here.

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,620
My cat is squeaky. I have a cat.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,520
Oh, I hate that, Bob. Isn't he dead?

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,580
Well, I was taking a bubble bath with Bob.

12
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,200
Cheese and crackers and gosh darn and some big ditch.

13
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,940
Pandora's box is really sacred to me.

14
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,260
So, okay, let's pretend there is a god.

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,660
Do you really think he's wearing magic underpants?

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:47,860
But, um, so the police actually came and arrested my cat.

17
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,800
And she didn't go to Cat Police Academy to, uh...

18
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,080
Bob, ladies and gentlemen.

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,560
Oh, slacker.

20
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,380
Now, I'm...

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,840
Got no point where I can sort of, like,

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,040
give myself a little slack.

23
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,400
That's beautiful, dude.

24
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,640
I wonder why this microphone smelled weird.

25
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,460
Yeah, it's Bob.

26
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,080
Slack.

27
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,080
I'm feeling it.

28
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,460
For me, I love finding ways to slack.

29
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,900
I seem to do better when I'm acting like it's slack-ass.

30
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,460
Like, I just seem to succeed when I'm acting like it's slack-ass.

31
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,120
That just seems to be the only place where I'm appreciated.

32
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,700
There's some liberation in, uh...

33
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:25,620
In...

34
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,240
In...

35
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:26,800
Slack.

36
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,000
Yeah, it's Bob.

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:28,540
I...

38
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,940
I love to find...

39
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,240
I find a way to love Slack.

40
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,700
And I keep starting and not starting.

41
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:37,140
And then I ask myself, why, little callers, why?

42
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:39,760
But is there an answer?

43
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:44,040
Despite our impact in our large gangling years, uh...

44
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,180
Speak for yourself.

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,500
Charming and incomprehensible banter...

46
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,640
Oh, we just lost contact with the alien.

47
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,380
Well, it's acceptable parameters of wit for a future scenario.

48
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,620
One of these years.

49
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:03,200
Well, the years are over.

50
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:05,080
I think the end of the world already happened.

51
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,660
We all got left behind.

52
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:13,700
Well, as a theological matter, we could spend our time and the show discussing that old chestnut.

53
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:24,000
Let's just say that in the realm of the official church story, people have already made up their minds about what they want to believe.

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,500
There's no amount of debating that'll change that.

55
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,780
That's why I think that we...

56
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,840
The archons of the church...

57
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:40,880
Should drop these old outdated controversies which serve no real purpose and move on to newer and better understanding.

58
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,540
Oh, superstitious, eh?

59
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,440
You know, Bob...

60
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,460
B-b-b-b-Bob got arrested a week before.

61
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:47,500
Oh, he did? For what?

62
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,200
He got in a big brawl and he punched an off-duty cop.

63
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,640
Uh, Bob wouldn't do that.

64
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:05,980
You know what I really loved is playing spin the bottle with Bob. He's incredible.

65
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,820
Uh, Bob's not comfortable talking about this.

66
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,560
Uh, Bob had a bag of acid.

67
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,580
Do they still use acid?

68
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,740
Bob's people do.

69
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:13,440
And a blunt.

70
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:14,000
And a blunt.

71
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,360
For the other thing.

72
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,060
Bob was on the grassy knoll.

73
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,400
Uh...

74
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,420
Bob's not comfortable talking about this.

75
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:24,120
Alright, Bob.

76
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,520
Spread out.

77
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,040
The town where Bob was born.

78
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,740
I'm at Bob's Barbecue.

79
00:03:29,740 --> 00:03:31,500
To attempt the ultimate destroyer challenge.

80
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,520
I only have 45 minutes to take down six pounds of greatest hits.

81
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:39,660
And if I do, I'll be the first person to ever defeat Bob.

82
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,060
The kids may be fine, but you wait much longer and I'm gonna pee in my pants.

83
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:44,240
We're gonna wait, Connie.

84
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,120
Six more minutes.

85
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:51,340
A circle of kids, bobbing their heads and kind of clapping along and laughing.

86
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:56,240
You know, there was a, like a circle of kids, bobbing their heads and kind of clapping along and laughing.

87
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:59,720
You know, there was a, like a circle of kids, bobbing their heads and...

88
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:07,440
Bobby.

89
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,340
Doesn't ask for much.

90
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,460
He puts in a hard day's work.

91
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,260
Why don't you cut him a little slack?

92
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,600
And stop being such a jerk?

93
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,000
No!

94
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,220
What was that?

95
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:26,720
No!

96
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,200
I am set up here for Bob.

97
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:29,720
Bob.

98
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


99
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


100
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


101
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


102
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


103
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


104
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


105
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


106
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


107
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


108
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


109
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


110
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


111
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


112
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


113
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


114
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


115
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


116
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:29,720


117
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,300
Let's see how it works out.

118
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,580
I am set up here for Bob.

119
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,700
Let's see how it works out.

120
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,640
I am set up here for Bob.

121
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:41,820
Okay, I'll find Bobby, but I want you both out of here.

122
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:42,340
But Dad.

123
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:42,920
No, Fox.

124
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,500
I want you both to wait in the car and I'll be out as soon as I find...

125
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:50,840
The Self Genius Power of Squatch.

126
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,280
This is a nice surprise, but aren't you sleeping at your dad's tonight?

127
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:55,340
Uh-huh.

128
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,700
But I forgot something.

129
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:57,300
Uh-oh.

130
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,540
Something about a pink dress.

131
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,240
Yeah, it's my favorite.

132
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,160
I want to wear it to my birthday party tomorrow.

133
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:04,120
Honey, it's in the very front of your closet, okay?

134
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,300
And don't forget the hair thingamajiggy that goes with it in case you want to wear that, too.

135
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:08,260
I won't.

136
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,980
Hair thingamajiggy.

137
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,180
Be right back.

138
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:09,780
Very important.

139
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,320
Get me a hair thingamajiggy.

140
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:11,740
I might...

141
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,100
Very front of the closet.

142
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,640
The guy who plays Bob took off his square pants.

143
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,720
Oh, there's my date.

144
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,940
Oh, who are you going out with tonight?

145
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:21,940
Oh, Bob.

146
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:22,320
You know...

147
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,900
Isn't he the one who drones on so incessantly you call him the Cricket?

148
00:05:25,380 --> 00:05:25,700
No.

149
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,520
I call him the Cricket because he rubs his hands together when he's drunk.

150
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:28,520


151
00:05:28,540 --> 00:05:29,380
They're really fast during...

152
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,920
Powerful switching.

153
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,300
Goodbye.

154
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,620
They bob.

155
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,020
They twist.

156
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,840
They rotate.

157
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,460
They bend.

158
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,060
They weave.

159
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,060
They twist.

160
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:22,040
They bend.

161
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,660
They twist.

162
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,940
They twist.

163
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,380
They twist.

164
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:27,380


165
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:28,520
They twist.

166
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,880
He fought for the title with Rios in Vegas

167
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:39,140
And he pulled him away in round number one

168
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:44,380
So hurry home early, hurry on home

169
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:49,440
Boomer Mancini's fighting Bobby Tracone

170
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,780
Hurry home early, hurry on home

171
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,900
Boomer Mancini's fighting Bobby Tracone

172
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,760
When Alexis Arguello

173
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:09,620
Gave birth to a baby

174
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:24,760
And he was a baby's baby

175
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:25,800
Boom, boom, beating

176
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:28,680
Seven weeks later

177
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,360
He was back in the ring

178
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,820
Some have the speed

179
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,280
And the right combinations

180
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,260
If they can't take the punches

181
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,660
It don't mean a thing

182
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:47,100
So hurry home early, hurry on home

183
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,100
Boomer Mancini's fighting Bobby Tracone

184
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,760
Hurry home early, hurry on home

185
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,640
Boomer Mancini's fighting Bobby Tracone

186
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,560
Hurry

187
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:18,440
Boomer Mancini's fighting Bobby Tracone

188
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,700
Hurry on home early, hurry on home

189
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:24,700


190
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,020
When they asked him who was responsible for the death of Duke who came

191
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,060
He said someone should have stopped the fight

192
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,940
Told me it was him

193
00:08:33,940 --> 00:08:39,180
They made hypocrite judgments after the fact

194
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:44,380
But the name of the game is beheaded back

195
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:48,420
So hurry home early, hurry on home

196
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:48,420


197
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,000
Hurry, hurry on home

198
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,600
Overland sea

199
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,100
We're fighting by the Chaconne

200
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,400
We're fighting by the Chaconne

201
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,400
We're fighting by the Chaconne

202
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:50,680
We're fighting by the Chaconne

203
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:18,720
Hey.

204
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,280
Who is this?

205
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:22,700
What are you wearing?

206
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,280
Combat boots and a parka, you jerk.

207
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:26,940
Who is this?

208
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,580
Bobby, is this you?

209
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,380
You know, whoever this is, this isn't funny.

210
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,800
Yeah, it is.

211
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,660
Assholes.

212
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:44,200
I'm free, remember me

213
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,980
I've been apart and I'm even free

214
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:51,440
I'll play the band from history

215
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,180
I'm free, remember me

216
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,960
I've been apart and I'm even free

217
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,380
I'll play the band from history

218
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,300
Good work, Bob.

219
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,220
Bobby, look.

220
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,660
Bobby, the reason we're here is because...

221
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,140
We really care about you.

222
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,680
The money wasn't gone, the goods weren't gone.

223
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,060
They just changed hands.

224
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,680
And there was a shift.

225
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,660
I've heard people call this a wealth transfer

226
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:30,200
and sometimes I am a little reluctant to use that terminology

227
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,020
because of preconceived notions,

228
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,740
but there is a wealth transfer that is taking place.

229
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:38,920
Fight the breaker, I don't care

230
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:42,920
You know what I'm gonna say

231
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:47,060
Fight the breaker, I don't care

232
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,960
Fight the breaker, I don't care

233
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:47,960


234
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,340
They are bossed up!

235
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,980
Fight the breaker, I don't care

236
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:58,960
Fight the breaker, I don't care

237
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,960
Fight the breaker, I don't care

238
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,300
And friends, now I can pot up Dave,

239
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,240
who's been sitting there...

240
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,140
Babbling.

241
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,280
Babbling to himself.

242
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,040
Completely unpottered.

243
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:17,640
Yes.

244
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:20,580
Yes, I was unpottered and I had to pot him.

245
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,520
Poor fellow.

246
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:25,120
You must have kind of wondered what was going on there.

247
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,140
These fish need to be watered.

248
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,280
And now you're...

249
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:28,980
Pottered and...

250
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:30,380
Pottered and salted.

251
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:34,020
I saw the little light flashing

252
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,760
and we were still like a minute or so

253
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:39,480
from the end of this collage by the large.

254
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,820
And I should mention, friends,

255
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:47,300
now that Dave and Princess Wee and I,

256
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,620
Stang are all together,

257
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,960
that almost everything that we've heard so far

258
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,940
was put together...

259
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,720
Well, the last nine minutes was put together by the large,

260
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,440
including that Warren Zevon song.

261
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:01,280
The long song was by Warren Zevon.

262
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,400
And the other collages,

263
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:08,260
aside from the stooge clips that I located,

264
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,620
all the rest of that was put together

265
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:13,560
by a new collargist,

266
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,380
Reverend Royal Decapitator.

267
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,280
Or Capitator.

268
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:20,020
Collargist?

269
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,820
Maybe he's related to Reverend Tater.

270
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,460
But, yeah, Royal Decapitator.

271
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:26,900
Decapitator.

272
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,800
Yeah, there's more from him.

273
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:33,100
And this is one of those time control shows, friends,

274
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:36,200
because in our time stream,

275
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:38,240
it's Halloween-een.

276
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:41,340
Hibiscus jelly night, as we like to call it here

277
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:42,760
in the land of Paul Bach.

278
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,460
It's tomorrow's Halloween where we are,

279
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,480
but where most...

280
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,960
Most of our listeners probably

281
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,140
won't hear this for two weeks.

282
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:54,480
So it's pointless to go on and on about

283
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,160
the fabulous WCSB Masquerade Ball

284
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,220
that happened last night.

285
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:04,000
It was the third one that has been done

286
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,420
through the invention of our station manager,

287
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,060
Sarah Corrigan.

288
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,540
The great and wonderful Sarah Corrigan.

289
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:11,540
Yeah, who was...

290
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,280
Great class.

291
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,720
And, friends, you can see a hot picture of her

292
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,620
and of...

293
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:18,200
All the other...

294
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:22,360
The women of WCSB, to put it in a sexist way.

295
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,820
Although right now on the screen,

296
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,340
I'm looking at a picture of Dr. Sinister

297
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,420
standing next to J.R. Bob Dobbs.

298
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,140
But even a woman in...

299
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:32,320
I mention this because even the folks

300
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,860
at other stations and other states

301
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:37,480
and other eens that aren't on Halloween

302
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,680
can look at the pictures right now

303
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,540
if you just go to subgenius.com.

304
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:45,860
It's...

305
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,500
We have a special Halloween...

306
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:47,860
We have a Halloween page

307
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,340
with a really...

308
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,840
Real hot picture of Reverend Susie the Flusie.

309
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,320
But there's a link that says Halloween Stash.

310
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,060
And if you run down that a little bit,

311
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:02,060
there'll be a link to WCSB 2011 Masquerade Ball.

312
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,780
Now, I also...

313
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,760
For those who...

314
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,160
When that page is changed after tomorrow,

315
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,760
it'll be a little harder to find those pictures,

316
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:12,660
so I made a tiny URL.

317
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:16,480
You can find it by going to subgenius.com

318
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,580
and Googling...

319
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:18,660
Halloween Pictures.

320
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:22,320
Or you can go to tinyurl.com

321
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,140
slash WCSB11.

322
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,880
The numeral 1-1.

323
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:30,640
Slick.

324
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:32,320
tinyurl.com

325
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,660
slash WCSB11.

326
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:39,680
And I say this because the costumes were great

327
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:41,180
and they are worth looking at.

328
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,920
Princess Wee and I photographed like crazy last night

329
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,520
and I worked all day to get the best pictures.

330
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,740
So Dave, you can look and see what you missed

331
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,840
and I'm really sorry you couldn't be there.

332
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:57,060
Were mind-boggling the detail that people went to.

333
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,100
There was a costume that was larger than a car.

334
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:00,840
Yes.

335
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,480
I'm not sure what he was supposed to be.

336
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,980
It was a big blue cube, sort of.

337
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:05,920
Rectangle.

338
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:06,340
Yeah, brick.

339
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,500
A brick-shaped thing.

340
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:11,380
And it was apparently very soft and bouncy.

341
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,700
You could see people bouncing off of it.

342
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:15,760
So he squished in the door and...

343
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:16,840
I don't know.

344
00:17:16,840 --> 00:17:17,620
How did he get in?

345
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:17,620


346
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:17,620


347
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:17,620


348
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,760
I have no idea how he got through a door with that.

349
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,400
Maybe it was assembled indoors.

350
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,660
I'm kind of disappointed that more local Cleveland subgeniuses

351
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:30,680
don't come to this party.

352
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:31,180
Me too.

353
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:33,300
Except that, how do we know they didn't?

354
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,440
Everybody was in a mask.

355
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,160
That's true.

356
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:37,500
In fact, I found myself sort of...

357
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,320
We were up on a balcony running projection a lot of the time.

358
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,480
We had our own special little projection booth

359
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,800
running monster movie trailers.

360
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,600
And I would lean over the...

361
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,080
I would lean over the balcony and scope out cleavages

362
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,840
and take pictures.

363
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,840
And I realized later that some of the cleavages I'd been stalking

364
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,300
were of personal friends of mine, neighbors,

365
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:03,960
the official plumber of the Church of the Subgenius.

366
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:08,120
And I would never stalk people I know that way.

367
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,000
I only do that with strangers, you know.

368
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,320
But they all had masks on.

369
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:12,960
I didn't know...

370
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,480
Ron Slade from Pyrosonic was there.

371
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,400
And I didn't know he...

372
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:18,760
In one of those V masks.

373
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,720
Well, which is annoying to everybody.

374
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:21,280
All night long.

375
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:25,700
And plus, you must realize that a masked ball is the perfect venue

376
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:28,720
for a kind of a clandestine sex with anything type of thing.

377
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,100
Are you making fun of me, Dave?

378
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,920
Oh, masked ball.

379
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,320
Masked ball, dear.

380
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:36,820
It's another way of using the expression ball.

381
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,620
Okay.

382
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:38,180
Oh.

383
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:39,400
I'm sensitive, I guess.

384
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,020
I should say, you know, in the classical urbane way, I could say...

385
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,380
Well, I'm confused now.

386
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,460
You...

387
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,900
Well, what I meant to say was...

388
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:55,660
But, Dave, I think you would be entertained to look at the photos that are on...

389
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:56,340
Exactly.

390
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,460
...subgenius.com right now.

391
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,000
And the girls at WCSB.

392
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:02,580
Exactly.

393
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:06,860
I see them all the time at meetings and stuff, and they're just kind of in their day clothes.

394
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:09,840
But they were all dressed up last night.

395
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:10,960
Exactly.

396
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:15,920
If you were reading my mind, that masked ball, the guy in the big rubber suit,

397
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,380
if you could tell that was a woman.

398
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:20,260
If you were a woman in that big rubber suit, you'd still be turned on as a man.

399
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,160
Well, the funny thing is...

400
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,380
No matter what they were, you'd be showing leaders who were, you know, dressed up like Frankenstein.

401
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,940
Like, he's hot, you know, dude.

402
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,580
I didn't mention to you earlier, Dave, but after...

403
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,820
We're really beat.

404
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,820
Because we...

405
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:38,740
Princess, we helped with decorations for three days.

406
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:43,260
And then I ended up doing these projections and stuff.

407
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,560
But after it all, after the cleanup, all the bars were closed.

408
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:47,260
We ran over.

409
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:52,000
We ran over to a bar, a gay bar owned by some friends of ours.

410
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,180
Oh, you are going to be...

411
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,180
Old friend, a couple whose old friend's Princess Wee.

412
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,000
My oldest friends in Cleveland.

413
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:05,480
And they had bought a gay bar, and they let us in after hours just to visit with them.

414
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,720
And I was very proud of myself.

415
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:13,440
There were some really hot-looking cross-dressers, and I was able to tell which ones were cross-dressers

416
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:16,540
and which one was actually a...

417
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:18,600
Woman, I think.

418
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,220
We'll see what you've actually done.

419
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:21,440
What a great bar.

420
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,420
And they said that it's really not...

421
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,600
I mean, it's not outwardly a gay bar.

422
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,800
It's just that everyone gay knows that they're welcome there.

423
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:32,140
But sometimes you go there, and it's just like any other bar.

424
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,940
Yeah, it's not like a disco place.

425
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,600
It's kind of a family-oriented gay bar.

426
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:44,000
Through the walls and weird, strange drinks being drunk by people with earrings in their...

427
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,980
Well, there was a little...

428
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,620
There were...

429
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,260
There is.

430
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:47,580
There was a little bit of that.

431
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,500
Oh, especially on Halloween.

432
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:49,980
At least symbologically.

433
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,400
Yeah, they said it was packed earlier.

434
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,120
I don't think we can give the name of this place.

435
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:59,780
The floor was strewn with black feathers, and I said,

436
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,160
oh, someone must have been in here with a black boa.

437
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,220
And they said, oh, no.

438
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:08,120
That was someone here playing the smoke monster from Lost.

439
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:09,120
That's right.

440
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:09,480
Wow.

441
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:15,120
The dad was dressed as the mom, and the mom was dressed as the dad,

442
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:17,060
which was a little disturbing to me.

443
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:20,180
We could tell where it is, or maybe not.

444
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:20,800
No.

445
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:24,160
Oh, there's pictures at the very end of the photo gallery.

446
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,220
So, you know, you can figure it out from the photos.

447
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:30,220
And my write-up.

448
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,900
I wrote up.

449
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,140
Yes.

450
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:33,440
I got up this morning and wrote up all of our adventures.

451
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:33,880
Yeah.

452
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:36,220
Kind of like a beatnik, once again.

453
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:41,100
If you really wanted to lay kind of a leveling, you know, sociologically,

454
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:44,580
a leveling effect upon the entire experience,

455
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,200
what you failed to note was,

456
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:51,120
the wind power, the gas passing party that took spontaneously,

457
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,220
took part right, place right in the middle of the dance floor

458
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:58,420
at precisely one o'clock, three or four people.

459
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:01,120
Then all of a sudden, the whole, everybody was trying to.

460
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,060
Is that what that smell was?

461
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,660
That's a very foul event.

462
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:12,080
Now you're looking at it from a different perspective entirely.

463
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,620
And I wish I wouldn't have taken you there, but I was lonely.

464
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,560
.

465
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:16,560


466
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:17,200
.

467
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:17,360
.

468
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


469
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


470
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


471
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


472
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


473
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


474
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


475
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


476
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


477
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


478
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


479
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


480
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


481
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


482
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


483
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


484
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


485
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,360


486
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:47,380


487
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:47,760
.

488
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:55,120
.

489
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:56,760
.

490
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:56,760


491
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:01,300
.

492
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:01,480
.

493
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:01,660
.

494
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,400
.

495
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,400


496
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,440
.

497
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:02,480
.

498
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:14,240
.

499
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:14,520
.

500
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:14,540
.

501
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:16,700
.

502
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:16,720
.

503
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,180
.

504
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:17,340
.

505
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:17,340


506
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:17,340


507
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:17,360
.

508
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,360


509
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:17,360


510
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:19,960
No, it's, yeah, fresh, that's right, or something.

511
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,100
Is it? I don't know.

512
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:31,540
The Reverend Abnorm Nihill somehow got hold of a copy of just the music without the vocals.

513
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:35,000
So if I knew the words, we could karaoke to it.

514
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:42,100
But it certainly is kind of karaoke worthy without the words, even more so.

515
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:46,320
Yeah, I'm not feeling snappy enough to sing along with it.

516
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:48,720
I wouldn't do that to the listeners anyway.

517
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,600
We've done it a few times.

518
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,620
Well, you wouldn't, you know, it would be cynical to try and advance your physical body

519
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,180
or superimpose your physique on anything.

520
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,320
Well, that's why we're on the radio and not on the television.

521
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:03,940
Exactly.

522
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:12,620
Now, we've discovered an interesting thing on the Internet a week ago.

523
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,060
The German newspaper...

524
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,880
Der Spiegel or something.

525
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,340
Is that how you pronounce that?

526
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:20,980
I forget.

527
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,040
Einstages Spiegel.

528
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:32,780
They did a long and fairly accurate, as far as I can tell, article about the Church of the Subgenius.

529
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,480
Although they used an illustration of the flying spaghetti monster on it.

530
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:39,860
And not a picture of Bob Dobbs.

531
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:42,400
But it was in German.

532
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,040
And Philo sent me a link.

533
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:47,940
Philo Drummond, Bob's close personal friend.

534
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:53,540
And I copied and pasted it into Google Translator.

535
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:57,260
And got an English translation that was very twisted.

536
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,620
Because it was done by a computer.

537
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:05,160
For instance, wherever the word pipe was used, the computer translated that as whistle.

538
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,380
Because he was thinking like pan pipes or something.

539
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:14,920
Then Legume took it and pasted it into Babelfish.

540
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:22,840
And we're going to read the computer generated translation of this long German article to you now.

541
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,880
And we're going to take turns doing it.

542
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,760
And I shall start.

543
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:29,800
The title of it was...

544
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,560
Was der Helle.

545
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,800
In German.

546
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:33,980
Was der Helle.

547
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,940
And it reads according to Babelfish.

548
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,660
What to hell you believe!

549
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,240
What there you do!

550
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:44,360
Walk the preacher of his pulpit down.

551
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,040
But I'm not going to do that.

552
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:45,320
Quote.

553
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:50,280
Drag your back by the day and sell bodies and soul to a heap of normallows?

554
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,700
The camera holds an office worker.

555
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:59,820
Behind whom monstrous superiors develop themselves.

556
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:05,800
In place of faces they have enormous fleischfarben smiley.

557
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:12,300
Are you it suffering to have always debt feelings, however no sex?

558
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,020
In the red light the lips smile.

559
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:20,000
The lips of the preacher forgave themselves to the diabolischen grinsen.

560
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,340
There is an answer dear friend.

561
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:28,000
Obviously this is all from the subgenius commercial on subgenius.com.

562
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,500
I'm glad you qualified it with that.

563
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:37,620
Women, men and children in white smocks and with whistles in the mouth hold cash notes up.

564
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,960
That's my son and daughter in that scene by the way.

565
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:45,000
On their armlets they carry formed smocks.

566
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,000
Swastikas from whistles.

567
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,460
Their eyes begin glowing.

568
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,440
The preacher demands, do penalty.

569
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,140
Quit your work.

570
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:55,680
Mach you noosly.

571
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,880
And praise, praise Bob.

572
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,660
That's my cue isn't it?

573
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:01,960
Yes.

574
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:08,240
Well can I first preface this by saying that I think that it's more than a case of bad translation.

575
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,360
I think it's bad journalism too.

576
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:14,000
Who switched on late 1998?

577
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:15,580
1991.

578
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,920
1991 enough.

579
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:32,580
The music transmitter MTV tripped over this bizarre nonsense verb eclipse in which the self-appointed Reverend Ivan Stang recruited fully in bronzed for its religion.

580
00:27:33,920 --> 00:27:38,720
In its absurdity the film machen, the film, excuse me.

581
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:44,280
In its absurdity the film can work like a mixture from the Nightmare and Monty Python sketch.

582
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,120
But...

583
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,440
Oh no no no.

584
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:47,240
That that that.

585
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,620
Put in church subgenius the of.

586
00:27:50,980 --> 00:28:00,680
Created at end of 1970s of two transverse heads of Texas as a folk joke.

587
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:05,780
But nonsense verse, Versal Bestang itself.

588
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,040
What?

589
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,500
I'm sorry I...

590
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:12,040
That's all I can make out of that.

591
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,260
Versal Bestang.

592
00:28:14,260 --> 00:28:14,640
Bestangity.

593
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:20,780
That's probably one of those German words that is like ten English sentences.

594
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:25,020
Until it became a full grown religious organization.

595
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:28,640
God, an invisible space monster.

596
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:42,540
Everything began with a small lampoon which Douglas's Smith, that's my human street name by the way, and its friend Steve Wilcox, also known as Dr. Philodrumon,

597
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:46,220
distributed in the year 1979 in Dallas.

598
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,840
In large type characters prankty on it.

599
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,040
Morning ends the world.

600
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,240
And you could die thereby.

601
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,800
And directly under it, tiny small,

602
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:59,200
Naja probably not.

603
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,300
Question?

604
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,320
No matter, however no matter reads on.

605
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:05,340
Then 14 sides.

606
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,400
A long chaotic collage came from illustrations of UFOs, cowboys, and whistle-sailers.

607
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:12,520
And then a long chaotic collage came from illustrations of UFOs, cowboys, and whistle-sailers.

608
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:28,660
And then a long chaotic collage came from illustrations of UFOs, cowboys, and whistle-sailers.

609
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,240
And then and COBRE clowns became the reshcart in its own Russia myth.

610
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:29,240


611
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:29,700
pixels.

612
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:29,700


613
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:29,700


614
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:29,700


615
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,180
I'm way better, I myself, ithkah I'm unique andispotable.

616
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,180


617
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,180


618
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,180


619
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:30,900
I don't like to say it's a big crowd of images.

620
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:30,900


621
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:30,900


622
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:30,900


623
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:32,940
Well, it's not too far away there in Southern California,

624
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:37,160
the largest cause of theoïtte in the ancient Pre Testament.

625
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:41,920
The Electorates Slings bathroom.

626
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:50,040
Dr. Philo Drummond and Reverend Ivan Stang described their church was whistle a smoking man face,

627
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:54,420
which they had stolen from an advert of the 50s.

628
00:29:54,420 --> 00:30:00,280
They sealed it a Highland Smith on J.R. Bob Dobbs.

629
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:06,060
The quotation marks clarify its holy light and are always written.

630
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,260
Was a most successful dealer of all times.

631
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:16,680
1953 appeared Bob on a built television god.

632
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:22,100
According to Smith, an invisible space monster.

633
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:29,700
It revealed Bob that it had to help humans, their slacks, to become conscious,

634
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:34,780
whereby the meaning of slack was for each humans different.

635
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:40,240
It helps humans since then to save its slackness.

636
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:46,520
Back from a world conspiracy which wants to etcherson it by them nervage work.

637
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,280
Your cue, Dave.

638
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:56,560
The lampoon worked like a mixture from religious parody and data work of art.

639
00:30:56,800 --> 00:31:01,120
It raised bulldada to most banal and things with deepest meanings.

640
00:31:02,020 --> 00:31:06,500
From front to in the back, God was obviously enshponen.

641
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:10,240
The subgenie, in reality, descended from the...

642
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,620
Yeti.

643
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:14,260
But humans did not hold to believe in it.

644
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,420
I paraphrased it.

645
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:18,820
Yes, I noticed because you left out the...

646
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,660
Oh no, you did say it was completely obviously ersponen.

647
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:23,880
Ersponen.

648
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,380
Whatever that.

649
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,680
Ersponen.

650
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:26,700
It's a nice word.

651
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:31,880
Ersmock work in artist circles became fast well known.

652
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:39,020
The musicians of the pop band Devo, heard in the background, and Frank, spelled like French money.

653
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,240
Frank, spelled like French money.

654
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:40,240


655
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:43,580
Frank Zappa became soon likewise Bob.

656
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:50,940
Jullengern, such as star comic seichner Robert Crumb, creator of Fritz the Cat.

657
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:59,200
When it began to recruit to its comic series, Weirdo, for the subgenius church, the wave was not to be stopped any longer.

658
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:05,020
1983 published the church, their first holy book, the book of the subgenius.

659
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,600
It contained a collection of abstruse welfare promises.

660
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,240
It contained a collection of abstruse welfare promises.

661
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,040
Quote,

662
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:19,700
Illustrations of full UFOs .

663
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,300
Moderates of the

664
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,840
erasmus.

665
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:27,980
Thank you.

666
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,700
You are still a gangster.

667
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:29,960
Like the abstruse welfare need.

668
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:29,960


669
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:30,600
I realize that counts and what is not in between.

670
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:38,760
atri Council I would authorize thiswnież was my group Anti arri��고m который

671
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,680
and their supporters around the church were perhaps lunatically,

672
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:49,200
however always also lunatically, maintenance Sam.

673
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:56,140
Even when the end of the world approached on 5 July 1998,

674
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:07,440
then the religion father stated extraterrestrials from the planet X would appear in order to destroy the world.

675
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:13,740
The members of the church of the subgenius would have to fear, however, nothing.

676
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:23,940
After presenting its membership card, the sex gotten of the planet X would inlet it into its escape caps

677
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:27,360
and from the destruction of the earth would save.

678
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:31,360
That's mine again?

679
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,120
Yes, Dave.

680
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:37,420
I see that I missed a whole paragraph because mine starts with the subgenius.

681
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:40,580
He took it like they took everything else with humor.

682
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,300
Well, I'll tell you what.

683
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,920
Let's stop reading this right now.

684
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:52,540
And I will do your missing part in a minute.

685
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,660
But let's just listen to some more collage-y stuff.

686
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,620
Oh, because this is great.

687
00:33:57,460 --> 00:34:05,200
There's a couple of minutes in, you will hear a clip from a Tarzan movie from the 40s.

688
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,260
Tarzan's Desert Mystery, 1980.

689
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:12,140
1943, which stars a character based on Susie the Flusie,

690
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,540
who plays someone named Connie.

691
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,760
And listen to the name of the horse.

692
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,960
This will be coming up right, and just hold tight, Dave, for about three minutes while we play this stuff.

693
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:23,740
I think there's burning.

694
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:24,340
Okay.

695
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:25,200
Hey, everybody.

696
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:26,280
It's Bob.

697
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,600
Hey, hi, everyone.

698
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:28,960
Hi.

699
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,060
Hi, indeed.

700
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:31,800
No, seriously, hello.

701
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:32,140
Yeah.

702
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,280
It's great to be here tonight.

703
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:33,880
Yeah.

704
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:34,880
You know, it is so.

705
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,500
Honestly, like, you know, you're here, I'm here.

706
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,420
All these people.

707
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,580
People are here, and, you know, that's very cool.

708
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,540
It's very, very cool.

709
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,580
You're high.

710
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:43,140
No.

711
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,580
I smell marijuana on you.

712
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:46,860
Well, check that.

713
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:48,200
How about medical marijuana?

714
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,440
You're not sick.

715
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,740
It's for work-related stress.

716
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,560
For stress related to working with Bob.

717
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,260
Hey, you think it'll work for me?

718
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:57,140
Because I have to work with me all the time.

719
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,920
Make it fast.

720
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,260
In real time.

721
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:03,100
Unlocking the secrets of the O.T.E. box.

722
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,080
Wow, that sure is a complicated chunk of technological gear.

723
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,860
Is that there in your, uh, dexter hand?

724
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:10,920
Let's see if anything.

725
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,560
What the heck is that thing?

726
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,100
Is it a...

727
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,660
Tells us if there's life on the show.

728
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,400
You're recording over his show.

729
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:17,060
Really?

730
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,000
He doesn't need his show.

731
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,320
I need my show.

732
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,000
You're recording over his show with a higher quality show of lesser quantity.

733
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,860
And he can't even hear this right now.

734
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:31,780
Even though it won't last as long, those few seconds that exist will be of such a mountain.

735
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:36,360
This is where we balance and find that point of equal memory.

736
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:37,140
This is where the stone...

737
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,860
The stone daughters of Niobe...

738
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:45,980
...and produce on a scale in supply and demand that quantity which is perfect for that price.

739
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:56,080
It was said that in the city of Thebes, the brass statue of Prince Memnon gave a shriek each morning as the sun's rays touched it.

740
00:35:56,120 --> 00:36:06,360
It made this strange grating cry, but that was simply because of the expanding metal and a common scientific phenomenon.

741
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,120
The universe is...

742
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:10,020
...a superstitious presence never could understand it.

743
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,280
...a superstitious presence never could understand it.

744
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:15,080
...was not the god speaking at the break of day through the statue of Prince Memnon.

745
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:17,480
...or was it?

746
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:20,160
The choice is yours.

747
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,920
What are you gonna believe?

748
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,620
Choose well.

749
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:23,260
Memnon.

750
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,320
Okay, muscles, there's my Greyhound for Bir Harare.

751
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:31,620
Wait! Jane, our wild horse!

752
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,280
Here, that's Connie's bracelet!

753
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,880
What is it, Connie?

754
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,640
How do you like that?

755
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,720
Amir is tipping the sheik off that Hendrix is a crook and a foreign agent.

756
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:48,680
Amir says he can prove that Hendrix has been arming the border tribesmen so that he can take over the whole country.

757
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,840
What is it, Jane? What's the matter?

758
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,000
Connie, look!

759
00:37:01,140 --> 00:37:02,300
Jane, get out of sight!

760
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:05,860
What's the matter?

761
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:11,260
And Jane-er did get out of sight. We made Jane-er get out of sight, actually.

762
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:29,840
Before the Tarzan, there was some puzzling evidence show from KPFA in Berkeley with Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Howe, which you can hear many episodes of at QuiveringBrain.com, which is Philo's truly insane website.

763
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:35,220
It's also got all the music that the Swingin' Love Corps has ever recorded anywhere.

764
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:45,100
And Puzzling Evidence TV on YouTube, which has some really embarrassing pictures of me as a very, very young person.

765
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,400
And also dressed like a woman, as usual. I mean, not as usual, as per your style.

766
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,040
It'll make your brain quiver.

767
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,800
Now, let's get back to this German article. I'm going to read over your missing part real fast, Dave.

768
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:05,100
Well, it doesn't start with, surely most religious stress.

769
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:05,200
Well, it doesn't start with, surely most religious stress.

770
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:05,200


771
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:10,280
No, it starts with, naturally the end of the world was missing. Like your printer.

772
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,920
Okay, I don't have it.

773
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,700
Well, I'll do it in a Dave accent. Naturally the end of the world was missing. See, it sounds just like Dave.

774
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:32,340
But the subgeni did not disturb that. They simply spread rumors. The calendar go evenly wrongly and the year 1998 still at all did not enter.

775
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:35,120
Or one had read the year in version.

776
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:35,200
Or one had read the year in version.

777
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:35,320
Well, but it was!

778
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:40,640
And then, conversely, and comes the end of the world, only 8,991.

779
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:46,280
89, 91. Which, if you turn it upside down, it says 1998, okay.

780
00:38:46,760 --> 00:39:00,280
Church founder, Douglas Smith, they spelled my name wrong there, let itself fit with springs still on 5 July of his fellow believers on a camping site in New York, Wisteria.

781
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:05,180
For his mistake symbolically tars and thrones.

782
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:13,400
into a pond. It wasn't really tar. It was honey. But Papa Joe Mama said it was motor oil and

783
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:19,280
everyone believed it. Also, it was beautiful half-dressed women who stripped me and threw

784
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:26,520
me into the pond. Subsequently, the subgenie went home again to the home and the church explained

785
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:35,980
from now on 5 July as the holiday. At this X-Day is to be gehuldigt in the future, also outcurving

786
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:42,320
celebrations the possible end of the world. Finally, one could be safe never whether the

787
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:51,700
sexgottenen would not go past this year. Over the years, the X-Day developed as an alternative

788
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:55,960
festival of several days with wildly disguised participants,

789
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:07,440
rushing trinkgelagen and appearances of artists and skirt volume. From the end of the world,

790
00:40:07,520 --> 00:40:17,060
apparently no one wanted to be able to be spoiled the fun. Why a goat? Everyone understood this fun.

791
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:25,320
That had to experience Rachel Bevilacqua, wife of the former subgenius manager Steve Bevilacqua,

792
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,320
also known as Jesus.

793
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:38,580
In December 2005, at the own body, the New Yorker judges James P. Punch, you withdraw the custody for

794
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:45,500
her son from first marriage because his father, the judge photo of their participation in a X-Day,

795
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:54,100
had passed on. Whereupon to see in as a clown made up man who carried an enormous dollar character

796
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,540
with a Christos.

797
00:40:55,540 --> 00:41:07,680
Christos passion parody as cross on the back was Rachel, the heart on their back to paint themselves and a man with a

798
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:15,020
Christianity is dumb t-shirt. Judge Punch called the party pictures, quote, disturbing.

799
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:25,300
The church of the subgenius then remembers Bevilacqua in their blog seemed to it deeply suspicious.

800
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:37,460
Particularly dubiously, two photos seemed to it on which Rachel into a scarce costume dressed held a pop mushy

801
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:50,280
in the hand. It obviously suspected an occultist symbol behind the tinkered animal head and again asked again and again,

802
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:52,320
why a goat?

803
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:55,460
Bevilacqua tried to explain to him.

804
00:41:55,540 --> 00:42:01,060
That everything had been only fun, but Punch did not let itself confuse.

805
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:12,440
It insulted it as perverse, called the X-Day sex orgy and awarded the custody for its son to their ex man.

806
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:24,600
The subgenie took it like they took everything with humor. They took donated blood and sold t-shirts with why a goat.

807
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:34,560
One and a half years persisted the law case until the suspected Bob follower in the summer 2007, their son again back yet.

808
00:42:35,380 --> 00:42:38,080
Perhaps the judge never still the joke got.

809
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:38,880
Yeah.

810
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:41,940
I'm sorry.

811
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:43,560
I said that was a paraphrase again.

812
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:47,200
I can tell that your printer isn't working, Dave.

813
00:42:48,220 --> 00:42:50,140
But I got the sweet note.

814
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,580
So this is like translated from German by a computer and then translated into English.

815
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:54,580


816
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:54,580


817
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,440
So this is translated by Dave.

818
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,020
Through the Dave device.

819
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,000
The Dave device has translated it even more.

820
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:02,940
Even more so.

821
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:04,400
The perfect joke.

822
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:10,040
It likes it so heavily pleases to be because the subgenius plays again.

823
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:11,500
Oh, wait.

824
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,060
Speaking of playing again, Devo stopped.

825
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,320
I'm going to turn on the flying Ryan brothers.

826
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:17,520
Oh, man.

827
00:43:18,420 --> 00:43:22,460
And again with the question whether all the insanity is now a joke or not.

828
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:24,560
The official website subgenius is now a joke.

829
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:24,560


830
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,340
The religion calls the largest joke which has ever told.

831
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:39,700
And a usual slogan of the religious community reads excrete on the others if they do not stand fun.

832
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:49,320
Completely obviously the cult with its motives makes itself merry over other religions cordially.

833
00:43:50,080 --> 00:43:53,820
It is at the same time protests, however, again and again.

834
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:54,540
Always.

835
00:43:54,540 --> 00:43:56,780
And all this is meant quite serious.

836
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:07,660
For the subgeni, the border between Ernst, E-R-N-S-T, and Witz, W-I-T-Z, seems to be flowing.

837
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:20,320
Douglas Smith, The Paradox Explained on 8 June 2007 in the religion critical Dogma Free America in such a way to podcast.

838
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:24,520
It is a verishoong of superstition.

839
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:24,520


840
00:44:24,540 --> 00:44:27,180
It is a verishoong of superstitious tranks and egomanen.

841
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:31,260
But it also is the one true religion.

842
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,440
Why not both?

843
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:41,560
If one regards religions and jokes exactly, both are actually not at all different so.

844
00:44:41,860 --> 00:44:48,900
And if you combine both, you have the perfect religion at the end and the perfect joke.

845
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:56,780
Surely most religions stress irony and insanity of the church of the subgenius.

846
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:08,020
Whether the spaghetti or a monster, a cash point dispenser of krachen, as religious animals, holy animals in a community together.

847
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:15,580
One daily arranged the shrags and merriest of them for you in art gagery.

848
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:18,680
Or in the art gallery.

849
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:18,880
Yes.

850
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,020
In the art gallery.

851
00:45:21,080 --> 00:45:25,020
I noticed I translated prairie squid as kraken.

852
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,000
Kraken.

853
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,560
Yes.

854
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,940
K-R-A-K-K-E-N.

855
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,400
K-R-K-E-N.

856
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:31,660
Kraken.

857
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:37,980
The mythical giant squid or octopus that would drag ships down to the bottom of the ocean.

858
00:45:38,220 --> 00:45:40,980
I've seen it in Pirates of the Caribbean 3, I think.

859
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:47,280
Well, I think when they see the kraken above the eyeball in the end of the septipus,

860
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:53,500
and the septic sores are exposed, then they get, you know, they see the smiling face of Dobbs there.

861
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:55,800
It opens the door.

862
00:45:56,020 --> 00:46:03,020
So that was the Babelfish translation of an article about the church from the biggest German,

863
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:06,900
it's like the Time magazine of Germany, I think.

864
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,020
Yes, thanks Dr. Legume.

865
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:11,240
And what a strange find.

866
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:16,820
Now if The Economist comes out with an article, and you might even be quoted.

867
00:46:16,820 --> 00:46:19,300
We'll translate that one into German and read it.

868
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:19,660
Yeah.

869
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:26,420
I could probably, we should, you know what we ought to do is take the Babelfish translation

870
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:31,800
and translate that into Spanish, and then translate that back into English.

871
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:32,340
Yeah.

872
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:33,900
It's a game of telephone.

873
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:36,120
That'll take care of our shows forever.

874
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:40,420
Dr. Sinister just walked in, did you see the photo on the...

875
00:46:40,420 --> 00:46:42,420
It's kind of creepy actually seeing it.

876
00:46:43,540 --> 00:46:44,820
There's a photo on the...

877
00:46:44,820 --> 00:46:46,800
It's a good thing I'm in disguise, because I really don't want to be seen.

878
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:46,800


879
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,240
I don't like being exposed like that.

880
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:56,100
It's a picture, I deliberately had a picture on the screen here of Dr. Sinister as a FBI, he was security.

881
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,280
He's ultra-uber disguised.

882
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:05,740
And he's standing next to Bob, who is not disguised, but is looking rather the worse for wear and wrinkles.

883
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:11,080
By the way, one of my favorite jokes of all time, what comes between fear and sex?

884
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,940
There should be a logical answer to that.

885
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:16,300
Yeah.

886
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:17,720
Fünf.

887
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:19,240
Delightful apprehension.

888
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:19,900
Fünf.

889
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,160
Fünf?

890
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:21,900
Fünf.

891
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:22,940
Fünf.

892
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:30,120
Eins, zwei, drei, vier, fünf, sechs, fünf.

893
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,640
Oh man.

894
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:35,720
Now soon you have to know how to count in German to get that joke.

895
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,040
Yeah, fünf is the magic number.

896
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:42,260
Although I can count in Lakota, I can't count in German.

897
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,920
It's funny because they don't say twenty-five.

898
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:45,920


899
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:45,920


900
00:47:45,940 --> 00:47:47,140
They say four and twenty.

901
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,160
Vier und zwanzig.

902
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,260
This is like four and twenty blackbirds baked in a pie.

903
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:55,580
Fünfundzwanzig, sechsundzwanzig, fünfundzwanzig, dreißig.

904
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,560
Ich will das dreitreich.

905
00:47:59,080 --> 00:47:59,560
Nein.

906
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,000
Du sprichst so gut.

907
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,280
I'd like to see the original German version actually.

908
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:10,560
Once upon a time when I was in college, which I never finished, but I took a course in international communication.

909
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:13,400
Is that why you're still at this college radio station?

910
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,880
Oh, there's people here who actually did graduate.

911
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:24,000
But there was a paper I had to write for my international communication course and I had to take a big news item.

912
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:29,200
And I took a look at different major, major news outlets from different countries.

913
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:41,840
I looked at what Le Monde had printed in France and what El Pais had printed in Spain and what the Xinhua News Agency in China had printed.

914
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:43,600
Don't forget the Pigaran.

915
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:49,140
And the story in question was the Abu Ghraib scandal.

916
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,860
Prisoners being tortured in that jail in Iraq that we took over.

917
00:48:54,640 --> 00:49:06,520
And for part of the project, I could not find English language versions of this story on Le Monde or in a couple of other outlets from some other countries.

918
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:11,480
So I actually took the original French article and I put that into Babelfish.

919
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,520
And what came out was complete.

920
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,860
Complete and utter nonsense, of course.

921
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:19,180
But then I took the original French and I kind of held the two up next to each other.

922
00:49:19,240 --> 00:49:26,980
And between the original French, which I can sort of kind of read a little bit, and the English translation of it, I was kind of able to make sense by putting the two together.

923
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:34,680
That's sort of what I did with this Der Spiegel article because I wanted to see if it was accurate.

924
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:42,000
Obviously, they took most of it from Wikipedia, which is surprisingly accurate on the Church's subgenius article in there.

925
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:51,100
Well, friends, so I actually have a couple of fun songs I wanted to play at the end of the show.

926
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:57,820
There's a collage, another collage by Reverend Royal Decapitator, or Ter.

927
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:09,560
And a song by the Rudy Schwartz Project, brand new, called Hoppy the Sheetrock Bunny, which I had to play a censored version for this live show.

928
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:10,480
It's fire.

929
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:11,000
Yeah.

930
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:18,580
And then we'll have another collage titled Bobsturbation from Decapitator.

931
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,980
Not nearly as fire.

932
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:26,780
We started a little late, though, when Charleston was here.

933
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:37,780
By the way, folks, if you look at the Halloween masquerade, WCSB masquerade ball pictures, you can see what Charleston, the guy before our Slack looks like.

934
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:40,700
And you can see Dr. Sinister in several pictures.

935
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:42,580
But not you.

936
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:48,180
And as we've mentioned, the girls, you can't say girls, women of WCSB.

937
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:49,740
The women of WCSB.

938
00:50:49,740 --> 00:50:52,200
And the hideous zombies of WCSB.

939
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,160
There's quite a few.

940
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,100
You talking about Count Lepone?

941
00:50:54,980 --> 00:50:56,060
I don't know.

942
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:00,580
Once again, Dr. Sinister, you're over my head.

943
00:51:01,420 --> 00:51:03,140
He's a very tall fellow.

944
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,100
In fact, I noticed the dwarf Bob.

945
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:09,960
Bob looks like a dwarf standing next to him in these photos.

946
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:12,460
See, Bob can take any shape he wants, though.

947
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:16,880
And he was trying to put it in his, stuff it into his wallet somehow.

948
00:51:17,280 --> 00:51:19,200
I was going to say put it in his pants somehow.

949
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:21,760
He certainly did with me.

950
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,780
I'm still trying to crawl out of Bob's pants.

951
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,580
I got you both sides, too.

952
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:29,400
I'm still trying to crawl out of Bob's pipe.

953
00:51:30,020 --> 00:51:31,880
Right. He's smoking us all.

954
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:35,880
And what a glorious, glorious sensation it is.

955
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,500
With his dothel.

956
00:51:39,260 --> 00:51:39,740
Dothel?

957
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:40,780
And his wattle.

958
00:51:40,840 --> 00:51:44,240
The wattle scene in these photos is really scary.

959
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:50,600
We put a turtle neck on Bob to hide the wattle, but it made it worse.

960
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:54,340
It just made it more look like it had a turtle's neck.

961
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,060
Are you saying that Bob's neck has become very flabby and rancid?

962
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:01,740
Or maybe you're just trying to look like Steve Jobs.

963
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:02,140
Or maybe you're just trying to look like Steve Jobs.

964
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:04,300
A soft crepe paper.

965
00:52:05,180 --> 00:52:08,800
So, speaking of, oh, I can't do that line on, on.

966
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:12,480
I had a Steve Jobs pledge drive.

967
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:14,740
Next week is our radiothon pledge drive.

968
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,780
And it's like, something jobs will go the way of Steve Jobs if you don't pay Bob.

969
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,140
Pay Dobbs.

970
00:52:21,580 --> 00:52:23,120
See, I can't tell jokes.

971
00:52:23,720 --> 00:52:25,100
Especially X-rated ones.

972
00:52:25,540 --> 00:52:26,680
I think I did it.

973
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:32,180
I think we have another X-rated show on subgenius.com, by the way.

974
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:35,800
A brand new X-rated show that can never, ever be played on any stage.

975
00:52:35,800 --> 00:52:39,280
You know, I suspect you were about to use a word that, standing on its own, was a word.

976
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:44,460
Without the context of the dirty joke, it would be perfectly acceptable to just say that word on the radio.

977
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:45,540
Yeah, the wind blows.

978
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:46,780
Yes, it does.

979
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,560
The wind, the wind, yeah.

980
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,480
The plastic blinds, the eggs blow.

981
00:52:50,540 --> 00:52:57,420
Or as Shakespeare, in their great fireside and theater line said,

982
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:03,280
Break, wind, break, and crack cheeks crack.

983
00:53:04,480 --> 00:53:08,000
And with that, I think we must go, Dave.

984
00:53:09,120 --> 00:53:13,220
Thank you for translating the bad translation.

985
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:14,840
And thanks for the extreme inflation throughout the evening.

986
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:22,900
I think it's been one of those shows where we show our true roots, sophomoric, childish, ridiculous anal humor,

987
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:26,500
and thank our lucky stones, each and every one of them for it.

988
00:53:26,500 --> 00:53:27,580
He's making fun of me again.

989
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:27,940
Again.

990
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:30,560
Dave, prepare to be potted down now.

991
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,160
He's going to pot you down.

992
00:53:32,360 --> 00:53:32,640
Yes.

993
00:53:32,860 --> 00:53:34,920
He says, I start real loud.

994
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:35,840
And I'll put it on.

995
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,400
The vats will come up.

996
00:53:37,460 --> 00:53:37,980
Let's go.

997
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:38,760
There he goes.

998
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:40,080
Bye, Dave.

999
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:44,920
We'll leave him on so he can hear over the phone.

1000
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,900
But we won't be able to hear him.

1001
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,340
But we can't hear him.

1002
00:53:49,600 --> 00:53:49,960
Or ourselves.

1003
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:51,040
So here we go.

1004
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:52,180
I mean, wake up, people.

1005
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:53,820
This has been going on for years.

1006
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:55,080
But no one's noticed it.

1007
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:56,660
And I think it's ridiculous.

1008
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,480
But I understand it.

1009
00:53:58,700 --> 00:54:01,880
I understand the connect the dots conspiracy.

1010
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:06,640
I understand the need ordered sense frightening and confusing.

1011
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:07,600
The world conspiracy.

1012
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,660
Because I used to be a paranoid conspiratorial.

1013
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:11,360
Jesus Christ.

1014
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:14,480
I didn't have an umbrella conspiracy environment.

1015
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,220
The world control ideas.

1016
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,380
Like, I'm not calling them conspiracy theorists.

1017
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,140
Conspiracy theorists.

1018
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:20,860
Jesus Christ creeping into this country.

1019
00:54:20,980 --> 00:54:24,440
If you think that the political connect dots, that's what our brain does.

1020
00:54:24,560 --> 00:54:27,940
Sense of connection and that the world makes sense somehow.

1021
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,640
Lunatic, fanatic, whack job.

1022
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:32,240
Born again conspiracy Christian.

1023
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,460
Fanatics commit to a series of unprovable tenets.

1024
00:54:36,460 --> 00:54:39,020
That they dog together into a meldma.

1025
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:40,640
Like, dude, that can't be true.

1026
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:41,100
That's ridiculous.

1027
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:41,860
You can't prove that.

1028
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,780
Oh, oh, okay.

1029
00:54:42,940 --> 00:54:45,800
So if you want to live in the conspiracy, go ahead.

1030
00:54:46,020 --> 00:54:46,800
You go ahead.

1031
00:54:46,980 --> 00:54:48,260
Because I know the truth.

1032
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,480
I swear to you.

1033
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:59,080
If Bob's head were to come down tomorrow and hover over the world and look down on the people of the world,

1034
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:04,940
the only thing he said was Oswald worked alone.

1035
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:10,960
There would be people on the ground that would be like, what does that guy know?

1036
00:55:11,940 --> 00:55:13,060
He lives in the sky.

1037
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,360
He was probably part of it.

1038
00:55:15,460 --> 00:55:16,900
He's a patsy.

1039
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,300
Bob was on the grassy knoll.

1040
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:32,220
Mr. Wilson, notice I'm low.

1041
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,080
Next to the bathtub.

1042
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,920
Right above the bed.

1043
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:35,500
Right above the shower.

1044
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,660
Had pressed it with his finger and it poked right through.

1045
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,720
But at least there weren't any termites.

1046
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:49,020
Mrs. Wilson brought him the yellow pages.

1047
00:55:49,100 --> 00:55:53,060
Opened it up to page 243.

1048
00:55:53,620 --> 00:56:01,480
There on the bottom with the quarter page, there was a gulpsious rabbit with a little blue cap and a hammer and a saw.

1049
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:04,760
And blue overalls and fluffy old ears.

1050
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:09,840
That looked a little queer and were twice as big as an elephant's balls.

1051
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,580
Hoppy the sheetrock bunny.

1052
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:17,080
He's got a quarter page head.

1053
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:21,040
Hoppy the industrious bunny.

1054
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:24,860
Enterprising, mesmerizing, never ever patronizing.

1055
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,580
Always there for your sheetrock needs.

1056
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:37,200
Hoppy pulled up in his big red trunk.

1057
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,500
Scratched his furry chin and sized it all up.

1058
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:47,420
Tore away the part that was crumbly and soft and poked his bunny head down between the studs.

1059
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,580
Reached into his pocket, pulled a flashlight out.

1060
00:56:53,700 --> 00:56:58,400
Made real sure that there wasn't any damage to the mastic and grout.

1061
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:08,000
Hoppy turned around with a big thumbs up and Mr. Wilson squealed with joy.

1062
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:11,640
Hoppy cut out a square piece of drywall.

1063
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:14,480
Lined it up and screwed it to the studs you see.

1064
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:18,200
Taped up the seams and smoothed it with his putty knife.

1065
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,500
Then he matched the texture perfectly.

1066
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:23,720
Hoppy matched the texture perfectly.

1067
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,040
Z szrà.

1068
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:48,180
Captured it in one place.

1069
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:48,180


1070
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:48,180


1071
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:48,280
It can drive you crazy every time you pull it out.

1072
00:57:50,100 --> 00:57:50,900
Hoppy has played Go for foundations.

1073
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:50,900


1074
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:50,940
Yay!

1075
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,340
Hoppy lost control.

1076
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:17,020
Poppy the sheetrock bunny

1077
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:19,440
Fixed Mr. Wilson's bathroom

1078
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:23,480
Poppy the industrious bunny

1079
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,560
Enterprising, fraternizing

1080
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,260
Never ever patronizing

1081
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:30,000
Always there for your sheetrock needs.

1082
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:32,840
Enterprising money with a quarter page.

1083
00:58:32,940 --> 00:58:39,080
And he's always there for your sheetrock needs.

1084
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:49,800
Okay, because I hear, when I hear surrealism, I think about, well, Bob.

1085
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:54,220
And the first time I saw Bob, it was like something out of Peter Pan.

1086
00:58:54,220 --> 00:59:00,140
Man, honest to God, it was like a swan coming out of the sky.

1087
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:03,120
But anyway, more power to you.

1088
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:07,480
My wife and I bought our 25th wedding anniversary toaster from Bob.

1089
00:59:07,520 --> 00:59:10,860
But when I came for the first time, Bob was like an apparition.

1090
00:59:11,220 --> 00:59:14,380
But I'm happy to say we still have the toaster, and it still works,

1091
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,940
and it's on our counter every morning for our toast.

1092
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:18,980
Oh, that's great.

1093
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:20,040
Thank you, Bob.

1094
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:23,280
And he has a gift for taking very complicated ideas

1095
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:24,200
and making them into a little bit more complicated.

1096
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:24,840
Making them simple.

1097
00:59:25,080 --> 00:59:25,560
Hi, Bob.

1098
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,700
Hey, good morning.

1099
00:59:26,820 --> 00:59:28,520
Beautiful subject you're talking about.

1100
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,160
I've only seen pictures of it.

1101
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,840
Oh, Bob, you've got to come.

1102
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:40,200
I plan to.

1103
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:40,720
All right.

1104
00:59:42,700 --> 00:59:43,960
As well he should have.

1105
00:59:45,220 --> 00:59:48,200
We're, I like, but I don't think right.

1106
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:51,620
Genius has a way of sometimes doing things like that.

1107
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:53,680
How and how and how and how.

1108
00:59:54,420 --> 00:59:55,360
Even out there.

1109
00:59:55,420 --> 00:59:56,280
Even out there.

1110
00:59:56,340 --> 00:59:57,220
Even out there.

1111
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,020
Even out there.

1112
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:02,900
Oh, Bob.

1113
01:00:03,020 --> 01:00:03,240
Oh, Bob.

1114
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:03,620
Oh, Bob.

1115
01:00:03,620 --> 01:00:03,880
Oh, Bob.

1116
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:06,040
Marvelous.

1117
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:06,560
Gorgeous.

1118
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,960
Well, this has been a real wonderful, unique Bob.

1119
01:00:10,080 --> 01:00:10,480
Thanks, Bob.

1120
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:11,620
Rapper start.

1121
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:15,240
My name is Atsushi Tsuyamano.

1122
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,340
My name is Hiroshigashi.

1123
01:00:18,580 --> 01:00:20,180
My name is Ukiyo.

1124
01:00:21,180 --> 01:00:23,800
My name is Makoto.

1125
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,820
Your doing great, and thank you, everybody.

1126
01:00:30,020 --> 01:00:32,820
You tell us what you want.

1127
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:34,080
You know, this performance is none of your business,

1128
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:34,080


1129
01:00:34,080 --> 01:00:34,080


1130
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:39,740
I'm посмотреть this again.

1131
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:39,740


1132
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:39,740


1133
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,680
It's Kneeling House, and what I see is

1134
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,320
some old looking emphasised instructions.

1135
01:00:44,380 --> 01:00:45,500
Where there is a wonderful child born to you.

1136
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:45,500


1137
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:45,500


1138
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:45,500


1139
01:00:45,500 --> 01:00:45,500


1140
01:00:47,140 --> 01:00:48,820
What are you doing here?

1141
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:49,720
The channel is as it is.

1142
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:50,840
What?

1143
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:59,940
We need to do something useful, like rob a f***ing bank, or kill a cop, or shoot the

1144
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:02,660
Pope, or kill the President.

1145
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:09,960
I figured that maybe somehow someone got in on the station illegally or something.

1146
01:01:10,020 --> 01:01:13,220
I didn't believe it could have been a legitimate radio station.

1147
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:14,980
Bust us.

1148
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:16,460
We need the publicity.

1149
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,800
Sire, there is no more money.

1150
01:01:20,060 --> 01:01:22,260
We gotta get some money.

1151
01:01:22,600 --> 01:01:24,840
That dirty Turkish harker back flat.

1152
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:26,460
We want to fill a f***ing burton.

1153
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:27,780
Perk a loom of burton.

1154
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:28,920
Don't bust an idol.

1155
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:36,400
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show, and we're even more glad that some listeners

1156
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:40,320
have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1157
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:45,360
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1158
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:45,900
Bye.

1159
01:01:46,460 --> 01:01:46,580
Bye.

1160
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:46,760
Bye.

1161
01:01:46,880 --> 01:01:53,320
But if you truly love Bob and want some of that slack back to rebound to you, you should

1162
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:59,940
go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages,

1163
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:03,280
and help out financially as best you can.

1164
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:09,620
Now, we know what it's like to be on the brink of total poverty, and we don't want any subgeniuses

1165
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:11,280
to make their own situations worse.

1166
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:14,240
But some of you still have jobs.

1167
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:16,240
Even five bucks.

1168
01:02:16,240 --> 01:02:21,120
Five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1169
01:02:21,380 --> 01:02:23,520
Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1170
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:32,280
All we're saying is that blowjobs could go the way of Steve jobs if you don't pay Dobbs.

1171
01:02:33,060 --> 01:02:38,120
We also take checks and money orders to subgeniusfoundation.

1172
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,480
P.O.

1173
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:45,600
Box 181417 Cleveland Heights.

1174
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:50,240
Ohio 44118.

1175
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:55,480
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.

1176
01:03:11,340 --> 01:03:13,880
We'll see you next time.

1177
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:14,460
Bye.

1178
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:14,480


1179
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:14,480


1180
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:14,480


1181
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:14,480


1182
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:14,540
Bye.

1183
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:14,600
Bye.

1184
01:03:14,600 --> 01:03:14,600


1185
01:03:14,760 --> 01:03:14,760


1186
01:03:15,240 --> 01:03:15,620
Bye.

1187
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:16,060
Bye.

1188
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1189
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1190
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1191
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1192
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1193
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1194
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1195
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1196
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1197
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1198
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1199
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1200
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1201
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1202
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1203
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1204
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1205
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:16,220


1206
01:03:16,240 --> 01:03:36,780
