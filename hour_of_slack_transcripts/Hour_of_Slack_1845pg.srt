1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,760
Bob

2
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,780
Bob

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,100
Bob

4
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,300
Bob

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,480
Everything's a damn about it

6
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:20,180
Bob

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:25,600
Bob

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,440
Bob

9
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,520
And it comes down the street like a garbage wagon.

10
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:44,260
Okay.

11
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:49,980
So their brains may live on forever.

12
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,800
Fresh venison.

13
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,080
Or has he created another?

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:58,840
By the miracle of recording.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,960
I'm not very good at singing songs, but here's a try.

16
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,900
Well, better make it quick, kiddo.

17
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:11,860
Ridiculous theory of evolution.

18
00:01:12,380 --> 00:01:14,080
Well, better make it quick, kiddo.

19
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:18,520
Peace or annihilation.

20
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:25,820
And thanks to Lee Murr for all that mess we just heard,

21
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,920
except for the very last part, which was by new guy Jason Myrick.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,300
And welcome to another non-standard Hour of Slack.

23
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,280
I, your host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang,

24
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,760
was looking at a whole mess of editing I'd have to do

25
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,840
to polish up another show made from live winter star footage

26
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,400
or chopped up puzzling evidence or even a best of oldies show.

27
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,060
But I've got a ton of other stuff to do for Bob.

28
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:52,000
And then it struck me.

29
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:54,100
At some point in the past,

30
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,460
I had compiled enough new hymns and songs of a subgeniously nature

31
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,960
to make a seven.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,580
Bob song CD.

33
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,160
But I'd never gotten around to making the packaging.

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,480
So this stuff hadn't been released except in dribs and drabs

35
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:10,280
on ancient hours of Slack from 2006.

36
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,580
So that solved my problem.

37
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,720
Here then is our of Slack number 1246

38
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:21,240
and all Bob songs episode and a sneak preview of our next official CD release,

39
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,820
which you now already have on MP3 from downloading this show.

40
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,700
But oh, well, Slack must come first in the life of every initiate.

41
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:29,860
Lee Murr.

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,240
Lee Murr shall start us off.

43
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,040
One, two, three.

44
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,140
Bob.

45
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:43,740
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

46
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,260
Bob.

47
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:53,780
Bob.

48
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:04,280
Bob.

49
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:07,220
Bob.

50
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,080
Bob.

51
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,820
That didn't look like me at all.

52
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:18,700
If you were turned inside out, that's a laser.

53
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:23,360
Apparently, Bob came and did something with all of us.

54
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,980
Raise a bar.

55
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,020
Quiet numbskulls.

56
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,540
I'm broadcasting.

57
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,300
Let your ass go to radio.

58
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,280
It's not a nightmare that's going to end.

59
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,120
It's just beginning because it's inside me.

60
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,300
You have to love Bob.

61
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,920
He loves you, Bob.

62
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,400
You love Bob.

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,540
You have to.

64
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,240
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?

65
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,180
He'll kill you.

66
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,940
He'll bob you out.

67
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,140
Right now, I will give you all my money.

68
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:29,280
I will give you all my money.

69
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:59,280
I will give you all my money.

70
00:04:59,300 --> 00:04:59,840
...

71
00:04:59,840 --> 00:04:59,860
Bob bob

72
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,740
Bob...

73
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,260
Bob bob

74
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:06,260


75
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,260
Bob bob

76
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,700
Bob bob

77
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,100
Bob bob

78
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,820
Bob bob

79
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,500
Congratulation!

80
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,380
Are you here scary all night?

81
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:21,380


82
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:21,480
I won't bite.

83
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,560
I'm gonna rip it open.

84
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,520
Hey, stop!

85
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,780
Shut up!

86
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,760
Shut up!

87
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,200
Hey, stop!

88
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,020
Shut up!

89
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,400
Shut up!

90
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,560
Shut up!

91
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,220
Attention.

92
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,560
Vouny.

93
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,400
Vouny.

94
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,380
Vouny.

95
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,060
Attention.

96
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,120
Attention.

97
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,380
Attention.

98
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:48,800
Attention.

99
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,380
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

100
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,240
Attention.

101
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,240
Attention.

102
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,220
Attention.

103
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,340
Attention.

104
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:38,340


105
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,040
Attention.

106
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,280
Attention.

107
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,160


108
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:43,640


109
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,000
Attention.

110
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,260
Attention.

111
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:53,280
Look, if he starts this thing, he won't be able to stop it.

112
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:56,440
It's immortality.

113
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:57,420
It's immortality.

114
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,600
It's more costly than death.

115
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,220
Attention.

116
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:06,300
The world stops spinning and the clock stops moving.

117
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,720
But something's still ticking and wearing on the inside.

118
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,260
Attention.

119
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,680
And every time you let it go like I'm doing right now,

120
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:22,080
you can feel the wear.

121
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:27,680
I know from 342 years of experience that

122
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:31,160
time control can only go awry.

123
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:35,580
The third world war might begin any minute and we'll all be killed.

124
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:37,660
Why should we bother about giant turtles?

125
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:39,420
Yes, maybe you're right.

126
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,700
I know how much you love your turtles.

127
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:45,580
But there are other things in life just as important, like having friends.

128
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:49,880
Our ancient legends did mention fire-eating turtles.

129
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,340
But they repeated this a thousand times.

130
00:09:17,560 --> 00:09:26,280
We can still beneficiaries of the nature's further

131
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:26,580
believingitting the die by a drop of보다 byancer.

Noral Preff and his composition Love Church.

136
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,320
It makes you feel real big.

137
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,160
Go, go, go!

138
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,520
Love Church.

139
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,240
Bob!

140
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,960
Yes, giving.

141
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,500
Yes, giving.

142
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:13,500
Love Church.

143
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:14,120
Bob!

144
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,840
Come join the fun.

145
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,960
All of you have heard of Bob.

146
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,940
Love Church.

147
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,440
It makes you feel real big.

148
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,000
Yes, giving.

149
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,760
Yes, giving.

150
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,120
Bob!

151
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:37,240
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

152
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,160
We all thought you were dead.

153
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,140
No, no, still here.

154
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,340
How are you, Bob?

155
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:52,300
Brothers and sisters,

156
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,920
we must confront ourselves

157
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:56,820
with

158
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,040
the fact that

159
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,220
we know that all men and women

160
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,520
are created good.

161
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,380
We must understand why you have gone bad.

162
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:09,020
You cannot play checkers with your life,

163
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,900
jumping around like an old whirlwind,

164
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,680
wrapping your dishes and plates,

165
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,520
and then unpacking them and placing them back on the shelf.

166
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:24,540
This is not the way the Jehovah One has designed you to act.

167
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:25,600
Unless,

168
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,620
you are willing to do something.

169
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,620
You are willing to admit that you are a gnome,

170
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,440
a pink boy,

171
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:32,760
a nanny,

172
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,500
a twig.

173
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,440
Only then can you decide where your path shall lead you.

174
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:45,740
But we know inherently that we are all created good by Jehovah One.

175
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,820
Some of you got such bad luck sometimes in your life,

176
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:54,000
you couldn't hang yourself with your own necktie.

177
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:57,000
This is when you should look to Bob.

178
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:00,560
When you look to Jehovah One and say,

179
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,120
Bob,

180
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,180
come into my life,

181
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,140
and you shall see one set of footprints in the sand.

182
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:16,620
And that is when you will know that Bob has charged you $5.99 to carry you to the nearest

183
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,100
taxi.

184
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,060
Praise Bob in his divine ways.

185
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,660
You got to know that life is like a vanishing twin,

186
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,600
a vanishing twin,

187
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:27,600


188
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,860
fading inside of a twin,

189
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,160
inside of a woman's belly.

190
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:36,020
That's how confusing this wiggly world can be.

191
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:40,820
You got to raise up above this wiggly world and grab the hand of Bob.

192
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,640
Praise him and all that flows from Bob.

193
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,560
And praise Reverend Raymond Lafferty who did that classic.

194
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,640
Uh, wiggly world indeed.

195
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:01,420
To help solidify things, we'll now hear Bob's audition by,

196
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,760
not Bob, but the Psychoskeletons.

197
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,220
Feels kinda like I'm in Spaceland.

198
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,340
That's a contradiction in terms.

199
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,880
And Bob's shining down on me.

200
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:24,080
And no one's aiming a rifle at me.

201
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,680
Holy dammit.

202
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:26,620
That's a contradiction in terms.

203
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:32,480
And Bob is the giant hepatitis penis of destruction bursting forth from the portable Johnny.

204
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:36,200
Now let's all be a contradiction in terms.

205
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:40,260
Herds of benign cattle wander across the acid-washed,

206
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,240
flush-drained landscape,

207
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,460
all belonging to their own friendship families,

208
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,020
none loving any other than Bob.

209
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,340
The flow between adjacent points of reference,

210
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:56,600
points on the line segment between the concrete to absolute oblivious eternity,

211
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:58,420
sweet lord Bob.

212
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:02,240
When we all act together as men, as people,

213
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:05,480
we could distinguish ourselves and betray any other.

214
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,120
As it was before time, but still within space,

215
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:11,580
all who bow down and submit to their fractals.

216
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,900
Mom, would you if you will, would you believe in—

217
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,680
Don't tell me, would you take me in, in

218
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,540
BELL sécher's쳐stVA.

219
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,760
GET coming up, like B Above Vincent Pratt.

220
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,080
It feels like Eastwood……

221
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:48,660
I hope we'll do a 7-in terran countdown.

222
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:53,800
Second one, look, we've got these abusers like you off and down telling songs that really

223
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,580
make itlements right, like like horror.

224
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,720
My shorter persevere

225
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,040
Bound down

226
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:05,020
My shorter persevere

227
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,180
Bound down

228
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:09,320
My shorter persevere

229
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:13,660
My shorter persevere

230
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,300
Bound down

231
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,940
My shorter persevere

232
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:26,240
My shorter persevere

233
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:30,720
My shorter persevere

234
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:34,960
My shorter persevere

235
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:55,940
Just like the sky, the sun, my slack goes on and on and on

236
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:07,160
Just like the sun, the sky, my slack goes on and on and on and on

237
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,320
Praise Bob!

238
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,640
Just like the sky, the sun, my slack goes on and on and on and on

239
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:13,640


240
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:19,940
Just like the sky, the sun, my slack goes on and on and on

241
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:31,000
Just like the sky, the sun, my slack goes on and on and on and on

242
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,280
Praise Bob!

243
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

244
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,580
Another song by Reverend Ed Fred entitled simply, Pink.

245
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,200
Hey little brothers and sisters, why don't you get around?

246
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:31,280
I've got something important to say to you, something I think you need to hear.

247
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:32,860
Come on now!

248
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,500
Are you sure you got your life together?

249
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,620
You think you're on top of the world, but reality is about to rear its ugly head.

250
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,260
Listen my friends, are you ready to face the music?

251
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,520
You're pink!

252
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:52,240
You're pink!

253
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,000
We think!

254
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,680
You're pink!

255
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,360
You drive that big ol' SUV,

256
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,640
Draining your wallet in the used to be.

257
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,780
You're in a material race,

258
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:13,620
You just can't get out.

259
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:13,840
You can't win.

260
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,840
Following society is your greatest sin.

261
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,820
You are destined to fail my friend.

262
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,280
You're gonna be poor and alone in the end.

263
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:30,220
You got your treasures, you got your hoard.

264
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:34,020
But you're only gonna end up broken board.

265
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,060
Come on friends, it's time to turn over a new leaf.

266
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:44,340
Unleash your weakness and get some relief.

267
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,960
Slack is king and nothing else matters.

268
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,340
Don't be pink.

269
00:18:51,740 --> 00:18:54,840
Pull yourself up by your latex undergarments.

270
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,740
Toss away all your commercial influences.

271
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:02,240
The slack within you can be born again.

272
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,820
Act now.

273
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,940
This is limited time offer.

274
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:10,180
Get yours now while supplies last.

275
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:13,640
Offer void in Alaska and Hawaii.

276
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:20,120
Be sure to consult your doctor about any risks that might be associated with slack.

277
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,000
Yeah, I hope you learned something today.

278
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:29,020
Now I'm going to get myself some slack.

279
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,300
Waste chopsticks.

280
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,320
Are you lookin for slicingAK?

281
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:38,360
facility

282
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:40,800
I have a great idea.

283
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:40,800


284
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:40,800


285
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:41,980
We thought you were macaroni.

286
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,820
Did you get a buck nervous after earmuffs?

287
00:19:43,820 --> 00:19:44,040
Party back at scale!

288
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:44,840
This is the POTATO FIRE TOUR.

289
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:45,720
Part two, ladies and gentlemen.

290
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:56,300
Tune in next week for a big 1987 movie of the Master Biology and also foroster episode of Christmasなん Mega гарminusuu

291
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:59,000
and aquesta första not just ustedes but every squad like the name of the character themselves.

292
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,140
Bob?

293
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,180
Bob?

294
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:09,740
Bob?

295
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:10,320
Bob?

296
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:10,740
Bob?

297
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:10,840
Bob?

298
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:11,380
Bob?

299
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:11,580
Bob?

300
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:17,560
Who are the overlords of the UFO?

301
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,960
I bring you a warning.

302
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:26,220
Every one of you listening to my voice, tell the world.

303
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:29,060
Tell this to everybody wherever they are.

304
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,820
Watch the sky.

305
00:20:32,680 --> 00:20:34,340
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

306
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:37,040
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

307
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:38,900
Shazam.

308
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,160
And I say it is possible for a giant lizard to have lived there for years without being sick.

309
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:55,960
Watch me.

310
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:03,940
Watch me.

311
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,160
You, you, you, you bloated idiot.

312
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:08,520
You stupid.

313
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,440
I have you.

314
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:19,280
There are a bunch of art critics and we're looking for people who like to draw.

315
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:21,600
You are not safe.

316
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,440
I'm safe from this.

317
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:26,500
Come on.

318
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,280
I'm going to get you there.

319
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,300
I'm going to get you there.

320
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,060
I'm going to get you there.

321
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,060


322
00:21:31,660 --> 00:21:32,800
I'm going to get you there.

323
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,940
Watch out and then you'll know the truth.

324
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,380
There are thousands of words of fun.

325
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,480
It's quite a joke.

326
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,680
It's quite a joke.

327
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,800
I tried to prop.

328
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,200
Groovy.

329
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,900
Right, Bob?

330
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,740
Bob?

331
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:05,620
Bob?

332
00:22:06,820 --> 00:22:09,640
Wait a minute. How did this happen? We're smarter than this.

333
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,220
Apparently not.

334
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:11,220


335
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:41,300
Bob?

336
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:50,780
Long cow Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

337
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,060
Apparently Bob came and did something with all of us.

338
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:06,400
The drugs I took seem to light up my brain.

339
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,400
I'm gonna take a little nap now.

340
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,180
I'm gonna take a little nap.

341
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,140
I'm gonna take a little nap.

342
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,320
I'm gonna take a little nap.

343
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:16,640
Bob!

344
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:22,240
Bob!

345
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,180
Bob!

346
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:30,560
And I say as long as you're alive,

347
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,200
you'll make noise.

348
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,500
You will make noise.

349
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:37,820
Grave Bob.

350
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,780
You'll shine up like hell.

351
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,360
And you ain't earned the last, Ernest T. Bass.

352
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,200
Praise Reverend Ernest T. Bass.

353
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,500
The last four minutes there were collages by Leemur, Byron Werner, and others,

354
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,280
remixed by me with my music.

355
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,520
I can't remember if I ever made a video with that one or not,

356
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,860
but now from a group or individual, I don't even know which,

357
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:04,360
called Da Binchy,

358
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:07,360
a tune called Eslactica.

359
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:35,880
Diffrm новая Mhängorge

360
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:40,180
Facepalm

361
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,380
And I perform the head.

362
00:25:58,940 --> 00:25:59,640
The head.

363
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,720
What about the head?

364
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:03,300
What about the scary poster dog thing?

365
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,880
That evil head.

366
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,060
There's no sign of Wellman.

367
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,280
There's no sign of Wellman.

368
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:10,220
We're just landlady.

369
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,700
Wellman's gone.

370
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,920
And hoping that we can get in touch with him.

371
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,640
Yeah, Wellman's gone.

372
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:21,200
But if we can just get the head inside that lead-lined vault, we'll be okay.

373
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,380
Friends, beware that head.

374
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,300
Safe.

375
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:26,220
I left a little Wellman at home.

376
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:36,820
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer rose slowly above the trap between the 3rd and 4th greens.

377
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,600
Down at Onion Creek Country Club.

378
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,200
And gone.

379
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:41,580
Off course.

380
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:54,420
Thumping slowly like an over-enlarged fig, the bleeding head slowly rose at a gentle angle above the green, dripping blood.

381
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:00,060
It hovered briefly over the sand trap.

382
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:10,940
And then slowly ascended towards the constellation of Orion at an angle of about 44.325 degrees.

383
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,580
Like a shot off a shovel.

384
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:18,400
There was no doubt that it was the head of Arnold Palmer.

385
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:22,660
That moon-faced smile was unforgettable.

386
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:29,440
The population, the population of Southeast Austin went wild.

387
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,260
They tore off their clothes.

388
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,980
Danced in the streets and said, the bloody head has come.

389
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,720
The time is here.

390
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,300
Take off your clothes and be somebody.

391
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:45,440
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer was above such things.

392
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,420
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer rose gently.

393
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:53,240
Buffeting itself slightly as it passed among some ancient pecan trees.

394
00:27:53,860 --> 00:28:00,000
And slowly, still, ever moving upwards, it wobbled slightly.

395
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:06,760
Spraying a small glissando of blood, so to speak, on the people below it.

396
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,940
Healing two old ladies.

397
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,280
To get the blood out of their bodies.

398
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,280


399
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,280


400
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,280


401
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,280


402
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,280


403
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,280


404
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,280


405
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,280


406
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,280


407
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,280


408
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:10,280


409
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:15,180
giving an old man a substantial gland rebuild.

410
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:26,480
At 14 minutes after 9, the bleeding head was sighted on the forward control radar access

411
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,840
plant at Barksdorf Air Force Base.

412
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:37,420
Three interceptors were scrambled, one of which crashed on takeoff.

413
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:40,820
They could find nothing.

414
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,660
The radar was still tracking the head.

415
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:52,180
The bloody head moved north, rocketed over Dallas and Fort Worth.

416
00:28:53,460 --> 00:29:01,220
The radar at Caswell Air Force Base gave subsequent indications that something large and wet was

417
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:07,400
moving north-northeast while ascending still upwards towards the constellation of a comet.

418
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:12,080
The bloody head moved on.

419
00:29:14,440 --> 00:29:20,800
Fourteen ex-virgins were rejuvenated in Lubbock as the head passed through.

420
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:36,520
Keep your hands out of each other's marsupial pockets, boys.

421
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,400
That's right.

422
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:37,400


423
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:44,200
Yes, the ballad of the bleeding head, a real oldie from the great Dr. G. Gordon Gordon

424
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,240
and Doctors for Extreme Prejudice.

425
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:50,680
I'm not sure, but I think one of the musicians on that finally got out of prison after serving

426
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:51,500
a term for murder.

427
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:53,160
And now, the news.

428
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:56,620
From NPR News in Washington, I'm delayed by heavy snow.

429
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:03,240
Pope Benedict XVI is instructing Irish Roman Catholic clergy to cooperate in the sex involving

430
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,460
priests and children.

431
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,740
The Vatican says Benedict does express,

432
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,520
found sexual regret, this time at the Vancouver Olympics.

433
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,680
On Wall Street, 151021421.

434
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,480
Pope Benedict says this is PR.

435
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:17,860
Your news is flawed.

436
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,320
Three instead of three and a half.

437
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,380
President Obama says,

438
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:22,580
And this is only the tripling.

439
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:28,860
Astronauts killed 18 people and injured 71 others aboard the International Space Station.

440
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,140
The astronauts need to encourage development of PR news from Washington.

441
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,380
Come on.

442
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:36,480

solution by the Psychoskeletons. Another song that also brings to mind Captain

Beefheart, although not for any good reason, is this masterpiece by the great

Dr. Gary Gaprog-Fran titled Tar Baby of Bob.

I've got no money but I've got no Bob Stuck to the Tar Baby of Bob

I wish I was stuck in a big ball of frog

477

00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:14,880
So, where's the dirty that we just straightened out?

506
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:19,940
Reverend Self Slayer did that quaint and quirky little X Day Folk song

507
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:26,720
now echoing a song from last week's show, Reverend Phineas Narco of nationalcynical.com

508
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:32,080
brings us this subgenicized version of a John Lennon song that probably doesn't deserve this

509
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:32,660
kind of treatment.

510
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:37,240
I'm a son of a bitch and I'm a son of a bitch

00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,240
I wonder what you'd do

515
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:00,300
Can't get an

516
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,340
ATM card

517
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,840
And no computers too

518
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:12,960
Imagine all sub-dini's

519
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,540
Living life in slack

520
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,140
Imagine there's no modems

521
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,480
And Sid comes on TV

522
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:38,540
We'd hunker down in mud huts

523
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,700
And take some

524
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:42,940

Hoo hoo hoo!

529
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:04,600
You may say I'm some genius...

530
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:09,640
But I'm not the only one...

531
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:15,120
God I wonder if I'm really one...

532
00:42:19,640 --> 00:42:21,340
What I'm losing out on?

533
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,660
Imagine no McDonald's...

534
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:34,020

535
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,620
No E-Mail and no voice...

536
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,580
And no Big Mac with cheese...

537
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,460
And no more songs like these...

538
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:53,980

539
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,680
Life without the con...

540

549
00:43:30,620 --> 00:43:32,120
What do you trust?

550
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,940
The Church of the Subgenius...

I know your slap...

552
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:41,740
I know your trap...

553
00:43:42,940 --> 00:43:46,280
I've been everything so spit and cuss...

554
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,940
I'm the Church of the Subgenius...

555
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:53,460

Don't trust yourselves!

A great subgenius anthem created by Nor El Pref of norelpref.com.

605
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:10,080
Loaded with inside references, as is this one by Reverend Oroboros Rex.

606
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,800
It's an X-Day song.

607
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:18,720
This one and the following song by Phineas Snarko are placed down near the end of the show for maximum tearjerker effect.

608
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:54,400
This is a song by Phineas Snarko.

609
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:57,200
Now the drills go by so fast

610
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:03,300
And it's one more day up in the saucer

611
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:09,200
And it's one more night in Rushwood

612
00:48:11,820 --> 00:48:16,400
If a Friday Jones could be my island

613
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:20,180

619
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:37,300
The smell of big boys and of normals

620
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:43,760
And the feeling that they all can't help but sit in my face

621
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:50,940
With my third eye I look across the mill

622
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:53,780
No way to see he exists

623
00:48:53,780 --> 00:48:54,200
But I know he exists

624
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,380
On their way to burn this place

625
00:48:58,580 --> 00:49:03,260
And it's one more day up in the saucer

626
00:49:03,260 --> 00:49:09,260
And it's one more night in Rushwood

627
00:49:11,380 --> 00:49:16,580
If saucer dreams alone could bring me Susie

628
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,220
Maybe I could

I cruise this堪اء 61 0000 000000 000000 000000 0000 Torah

646
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:49,220


647
00:49:49,220 --> 00:49:52,580
Some time after 2 a.m.

648
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:54,180
And talk about alcohol in danger

649
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:54,180


650
00:49:54,180 --> 00:49:56,820
a little while about the church.

651
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:05,400
But the conspiracy makes you move a little slower,

652
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,600
makes you talk a little lower

653
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:11,980
about the day that we take over.

654
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,680
It's been a while since X-Day,

655
00:50:15,840 --> 00:50:18,500
and I guess I will believe

656
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:23,880
maybe next year will be better than the last.

657
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:32,760
I can't remember all the times I played the hour of slack

658
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,540
and wished my religion would make it come to pass.

659
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,780
So it's 6.59 on Gordon's Saucer.

660
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,740
But it's 7.01 in Brushwood.

661
00:50:55,460 --> 00:51:00,040
I have never made it to an X-Day.

662
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,560
I guess I should.

663
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:10,280
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.

Na, na, na, na.

666
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:38,340
In the time of chimpanzees, I was a yeti

667
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,980
Church air in my veins and my fur is getting shitty

668
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,160
While the plastic-ass pipes spray paint the palmer head

669
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,000
Dog food vendors with a beefcake suit-a-fed

670
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,360
Kill all the pink boys and put it in neutral

Bobby's in Sherman, tired of fightin' the bike

673
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,160
Got a couple motel rooms, sleep on the floor tonight

674
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:03,080
Someone keeps sayin' I'm insane to complain about a round-trip ticket when it's all gonna

675
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:03,440
end

676
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:08,960
Why believe anything that ain't nice when you got Reverend Surnow and the Jader device?

677
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:14,620
Just watch the face smilin' there in the dark Burn all the money when they decimate the

Say pal, no such thing as Judas

686
00:53:31,320 --> 00:53:32,020
I pulled up the Pantgros

687
00:53:33,980 --> 00:53:35,820

Santers of genius

694
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:46,340

00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:46,340


698
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,940
And a sock fist pounding down the door of the world

699
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:51,880
Cause one's gotta rant and the other's gotta brag

700
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:54,660
Bob's on some window painting, Connie's on the rag

701
00:53:54,660 --> 00:53:57,760
With the radio shows and the backstage world jobs

702
00:53:57,760 --> 00:54:00,660
Can't get invited to the first week of the summer

703
00:54:00,660 --> 00:54:02,860
Burn to death like a Buddhist priest

704
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:05,720
Yes, men starving at the subgenius feast

705
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,580
And it's all for those who fulfill their fate

706
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:11,520
Trade the cash for the pills for the bodies for the hate

707
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:13,460
And the time is a piece of crap

708
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,180
Falling down the toilet

709
00:54:15,180 --> 00:54:17,420
With Bob's hand on the handle

710
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,160

You'll catch me when I municipi

735
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,200

You're better than me right there

737
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,580
I've done run over my wife

738
00:56:42,660 --> 00:56:44,340
Doctors for Bob

739
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:48,020
And everything for him and his wife

740
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:50,440
He's got the blues

741
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:55,100
But that damn pickup done run over his wife

742
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,780
Doctors for Bob

743
00:56:57,780 --> 00:56:58,940
Doctors for Bob

744
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:02,760
We're doctors, we're doctors, we're doctors for Bob

745
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,340
We're doctors, we're doctors, doctors for Bob

746
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:09,980
Doctors, we're doctors, we're doctors for Bob

747
00:57:09,980 --> 00:57:13,400
Doctors, we're doctors, we're doctors for Bob

748
00:57:13,400 --> 00:57:15,120
And in the open we'll be broken

749
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:16,420
Not Gregory, we'll be broken

750
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:18,140
Steve LeBlanc. Not Rodriguez

751
00:57:19,860 --> 00:57:22,380
We're doctors, we're doctors, we're doctors

752
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:23,800
Doctors for Bob

753
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,500
Destroy the Indian Outfits

754
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,900
Destroy the Indian Outfits

755
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,440
Destroy all the rules

756
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:36,320
Hand state the Germans the Jews

757
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:40,260
We shall rule.

758
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:41,720
We shall be free.

759
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,660
We are the story of the people.

760
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:46,220
We are the true church.

761
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,420
Doctors for Bob.

762
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:54,480
Everything's real in his life.

763
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,980
He's got the blues.

764
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:01,780
Because that damn pickup gun run over his wife.

765
00:58:02,740 --> 00:58:04,440
Doctors for Bob.

766
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:15,820
Bob?

767
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:40,200
All right.

768
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:40,960
All right.

769
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:40,960


770
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,140
I'll sing you a song.

771
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:54,700
About Bob.

772
00:59:06,580 --> 00:59:12,060
I'll sing you a song about Bob

773
00:59:12,060 --> 00:59:14,180
I know

774
00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:15,120
I'll sing you a song

775
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:17,640

776
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,500
I'll sing you

777
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:21,220
a song

778
00:59:22,040 --> 00:59:24,940

779
00:59:24,940 --> 00:59:26,740
I'll sing you

780
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,620
a song

781
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:30,060
about Bob

782
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:32,500
I'll sing you

783
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,340
a song

784
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,940
about Bob
