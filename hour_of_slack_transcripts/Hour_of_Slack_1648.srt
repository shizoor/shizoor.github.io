1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,720
Somewhere in the forbidding tundra mountains of Lapland, high above the Arctic Circle,

2
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,640
a group of mining engineers were prospecting for copper.

3
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:16,280
But what they unearthed was a story. A story that was to terrorize the whole world.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:21,160
I'm in there and have to dig life with father, and I mean Father Slack.

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:27,320
The Soft Genius Power of Slack

6
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:34,960
I'm in there and have to dig life with father, and I mean Father Slack

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,720
I'm in there and have to dig life with father, and I mean Father Slack

8
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:54,580
But wait! This Hour of Slack, number 1648, is actually a rerun of number 775 from the year of 2001,

9
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:59,980
mostly recorded at or around the winter season.

10
00:00:59,980 --> 00:00:59,980


11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,100
It's the first star festival of that year.

12
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:04,200
Price Bob.

13
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:07,080
Let me get you radio boneheads going.

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,480
Watch out! No, no, no, no.

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,620
Okay, okay, watch out now.

16
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,700
Okay, alright, get us going. We're waiting.

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,480
Free before me, Earthman!

18
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:15,100
Hey, he said he's gonna get us going.

19
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:16,740
Ivan, come on, let the guy talk.

20
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,740
Emperor of Planet X!

21
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,320
Okay, shut up, Ivan.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,000
And I have come to destroy your puny...

23
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:23,820
Come on, man.

24
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,800
...Lamo! Both of you are Lamos!

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:29,140
I know, I think it's time for the world...

26
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:32,380
...the first group, right over there behind Reverend Patterson or Rappertino.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,680
How do you know there's both of us?

28
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,740
How do you know there's not three of us being Lamos?

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,980
Each time he says it, he has to pay that...

30
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:43,040
Obviously, there's four of us being Lame here, not two.

31
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,360
Both would imply a couplet.

32
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:50,300
Yeah, it's easy to say Lame. It's easy to say Lame.

33
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,140
I can say Lame. Lame, Lame, Lame, Lame, Lame, Lame.

34
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:56,240
The lamest show with the lamest callers.

35
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,120
So if you get really close to the mouthpiece, does that mean you're...

36
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,420
...can you talk a lot more loudly?

37
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,640
I don't know.

38
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:06,140
But you can say Lame. Come on, say Lame. One more time. Lame, Lame, Lame.

39
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,260
Oh my God, there'll be a molestation.

40
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:10,440
You're an adolescent and you overcompensate.

41
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,560
Support all of us on this with your work.

42
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,660
Oh, no. How many cans of Red Bull have you had?

43
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:15,420
Adolescent.

44
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll support both of us.

45
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,240
Adolescent?

46
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,460
Yeah.

47
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,000
I'll have you know, I just reached puberty.

48
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,020
Hey, I have some... I got four hairs on my nutsack.

49
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,800
Are you sure?

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,040
Just stop the show.

51
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,180
Hey, we're cruising now.

52
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,540
That's not what your mom said.

53
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,240
I should make jokes about Lame over the water.

54
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,040
Because we are cruising, man.

55
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,960
Now we're cruising. Thanks to that caller, we're kicked off.

56
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,640
We are cruising down the road.

57
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,440
I feel the wheels turning.

58
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:50,940
Yeah, and I have to jump Michael Pepe's phone machine for that.

59
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,460
Michael Poopy.

60
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,640
Because this is the last show of the millennium, folks.

61
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,120
Michael Poopy on the last show of the millennium.

62
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:56,540
Yep.

63
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,560
It is the last show.

64
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,040
The show is cooking now.

65
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,820
Have you noticed that?

66
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,140
There's a little smoke coming out of that box over there.

67
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:05,920
Oh, yeah.

68
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:06,360
Nice.

69
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,860
Eggs Benedict.

70
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,040
Smells kind of like Eggs Benedict or you could think...

71
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:23,520
Some could say it smells like burning rubber or electrical conduit in a state of hyper thermal activity.

72
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:45,940
But you know, friends, the real subgeniuses are the ones who literally, totally gave their brains over to Bob.

73
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,080
Now, that turns some people off.

74
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,080
That's why we're not...

75
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,300
Maybe we're a little faster growing than, say, the Scientologists or the Mormons.

76
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,060
But we're not there yet.

77
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,820
And I think it's a lot of times.

78
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:06,320
Because people, they see these subgeniuses who are really into it and they're acting just wrong.

79
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:07,560
You know, there's just something.

80
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,940
But friends, you can't imagine how much those are the ones who truly, truly believe in Bob.

81
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,540
They have given their brains to Bob for good.

82
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,220
Forever.

83
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,620
They're never going to get those brain cells back and they don't want them.

84
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,000
Those weren't the brain cells they needed in the first place.

85
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,880
But friends, you too can give your brain to Bob just temporarily.

86
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,140
You don't have to do it for all time.

87
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,040
Just say for tonight, you know.

88
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:35,940
Once you've been slack, you'll never go back, my friends.

89
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:41,240
If you could be slack for one Saturday night, you'd never want to be pink again.

90
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,760
And, you know, as...

91
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:53,660
Now, some people also question the church because of our track record regarding ends of the world happening every July 5th or not.

92
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:56,120
And as I've said before,

93
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,860
Are we going to let the church win?

94
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,940
Jehovah's Witnesses out-cook us.

95
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,700
Hell no.

96
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,660
But, you know, Bob has held these...

97
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,980
They're drills.

98
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:13,600
They're sort of culling drills that we hold every year to weed out the faithless from those who have faith.

99
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:17,780
And friends, here in the Church of the Subgenius, we have no faith!

100
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,980
We don't use faith instead.

101
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,700
We use magic.

102
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,440
But it's a special kind of magic.

103
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,660
The Bob's keys to magic begin...

104
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,840
His first key to magic begins...

105
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,940
Get off your ass.

106
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,720
And his final key of magic is...

107
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,020
Wash your ass.

108
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:36,500
And I think I'll let you worry about the in-between stuff.

109
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,100
We can't, you know, give away all our secrets for free.

110
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:45,780
But, you know, depending on magic is kind of tricky.

111
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,040
Because, you know, in a way, what you're saying is you're feeling lucky.

112
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:50,980
You know?

113
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:56,480
So I'm going to go ahead and invest that money that I borrowed from my friend because I'm feeling lucky.

114
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,820
Friends, when you feel lucky, you're going to be lucky.

115
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:03,100
You taunt the subgenius demon, which is called Niiiigi.

116
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,640
You taunt him.

117
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:09,040
It's as if you're saying, oh, Niiigi, you are ineffective.

118
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,820
You can't hurt me.

119
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:11,480
I feel lucky.

120
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,560
No, no, no.

121
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:17,180
You have to get off your ass every now and then, friends.

122
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,500
I've been constantly, and I hope dispassionately, considering this very problem.

123
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,940
I have come to the unalterable conclusion that man is unfit as yet.

124
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,560
He receives such knowledge, such almost limitless power.

125
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,540
An invisible being that cannot be disintegrated by atomic fission.

126
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:38,140
That is our god.

127
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,480
That is a scientific impossibility.

128
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,840
There's your answer.

129
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,740
It must have been renewing its molecular structure from one microsecond to the next.

130
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:50,420
Trapped in your cage of only three dimensions.

131
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,580
Take it down now.

132
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,620
Take it down.

133
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,560
We're scoping this entire life for you.

134
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:56,580
Now listen to him.

135
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,920
Maybe if we reasoned with him.

136
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,600
A meddling idiot.

137
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:02,620
As always, Abe's brain could contain the secrets of the Krell.

138
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:02,940
Reason.

139
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,860
If reason would be the key.

140
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,320
They could hardly have understood what power would destroy them.

141
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,700
If reason could turn as quickly as a watch into the hand of death, do you have got the

142
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,180
reason?

143
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:10,900
I've said it.

144
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:15,200
You could hardly have understood what power destroyed them.

145
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:19,540
You know, I just don't think I've ever given me a chance to be me.

146
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,740
Nothing but smoking ashes, man.

147
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:25,000
For miles and miles, we found a stream, and, well, I keep this all pink.

148
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:30,500
Yeah, and it was slimy, but we drank, and where it moved, we cupped our hands, and

149
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:34,580
we took as much water as we could in, because our gills were already expanding, and the

150
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,400
mutations were starting to happen.

151
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,620
We knew it wasn't going to be easy, but we tried, oh, to have fun along the way.

152
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,540
Any way we could, our sensations were expanded.

153
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,800
Not much more.

154
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:51,960
The pain was more, and so was the joy and the pleasure, so we advanced ourself along

155
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:52,720
those lines.

156
00:07:52,720 --> 00:08:02,720
Who hence had more lived than someone else...

157
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,540
Nightmare!

158
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,300
Nightmare!

159
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:16,100
Nightmare!

160
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,180
Nightmare!

161
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:17,720
Nightmare!

162
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:18,720
Nightmare!

163
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:20,200
Nightmare!

164
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:20,720
Nightmare!

165
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:21,860
Nightmare!

166
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,560
Nightmare!

167
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,120
Somebody restrain on you.

168
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,280
Heat one quart of milk in a heavy utensil.

169
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:27,940
What are you, dude?

170
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,620
We're on the show with milk for fewer calories.

171
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:32,640
Is this beat doing something for you?

172
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,700
Yeah, man, I'm swinging.

173
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:37,640
Hanging mighty low, hanging low.

174
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,580
Get your damn old feet!

175
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,620
It's the devil on seat.

176
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,460
How you doing there, boy?

177
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,780
Sure, yeah, yeah, okay.

178
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:51,540
Well, things have taken a much worse turn.

179
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,240
Look at them all.

180
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:53,740
Look at them all.

181
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,080
Look at them all.

182
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,960
Spin their heads around like that.

183
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:01,300
We need a big old wad right on top there.

184
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,480
More recently, what if you had a shot at killing Hitler?

185
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,060
You see, it's kind of a slippery slope.

186
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,820
Justifying premeditated murder.

187
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,580
Oh, yeah, sure.

188
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,100
That's easy for you to say.

189
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,460
You keep saying that.

190
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,360
You say you can justify murder.

191
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,460
I don't believe so.

192
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,960
I don't believe you can...

193
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,000
Well, okay, I take that back.

194
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:21,380
I do.

195
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,860
I don't believe you can justify murder.

196
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,580
So now you have to kill me.

197
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:26,040
Under certain conditions, yes.

198
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:27,280
You have to kill me.

199
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,400
It's part of Cult Stock, 2001.

200
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:30,320
No!

201
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,200
You'll drop your weapon or I'll kill you.

202
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:32,620
Eli!

203
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,820
I have to see you.

204
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:35,880
Eli, like a dog.

205
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:38,120
Like a scurvy dog you are.

206
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,180
Want you to let me kill someone?

207
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:41,860
Kill her!

208
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:43,100
Sure, yeah.

209
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,160
Kill them.

210
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:46,140
Kill them all.

211
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,020
That's what they said.

212
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,140
Kill them all.

213
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,680
You killed my bury.

214
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,720
They're beeswax.

215
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,360
It's a hard hard work,

216
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,800
to blend so many different spaces in your head,

217
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:04,240
yeaah!

218
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,700
You know I can't refuse.

219
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,600
Goose.

220
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:11,340
movie time here.

221
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,720
And...

222
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:19,760
You know I can't refuse.

223
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,580
Build it.

224
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,280
And you.

225
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,240
I believe as I did before.

226
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,700
In theory, it should work.

227
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:27,680
Always theories.

228
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,660
Jigsaw puzzles on paper.

229
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,840
Aren't you fellows ever positive?

230
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,440
I am golden slipass.

231
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:32,940
Look at my feet.

232
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,100
Touch me, levitate now.

233
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,580
Only about doomsday.

234
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,220
Yes.

235
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:39,680
Doomsday.

236
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,320
I have the power in my feet.

237
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,880
Look at my carpal toenails.

238
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,240
Look at the fungus, it shines.

239
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:46,240
I...

240
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,620
Now I look down at you.

241
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,180
See?

242
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,620
And I can move around the room with it.

243
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,860
You think being an insect is not...

244
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:58,920
Of doomsday.

245
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,080
We are all too sure.

246
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,940
Damn that man.

247
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,900
Spend too much time with the stars.

248
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,680
You don't know anything about living.

249
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,280
The law of the jungle.

250
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,040
The human jungle.

251
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,100
I do.

252
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,300
I've spent my life at it.

253
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,160
It's coming.

254
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:17,340
You don't know what your civilized people will do to cling to life.

255
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,620
I do because I know I'd cling if I had to kill to do it.

256
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:21,640
And so will you.

257
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,400
We're the lucky ones.

258
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,040
The handful with the chance to reach another world.

259
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,020
And we'll use those guns.

260
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,460
You'll use them, Doctor.

261
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:29,900
Yes.

262
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:32,120
To keep your only chance to stay alive.

263
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,220
Yes, I'll use them.

264
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:33,760
Right.

265
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,480
There it is.

266
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,640
If I can figure out how to make this thing work.

267
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,920
My friends.

268
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,920
It's backwards, sir.

269
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,180
It is imperative that you listen closely.

270
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:45,280
I was in the cave painting these pictures the way we saw them on the viewer screen.

271
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:46,620
Why were you doing that, Johnny?

272
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:50,800
So in case he did wipe out the human race, there'd be some record of how it happened.

273
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:51,740
Go on, go on.

274
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,620
I need guidance, great one.

275
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:57,740
For the first time in my life, I am not sure.

276
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,740
You sound like a human, not a Roman.

277
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,100
Can you not verify a fact?

278
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:04,480
I'm bossy.

279
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,900
You're so bossy, you ought to be milked before you come home at night.

280
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:13,360
Dominator 1 using a

281
00:12:37,540 --> 00:12:38,060
NOOOOOOO!

282
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,040
AHHHH!

283
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:41,640
Frankie?

284
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,500
Have you ever had unnatural urges?

285
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,740
Do you know the way to the Hershey Highway?

286
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,460
Do you know the way?

287
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:51,960
Oh, you make me sick!

288
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,620
So how'd it feel, girl?

289
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,320
Felt good. Felt real good.

290
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,120
Yeah, I would have.

291
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,620
I had this big

292
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,500
particle on my toe

293
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,760
and I couldn't get off so I had to take a pair of

294
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,000
pliers and grab that sucker

295
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,360
and wrench him over.

296
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,340
What?

297
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,180
You had to grab them pliers and took them pliers

298
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,360
Hello Ivan, how you doing?

299
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,820
Oh, it's you guys!

300
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,320
Yeah, it's the show, man.

301
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,500
Do you have any pliers?

302
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,280
Yeah, I got some pliers for you, son. Right here!

303
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:24,460
I got your pliers swinging!

304
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:26,420
Must be 5 AM there or something.

305
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:29,460
And we're on the last show.

306
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,260
This is the last, last show.

307
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:32,560
What'd you do? Did you get up early?

308
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,740
Oh, you wish it was the last show.

309
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,500
It's the last show.

310
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,580
We don't have any more to do.

311
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,020
It's the last show of the millennium.

312
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,760
It's the last show of the old age.

313
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:44,680
But now

314
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:46,980
the new old age begins.

315
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:47,960
The newage.

316
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,000
Ever more infirm.

317
00:13:51,820 --> 00:13:53,640
And Alzheimer's ridden.

318
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,220
We

319
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,160
hobble on into the future.

320
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,780
Yeah, you hob. Hobnob.

321
00:13:58,880 --> 00:13:59,860
For this time,

322
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:02,500
young baby

323
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,740
2001 is actually

324
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:07,380
still just old man 2000.

325
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,160
What's that dripping sound I hear?

326
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,140
Is that you dripping?

327
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,480
Are you dripping wet?

328
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,280
No, I think that's just

329
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,120
the morphine drip.

330
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,540
What time is it there in

331
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:22,280
the middle, mid-America?

332
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,280
Oh, here

333
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,940
in the great salt mines

334
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,040
underneath Lake Erie.

335
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,320
6.57 AM.

336
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,060
Wow.

337
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,240
So you don't actually feel the cold

338
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:34,740
and horror of the cold?

339
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:34,860
No, I don't.

340
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,240
I don't feel the horrible temperatures

341
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,560
that other people are stuck with there.

342
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,600
No, no, not, not.

343
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,680
Well, I would if I let down

344
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,760
my concentration for a little while.

345
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:45,660
Yeah.

346
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,280
Like the Yeti, I may wander naked

347
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,280
through the snow.

348
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,060
Yeah, I saw those pictures on the website.

349
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,840
Melting the snow before it hits you

350
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,020
because of the radiant heat

351
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,220
you generate with your mighty brain.

352
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,520
Well, it's not my brain, actually.

353
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,140
It's the mighty bowl of chili

354
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,040
that I eat every hour.

355
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,980
Ah, yes.

356
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,700
To fuel them.

357
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:09,920
The huge cans. The one-ton cans being

358
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,880
emptied at one end and the thoughts

359
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,780
coming out the other.

360
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,520
I was one of the benefactors of the leftover chili.

361
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,260
I actually,

362
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,920
well, Dr. Drummond,

363
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,500
please,

364
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,300
you are my mentor in this

365
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,100
arena of

366
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:27,300
pyroflatulation.

367
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,500
Yes, it's an art form that

368
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,060
we all claim mastery of.

369
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,520
Some of us are still learning to be

370
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,020
ascended masters and

371
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:37,240
some are just...

372
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:40,100
I have often been burnt by the heat of your passing.

373
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,720
You quit your

374
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,540
assassin, boy.

375
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,920
I've pulled you out of your mother and I'll shove you right back in.

376
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,160
Now you get in that truck

377
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,020
or you skedaddle.

378
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,220
I like knockers.

379
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,360
Do you ever fantasize

380
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,980
about being killed?

381
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,940
One question, Frank.

382
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,180
This guy's screaming in here.

383
00:16:00,520 --> 00:16:01,520
I'm sure he's a dead cadaver.

384
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,180
Why don't you open the door and find out?

385
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,480
No, it's all right, Frank. I'll take your word for that.

386
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,320
They report they can't use the

387
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,300
flame throwers. Can't get close because of the

388
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:12,540
acid slime. All right. We'll take other

389
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,400
measures. Anyway, you're gonna love this place.

390
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:16,020
It's a dynamite camping spot

391
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:18,000
and it's got a pond to piss in.

392
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:20,240
Sniffing butts is probably more the

393
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,720
articulate science you would prefer.

394
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:24,180
The combination of X-Day, all of them

395
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:26,120
subgeniuses, and Brushwood itself,

396
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,120
the weird energies of that strange

397
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,320
campground in Sherman.

398
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,020
That sounds like an immune system deficiency.

399
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:32,860
It changes people.

400
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,180
It does change people.

401
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,160
I've witnessed that first hand.

402
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,360
People do things out there

403
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,140
that they would never imagine doing

404
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,300
in the world.

405
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:47,580
Have you noticed a trans-dimensional drift

406
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,500
in some of the subjects

407
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,700
or unsubjected ones who are out there

408
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,360
perhaps floundering in the field

409
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:53,600
kissing a rocket butt or something

410
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,260
and the next thing you know they've disappeared off the face of the groin.

411
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,860
I believe that there is a reason for that.

412
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,620
An explainable reason for that

413
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:00,980
is that the National Transfers

414
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,980
I dare you not.

415
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,820
I believe that you will not.

416
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,800
What I have to say would sound so ridiculous

417
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,800
and so ludicrous to your ears.

418
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:12,300
What we've been saying so far was so erudite and clear.

419
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,520
It would almost guarantee disbelief.

420
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,080
So I might as well go ahead and say it.

421
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:19,080
I believe everything you guys have been saying

422
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,860
about Mojo's huge testicles

423
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,280
and the rockets coming out of his head

424
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,620
and everything so far like that.

425
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,560
Many of us feel like we're on the wrong planet.

426
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,560
Ha ha ha.

427
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:29,500
You know, right as Susie the floozy said

428
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,160
right hemisphere, wrong planet.

429
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:31,840
Ha ha ha.

430
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,500
I see. It's like a trans-dimensional gate

431
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,980
or like a Zardo's plane.

432
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,960
Maybe we really are on the wrong planet.

433
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:41,240
Now you know that it is possible to move

434
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,060
planets out of their orbit to in fact

435
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,140
even switch planets

436
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:47,340
and many of us have suspected of course

437
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,680
that the planet we now call Mars

438
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,480
the dead, empty

439
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,460
poison-atmosphere planet

440
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,280
is actually what was once Earth

441
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:57,420
the native planet

442
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,840
of some of us in our yeti days.

443
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:01,420
But it was polluted

444
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,380
by the humans.

445
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:06,120
It was made red with the blood of many many creatures

446
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:08,640
that came and went as the wind.

447
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:08,700
And what we used to call Mars

448
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,280
had brought it to this part of the solar system.

449
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:12,860
One second.

450
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:15,400
And we now move on what was Mars

451
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,880
only it is now called Earth

452
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,820
by the conspiracy.

453
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,100
And in fact they are trying to make it more like Mars

454
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,700
covered with concrete

455
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:26,180
or rock, whatever, concrete for now.

456
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,300
Painting the buildings red.

457
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,700
Poisoning the atmosphere.

458
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:32,160
Painting people's eyelids red as if they hadn't slept for days.

459
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,480
Exposing them to radiation.

460
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,560
And by doing that

461
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:39,040
making them take nitrogen and subcutaneously aniline.

462
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,260
They are recreating Mars here on Earth

463
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,040
and yet Mars

464
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:44,740
they are secretly planning to turn it back into the

465
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:46,760
20,000 million years to our

466
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,440
into their

467
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,780
special conspiracy hideout.

468
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,960
But it was our planet.

469
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,820
Earth back to Mars.

470
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:55,580
They are going to love the knife screens.

471
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,540
Earth. The danglings of the earth.

472
00:18:57,560 --> 00:18:58,260
Earth back to Mars.

473
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,820
So few astronaut Americans

474
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,400
have been willing to come out and admit

475
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,700
that yes, friends sure

476
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,380
many of you at this point are going

477
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,100
yeah maybe Sang's right

478
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,560
this all makes sense. No wonder I felt so weird

479
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,660
in high school. No matter I'm such a

480
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,480
mutant. But

481
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,500
what if friends, of course you're

482
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,580
thinking but I'm sure they did this

483
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,140
switch thousands of years ago.

484
00:19:21,300 --> 00:19:23,600
No! It happened in 1953!

485
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,780
In 1953

486
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:27,160
Earth

487
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,560
and Mars changed places

488
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,740
by the strange forces

489
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,040
wielded by the conspiracy

490
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,360
and their alien allies.

491
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,260
And to this day the mystery of it is

492
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,380
how did they do it without anyone

493
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:41,120
noticing? It is very hard.

494
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:42,740
If you look at the Hollywood movies

495
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,340
if you look at the comic books, if you look in the bottom

496
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:47,420
of the wine bottle after it's been finished off

497
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,760
you will see that what I say

498
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,500
is true. It did happen

499
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,480
in 1953. Earth was switched

500
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,240
with Mars. Okay

501
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:57,540
now let's elaborate on the substance of Mars.

502
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,180
Robert you MSNBCish guy

503
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,460
you made the point that Clinton was a dirty

504
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,380
liar or something whatever point you wanted to make.

505
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,420
I'm gonna miss Bill. Let's have the proof

506
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:07,140
I don't care what you guys say. It's hard

507
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:09,340
to change planets midstream.

508
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:11,680
Imagine Chaz over there trying to catch

509
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,340
an RTA fudge. That is why

510
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,420
it's... I don't expect you to

511
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,480
believe me. And yet

512
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,440
what I said was the one serious thing

513
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:20,940
I've ever said on this show. It doesn't matter.

514
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,440
You can burn it all down. Burn the whole

515
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,420
planet down because we're gonna get off soon.

516
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:27,320
Let them burn it down.

517
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,060
See Chaz that's where we differ.

518
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:31,100
But see they don't want to let us off.

519
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,400
They're trying to keep us here. They're gonna get off.

520
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,380
Chaz is like an Earth let's get off guy

521
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,140
and I'm like one of those Earth first guys.

522
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:39,480
I think we should turn this into a terrestrial

523
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,320
paradise. Yeah I believe in that. Earth first

524
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,340
then we can torch the other planets

525
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,960
later. But see

526
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:46,920
they've already done that.

527
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:49,460
Attila to Chaz. We're just now getting

528
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,440
the idea. The conspiracy's been doing this for

529
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,380
billions of years. This is the last planet of

530
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,360
the solar system. They've already done it to all the

531
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:57,440
other planets. Well I can't wait to turn it to cinders

532
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,200
either then. But man Neptune

533
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,320
was great before the conspiracy started

534
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,440
building walls on it. We swam on Neptune. We swam on

535
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,440
Neptune. We were like it was the air and

536
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,620
it was the water. It was like this nitrogenous

537
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,260
stuff and it was like a jelly.

538
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,480
And Saturn didn't used to have any atmosphere at

539
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,160
all hardly. Until we blew that up too.

540
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,500
It's really a small planet actually. Those rings

541
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,220
were originally a beautiful moon

542
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,500
sculpted in the shape of Bob's head.

543
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,620
It was our home. The conspiracy destroyed it.

544
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,520
We lived in that pipe and we blew it

545
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:23,780
up.

546
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,440
We're killing everything. We lived in the pipe

547
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:31,500
We are the children of the pipe of the ring of the

548
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,320
pipe of the ring of Saturn.

549
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,240
No.

550
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,360
That was pretty good. We are the children

551
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,940
of the pipe of the ring

552
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,980
of the pipe of the ring

553
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:43,380
of the ring of Saturn.

554
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,040
Whatever you guys are on.

555
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,600
I don't want any of it.

556
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:49,620
Talk about B-Wolf

557
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,560
and all them guys.

558
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:52,260
Jeez man.

559
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,580
Yes this is the last show folks.

560
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:57,540
The last show.

561
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,380
The very last show.

562
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:01,000
The very last show.

563
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,620
It's about damn time.

564
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,300
Can you believe it's lasted this long and they hadn't

565
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,640
killed us yet? Really?

566
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,960
That's the thing that amazes me. I can't believe it.

567
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:10,660
So now that

568
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,980
Stang and Phyla have gone to Burning Man

569
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,200
is Doug going to go to

570
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:16,760
Wellman Greenfield?

571
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,340
Yeah to Janer stock in New York.

572
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,420
Hey get out of the way man!

573
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,000
Hey shut the door.

574
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,620
There was a terrible controversy over

575
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,760
whether the giant subgenius

576
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,580
party of 4X Day

577
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,740
should be held after the world ends

578
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,580
or before. Yeah I like those questions.

579
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:35,560
Well what do you think? What's the vote count?

580
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,280
Well there was a vote and the

581
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,620
principal chose to

582
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,440
party aboard the escape vessels

583
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,360
after July 5th. In other words

584
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,520
the celebration of

585
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:46,580
X Day will begin

586
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,060
at 7am July 5th

587
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:50,740
which is Thursday.

588
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,800
Sure.

589
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,320
I vote maybe.

590
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,180
And it will never end.

591
00:22:57,300 --> 00:22:59,140
This will be the X Day that never ends.

592
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,560
Bring your moon pants.

593
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,740
Breach them not.

594
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,560
As you enter the vacuum.

595
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:06,760
Ah yes.

596
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,120
Wow free watermelon.

597
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,040
Bring your moon pants

598
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,620
and your um

599
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,400
your moon rocks.

600
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,380
Bring your moon rocks too.

601
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,680
Bring your

602
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,340
your gland shoes.

603
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:22,700
Bring your mattress.

604
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:25,600
Bring your mattress back with you.

605
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,860
Go to camp man. I'm bringing mine.

606
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:30,020
Bring your old mattress back there.

607
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,980
Take her on down.

608
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,920
Back in that back room.

609
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:36,720
You know where all that stuff is.

610
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,320
Back where we made the real plan.

611
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:40,740
He he he he.

612
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:41,580
Wait a minute.

613
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,860
Are you talking about the place where

614
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,100
where Tenderly Convenience waxed

615
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,760
Sterno in the head? That back room?

616
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:49,920
Yeah. That was the corner room.

617
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:51,320
That was in Chicago.

618
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:55,120
That was a long time ago folks.

619
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:55,600
Well you didn't know that.

620
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:56,620
You could have hit him in the head too.

621
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:58,280
You could have.

622
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,180
You're just jealous cause Tenderly got there first.

623
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,760
Here's Tenderly dancing around.

624
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,740
Everybody wanted some Sterno head back in those days.

625
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:09,200
In a tunnel.

626
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:10,980
I really wanted some Tenderly head.

627
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:13,280
Now these people are old

628
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,600
crotchety men.

629
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,360
Sad old bags of

630
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,940
Sad old bags of

631
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:19,740
pissed off-edness.

632
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:22,840
I remember when South Jesus owned the world.

633
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,320
I remember when he was the

634
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,060
preeminent cult in America

635
00:24:27,060 --> 00:24:29,720
and now the Mormons have completely taken over.

636
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,080
I've got

637
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,860
everything in sync.

638
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,240
And I don't mean

639
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,860
in synchronization.

640
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,160
I take a

641
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,340
load now

642
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:41,960
and then.

643
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:45,040
Some people flush it down the toilet.

644
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,040
I depend on the sink.

645
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:48,760
The sink.

646
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,480
The sink.

647
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,480
And then the plumber happened to

648
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:53,900
arrive.

649
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,960
And they took that little

650
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,200
electrical snake

651
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,540
and they plunged it down the sink.

652
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,660
And you wouldn't believe

653
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,620
what they came up with.

654
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,080
In the sink.

655
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,160
In the sink.

656
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,840
So anymore

657
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,720
I don't do that procedure.

658
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,660
I don't do that procedure.

659
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,660
Cause it

660
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,540
stopped up the drain.

661
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:23,380
Cause it stopped up the drain.

662
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,600
It stopped up the sink.

663
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:25,600


664
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,640
So if you've got a

665
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,800
master bank

666
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,520
Don't use the sink.

667
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,060
Cause you're just

668
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,280
giving a dog

669
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:41,560
to a plumber.

670
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,720
Don't stop up the sink

671
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,420
with a cup.

672
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:51,860
Don't shoot your

673
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:53,160
barge

674
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,440
down the sink

675
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:55,600
with a cup.

676
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:55,600


677
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:55,600


678
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:55,600


679
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:59,440
It's not the kind of thing

680
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,020
that works against the sink.

681
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,600
Don't sink your

682
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,140
water

683
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,160
down the sink.

684
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,020
And the day

685
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,620
comes

686
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:12,600
when heaven and earth

687
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,920
belong to one.

688
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,520
You can look back

689
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,680
in the sink.

690
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:21,560
I hate

691
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,460
these memories.

692
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,340
I hate

693
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:26,180
the sink.

694
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,500
Everything goes

695
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:31,400
back to the sink.

696
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,840
How do

697
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,940
you make babies?

698
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:39,100
How do you stop

699
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,320
births short of

700
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:40,800
abortion?

701
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,700
How do you do it

702
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,940
with a sink?

703
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,860
How do you stop

704
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,840
babies

705
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,620
without abortion?

706
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:55,600
How do you stop

707
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:55,600


708
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:55,880
babies without

709
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:55,880


710
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,400
How do you do it

711
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,580
with a sink?

712
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,360
You bust

713
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,340
them little

714
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,740
spermies

715
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,620
down the

716
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,380
sink.

717
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,340
Oh,

718
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,040
yes dear

719
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:22,340
friends.

720
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:22,820
Well, that was

721
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:23,500
something you don't

722
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,220
hear every day.

723
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,100
A song there

724
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:29,200
called In Sink

725
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,600
or In the Sink

726
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:33,160
by Skip and

727
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,240
the Elite

728
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:36,720
posted to the

729
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,720
Alt Binaries Slack

730
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,020
News Group.

731
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,200
And friends,

732
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,100
we've also been listening to the last

733
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:47,000
show of

734
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,460
the millennium on KPFA

735
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:51,000
in Berkeley. The

736
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,620
subgenius, non-subgenius,

737
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:55,540
more than an hour, less than a show

738
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,620
show with puzzling

739
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:59,740
evidence and normally has Dr. Howell

740
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,000
but in this case, Dr.

741
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:03,380
Philo Drummond, the

742
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:05,260
overman, the true,

743
00:28:05,420 --> 00:28:07,080
one true, the only

744
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,180
overman yet so far

745
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:11,560
that we have in the church. The only

746
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,180
proof we have that Bob is

747
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,680
even true. Oh,

748
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,580
no.

749
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,320
Oh, man. No wonder, well anyway,

750
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:21,140
that show was all

751
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:23,620
mottered up with the ESO

752
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,900
Swamp Radio

753
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,120
show at WCSB

754
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,460
Cleveland with Professor

755
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,100
Chaz Smith and

756
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,220
lonesome cowboy Dave

757
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:35,360
and yours truly and maybe

758
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
Princess We Are Doe got in there somewhere

759
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,000
and there's some

760
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,300
media barrage clips, monster movie

761
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:43,040
stuff by our friend

762
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,240
Noumonet, the

763
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,500
mysterious Noumonet.

764
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,820
The music

765
00:28:48,820 --> 00:28:51,600
in the background is Einstein's

766
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,700
Secret Orchestra with

767
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,400
Ron Slade.

768
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,740
Recorded just a couple

769
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,220
of weeks ago at Winterstar

770
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,140
Symposium sponsored

771
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,120
by Ace. This song

772
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,560
called Trippy Beard

773
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,100
P-Boy Muff.

774
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,440
Oh, speaking of hippie weird

775
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,440
stuff, I've got the schedule

776
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,480
for Winterstar where we have

777
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,500
to work, boys.

778
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,540
What do we, do we have to slosh the kitchen or do we

779
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,280
have to remove the urinals and stuff? You have to do

780
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:21,360
a consciousness expanding

781
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,740
jam at the end of the evening.

782
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,040
I thought it was the P-Boy.

783
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,500
Get this man, Halim

784
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:29,500
El Dab. Halim El Dab?

785
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,660
Notice that name, Halim El Dab

786
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:33,080
who is a pharaoh.

787
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,340
An actual pharaoh of a pharaoh. I am proud to call

788
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,400
an acquaintance, perhaps even

789
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,300
a friend. Certainly I admire

790
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:41,460
his great drumming and his composition. I know you used to hang with

791
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:43,220
the Ramseys and Tootin' Common

792
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:46,020
and all the rest of the guys that are seriously mortifying.

793
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:47,460
He will be drumming across the great

794
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,820
rivers while... Sticks.

795
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,240
You can stretch

796
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,580
yourself out of

797
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:55,580
pain. Oh, string theory again. With

798
00:29:55,620 --> 00:29:57,040
that Abnomi, that abnormal

799
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:59,360
girl. You can turn yourself into a G-flat or an

800
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,880
A-shark. And, um,

801
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,680
Halim El Dab

802
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,340
will guide you in

803
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,240
slack. And, uh,

804
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,460
at 3 o'clock, actually at 3.30, then I

805
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,020
give a scientific

806
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:13,360
talk about the scientific basis

807
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,440
of slack. Okay, now who's

808
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,400
to guide... My new neighbor, Nathar, will be

809
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:19,500
doing the electronic meditation devices.

810
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,440
Do you have a new home or domicile?

811
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:23,200
Something

812
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:25,480
is happening. You don't have to say where it is, I'm just saying.

813
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,500
We're tunneling, let me put it that way.

814
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,440
The tunnel is progressing. You're taking the bags

815
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,520
of dirt out and you're making sure that nobody knows

816
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,500
where you're going? We have to

817
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,480
hide the bags of dirt. Imagine.

818
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,420
That ain't easy.

819
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:39,460
Oh, and then Pope Bob Wilson... I noticed your toenails

820
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,580
were filling. ...after it does... will tell

821
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,240
it... give everyone a new map

822
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,460
of their consciousness. Pope... Pope

823
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,240
Dozier? Pope Bob... Robert

824
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,340
Anton Wilson is his fancy

825
00:30:49,340 --> 00:30:51,260
author name. We'll connect our consciousness in the key of a

826
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,460
flat tire. But we subgeniuses know him as

827
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,820
just a regular feller...

828
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:57,600
Pope. ...who appears and disappears

829
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,460
magnanimously without any reason.

830
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,680
Sometimes in a bar or a kitchen.

831
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,700
It's the way.

832
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:05,660
It's the way. It's the way

833
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,520
above us. It's the way it's been done for billions

834
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,400
of years. So what was life like

835
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,600
to an early denizen of the pipe

836
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,500
of the ring of the pipe of the ring of the moon

837
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:15,600
of the Saturn? It was like

838
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,600
working at Playboy. I was gonna say...

839
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,440
It was like as if you worked at Playboy.

840
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:21,460
I was gonna say it was like working at Kmart.

841
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,960
The endless droning.

842
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,860
No, it's like working... The blue shirts, the red shirts.

843
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,760
You were the photographer's

844
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,380
assistant at Playboy. We are happy to help you.

845
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,360
No, the makeup person's assistant.

846
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:33,220
Can I help you? At Playboy.

847
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,860
And what else is happening then? The spritzerer.

848
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,780
I'm the spritzerer?

849
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,780
The one who comes and spritzes the babe.

850
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,160
What else is happening then? You're supposed to look sweaty.

851
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:42,820
Um...

852
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:45,540
Oh, and then, uh, that's when

853
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:47,380
my page ran out.

854
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,520
But what they didn't dare print

855
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,500
on my printer refused to print

856
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:53,200
was something about a

857
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,360
space jam... Glam's what's he? In the

858
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,620
middle of the frozen night.

859
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,720
In those cabins.

860
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,160
Covered with icicles. Did it say anything about

861
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,800
Space Trance 1 workshop

862
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,060
meditation

863
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,440
trance drone?

864
00:32:08,620 --> 00:32:09,920
It may have.

865
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,520
I forget what time.

866
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,940
I think I'm on five.

867
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:17,120
I'm on right across from... Look at www.rosencomet.com

868
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:17,460
Yeah.

869
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,180
Maybein' it'd be best

870
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:54,880
to swear, Unre保証

871
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,000
as I spell theَ

872
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:55,020
name.

873
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:55,600
His business via

874
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:55,600


875
00:32:39,620 --> 00:32:53,620
arna

876
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,020
Will you escape from the deep?

877
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,560
Will I live soon?

878
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,340
Will you wander through the wilderness of fall?

879
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,940
I know the moon is on me

880
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:45,540
And I know soon the body is coming

881
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,320
I've smelled it, heard voices, had an universal voice

882
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,860
A galaxy that numbered a billion

883
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,600
Will you escape from the deep?

884
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:55,600


885
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,900
Will I live soon?

886
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,580
Will you wander through the wilderness of fall?

887
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,720
Hey now, hey now!

888
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:32,780
Now, to abruptly change the subject,

889
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:40,240
this, the internet, um, I was, uh, there's several subgenius news groups

890
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,380
and of course a zillion websites and so forth, but, and chat rooms, all that kind of crap,

891
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:51,060
and one, one person was griping on, on alt.binaries.slack,

892
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:54,540
which actually has great stuff on it,

893
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,040
and, uh, he was complaining, he goes,

894
00:34:57,100 --> 00:35:00,120
Oh my Bob, is this news group screwed up?

895
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:02,220
All the posts are coming in day late,

896
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,840
and even the goodies that I put there don't show up, and

897
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:07,380
he goes, yeah, everything's a day late for me too,

898
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:11,160
I think the conspiracy is screwing with Usenet

899
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:14,000
so that we'll all go web-based.

900
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:20,240
And friends, I think that's exactly what's going on.

901
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,360
And, I don't know, you know, some of you are probably a little newer to the internet,

902
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,580
and some of you probably have dealt with it for a long time,

903
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,180
but I suspect that in about a year or two,

904
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:36,160
we'll all have to have a license to have a website,

905
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:39,480
just like the radio, you know?

906
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,160
They, there was a time when anybody could have a radio station,

907
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:44,120
but suddenly, oh well, there's not enough bandwidth.

908
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:48,840
So, and of course, you know, some of these subversives might use it for,

909
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,340
you know, to spread something bad, like information.

910
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:54,900
So, friends, the supernational,

911
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:58,680
corporations don't like competition.

912
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:05,000
And they know that our one world religion is the only antidote

913
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:07,680
for the one world advertiser.

914
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,260
Down with the supernationals and up with the supernatural, my friends!

915
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:17,520
Up, down with the quote-less Bob, and up with Bob!

916
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:23,420
When they, as Bob said, in 1959,

917
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,880
Bob!

918
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,180
When they regulate websites,

919
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:30,900
only news group geeks will have free pornography!

920
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,420
He muttered that in his sleep.

921
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:39,140
Now, friends, I really do think that, of course, needless to say,

922
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:43,760
the conspiracy is not going to let us get away with murder on the internet forever,

923
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:47,000
like we have been. I certainly feel like I have been.

924
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:52,100
But, you know, and this is what the lesson that we must learn is that

925
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:54,880
a few subgeniuses must retain their power,

926
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,800
and they must retain the primitive knowledge,

927
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:02,620
and we must hand down certain paleolithic knowledge,

928
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:07,140
like of pre-website stone implements,

929
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:12,220
like news readers, and telex, and crap like that,

930
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,160
hand axes, you know,

931
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:19,240
and even, we must, even some of us must take it upon ourselves

932
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,380
to hand down skills like shoe repair,

933
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:25,460
how to clean a handgun barrel,

934
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,440
so it doesn't blow up in your face,

935
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:30,600
and how to change tires, and diapers, and dollars,

936
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:33,460
and so forth, because, friends,

937
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:41,940
I was shocked at how fast the internet went from 99% slack to 99% ads!

938
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,480
It was almost like it happened overnight.

939
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:48,380
Now, back in the late 60s, early 70s,

940
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,060
it took more than a year

941
00:37:51,060 --> 00:37:54,600
to turn what was known as acid rock

942
00:37:54,600 --> 00:38:00,860
into a sold-out conspiracy tool used to sell tires on Sears commercials.

943
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:05,540
By the late 70s, with what punk came along,

944
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:07,020
I remember kids telling me,

945
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,620
well, that old hippie stuff didn't do anybody any good,

946
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,400
but punk will save the world!

947
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,960
It will save the conspiracy cat fight!

948
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:20,680
It took six months to turn punk into a slogan and a haircut on a beer commercial!

949
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,040
And, friends, nowadays,

950
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,580
only little children still believe

951
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:31,280
that music can ever be used as a weapon of rebellion anymore!

952
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:34,720
But then, along came the internet.

953
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:36,600
We had to give up on rock and roll.

954
00:38:36,780 --> 00:38:38,780
It's owned, lock, stock, and barrel.

955
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,940
But the internet, there was hope!

956
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,440
There was actual hope!

957
00:38:42,660 --> 00:38:44,100
But how long did it take?

958
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:46,080
The wink of an eye, friend,

959
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,840
the blink of that red eye

960
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:51,040
that you see when the conspiracy cat fights,

961
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:52,220
the conspiracy moons you!

962
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,200
And, friends, I hate to say it,

963
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:58,100
but I am a, well, I'm proud to say I'm a subgenius,

964
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,940
but I am a dumbass!

965
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:02,880
Because I actually thought that it would be years

966
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,140
before the internet was castrated,

967
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,800
since I figured, well,

968
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,580
the government can't get their hands on it.

969
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,880
You know, it got away from them.

970
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,460
Boy, was I fooled

971
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:15,220
to think there was a government!

972
00:39:15,620 --> 00:39:19,700
That was the, the damn government was the first to go!

973
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:23,760
Long before acid rock was even thought about,

974
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:25,120
the government was sold out.

975
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:31,120
The one world advertiser has been bamboozling us all along,

976
00:39:31,260 --> 00:39:34,120
at least for the last couple of hundred years.

977
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:36,900
And no more of it, I say, friends!

978
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,660
Now that it's too late,

979
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,140
and it's a completely hopeless battle,

980
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,700
that's when we, the subgeniuses,

981
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:46,160
must fight back all the morgue insanely!

982
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:49,080
And viciously and mindlessly, friends!

983
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,880
What have we got to lose?

984
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,720
What have we got to lose at this point?

985
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,500
Most of us, we, you know,

986
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,080
people complain about civil,

987
00:40:01,220 --> 00:40:04,560
we're just, our civil rights are slowly being taken away.

988
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:09,460
My friends, you give away all your civil rights

989
00:40:09,460 --> 00:40:11,700
the minute you clock in at work in the morning.

990
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:15,340
You give up your civil rights from 9 to 5 every day,

991
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,100
you know, and don't even think anything about that.

992
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:21,960
You clock out from what freedom you pretended to have,

993
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,560
and then you go home and watch TV and go to sleep.

994
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,860
So what is left, friends,

995
00:40:27,020 --> 00:40:30,020
except to use every spare second,

996
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:32,040
every spare stolen minute,

997
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,280
working like a crazed lab rat

998
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,520
with a wire up our asses

999
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:39,120
on anything that will give ourselves slack!

1000
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:44,260
Even if that means laying in bed watching TV for hours.

1001
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:44,920
Praise Bob.

1002
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:51,260
But it could also mean energetic monkey wrenching.

1003
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:53,340
And I don't mean monkey wrenching of machines.

1004
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:54,860
Machines are our friends.

1005
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:57,280
You know, the robots, let them serve us.

1006
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:01,440
But the monkey wrenching of men's minds, friends!

1007
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:05,260
Yes, you know, a strong pink back

1008
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,460
is a terrible thing to waste.

1009
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:11,480
And some of my fellow subgeniuses feel that

1010
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,520
on July 5th, 19, well, uh,

1011
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,300
2001, whatever,

1012
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,000
when the aliens finally arrive and

1013
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,320
the dues-paying subgeniuses are ruptured up

1014
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,520
into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses,

1015
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:27,500
on that day, some subgeniuses,

1016
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,260
the holocaustal group,

1017
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:30,900
feel that we should just simply

1018
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,580
wipe out every normal human being

1019
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,980
who didn't send Bob 30 bucks!

1020
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:41,760
Now others, such as the evangelicals,

1021
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,260
the schism that I got stuck with,

1022
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,680
we believe that, you know,

1023
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,340
why waste them if you can put them to work, you know?

1024
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,560
If we can control their drone-like behavior

1025
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,720
like is already being done,

1026
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:00,740
like the toy robot stick men they already are,

1027
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,280
why don't we do it, you know?

1028
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:06,760
Now, how each individual does this,

1029
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,000
that's between you and Bob!

1030
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,740
Unlike every other human being,

1031
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:13,000
even if you're a conspiracy and religion,

1032
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:16,060
we're not gonna tell you what to do or what to think,

1033
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:17,540
we'll just tell you how to think.

1034
00:42:18,740 --> 00:42:20,640
That's the, really, that's the great thing

1035
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:21,700
about this church, friends,

1036
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:24,480
because only you paid Bob

1037
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,240
to tell you what you really think slack is.

1038
00:42:27,660 --> 00:42:31,600
No other subgenius will even try to tell you

1039
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,620
what your slack is,

1040
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,820
and the real subgeniuses,

1041
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:39,060
they know that if they could telepathically gaze

1042
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,720
deep into the soul of another subgenius,

1043
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:46,020
all of the other ones would seem utterly incomprehensible

1044
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,600
and completely insane

1045
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,720
at the basis of their very soul.

1046
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:51,580
And they are!

1047
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:54,380
But we know that,

1048
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,540
and that is the difference!

1049
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:58,900
Praise Bob and hail Connie!

1050
00:43:02,900 --> 00:43:06,340
Soon a Star Wars battle will be fought among the planets,

1051
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:09,740
and the headquarters of these spirits will be transferred to the Earth.

1052
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,420
Who are these ETs?

1053
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,680
Lucifer and his fallen angels,

1054
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,320
the Devil and his demons.

1055
00:43:15,540 --> 00:43:16,380
Who's behind it all?

1056
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:20,240
Well, this mysterious ET called Satan.

1057
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:30,320
We must have all good wrong blood for this tight war.

1058
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,960
The evil is free.

1059
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,080
May God have mercy on us.

1060
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,680
We've got a card to order this startling new video

1061
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,380
for a gift for just $24.95.

1062
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,660
Plus $3 shipping and Halloween.

1063
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,040
Space.

1064
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,040
2001.

1065
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,460
Download.

1066
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,380
Transporter.

1067
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:12,180
Conquest.

1068
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,720
Thamara M dance.

1069
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,360
��이

1070
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:39,080
expands to plastic and

1071
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,720
stop your

1072
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,040
Insects don't have politics.

1073
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:48,260
They're very brutal.

1074
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:51,680
No compassion.

1075
00:44:51,940 --> 00:44:53,520
No compromise.

1076
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:57,420
We can't trust the insect.

1077
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:06,060
I'd like to become the first insect politician.

1078
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,880
You see, I'd like to.

1079
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:11,300
And don't we have one?

1080
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,320
Isn't George W.

1081
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,140
I'm afraid.

1082
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:15,140
W.

1083
00:45:15,640 --> 00:45:16,100
W.

1084
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,440
I don't know what you're trying to say.

1085
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,700
I like what you're saying.

1086
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:21,600
I'm saying I'm an insect.

1087
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:22,320
Yes.

1088
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,480
I'm saying I'm an insect.

1089
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:29,180
Who dreamt he was a man.

1090
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:29,840
Yes.

1091
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:30,880
And loved it.

1092
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,100
Loved it.

1093
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:33,400
But now the dream is over.

1094
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:34,500
Now the dream is over.

1095
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,100
I know.

1096
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:35,920
And the insect isn't.

1097
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:39,240
I know.

1098
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,660
We're all insects.

1099
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:41,640
Saying I'm an insect.

1100
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,520
Who dreamt we were men.

1101
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:44,900
Saying I'm an insect.

1102
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:48,860
But now the dream is over.

1103
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:51,560
They're saying I'm an insect.

1104
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,260
At the board of unemployment, they're saying I'm an insect.

1105
00:45:56,300 --> 00:45:59,560
At the job I'd like to give, they're saying I'm an insect.

1106
00:45:59,820 --> 00:46:03,140
My church and in my home, they're calling me an insect.

1107
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:07,460
But I don't believe.

1108
00:46:17,560 --> 00:46:18,240
They're not.

1109
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:20,500
They're calling us.

1110
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:24,740
Why aren't we supposed to call?

1111
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:24,740


1112
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:25,480
We want a lie.

1113
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:27,620
It's important that you stay from the dates of the year.

1114
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:28,000
Other people probably have a homeless family back there.

1115
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,000


1116
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,000


1117
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,000


1118
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,000


1119
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,000


1120
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,000


1121
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,000


1122
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:28,000


1123
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,740
We're heard, but we don't now what story's going on.

1124
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:31,280
Oh.

1125
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,660
You're the only one who knew this story.

1126
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:34,660


1127
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:34,660


1128
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:35,000


1129
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:55,600
By the way, Ivan, have you ever listened to this show on kpfa.org?

1130
00:46:55,780 --> 00:47:00,140
I just did. I listened to the whole first half of it just this morning.

1131
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,760
It was your show.

1132
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:09,220
It was the same damn CD that I just sent to you, only it sounded all watery.

1133
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:10,760
That's right, because we were upstairs conferring.

1134
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:15,020
Yeah, we had to be upstairs conferring to get my drift.

1135
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:18,000
If you catch my meaning there.

1136
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,620
Let me do some more show here.

1137
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:22,580
We had to snort some show.

1138
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,000
Oh, man, this is a great show.

1139
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:24,700
All right.

1140
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:27,620
I think this show's been stepped on.

1141
00:47:27,620 --> 00:47:31,120
See, that's our version of Popus Lilith doing her, you know,

1142
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:31,960
Hey, is that?

1143
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,220
That, uh, frop?

1144
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,880
I thought that was hilarious, actually.

1145
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,060
And you know what's funny?

1146
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:41,020
I recognize it right away as Popus Lilith.

1147
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:42,460
Did you know that the average...

1148
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:44,080
It was Popus Lilith pretending to be a guy.

1149
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,400
Did you know that in his lifetime...

1150
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:49,000
I'm going to give you a little fact here, Reverend Stans,

1151
00:47:49,180 --> 00:47:53,060
that in his lifetime, the average person will have eaten...

1152
00:47:53,060 --> 00:47:56,960
I know this assumes that they're not a vegan or a vegetarian...

1153
00:47:56,960 --> 00:47:57,740
Or Phineas Narcos.

1154
00:47:57,820 --> 00:48:01,220
But they will have eaten 14 cattle, 12 sheep,

1155
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:08,580
2 calves, 23 hogs, 35 turkeys, 770 pounds of fish, and 880 chickens.

1156
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:10,840
I heard it was thousands of chickens.

1157
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,440
Well, yeah, it could be thousands by now.

1158
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:15,140
I mean, how does that help us with our last short of the lalunium?

1159
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:17,580
Probably less calves and more chickens by now.

1160
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:20,040
I don't eat as much veal as I used to.

1161
00:48:20,240 --> 00:48:20,280
Only 14 cattle?

1162
00:48:20,560 --> 00:48:23,020
Only 14 cattle, but they're big cattle.

1163
00:48:23,580 --> 00:48:24,800
They're like ox.

1164
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:28,980
I don't even want to think about what they do to calves.

1165
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:29,540
Cows!

1166
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:30,320
Cows.

1167
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:31,820
Oh, they torture them.

1168
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:35,300
They eat them mercilessly before they kill them and feed them to us.

1169
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,140
They make us eat them.

1170
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:39,980
But that's okay because it's people doing it.

1171
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:41,200
It's not other calves.

1172
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:42,220
Yeah, it's okay if it's...

1173
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,940
It would be brutality if it was another cow doing it.

1174
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:46,600
My God, that would be unthinkable.

1175
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:49,020
That would be... I couldn't think about that, but...

1176
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:50,800
As long as I know that's not happening...

1177
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:55,660
By the way, folks, if you're watching on Channel X, you can see Ivan saying they're eating psychopops.

1178
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,120
I've heard that they do that.

1179
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,820
They force the animal's parents to do it in other foreign countries.

1180
00:49:01,820 --> 00:49:03,860
Oh, it's going to be an exciting subgenius show.

1181
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:06,220
The one and two's gone.

1182
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:11,400
In some foreign countries, they force tigers to eat antelopes.

1183
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:13,880
They force lions to eat zebras.

1184
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,020
Did you know that...

1185
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,120
That's how cruel people are to animals.

1186
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,960
In this country, they force cats to eat songbirds.

1187
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:29,440
We raise house cats so that they can go out and kill the songbirds.

1188
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,000
And that's why we have so many bugs.

1189
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:32,600
Good night, bird.

1190
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:37,340
400 million girls were interviewed after why they had their legitimate babies.

1191
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:40,120
They said not just the words, the beat.

1192
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,700
They don't believe I'm crying, do they?

1193
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:45,300
No.

1194
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,380
They will when they make me feel conscious, though, won't they?

1195
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:49,260
No.

1196
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,460
You figure that out if you want to.

1197
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:59,420
They instigate wars, terrorism, assassinations, murders, rapes, and every other evil.

1198
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:00,500
They're all committed globally.

1199
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,400
So you're too naive.

1200
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:05,280
You don't know what Jim Jones is all about.

1201
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:06,160
You can't even follow him.

1202
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:09,080
They said not just the words, the beat.

1203
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,940
The fertility rights of the jungles are the same beat.

1204
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,960
Incorporated in this modern rock to spill it all.

1205
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:19,540
We haven't got next to him, but I've got all kinds of things in store.

1206
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:21,320
Who and what are these ETs?

1207
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:23,200
Who created them and why?

1208
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,200
Can their existence be proven?

1209
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:26,920
Sex on the street.

1210
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:34,380
You who are stupid piss ants and reptiles and lower than the primates,

1211
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,180
you can make a hoopie if you want.

1212
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,440
Sex on the street.

1213
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,980
So you can make your hoopie while I do something.

1214
00:50:40,980 --> 00:50:41,680
Do you feel blamed?

1215
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,240
Are you mad?

1216
00:50:43,460 --> 00:50:45,320
Do you feel like moose about to run planet?

1217
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:46,600
Do you feel like moose about to run planet?

1218
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,340
Do you feel like moose about to run planet?

1219
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:54,720
That's where the music comes up and everybody gets really, really, really scared.

1220
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,360
Man, this has been a lot of fun because we've had the, uh...

1221
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,140
We've had everybody here tonight.

1222
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:03,020
We've had the only three important people in the Church of the Subgenius, that's for sure.

1223
00:51:03,020 --> 00:51:03,580
Yeah, that's true.

1224
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:07,400
Phineas, me, and Wellman.

1225
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:10,540
Wait, no, let me look at my card here. I can't...

1226
00:51:10,540 --> 00:51:11,240
Hey, what? What?

1227
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,000
Yes, you've been listening to the last show of the Malunium.

1228
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:17,340
I don't think so.

1229
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:22,420
Only the three most important, but not the greatest of all subgenii.

1230
00:51:22,600 --> 00:51:25,560
But where was Bob in all this time?

1231
00:51:25,780 --> 00:51:27,820
Well, Bob's just the made-up guy. Don't worry about that.

1232
00:51:27,820 --> 00:51:30,680
And where then was Bob in all this time, son?

1233
00:51:30,740 --> 00:51:30,840
I'll tell you about it.

1234
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,860
Bob's in your mother.

1235
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:33,460
Where are you thinking of, Bob?

1236
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:38,780
If I were one of the subgeniuses, I'd claim that I made up Bob right about now.

1237
00:51:38,780 --> 00:51:42,560
Did you even have the common decency to pull your knife out of Bob's belly that day, eh?

1238
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,740
I'll tell you where he is, Stans. He's at your mama's house.

1239
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:46,860
Heh heh.

1240
00:51:48,140 --> 00:51:50,540
Eating the black stuff inside his skeleton.

1241
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,320
I was gonna ask, sir, what about the black stuff?

1242
00:51:53,340 --> 00:51:56,460
Hey, uh, cut your belly open and I'll show you the black stuff.

1243
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:57,800
Sounds like a rub, you know.

1244
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:01,420
You're gonna cut your little round belly with the black stuff inside your mother's skeleton.

1245
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:02,580
Heh heh heh.

1246
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:03,180
Is Sal there?

1247
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:04,080
Let the rabbit suffer.

1248
00:52:04,340 --> 00:52:05,140
Is Sal there?

1249
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:06,000
Heh heh heh.

1250
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:06,880
Sal?

1251
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:08,600
I'm gonna go to the rabbit stew!

1252
00:52:08,980 --> 00:52:09,340
Sal?

1253
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:10,560
Sal who?

1254
00:52:11,780 --> 00:52:12,300
Salami?

1255
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:15,100
That's funny.

1256
00:52:15,620 --> 00:52:16,140
Salami!

1257
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:17,680
It's just Sal Roman.

1258
00:52:17,680 --> 00:52:18,180
Salami!

1259
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:21,860
This, this show has been very good for me.

1260
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:22,580
Thank you, thank you.

1261
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:25,440
This show has been good for me, too.

1262
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:27,540
This show has, like, brought, delivered me.

1263
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:27,800
It's like, I'm in a place where I can be myself.

1264
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:27,800


1265
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:27,800


1266
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:27,800


1267
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:27,800


1268
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:28,540
It's brought me forward.

1269
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:30,220
This show has been arthritic for me, too.

1270
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:32,340
This show has been a frightening experience.

1271
00:52:32,360 --> 00:52:34,960
It's been a carbuncle on the butthole of society.

1272
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:37,440
But other than that, it's, it's been great.

1273
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:37,800
Yeah.

1274
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:42,000
And this, you know, last five minutes of the last show.

1275
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,420
The last, theoretically, second of life.

1276
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,620
The last five minutes of the last show.

1277
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:49,520
...known on this plane.

1278
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:52,840
The forces of good are a sworn enemy.

1279
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:56,740
And I repeat, they must be exterminated.

1280
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:57,640
And I mean, lethally.

1281
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:57,780
I don't mean to be a

1282
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:57,780


1283
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:57,780


1284
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:57,780


1285
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:57,780


1286
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:59,720
little man has done it to us again.

1287
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:03,580
He's made a monkey out of the forces of evil.

1288
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,400
Is he dead?

1289
00:53:06,220 --> 00:53:06,700
Yeah.

1290
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:11,160
He's messed up as bad as those two back there.

1291
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:16,140
Suppose that saucer or whatever it was had something to do with this?

1292
00:53:16,820 --> 00:53:18,560
Your guess is good as mine, Larry.

1293
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:20,940
One thing's sure.

1294
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:22,580
Inspector Clay's dead.

1295
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:24,540
Murdered.

1296
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:27,240
And somebody's responsible.

1297
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:27,760
I'm sure.

1298
00:53:32,660 --> 00:53:36,520
I've got to get toinnenment, briefly with the most serious questions.

1299
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:39,200
Uh, I have to.

1300
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:48,580
His around here, probably stay out there today, li'l

1301
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:57,560
my mennyt with to then with fellows you just got guess myself, isending out there.

1302
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:01,320
Even though there's nobody left there, there's just a P.O. box.

1303
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:08,060
It's just a town that used to be there, but now it's just only a stick in the middle of town with a box on it.

1304
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:11,720
And it's the P.O., sacred P.O. box because the rest of the city is gone.

1305
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:15,660
And that MTV tape, folks, that you saw on MTV so many years ago.

1306
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:20,540
There's a picture of the guy that answers that box with his family out in the middle of the wrecked city.

1307
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,660
And there you can see in the foreground a little box, a little mailbox.

1308
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:26,940
The sacred golden box. It's made out of solid gold now.

1309
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:28,940
It glistens in the distance.

1310
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:41,560
As people draw closer to Dallas, they see the shimmering, gilded sky as they approach the golden P.O. box.

1311
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:43,380
That is Dallas, Texas now.

1312
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:55,880
Next day's coming. That's Bob at Post Office Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1313
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:57,540
That's Box 807.

1314
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,740
Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

1315
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,820
Order now.

1316
00:55:03,820 --> 00:55:06,560
Shine the light of whatever.

1317
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,560
Not available in any store.

1318
00:55:09,620 --> 00:55:10,500
Shine the light.

1319
00:55:11,460 --> 00:55:13,740
Batteries not included. Some assembly required.

1320
00:55:14,560 --> 00:55:15,860
Not stored in souls.

1321
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:19,180
Not stored in souls.

1322
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,480
I'd almost forgotten that old saw.

1323
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:25,420
That clever play on words.

1324
00:55:26,080 --> 00:55:27,480
Not stored in souls.

1325
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:28,000
Not stored in doors either.

1326
00:55:28,140 --> 00:55:28,720
Not stored in doors either.

1327
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:31,400
So sad not to have it anymore.

1328
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:35,220
But you can get it back. You can get it back.

1329
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:38,720
From, with only a self-addressed stamped envelope.

1330
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:40,020
From just what they said.

1331
00:55:40,180 --> 00:55:44,440
Post Office Box 140306 Dallas, Texas.

1332
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:46,440
And the zip code on that, friends.

1333
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:53,960
The all-important zip code of Bob is 75214.

1334
00:55:54,140 --> 00:55:56,480
And friends, amidst the puzzling evidence,

1335
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:57,540
Einstein put a zip code on that box.

1336
00:55:57,540 --> 00:55:57,760
And we have a new one.

1337
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:58,260
It's called the Einstein Secret Orchestra.

1338
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:02,440
Radio Swamp, Philo Spew, and Dave Brain.

1339
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,680
We also heard some of the Satanic Jamboree Clips

1340
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:08,540
by Jupiter Research.

1341
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:13,860
And the song Wilderness of Bob by Chaz Smith.

1342
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,740
We heard they were recorded at Winterstar.

1343
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:19,400
And also my rant from Winterstar.

1344
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:21,080
There, friends.

1345
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:24,580
Congratulations, by the way, to Einstein Secret Orchestra

1346
00:56:24,580 --> 00:56:27,520
for winning the Free Times Music Award.

1347
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:32,340
Here in Cleveland for Best Instrumental Electronic Music, of course.

1348
00:56:32,580 --> 00:56:34,780
And, oh, and while you're at it, friends,

1349
00:56:35,540 --> 00:56:43,540
check out on the web www.subgenius.com.

1350
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:49,380
And then go to www.pandromeda.com.

1351
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,260
I did that finally.

1352
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:56,620
And the promise of Mojo World is so great.

1353
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:57,480
It is.

1354
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,100
So great.

1355
00:56:58,400 --> 00:56:59,100
Grandiose.

1356
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,660
So truly grand is the promise.

1357
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:02,260
Yes.

1358
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:02,820
Ah.

1359
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,880
It is a...

1360
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:05,220
I...

1361
00:57:05,220 --> 00:57:06,040
And it...

1362
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:10,120
It pulls and tugs at me like a Pied Piper.

1363
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:16,900
I'm like a rat of Hamelin wanting to follow the promise of Mojo World.

1364
00:57:17,740 --> 00:57:21,000
That's www.pandromeda.com.

1365
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:22,680
The Pied Piper.

1366
00:57:22,920 --> 00:57:25,020
Where the Pink Bob rules.

1367
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:26,040
And the Mojo.

1368
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:26,600
The Bizarro Bob.

1369
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:29,160
Me no like slack.

1370
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:30,760
Ugh.

1371
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:32,040
Me Bizarro Bob.

1372
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:33,020
Me hate slack.

1373
00:57:33,140 --> 00:57:33,340
Get to work.

1374
00:57:33,480 --> 00:57:34,420
This man...

1375
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:35,780
Legume has slack.

1376
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:36,800
If you call him a man...

1377
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:37,320
Take it away.

1378
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:39,620
...has designs on your consciousness.

1379
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,340
That was an actual quote, wasn't it?

1380
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:42,480
Look into your computer screen.

1381
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:44,500
Don't you see what's happening?

1382
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:47,800
Your mind is being Mojo-ized and you don't even know it.

1383
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:49,260
Stand back, Dr. Grinnecke.

1384
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,400
I have to disconnect the wires.

1385
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:51,700
It's okay, Dave.

1386
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:53,540
I've seen Dave...

1387
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,540
Dave, don't freak out on it.

1388
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:55,740
Just accept it.

1389
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:56,000
It's the new paradigm.

1390
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:02,380
I have seen Dave get freaked out just looking at an ordinary videotape of computer animation.

1391
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:05,060
Just some real trippy computer animation.

1392
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:09,540
And Dave, late at night, we exposed him to this stuff and he was going,

1393
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,160
Man, it's getting too...

1394
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:12,180
This is too intense.

1395
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:13,740
They're gonna watch us back.

1396
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:14,420
He watched it.

1397
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:15,080
It's all virtual.

1398
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:16,920
Nobody has a real life anymore.

1399
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:18,320
He pulled his head right up to the screen and he said,

1400
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:20,480
I need blue light, baby.

1401
00:58:20,660 --> 00:58:22,640
I need blue light, baby.

1402
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,180
I need blue light.

1403
00:58:24,180 --> 00:58:24,320
I need blue light.

1404
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:38,200
I need blue light,funnya.

1405
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:41,420
Well scream blue light if you're Radio Robocop.

1406
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:41,420


1407
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:41,420


1408
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:46,040
di da zang

1409
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:46,660
And they said,

1410
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:49,540
they want green light.

1411
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:51,800
and then the telegraph guy went,

1412
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:54,140
it's gusta- ular.

1413
00:58:54,140 --> 00:58:54,160
and then whoever told him to candies

1414
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:06,020
Thank you.

1415
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:37,980
Thank you.

1416
00:59:56,100 --> 00:59:58,900
Thank you.

1417
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:27,980
Thank you.
