1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,860
Doug Smith, radio operator. I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

2
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:06,340
No trouble. No trouble at all.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:07,440
Get set, get down.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:07,880
It's a go.

5
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:11,740
Hey Patty, everything's going great.

6
00:00:11,860 --> 00:00:13,080
It's going just great.

7
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:15,520
No trouble there, friend.

8
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:19,880
Welcome potential initiates, and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,420
Bob?

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,200
Bob ain't going to help you this time, friend.

11
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:25,660
Bob?

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,780
I wish I could say he would.

13
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,860
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

14
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:39,200
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack.

15
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,920
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

16
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:47,480
Oh yes, dear friends.

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:56,220
But I'm afraid this time, it might not be an hour of pure slack.

18
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:57,460
No, I'm afraid.

19
00:00:57,780 --> 00:01:02,020
This time it might be an hour of pure, unrelenting slacklessness.

20
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:08,900
Things have been just a mite rough around here.

21
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,100
We've got lots of news.

22
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,500
Some of it's real good news.

23
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,820
Some of it's real bad news.

24
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,740
But there's plenty of it, at least.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,600
And what there's not plenty of is time, dear friends.

26
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:22,940
Time.

27
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,660
Time, time, time.

28
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,140
In the next three hours, I've got to try to produce...

29
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,280
Four hours of slack.

30
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,300
I don't know how I'm going to do it.

31
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,840
Because tomorrow I'm going to leave.

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:37,440
By the time you hear this tape, my friends,

33
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:41,540
your host and prayer partner is going to be on the GWAR tour.

34
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,780
Yes, opening for this horrible rock and roll band called GWAR.

35
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,620
Most of you probably are familiar with them.

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,880
They're the ones that perform in rubber monster suits,

37
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,800
if they really are suits.

38
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,100
I guess I'll find that.

39
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,320
I'll find that out while I'm on the bus.

40
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,460
Yes.

41
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,600
Yes, I'm going to give you real quick the dates for the GWAR shows

42
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:10,740
that will be opened with a subgenius, a sermon.

43
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,220
That is October 27th in Cleveland.

44
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,920
October 28th in Detroit.

45
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,680
October 29th at Bill Gates' Halloween party.

46
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,880
But I'm not going to be at that one.

47
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,120
What?

48
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,040
No.

49
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:29,440
November 30th in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

50
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,060
And the 31st in Chicago, dear friends.

51
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,060
Lovely Chicago.

52
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,560
First, now some of you may hear this in time.

53
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:43,700
The 31st Halloween, it will be a subgenius devival preached by myself,

54
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,240
opening for GWAR.

55
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:47,280
And let's see.

56
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,140
November 1st is Cincinnati.

57
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,620
November 2nd, Columbus, Ohio.

58
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:53,620
November...

59
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,240
Shut up.

60
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,520
November...

61
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,800
3rd, St. Louis, dear friends.

62
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,320
St. Louis.

63
00:02:59,380 --> 00:02:59,920
And that ought to...

64
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,880
Man, that's where the swinging love corpses live.

65
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,640
November 4th in Lawrence, Kansas.

66
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,240
And November 5th in Minneapolis.

67
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,920
And at that point, the GWAR monsters go on touring.

68
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,280
And I go back home to recuperate.

69
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280
And to answer the mail.

70
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,780
The endless mail that stacks up.

71
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,360
And the endless horror, friends.

72
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,320
Because the hammer keeps it coming down.

73
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,000
There will be shows in Texas.

74
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,960
I'll be preaching at the GWAR shows in Lubbock on November 20th.

75
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,000
Tulsa, the 21st.

76
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,240
Corpus Christi, November 24th.

77
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,480
And Houston, November 25th.

78
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:45,320
But best of all, friends, my own hometown, Dallas, Texas, on November 22nd.

79
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,360
Yes, GWAR and Bob will kill Kennedy again.

80
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,920
And I'm real glad I went and bought that Kennedy head mask when I saw it the other day.

81
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,640
And...

82
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,740
Okay, well, so much for the good news.

83
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,160
Yeah, just watch your...

84
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,180
I can't tell you which clubs these things are in.

85
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:07,460
Just watch your local newspaper for times and places and so forth.

86
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,620
For GWAR, it may not say Reverend Stang's going to be there.

87
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:14,000
But at least those cities in the Midwest and in Texas that I said,

88
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,400
Oh, I'll be there.

89
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:19,760
I'll be there with my flaming sword and my ghost shirt.

90
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,180
So that their fans can't kill me.

91
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,620
Okay, well, so much for the good.

92
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:25,860
Good news.

93
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:33,600
Actually, the GWAR show does sound like it's going to be a hellacious spectacle of violence,

94
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,580
degrading sex, and speed metal thrash hell music,

95
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,680
which is no longer called for.

96
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:45,220
This Joe Satriani stuff, I don't know, man.

97
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:50,740
I like guitar players, but haven't I heard every one of those licks back in the 70s

98
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,780
at a Peter Frampton concert or something?

99
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,260
Here's what the bad news is.

100
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,820
I've got to put on something proper for that.

101
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,620
It's Doctors for Bob.

102
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,480
Old Doctors for Bob tape cranking away here in the background

103
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:09,160
because I have to, well, let me put it this way.

104
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,440
You know how when you lose something, friends, and it's just gone.

105
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,660
I mean, it's gone.

106
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:18,860
It ain't going to be the same again.

107
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,580
Even though it's gone, that's all you can think about.

108
00:05:23,820 --> 00:05:25,160
You know, it just keeps.

109
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,160
It's just getting away at you.

110
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,300
You may have so much work to do, you can't believe it.

111
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,160
You may be distracted by a million other things,

112
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,580
but for some reason, your mind just keeps going back to that thing that's gone.

113
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,260
Well, damn it.

114
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,360
I wish I could use much stronger language.

115
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,160
Well, I will.

116
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,380
God, if you're up there, if there's a God, why don't you strike me dead right now?

117
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,140
Go ahead, do it.

118
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:51,480
See?

119
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,560
Well, here's how we know there ain't no God, my friend.

120
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,380
And I should have done this show a month ago, but what can I say?

121
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,600
I haven't been between hammer blows for all this time.

122
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,120
December, no, August 27th, on alt-slack on the internet,

123
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:20,560
this news came out from Pastor X, a good friend of our friend Dr. Legume.

124
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:22,480
And it said, and I quote,

125
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,580
To all, Dr. Katahdin Legume,

126
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:31,380
Legume passed away last night after being involved in an accident on Interstate 95.

127
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,440
He was on his motorcycle and was struck and killed by a drunk driver.

128
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,840
He was pronounced dead at the scene.

129
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,200
He will be missed by all.

130
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,100
Pastor X goes on to say,

131
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,440
Legume was a hell of a guy.

132
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:49,280
He helped me through some of the roughest times of my life when nobody else gave a crap.

133
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,740
He was one badass subgenius minister and the best friend I ever had.

134
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,620
The world is a crappier place without him.

135
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,380
And I hope you, uh, idiots, know what you lost.

136
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,480
And if you didn't like him, then you can just go, uh, joke yourselves.

137
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,400
Because he was a giant of a man, bigger than life and twice as ugly.

138
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:12,920
And I hope the bastard who killed him rots in the filthiest cell in the filthiest prison on earth.

139
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,180
Because if I ever meet him, I'm going to make him wish he were that lucky.

140
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,120
And Pastor X says,

141
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,860
I guess if I could say one last thing on the subject, it would be,

142
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,580
Doc, Legume, you stormed through life.

143
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,380
Like it was your own personal Poland.

144
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,360
And you deserve to die like a warrior.

145
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,340
Not like just another mundane highway statistic.

146
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,040
I love you, brother.

147
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,240
Goodbye.

148
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:44,640
Yes, friends, and I've got a big stack of responses that came in on alt.slack,

149
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:47,680
the subgenius internet hangout.

150
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:53,300
You know, and as, uh, St. Andrew pointed out,

151
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,620
Dr. Legume's most ironic.

152
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:59,600
I mean, his most ironic statement was that Bob had been good to him.

153
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:03,000
And Bob had been good to Dr. Legume, I must say.

154
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:06,240
I mean, he was rolling around in waterbeds with, uh,

155
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:12,260
the objects of his heart's desire for the last several months of his life.

156
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,480
It was a beautiful thing.

157
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,360
But let's see what else we've got here.

158
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,520
I mean, it's been a while for me.

159
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,100
I've sort of gotten used to it.

160
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,840
I guess you could say.

161
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,180
And, uh,

162
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:28,800
well, here's what I got all choked up, man.

163
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:30,280
I was, I was writing about it.

164
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,300
It just ain't fair.

165
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,660
I can't get used to how he's actually gone.

166
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:37,600
All the devivals in the last three years had him there.

167
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,520
He practically made these shows.

168
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:43,140
And I'm gonna be editing these shows and looking at the videos

169
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,840
and seeing my buddy rant his head off

170
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,820
with more feeling than anybody since Pope David and Meyer

171
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:51,340
and thinking about all the good turns he's done me personally

172
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:53,160
and the weird shit he can do,

173
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:55,620
like when he actually made physical love to the next man.

174
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:58,660
And the next stump of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer on stage.

175
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:03,500
And the impromptu mind rapery that he was capable of.

176
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:05,240
Just standing in front of you.

177
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:09,860
And his nerve when it came to faking out actual televangelists.

178
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,560
When they'd come to his town, like Peter Popoff,

179
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:14,640
he walked up to that televangelist

180
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,160
and started preaching against the evil subgenius cult.

181
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,360
And now whenever Popoff is in town,

182
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:21,920
well, he used to call up Dr. Legumes.

183
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,620
And the worst part, well, I don't know.

184
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,820
I could go on and on.

185
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:30,120
But you know, of all the people to get prematurely ruptured,

186
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,080
why him?

187
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:35,580
How is it that Rush damn Limbaugh is fat and happy

188
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,740
while Dr. Legumes is...

189
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,640
Well, you know, if anybody had a free pass to subgenius hell,

190
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,700
it was him, granted.

191
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,520
But we don't get to hear him rant anymore.

192
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,340
You know, oh yeah, he'll be immortalized like Bill Hicks on CDs.

193
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,800
Whoa, two or three whole shows worth.

194
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:52,800
Whoop-dee-doo.

195
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,440
But we the living, friend,

196
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,400
have been cheated big time.

197
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:00,260
Sure, Bill Hicks and Lenny Bruce and Jimi Hendrix

198
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:03,060
and all those guys getting to watch Legumes' new routines,

199
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,560
but we have been cheated by a drunk

200
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,680
because of the conspiracy, friends!

201
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:10,160
Because if the conspiracy hadn't made alcohol

202
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:14,340
the glamorous, cheap, universally available narcotic,

203
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,060
you know, even if they'd managed to legalize pot,

204
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,040
for God's sake, that drunk wouldn't have...

205
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,260
Either he wouldn't have been as drunk

206
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:24,700
or he would have been a lot more messed up

207
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:27,200
and he would have killed somebody else earlier in the evening.

208
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,760
Oh, dear friends,

209
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,420
Dr. Legume was one of a kind.

210
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,780
Truly one of a kind.

211
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,280
The whole church was cashing in on him indirectly,

212
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,040
and I don't have the slightest doubt that he'd love to see us

213
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,000
blow his legend up even bigger

214
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,020
and cash in on his legumeness even more.

215
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:50,280
He's such a standard in the Church of the Subgenius

216
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,720
that only he could live up to,

217
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,240
but he did it in such a way that it made the rest of us

218
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:54,880
want to try.

219
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,780
Now, I've been a subgenius preacher for so long

220
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,780
that sometimes it seems like it's just a job.

221
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:03,280
But Legume preached, friends, because he believed.

222
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,160
Not in the stupid way, not in the psycho Bobby way,

223
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,300
but in the real way, the deep way.

224
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,180
He knew what this church was all about, friends.

225
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,540
He was real.

226
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,560
He was real.

227
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,020
You know, most of us have to fake it.

228
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,160
I'm not faking it right now,

229
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,280
but most of us have to fake it at least to some extent.

230
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:26,220
He made it seem effortless because he wasn't faking.

231
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,680
He trained himself to do nothing but speak the truth.

232
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,960
And you can't imagine what a hard thing that is

233
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,000
to do on stage, friends,

234
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,640
right in front of a bunch of idiots,

235
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:39,760
staring, hundreds of staring primate eyes.

236
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,300
You know, he had that much faith.

237
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:45,960
Faith?

238
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,000
Faith.

239
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,760
Actually, Legume didn't have any faith at all.

240
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:52,260
He didn't believe in a damn thing.

241
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,460
He really could cut through the bull hockey.

242
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,660
Pardon my language.

243
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,840
And that takes more than faith, dear friends.

244
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:05,000
I had a dream.

245
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,280
Oh, yes.

246
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:11,240
And in my dream, I was flying above the clouds.

247
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:13,940
I had left my earthly body behind.

248
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,780
I had abandoned the illusion of flesh.

249
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:20,840
Oh, yes.

250
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:22,240
Yes, I had abandoned the illusion of flesh.

251
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:25,360
Oh, yes.

252
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,440
And I heard a sound.

253
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:28,860
I heard a terrible sound.

254
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:35,120
The sound was the screams of the unsaved.

255
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,460
And there are many unsaved here tonight.

256
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,320
How many people tonight here are saved?

257
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,380
How many people here tonight are going to be on the pleasure craft

258
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:46,100
of the sex goddesses on July 5th, 1998?

259
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,140
Can I get a hey, man?

260
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,380
Can I get a hey, man?

261
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:52,220
Can I get a hey, man?

262
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:53,440
Can I get a hallelujah?

263
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,440
Oh, yes, brothers and sisters.

264
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,060
And there were terrible screams.

265
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,180
And there was fire and death.

266
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:06,220
There was the ultimate unspeakable horror falling down upon the unsaved.

267
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:10,000
Many were the tribulations.

268
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,100
There was poverty.

269
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,440
There was starvation.

270
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:18,940
There was pestilence.

271
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:22,200
Rats the size of greyhound bugs.

272
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:26,140
buses feeding on the flesh of the dying.

273
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,500
Oh yes, there was barbed wire,

274
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:33,040
there was poisoned water, broken glass,

275
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:38,240
piss rain. Oh yes, there were death camps

276
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,960
and radiation, war, slavery, cannibalism.

277
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,020
Oh yes, but all of these things

278
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:50,060
are gonna be like your first blow job compared to what's gonna happen

279
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:53,280
to the unsaved after X day. Oh yes,

280
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,060
oh yes, there will be terrors and horrors unspeakable.

281
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:01,680
There are going to be tribulations raining down.

282
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,800
There are gonna be nothing but pain. You're gonna have pain on a molecular level.

283
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,860
You're gonna have every molecule of your body splattered all over the surface

284
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:13,680
of the earth. And each one of those molecules will feel nothing

285
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:18,040
but pain. Oh yes,

286
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:22,120
oh yes, but the saved, the subgenius,

287
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,620
the people who have their membership cards in the church,

288
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,560
while everyone else is dying, we're gonna have a Bob

289
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,060
damn party!

290
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,840
Oh yes, we're gonna have the mosh pits while

291
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:41,020
y'all have the death pits. Oh yes,

292
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:45,240
we'll be moshing in the pit and you'll be rotting in the grave.

293
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:49,440
Oh yes, because we're gonna be raptured up

294
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,540
on the space vessels of the sex goddesses.

295
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,060
The pleasure craft. We're gonna be buzzing around in our own

296
00:14:57,060 --> 00:15:01,240
private UFOs. We're gonna be looking down and we're gonna

297
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,040
see you laying down there, you unsaved folk. We're gonna see you

298
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,240
looking up at the sky. We're gonna see you going, oh, maybe the UFOs

299
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,880
coming to save me. Maybe they're gonna make the world a better place.

300
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:16,460
But no, all you're gonna see is that smiling Bob face

301
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:20,280
up in the sky and death rays are gonna fire out of his eyes

302
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,660
and they're gonna incinerate you into a pile of ashes. And even the pile

303
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,720
of ashes is gonna feel pain.

304
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,780
Oh yes, but we're gonna be, like I said, we're gonna be

305
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,480
having a party. We're gonna be up there with the aliens. We're gonna be up there rolling around

306
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,740
with the sex goddesses. We're gonna be indulging in our every pleasure.

307
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,640
Why, our bodies will be

308
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:48,600
transformed into nothing but one big nerve

309
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:51,420
ending. One big erogenous zone.

310
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,740
And all we're gonna feel is pleasure.

311
00:15:55,840 --> 00:16:00,200
Yes, and we shall have orgasms uncounted

312
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:03,180
while you all writhe in pain and agony.

313
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,000
We will masturbate to your murders.

314
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,620
Ha ha ha ha ha.

315
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:14,620
Oh yes, and our every, every

316
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,680
nerve ending, every area of our new bodies are going to be one

317
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:22,740
big erogenous zone. The wind blowing past you is gonna make you come.

318
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,840
The sun shining down on you

319
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,900
is gonna make you come. Oh yes.

320
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,740
Why, just the very molecules of the universe itself bouncing

321
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:36,960
up against you will make you come.

322
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:40,440
And a veritable sea of your own bodily fluids

323
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:44,800
shall ooze from you. And you will float

324
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,940
up. You will float up in the sea of your own bodily fluids.

325
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:52,700
You will float up with just your head

326
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:56,640
above the sea of bodily fluids. Oh yes.

327
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:00,940
Until you are washed up onto the shores of

328
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,000
subgenius heaven.

329
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:07,080
That's right, you will be washed up onto the shores

330
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:11,100
of subgenius heaven. But what of earth? Why, earth will be

331
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:15,020
flooded in a veritable river of sin. Yes, a veritable

332
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:19,040
river of our own evil bodily fluids.

333
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,000
Oh yes. But once that sea starts arising,

334
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,000
a lot of you unsaved are gonna be up to your waists.

335
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,760
And you're gonna be saying, well, at least it isn't up to my chest.

336
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,920
Then it'll be up to your chest. And you'll be saying, well, at least

337
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,200
it's not up to my neck. And then it'll be up to your neck.

338
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:42,420
And you'll realize that the river's rising and you're all gonna be washed

339
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,160
away in it. And you'll be looking up into the sky.

340
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:50,860
And you're gonna be putting your hands out, spreading them wide above your heads.

341
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:54,120
And you're gonna be saying, Jesus!

342
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,860
Jesus Christ! Oh, I accept you now as my Savior.

343
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,680
Ha ha ha!

344
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,340
Oh yeah.

345
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:08,720
And that's gonna give us the biggest laugh. The minute you say

346
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,060
that, laughter will roar from the skies around you.

347
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,380
And the face will appear again. And he will say,

348
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:20,880
too late, buddy. You had your chance.

349
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:24,120
You had your chance to get on the sex goddess'

350
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:28,220
escape vessels. You could be up in space right now

351
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:32,220
as veritable giants stomping

352
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:35,840
on the ants that are humanity. Oh yes.

353
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,720
But there are some of you here today that are probably thinking to yourselves,

354
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,940
this man's up there blaspheming against God.

355
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,040
Blaspheming against God.

356
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:52,140
Well, I'm not blaspheming against God. As a matter of fact,

357
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:56,100
I brought your God with me tonight. Do you want your

358
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:59,040
God? Do you want your God?

359
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,080
Here's your God. Aerosol cheese in a can.

360
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,680
Oh yeah. Say your prayers. They'll always come true.

361
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:15,380
There'll always be cheese in the can waiting for you.

362
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,020
Oh yeah. Easy cheese.

363
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,100
Yeah. Yeah. There you go. Oh yes.

364
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:28,080
Why don't you partake of his bountiful harvest. You'll get all the

365
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,640
cheese you want out of God. But salvation you will not get from God.

366
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,880
Salvation you will not get from your can of aerosol cheese. Salvation you will only

367
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,900
get through the love of

368
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,800
Bob. Oh yes.

369
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,680
And now you'll know. Raise your hands high, brothers, and cry out,

370
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:51,420
Bob! I'm ready for you, Bob. Bob!

371
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:53,040
Come down, Bob!

372
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:59,280
Come save me, Bob! All you gotta

373
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,320
do is accept Bob as your Savior, and you'll be saved.

374
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,240
But then maybe not.

375
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,120
Bob might let you rot too, but you've gotta prove

376
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:15,180
that you have faith in Bob. And all you have to do

377
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:19,060
to prove that you have faith in Bob is to join up with the Church of the

378
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,780
Spirit. Is that a genius? Yes. You'll have to join up. You'll have to

379
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,140
tithe unto Bob that which is Bob's.

380
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,800
You must plant your seed of faith that you may be rewarded with

381
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,660
a hundredfold harvest, a thousandfold

382
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,240
harvest, a millionfold harvest

383
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:42,100
of slack. And the best part is

384
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,100
it'll only cost you $30. Now a lot of people are saying,

385
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:49,180
you think I'm gonna give up $30 for Bob?

386
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,020
Well, I'll tell you what. After July 5th,

387
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:58,000
1998 at 7 a.m., you might as well just wipe your ass

388
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,100
with that $30, because it ain't gonna buy you nothing. But if you

389
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,940
got that subgenius membership card, if you just got that subgenius membership card in your wallet,

390
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,980
all you gotta do is when them saucers come, hold it up high.

391
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,020
Hold it up high, and ye shall be raptured

392
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:18,080
up. Oh yes, ye shall be raptured up.

393
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,040
And pleasures untold shall be yours.

394
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,120
Oh.

395
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,500
Yes, yes, yes. Dr. LeHume

396
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,780
preaching there, the last Cleveland show.

397
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,060
About two or three months ago.

398
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:42,020
Yes, yes, Dr. LeHume, I miss you. I miss you.

399
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:46,060
It's a hell of a deal, man. But you know, it's kinda like

400
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,960
there's a room full of candles, friends. Great big room

401
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,080
full of candles. All those candles look so pretty, and the room looks so pretty. You can see

402
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,900
all the hangings and the paintings in the

403
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,960
room. And then you, but you look over there and you go, oh, look at that one

404
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:05,940
ugly candle. It's burning too bright. It's burning brighter

405
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:09,960
than all the other ones. It's unbalancing this

406
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:13,900
lovely composition. And not only that, but it's burning

407
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:17,800
from both ends. So you go, well, I guess we'll just put that one out.

408
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,900
And you put it out, and suddenly that room's hardly lit at all.

409
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,060
Oh yeah, there's plenty of other candles in there, but it's all dingy and dark looking.

410
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,760
And that's when you realize it was that one ugly candle

411
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:33,480
that was actually the only one that was making the room

412
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:38,200
look so pretty. Friends, Dr. LeHume

413
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:41,680
was a great man. He was

414
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,260
more than a man, he was a subgenius.

415
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,060
Whiskey and blood ran together

416
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:54,580
and mixed with the glass where they lay.

417
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,620
I heard the crash on the highway

418
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,800
but I didn't hear nobody

419
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:05,920
pray. I didn't hear nobody

420
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,980
pray, dear sister.

421
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,940
I didn't hear nobody pray.

422
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,200
I heard the crash on the highway

423
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,780
but I didn't hear nobody pray.

424
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:21,740

. . .

447
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:33,060
. .

448
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:11,180
These shabby shoes I'm wearing all the time

449
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:14,460
Is full of holes and nails

450
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,580
And brother, if I stepped on a worn-out dime

451
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:23,800
I bet a nickel I could tell you if it was heads or tails

452
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:28,080
I'm not gonna worry wrinkles in my brow

453
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:32,180
Cause nothing's ever gonna be all right, no how

454
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:35,420
No matter how I struggle and strive

455
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:40,540
I'll never get out of this world alive

456
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:54,920
Well, well, Damien, I tell you, I know exactly how old Hank Williams feels in that song.

457
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,640
Ironically enough, that song, almost every little section of that song

458
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:02,060
describes something that's happened to me.

459
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:04,060
Especially the part about the shoes.

460
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,460
And just be glad you aren't sitting next to me smelling me.

461
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:11,800
I'm sure you've already thought of that.

462
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:18,360
It's been a long, long, long week and a long month.

463
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:22,220
And, well, my gobs, let's see what...

464
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:25,020
As the good...

465
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:28,780
Well, actually, the bad Dr. Nenslow posted,

466
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:29,300
he said,

467
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,360
Legume King.

468
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:33,280
In subgenius hell.

469
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:34,300
Nenslow said,

470
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,740
There's only one thing that ever need be said about Dr. Legume

471
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:42,520
to let you all know how entirely superior he is to all of you.

472
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:46,380
He could take a joke.

473
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,200
Legume is raping the torn-off neck stumps

474
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:54,360
of all your dead grandmas and grandpas

475
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,900
in subgenius hell right now.

476
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,760
And when you pasty-faced, chinless,

477
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,640
eight-eyed, question-mark-shaped,

478
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:09,140
sniveling, spineless segments of dog-tick-bowl get there,

479
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,720
he will do the same for you.

480
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:15,800
What really makes me mad is that it was him that died

481
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,440
and not you.

482
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,580
It's not too late to change half of that.

483
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:24,760
It could be the only worthwhile thing you ever did

484
00:27:24,760 --> 00:27:26,600
in your whole baffled life.

485
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,400
You scum.

486
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,100
Signed, Nenslow.

487
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:31,740
Well, that was...

488
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,800
That was one comment on the death of Dr. Legume.

489
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,340
Let's see, oh, there's more of me

490
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,220
whining and weeping,

491
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:40,780
saying,

492
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,220
you know,

493
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,140
that some unknowing pink

494
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,080
would suddenly, randomly

495
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,500
latch on to green kryptonite.

496
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:51,100
It's just...

497
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:53,080
Well, it's improbable.

498
00:27:53,260 --> 00:27:56,300
It's so improbable that it's still very hard for me to believe.

499
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,640
Anyone who knew Legume,

500
00:27:57,780 --> 00:28:00,160
the superman of the Church of the Subgenius,

501
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,740
is probably reeling from the impending...

502
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,840
...implications because if any subgenius

503
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:06,320
was the unkillable survivor type,

504
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:07,060
it was he.

505
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,020
He was the one subgenius that you tended to think of

506
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,520
as somehow invulnerable

507
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,200
and for him, of all people,

508
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,720
to be called home

509
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,600
is hard to accept.

510
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,940
But there it is.

511
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:23,120
Why, friends, is the reality of this weird church

512
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,640
every bit as ironic

513
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:30,240
as its ha-ha black humor doctrinal output?

514
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,060
And the good Reverend Steve Bevilacqua,

515
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:39,240
who is my agent now, I guess,

516
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:40,500
I guess that's what you call him.

517
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,240
He's been the one that's setting up all these devivals.

518
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,020
He talked about Legume.

519
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:49,100
It was one of the first times he ever met him

520
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:49,880
or dealt with him.

521
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,680
He had scheduled this devial.

522
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:54,360
Hundreds of people were waiting to get into the auditorium

523
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,200
when a few frightened girls ran up to me.

524
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,340
Steve, there's...

525
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:58,780
there's...

526
00:28:58,780 --> 00:28:59,180
there's...

527
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:01,160
there's a priest in the elevator

528
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:01,740
and he's got...

529
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,300
he's got a baseball bat and...

530
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,400
Calm down and tell me what happened, I said,

531
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,160
hugging the girl close for reassurance.

532
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,400
He looked at me, she said.

533
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,340
She said looked,

534
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:16,420
like he had done some sort of physical harm to her.

535
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:17,680
And...

536
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:20,100
Well, then he pointed the bat at me and said,

537
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:21,920
Do you believe in Bob?

538
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,320
And then the door opened and I ran.

539
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,480
There, there, I said,

540
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,240
sliding my hands to her waist for reassurance.

541
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,580
So he looked at you and asked you a question?

542
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:34,760
But it was the way he did it.

543
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:35,420
Hmm.

544
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:37,000
I was perplexed.

545
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,020
It seemed strange, but nothing to worry about.

546
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,860
I slid my hands a little lower for reassurance.

547
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,200
Suddenly the girl ran off into the multitudes.

548
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,280
She must have felt better by our talk.

549
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,480
So out of curiosity, I decided to check things out.

550
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,560
I walked over to the elevator.

551
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:54,440
The door slid open and out swaggered Dr. Legume.

552
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:58,020
But this was a different legume than the T-shirts

553
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,420
and jeans legume of Starwood.

554
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,720
This legume was...

555
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:04,060
dressed in priest's clothes complete with collar.

556
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,180
And he was wearing sunglasses, the mirrored cop variety,

557
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:11,700
and in his hand an aluminum bat that would become his signature.

558
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,160
Um...

559
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:16,480
Praise Bob, I said, hoping to get off on the right foot.

560
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:21,040
Kill Bob was his retort in an odd, almost hillbilly drawl.

561
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:23,960
I was stunned, but then he gave me this queer smirk,

562
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,860
letting me know everything was okay.

563
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:28,740
Well...

564
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,220
Dr. Legume, let's see.

565
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:31,480
Oh!

566
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,380
Oh, by the way, tattooed forever into his arm

567
00:30:34,380 --> 00:30:38,560
was the Killing Time logo, the wings and clock complete with dagger.

568
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:43,240
Whenever I see it, I still think of it as Legume's personal symbol.

569
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,960
He took time control to an entirely different level.

570
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,360
Adopting the watch smashing was something all his own.

571
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,740
Into something all his own.

572
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,600
That night, I would watch as two half-naked women

573
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,240
bound and gagged a Dobbs impersonator,

574
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,440
and Legume ripped Bob's still-beating heart out of his chest,

575
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,460
threw it on the floor, and...

576
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,500
and pummeled him with the bat.

577
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,740
Hello, friends.

578
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:09,440
Bob Joe Mama here with a very serious and very sad duty to perform.

579
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:15,520
It is with heavy heart that I report the death of one of Bob's best preachers,

580
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:19,040
my friend and co-ranter, the Reverend Dr. Legume.

581
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:25,280
He was murdered on his motorcycle by a drunk driver on Saturday, August 26.

582
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:30,880
Those of you who are blessed to hear his fire-breathing diatribes know,

583
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:33,620
that Legume wasn't just familiar with Bob,

584
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,320
he was possessed with him.

585
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:39,340
He preached the real word of Bob, words of hate and power,

586
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,220
not the Uncle Tom, touchy-feely,

587
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,540
why-can't-we-just-get-along, politically-correct, mass-marketed version of Dobbs.

588
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,360
Of course, this made Legume a target.

589
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:53,600
The conspiracy labeled him controversial, polarizing, inflammatory.

590
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:57,940
Ever since he took his 12-gauge shotgun into that church in Pittsburgh

591
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,860
and shot a round through the roof while praising Bob,

592
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,920
the conspiracy has never forgiven him.

593
00:32:03,220 --> 00:32:06,080
That's because Legume was more than just talk, friends.

594
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,100
He was action.

595
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,600
At work, the corporate hierarchy issued psychological profiles

596
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:16,160
for each of the peons to fill out in return for their analysis.

597
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:21,460
Legume took his, drew a big X on it, and added a little love note

598
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:24,240
telling the company's CEO that the test was a crock.

599
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:29,480
When the big boss heard that some lowly employee challenged his judgment,

600
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,200
he went ballistic.

601
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:35,660
Who would dare question his authority to dissect the brains of his employees,

602
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:37,240
fire them at once?

603
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,380
But Legume's supervisor refused because Legume did most of the work.

604
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:45,420
In fact, he was their best employee, so long as he was treated decently.

605
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:49,160
Eventually, the top brass backed down and Legume prevailed.

606
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,640
By standing up to them, he sent a chilling message the conspiracy would never forget.

607
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,780
Legume is not a team player.

608
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,980
Legume cannot be beaten down and pushed around.

609
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:00,180
Legume is not a team player. Legume cannot be beaten down and pushed around.

610
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,460
Legume makes waves.

611
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,080
His defiant example makes others stand up to authority as well.

612
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:07,120
Legume is a threat to his system.

613
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,200
He clogs the cogs.

614
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,100
He needs to be removed.

615
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,520
Now, on the eve of his East Coast tour, Legume is cut down,

616
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,400
prevented from spreading his message to thousands of needy subgenie.

617
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,800
Mere coincidence?

618
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,640
Oh, I think not.

619
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:29,340
We believers in Bob may not be geniuses, but we can still add two plus two.

620
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:35,680
We become a little suspicious when our rising stars end their careers just prior to launching them.

621
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:44,000
After all, it wasn't too long ago that Bob himself was silenced moments before addressing his largest live audience from a stage in San Francisco.

622
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:47,500
We admit this could have been a coincidence.

623
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,440
But how many coincidences does it take to establish a pattern?

624
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:54,320
As Legume himself was fond of saying,

625
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:58,860
Just cause you're paranoid doesn't mean they're not out to get you.

626
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,640
Oh, how right he was.

627
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:05,860
On the Friday night, 24 hours before his untimely death,

628
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:13,440
Legume phoned me to say he had just uploaded his very first recorded rant on the sacred 900 number of Bob.

629
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:21,960
It was the first of many he planned to deliver, rants that would tear the bleeding scab of silence off the gaping wound of conspiracy censorship.

630
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,200
When I later heard of his alleged accident,

631
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,840
I called the sacred 900 number to receive his spiritual guidance.

632
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:34,240
I wanted to hear his final words in hopes that they could shed some light on this senseless tragedy.

633
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,080
But alas, there was no Legume recording.

634
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:44,660
It had all been mysteriously erased, somehow, by someone, for some reason.

635
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:52,360
If the conspiracy thinks they can shut us up by incrimination, intimidation, or assassination, they have another thing coming, friends.

636
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,240
As the end times approach, expect them to get more and more desperate,

637
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,820
to resort to lower and dirtier tricks, to make us more and more suspicious.

638
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:58,880
But they're not.

639
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,140
They're just trying to achieve their sinister purposes.

640
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:06,240
On July 5th, 1998, we're going to see that they pay for their sins with interest.

641
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,700
If we're wrong and they're innocent of this particular crime, we apologize for nothing.

642
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:15,820
They can direct our anger to other schemes they committed against us,

643
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,440
a sea of sins we never detected until after X-Day.

644
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:23,760
Because starting then, we're going to dig up the toilet paper trail,

645
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,560
and follow it through every commode,

646
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,000
and nab every butthead who tried to wipe us out.

647
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:32,980
We've got a special hell reserved for those guilty of treason against Bob,

648
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,420
but we'll leave the details of it vague,

649
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,680
to dangle over their heads like a loose blade of the guillotine.

650
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:42,920
Because if there's one thing the conspiracy can't stand,

651
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:46,080
it's not knowing everything.

652
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:50,120
In the meantime, we'll fight on.

653
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:54,240
Legume was the sorcerer's apprentice, carrying water for Bob.

654
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:59,860
He cut down, accident or not, two more subgenies spring up to replace him.

655
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:04,140
If they fall, four more will appear, and then sixteen, and on and on and on,

656
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:07,340
because the essence of Legume is still alive, my friends.

657
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:12,500
His spirit lives, breathes, and fights in each and every one of us who stand up to the conspiracy.

658
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:16,600
We won't forget him, and we won't let the conspiracy forget him either.

659
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:21,620
We'll burn his name into the foreheads of the pinks, just like the cattle they represent.

660
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:24,980
Legume will be the thunder heard in the distance,

661
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:27,160
before the world splits in twain.

662
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:31,380
And once those end times arrive, in the pleasure saucer's land,

663
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:34,840
guess who'll be the bouncer guarding the gate?

664
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:39,960
It'll be Legume, with his skin head polished bright,

665
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:43,140
and his baseball bat ready for action.

666
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:47,960
I pity the fools who don't have their tickets, friends.

667
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:53,020
Because I know Legume, and if he can't punch their tickets,

668
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,800
well...

669
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,480
he'll find a convenient substitute.

670
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,540
Here endeth the word of Bob.

671
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:02,300
Praise Bob!

672
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:03,520
Amen!

673
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:18,220
And if you'd like more information about the Church of the Subgenius,

674
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:23,860
send a stamped, self-addressed envelope to Bob.

675
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,340
PO Box...

676
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:31,800
140306...

677
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,460
Dallas, Texas, Twin...

678
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:37,160
Oh, 75214...

679
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,220
Oh, seekers, I've got an odious thing coming up here, and I really...

680
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:43,960
I really can't quite think straight.

681
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,440
So let me change my ambiance here, because this isn't a very perky message.

682
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,080
Oh, God...

683
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,140
Oh, God...

684
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,260
Oh, God...

685
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,140
Oh, God...

686
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:56,180
Oh, God...

687
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:56,700
Oh, God...

688
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:56,700


689
00:37:56,700 --> 00:38:00,860
Seekers, last week I received the devastating news from Father Joe Mama

690
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,780
that the glorious Dr. Katahdin Legume was cut down in his prime

691
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:07,580
on a lonely highway in Pennsylvania.

692
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,200
I was lucky in that the following show was Dr. Nolan Boyd's beat,

693
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:16,460
because the pain was too fresh for me to hold myself together.

694
00:38:17,140 --> 00:38:21,120
I was even too distraught to listen to Dr. Legume treat myself.

695
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:25,640
tribute on the subgenius hotline last week and i missed out on that because the message has been

696
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:34,740
changed oh dr voids of impassioned eulogy basically said it all but i want to say a few words to send

697
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:40,780
this mighty man of bob off to his no doubt glorious afterlife in the best circles of subgenius heaven

698
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,880
or hell which the good dr legume would have no doubt preferred

699
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:55,460
for he lived a three-fisted life that none of us can equal he was truly walking the walk he was

700
00:38:55,460 --> 00:39:02,060
living it he would wade fearlessly into the swarms of fundamentalist christians and proselytize for

701
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:07,700
bob and they would listen to him because he could squeeze their brains out through their noses like

702
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:15,520
a tube of cress oh he unsaved so many people so many people oh doctor

703
00:39:15,520 --> 00:39:15,860
could you please forgive me i was so sorry for keeping you all waiting for you i'm good

704
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:15,860


705
00:39:15,880 --> 00:39:18,200
Todd and Legume a debt of their life.

706
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,260
I'll always associate Dr. Legume

707
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,180
with the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

708
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:28,440
Oh, the head revealed things to him

709
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,520
that Stang himself didn't know.

710
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,980
Oh, when he was here in Atlanta,

711
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:36,880
it was Legume who found the dogma-shattering secret message

712
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:38,480
scrawled on the next stone.

713
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,500
St. Jane or Hypercleats will always be the man

714
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,920
who launches the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer

715
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,220
at our Church of the Subgenius Divivals.

716
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:52,440
But forevermore will I remember the smiling Dr. Katahdin Legume

717
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:55,780
lovingly clasping the head to his rock-hard bosom,

718
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,820
looking blissfully into Arnold's eyes.

719
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:02,200
Because he loved that head so.

720
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,720
He even married it once

721
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,060
in a beautiful short-duration marriage ceremony in Cleveland.

722
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:11,580
And the next time that head is launched,

723
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:14,820
there will be ghostly hands reaching out to pluck it

724
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:14,900
and say,

725
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:18,120
because I truly believe that it would take more

726
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,120
than a gas-guzzling Detroit-made steel-jagged projectile

727
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,100
to kill a primal horse like Dr. Katahdin Legume.

728
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:29,740
It'll take more than the grave to hold this overman back.

729
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,440
And if anyone could push the rock off of his own tomb,

730
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:34,560
it's the good doctor.

731
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:39,440
Because Dr. Legume truly is the three-fisted, swinging meat Jesus.

732
00:40:39,660 --> 00:40:41,780
And I think I'd better be running scared

733
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:44,000
because Bob has a new right-hand man.

734
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,000
And when I build my church,

735
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:51,660
there will be a stained-glass window,

736
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,640
three feet tall, towering above the altar,

737
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,940
and it will be of Dr. Legume.

738
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,060
And he'll be cradling that head in one arm like a bloody infant.

739
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,340
And in his other hand, he'll brandish a titanium steel bat.

740
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,080
And he'll be glaring out at the assembled seekers

741
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,560
with one eyebrow raised,

742
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,680
staring each and every one of you right in the eye.

743
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,500
Oh, no.

744
00:41:15,840 --> 00:41:18,740
No, he'll be looking at that sweet spot

745
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:21,320
six inches behind your head.

746
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,420
And you'd all better be watching your asses

747
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:27,980
because if you mew him out subgenius slogans spouting,

748
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:29,660
Bobby's ain't right with Bob,

749
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,180
Dr. Legume will have you spitting out your own teeth

750
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:34,520
like bloody chicklets.

751
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,720
So, Bob, speed you, good brother.

752
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:43,600
And may you always revel in the sweet, frothed gardens of Bob.

753
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:44,900
Thank you.

754
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,240
You deserve it, Dr. Legume,

755
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:50,720
because of all the men I've known,

756
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:56,580
he was the most subgenius.

757
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:12,920
¶¶

758
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:25,680
¶¶

759
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:30,000
And now, Dr. Nolan Void.

760
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:35,680
This, my inaugural show at the helm of Bob's Psych Time Funhouse,

761
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:38,140
was to have been a joyous occasion,

762
00:42:38,420 --> 00:42:40,600
a celebration of a new era of slack.

763
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:43,920
But alas, my sharers in this mighty faith,

764
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:44,500
¶¶

765
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:44,740
¶¶

766
00:42:44,740 --> 00:42:44,900
¶¶

767
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:44,900


768
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:44,900


769
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:44,900


770
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:44,900


771
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:44,900


772
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:44,900


773
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:44,900


774
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:45,720
¶¶

775
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:46,080
✱

776
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,600
On this, my first show as full-fledged host,

777
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,440
it has already fallen to my lot

778
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,360
to have to make the following announcement.

779
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:56,440
This is not, I repeat, this is not a joke.

780
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:58,960
It is with very deep sadness

781
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:01,240
and a very personal sense of loss

782
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,880
that I must announce the death last Saturday night

783
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:06,660
of Dr. Kitaton Legume.

784
00:43:08,780 --> 00:43:10,560
According to the details I have received,

785
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,980
he was riding his Harley

786
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,080
and he got taken out by a drunk driver.

787
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:14,880
¶¶

788
00:43:15,580 --> 00:43:20,320
I was told that his death was instant instantaneous and that nothing could have been done to save him

789
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:27,540
the church has lost a stalwart warrior for Bob and the world has lost one of its most slackful

790
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:36,200
free spirits ever words fail me my friends I can only say that I met Dr. Legume on the one

791
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:40,460
occasion at the revival here in Atlanta in July and of course I'd heard about him from the hour

792
00:43:40,460 --> 00:43:47,340
of slack and like all of us thrilled to the power of his testimony on the radio but when I met him

793
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:58,120
I was most impressed by the impish sparkle of high intelligence in his eyes I was around him quite a

794
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:02,600
bit during his stay here and I can report that he was unfailingly polite and one of the funniest

795
00:44:02,600 --> 00:44:08,800
storytellers I have ever met next week sister Susie who knew him better than I will no doubt

796
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,440
deliver a more detailed eulogy than I ever would but we'll see how that goes.

797
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:10,440


798
00:44:10,460 --> 00:44:17,700
I am able. But let me add to my remarks that the struggle, our epic insurrection against the

799
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:25,380
conspiracy of normalcy, continues. True, we have lost an already legendary hero, but we, lesser

800
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:31,580
children of Bob, must close ranks to fill the breach he occupied and continue forward firm in

801
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:36,420
the certainty of our ultimate victory. To do our damnedest to topple the rule of idiots who are

802
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:41,240
destroying this planet and making it such a dull place in general is the single greatest tribute

803
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:49,140
that we, as subgeniuses, can pay this man, this fallen saint of our eternal faith. By all the

804
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:53,660
weirdnesses of fate, I, who hardly knew him, have ended up one of the handful of people on this

805
00:44:53,660 --> 00:45:00,140
planet who possess an audio tape of Dr. LeGue's last public appearance for the church. Anyone who

806
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:04,620
was there knows that while our band was setting up between the national and local segments of the

807
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,400
revival, Dr. LeGue was not the only one who was there. He was the only one who was there. He was

808
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:06,400


809
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:06,560
the only one who was there. He was the only one who was there. He was the only one who was there.

810
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:11,500
Dr. LeGue returned to the stage and treated us all to an amazing round of completely impromptu

811
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:20,320
preaching and cussing and telling of tall tales and such. So this, not his planned sermon at the

812
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:27,080
revival which he had done earlier, this off-the-cuff tour de force is the actual final sermon of Dr.

813
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:32,340
Katahdin LeGue. It's a copy of a copy, so please bear with me on the quality, but believe it or

814
00:45:32,340 --> 00:45:36,400
not, you are hearing this amazing performance by Dr. LeGue before even the end of the show.

815
00:45:36,420 --> 00:45:40,600
Dr. LeGue, you are the one who has given Reverend Stang himself. We are moving quickly to get a tape to

816
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:45,960
Reverend Stang, however, and you will probably hear this again on the Hour of Slack. And now,

817
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:56,140
DragonCon 95, Atlanta Devival, the actual last sermon by the late, great Dr. Katahdin LeGue.

818
00:45:57,520 --> 00:45:58,040
Dr. LeGue.

819
00:45:58,300 --> 00:45:59,100
Dr. LeGue.

820
00:45:59,100 --> 00:45:59,380
Dr. LeGue.

821
00:45:59,440 --> 00:45:59,440


822
00:45:59,440 --> 00:45:59,900
Dr. LeGue.

823
00:45:59,980 --> 00:45:59,980


824
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:00,440
Dr. LeGue.

825
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:01,080
Dr. LeGue.

826
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:01,220
Dr. LeGue.

827
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:01,220


828
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:01,220


829
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:01,220


830
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:01,240
Dr. LeGue.

831
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:01,240


832
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,220
Dr. LeGue.

833
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:04,340
Dr. LeGue.

834
00:46:04,340 --> 00:46:05,860
Dr. LeGue.

835
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:09,700
Dr. LeGue.

836
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,120
Dr. LeGue.

837
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:17,920
Dr. LeGue.

838
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:22,200
Dr. LeGue.

839
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,820
Dr. LeGue.

840
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:32,180
Dr. LeGue.

841
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:41,460
turned over in the road. There were people laying in snow banks with their legs sticking out.

842
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:48,720
And there were just crashed vehicles all over the road. But I made it. Ten miles an hour.

843
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:57,220
Five hundred miles. But I made it. And I made it to California. And the man who I had punched

844
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:02,180
out had woke up and he was looking over at me with what it looked like. The minute we get out of this car,

845
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:10,660
I'm gonna kill you. Oh yeah. And I looked down at the gas gauge and it was just on the border of empty.

846
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:17,680
And we were in the high desert of California. It was freezing cold and the wind was howling.

847
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:23,120
And I knew that if we ran out of gas, it was gonna take that nine millimeter parabellum out of the glove box

848
00:47:23,120 --> 00:47:31,940
and put a slug through my head. Slug. And then I made a wrong turn. I made a wrong turn.

849
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:38,160
I'm riding down this road and there's nothing. There's not a house. There's not a tree.

850
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:48,940
Just howling wind and cold and long and lonesome road. Oh yeah. And then over the horizon when it looked like

851
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:56,260
we were doomed to be frozen in the desert, I seen a light. A light that blinked up over the horizon.

852
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:01,920
It was a gas station. And I stopped in the town of Washington.

853
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:06,720
I was in the town of Needles, California. And we got a tank full of gas. Gas.

854
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:11,940
And I went in to use the bathroom. And I looked at the wall over the back of the urinal.

855
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:20,760
And there on the white tile in black letters having been written with a big black felt tip marker with the words,

856
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:29,040
Bob loves you. Bob loves you. And I grabbed myself by the chest and I ripped my own heart out for Bob.

857
00:48:29,100 --> 00:48:30,380
This is a true story, brother.

858
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:36,040
And I got out of it. And I walked out of that bathroom with a big smile on my face.

859
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:41,640
And I got in the car and I drove off and realized that that wrong turn took a hundred miles off my trip.

860
00:48:41,920 --> 00:48:44,800
Yes. And that is the miracle of the dogs, brother.

861
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:50,220
I'm here to testify. The miracles are real if you know what to look for.

862
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:53,860
Yes. Oh yeah. You can walk around with your head up your ass forever.

863
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,100
You can walk around with your head up your ass. But you'll never see the light.

864
00:49:00,420 --> 00:49:00,860
Yes.

865
00:49:00,860 --> 00:49:03,240
Yes. You'll never see the light with your head up your ass.

866
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,640
You got to pull your head out and look around and say, there is light to be found.

867
00:49:06,720 --> 00:49:09,420
There are miracles of Bob to be had. Yes.

868
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:15,560
Oh yes. And there is love. The love of Bob. The love that makes you stand right up.

869
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:20,340
The love that makes you say, oh yes.

870
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:25,740
Bob, go to town, baby. Go to town. Lay your miracles down on me.

871
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,320
Go to town. Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

872
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:31,040
Emptying the ashes from your pipe upon me.

873
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,220
Did I make it a contact buzz through my skin?

874
00:49:34,620 --> 00:49:37,740
Bob, it's hot. Oh yeah.

875
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,780
Pack my pipe with your love. Bob, pack your pipe with my love.

876
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:46,680
Bob, pack your pipe with slack. Slack.

877
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:53,200
Pack your pipe with froth. Pack your pipe with eternal salvation. Slack.

878
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:57,580
Oh yes. And that's what Bob's going to do for you, brothers.

879
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,260
That's what Bob's going to do for you, sisters.

880
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:05,600
He's going to pack your pipe and never shall your pipe go empty.

881
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:07,880
Slack. Oh yes.

882
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:11,740
You shall smoke for eternity with Bob.

883
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:17,500
Or you can smoke for eternity with Satan. Slack.

884
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:21,120
You can smoke burning in hell. You can smoke burning in heaven.

885
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,800
But the best smoke is the smoke that comes from the pipe of Bob. Slack.

886
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,520
Oh yes, my brethren.

887
00:50:31,740 --> 00:50:36,260
The last sermon by the late, great, departed Dr. Katahdin Lagume.

888
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:44,680
And yet, my fellow semi-Yetties, we must remember that our faith can yet sustain us, even through these times of sorrow and loss.

889
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:54,200
We know that according to the promise, the deal, the contract we have with Bob, that Dr. Lagume can never really die.

890
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:58,300
As a paid up and saved member of this glory, I am not going to die.

891
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:01,100
But I am going to be a part of this glorious, this mighty Church of the Subgenius.

892
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:06,180
We can be assured that Dr. Lagume is looking down upon us even now from Asgard,

893
00:51:06,360 --> 00:51:12,120
as he regales the very gods with the story of the man with no legs.

894
00:51:14,260 --> 00:51:25,920
Also, my brethren, I'd like to mention that the Church of the Subgenius' 900 number has been set up

895
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:28,280
for the benefit of Dr. Lagume's family.

896
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:35,580
And the number, it's a tribute to Dr. Lagume.

897
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:36,760
It's five minutes long.

898
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:39,080
It's $2 a minute.

899
00:51:39,240 --> 00:51:41,440
So we're talking about just $10 here.

900
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,780
Just $10 apiece for the bereaved family.

901
00:51:45,620 --> 00:51:49,000
$10 apiece from each of you, that is, for the bereaved family of Dr. Lagume.

902
00:51:49,860 --> 00:51:51,400
That number is as follows.

903
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:57,460
1-900-990-7000.

904
00:51:57,460 --> 00:51:58,260
1-900-990-7000.

905
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:58,260


906
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,180
5085.

907
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:06,000
extension 324.

908
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:13,460
Like I said, that's a benefit line set up by the Church for the family of Dr. Lagume.

909
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,760
It's just $10 a pop.

910
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,540
I don't think it's too much to ask you.

911
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:24,880
This is the first announcement anywhere on the Subgenius radio network of the 900 line.

912
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:35,180
And so this is a great opportunity to show the church that we here in Atlanta are numerous and strong in the faith

913
00:52:35,780 --> 00:52:40,580
and that we're willing to help out a fallen brother and especially the family of a fallen brother.

914
00:52:41,620 --> 00:52:50,620
I think you think about it, it's just 100 people, if just 100 people called into that line,

915
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:58,680
that would be another thousand dollars for the family of this man who are grieving over his loss even as we are ourselves.

916
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:05,180
I'm going to go ahead and fade out a little bit here and leave you with the doors for a few minutes.

917
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:10,040
I'll be coming back in just a few more minutes with a little reminder about the number.

918
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,320
Now here's a tribute to Dr. McGeough and here are the doors.

919
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,320
Desperate love.

920
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:54,700
What can I say, dear friends?

921
00:53:55,020 --> 00:53:57,840
Well, I can give you the subgenius PO box. I can always do that.

922
00:53:57,960 --> 00:53:58,900
That would help.

923
00:54:00,100 --> 00:54:02,080
And that 1-900 number again.

924
00:54:02,700 --> 00:54:12,660
But first, I would like to continue with Reverend Steve Bevilacqua's memoir here about Dr. Legume.

925
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:20,420
He's talking about how on the night at a devival in Cleveland after Legume had ripped Bob,

926
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:22,620
still beating heart out of his chest.

927
00:54:23,060 --> 00:54:27,720
I lost sight of Dr. Legume for a moment in the throngs of crazed and shouting people,

928
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:32,760
but he reemerged, clenching a brain proudly in his grasp.

929
00:54:33,080 --> 00:54:35,600
The brain of Bob, he shouted.

930
00:54:35,620 --> 00:54:38,000
A round of oohs and aahs rippled through the crowd.

931
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,940
I stood on a chair wondering what could possibly happen next.

932
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:47,560
With great reverence, he placed the brain on a table, raised the bat above his head,

933
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:50,340
and with both hands began pummeling the gushy organ.

934
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:54,280
Again and again, the aluminum and flesh becoming one.

935
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:57,580
The brain slid from the table with a plop.

936
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,680
Legume retrieved it and held it skyward.

937
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,380
You cannot kill the brain of Bob!

938
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:05,720
Legume was on a roll.

939
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:12,420
It is indestructible, but you can eat the brain of Bob.

940
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:18,420
With both hands firmly holding the brain, Legume dug his face into the pink fleshy mass.

941
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:20,420
This is where I began.

942
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:22,440
I began to lose hold of my own reality.

943
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:28,400
The last thing I remembered was the good Dr. Legume tossing pieces of brain around the room.

944
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,020
I don't know what to say.

945
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,340
This is a terrible loss.

946
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:35,480
Legume was and will always be the model of a true subgenius.

947
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:36,980
He did it because it was fun.

948
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:38,720
He enjoyed entertaining people.

949
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,060
In fact, it was hard to get him to stop once he took the stage.

950
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,500
But most of all, he was genuine, completely real.

951
00:55:46,540 --> 00:55:48,580
It took me a long time to realize that.

952
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,600
I was talking to him only a few minutes later.

953
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:54,540
A few days ago about some gigs I was setting up in which he was to play a major part.

954
00:55:54,820 --> 00:55:57,540
And I was telling him how great I thought his ranting was.

955
00:55:57,640 --> 00:55:58,940
He explained to me why.

956
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:01,480
You know why it's good, don't you?

957
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:02,700
Because it's real!

958
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:04,960
When I'm up there, that's me.

959
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:07,420
Everything you see is what I am.

960
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:08,640
It's genuine.

961
00:56:08,760 --> 00:56:10,300
It's not just some act.

962
00:56:10,340 --> 00:56:11,120
You know that, right?

963
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:18,300
And Dr. G. Gordon Gordon to go on imitating my friends.

964
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:20,580
Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

965
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:20,580


966
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:20,580


967
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,140
Mercenary for Bob.

968
00:56:23,620 --> 00:56:24,420
He said,

969
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,380
I couldn't agree more.

970
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,540
I met Dr. Legume at the Chicago con and we partied down.

971
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:32,360
Now he's done the 40 frame...

972
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,760
40 frame...

973
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:37,500
I don't think I can do Dr. Gordon.

974
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:41,860
Now he's done the 40 frame fade to black.

975
00:56:42,100 --> 00:56:47,220
Just when new blood and testosterone promised to put some balls back in the church.

976
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,560
I admired the man.

977
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:49,940
I saw great potential in it.

978
00:56:49,960 --> 00:56:50,340
Figured.

979
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:51,480
I jumped drunk got him.

980
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:54,160
He went fast, went hard, and was a true doctor.

981
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:59,120
I will miss him and would gladly trade most of the internet subscribers to get him back.

982
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:06,740
Of course, if we got hold of his body and enough dupes and bobbies to supply sufficient life force to reanimate him...

983
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,200
But, nah.

984
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:13,220
It would take the nantescence of doctors to bring him back all the way.

985
00:57:13,840 --> 00:57:14,620
Oh well.

986
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:20,560
The fightin' Jesus and someone to cover his back when metaphysical ass-kicking time rolls by.

987
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:31,460
around. Saludos, amigo, we miss you. As Dr. Nenslow said, listen, Legume used up more living

988
00:57:31,460 --> 00:57:37,380
and five minutes of dreamless sleep than you hunks of coke, pod, vomit altogether will use in your

989
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:43,780
entire lives. Even as an urn full of scorched calcium chunks, he's bigger, smarter, sexier,

990
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:49,880
and scarier than your most naive comic book style wish fantasies of what you would rather be

991
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:56,140
than the pale, puking, worthless wretch you are. Killing yourself won't bring Legume back,

992
00:57:56,380 --> 00:58:07,640
but it won't hurt to try. And Sister Tarla Star, on the day that Legume was to be cremated,

993
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:14,840
she said, remember, this is the day he burns, so act accordingly. I wonder if a hit of Dr. Legume

994
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:19,620
would get you high. Well, friends, it's

995
00:58:19,620 --> 00:58:19,860
time to say goodbye.

996
00:58:19,880 --> 00:58:28,160
Time for us to do that 40 frame fade to black ourselves. And, uh, I'm gonna give you the

997
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:46,100
subgenius post office box number. That's Bob at a post office box 140306. That's 140306 Dallas, Texas

998
00:58:49,440 --> 00:59:01,900
75214. And if you're on the World Wide Web, try sunsight.unc.edu slash subgenius. And by next

999
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:07,700
week, we'll be able to tell you where to hear the Hour of Slack any time of day and lots of old

1000
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:16,080
shows over the internet. Anywhere in the entire planet, if you've got a normal or a normal, or a

1001
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:23,080
ordinary home computer. Thank you, dear friends, and, uh, good night. Oh, uh, this music in the

1002
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:25,160
background is D.K. Jones.

1003
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:44,300
That 900 number once again to benefit the family of Dr. Legume. Five minute message, two dollars a minute. It is 1-900-990-5085 extension 324.

1004
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:45,340
4.

1005
00:59:46,100 --> 00:59:52,080
We're gonna go ahead and take you on out here with the doors. The very moving last verse of the end.

1006
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:01,960
This is the.

1007
01:00:07,560 --> 01:00:08,060
This is the.

1008
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:10,860
This is the.

1009
01:00:11,300 --> 01:00:11,300


1010
01:00:12,720 --> 01:00:13,220
My.

1011
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:17,980
This is the.

1012
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:20,580
It has to set you free.

1013
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:24,140
But you'll never follow.

1014
01:00:25,900 --> 01:00:27,020
Oh, well.

1015
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:30,600
That sounded pretty bad anyway, didn't it?

That's the problem, you know, with these subgenius shows. They sound bad.

1017
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:43,840
But, you know, as bad and crazy as this church sometimes seems, as Dobbs once said.

1018
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:45,640
As.

1019
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:46,000
As.

1020
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:46,560
As.

1021
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:56,820
As 1998 draws closer, normal, everyday reality will get to seem so crazy that the Church of the Subgenius will become the only thing that makes sense.

1022
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:01,760
This is my testimony.

1023
01:01:02,660 --> 01:01:03,600
Thank you.
