1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
The Subgenius Hour of Slime.

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,740
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:11,220
Yes, yes.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,120
Yeah, man.

5
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:13,860
Yeah, man.

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,960
Is everything good and cool or terrible and horrible or both?

7
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,320
Both. I thought you might say both, but I was going to tell you it's both.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,340
Yeah. Why not both?

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,800
Well, I went into town to walk the dogs someplace new.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:36,160
I noticed a big sign, an electric sign that they can change that usually says,

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,420
Welcome to Glen Rose.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:42,420
It said, We are Texas Strong.

13
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,140
Wash your hands.

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:50,380
And right across the street was my vet, and he has a similar sign.

15
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,980
And his said, Wash your paws.

16
00:00:56,380 --> 00:00:58,520
Yeah, I'm happy to love that.

17
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,260
Yeah, wash your paws.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:01,860
Well.

19
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,000
Scrub their foreheads real good and everything.

20
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:12,460
I was going to wash my paw, but he's now resting eternally in an eternal plane.

21
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:13,460
Yeah.

22
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:17,660
Well, I get out of it when somebody says, Wash your paws.

23
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,980
It means go scrub your parents down because there's a reason for all your problems right there.

24
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,920
Oh, your paws.

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,500
All my grandpais.

26
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:28,640
My grandpas.

27
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,960
Well, I can't hush them down either.

28
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:37,900
It's weird how they sell it different ways than here in Ohio.

29
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,040
We'll get through all this together.

30
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,820
We're one thing, and we're not one thing, are we?

31
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,000
No.

32
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,360
No.

33
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,120
No.

34
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,660
We're a thing, but.

35
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,160
Well, we've been talking about X Day.

36
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,100
You know, it was kind of a conundrum as to what we were going to do.

37
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:57,700
Yeah.

38
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,020
Yeah.

39
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,500
Yeah.

40
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,500


41
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,500


42
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,500


43
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,500


44
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,500


45
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,500


46
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,500


47
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,500


48
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,500


49
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:58,500


50
00:01:59,340 --> 00:01:59,740
Yeah.

51
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,180
Yeah.

52
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,180


53
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:10,180


54
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,400
We're talking about some season seven, season seven, season seven 신뢰 restoration.

55
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:17,180
Yeah.

56
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:17,360
It was like, What?

57
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:17,980
Just kidding.

58
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:17,980


59
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:17,980


60
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:17,980


61
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,100
Hmm-mm-hmm.

62
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:18,520
Yeah.

63
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:18,800
Uh, yeah, yeah.

64
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:18,860


65
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:19,100
Yeah.

66
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,360
I don't even tell you what it's called to check it out, I want to fast track things

67
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:22,780
for you and I should just say thing on the way because I do not want to do that for you.

68
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:24,480
Well, you have a button that's fantastic.

69
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:24,480


70
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,780
Yeah, you do it if and when you leave the building.

71
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:27,140
What's that?

72
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:28,500
Oh, that's the signing.

73
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,500


74
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:28,500


75
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,520
All the famous chefs will be making stuff every...

76
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,900
Yeah, it's a great idea.

77
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:35,860
Yeah, Cruise Ship X Day.

78
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,440
April 15th.

79
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,840
We'll let everybody know which ship it is,

80
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:45,500
and they can rush in their cars down to whatever port it's leaving from.

81
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:51,040
Yeah, and everybody who boards or disembarks has to wear a conundrum.

82
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,480
Well, since it's X Day, we know that we won't be coming back anyway.

83
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:01,420
But I've been wearing my conundrum on my face.

84
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,140
I was the second person I've seen in this town doing that.

85
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,540
But then suddenly yesterday, all the old people were wearing bandanas and stuff,

86
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,620
and nobody else, just us oldsters.

87
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:20,960
I have a feeling, you know, another couple of days...

88
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,920
If all those oldsters were wearing bandanas,

89
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:25,460
we're all playing.

90
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,500
We're playing Brave Cowboy Pete, you know what I mean?

91
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:28,240
Right, yeah.

92
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,820
They had those little toy six-guns and stuff.

93
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,880
Stick them up, baby!

94
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,200
In Texas, they actually do carry six guns.

95
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,280
Sometimes.

96
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,180
In real life, that doesn't happen much.

97
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,600
They keep them hidden.

98
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,000
Well, what could be more real than...

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,360
Yeah.

100
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,660
I kind of understand what you're saying, but...

101
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,640
I need more forgiveness.

102
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,060
I need more...

103
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,000
irreprehensible behaviors to forgive and forget.

104
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,680
Well, forgetting is easy.

105
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:03,800
Forgiving.

106
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,140
Well, it doesn't matter once you forget.

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,200
Yeah.

108
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,940
That's what I was trying to say.

109
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:12,860
Believe it or not.

110
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,100
I'm trying to decide whether to tell my doctor tomorrow

111
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:19,300
I'm going to get a Medicare checkup.

112
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,580
I'm trying to decide whether to tell him

113
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,040
I want to be...

114
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:22,280
I'm trying to decide whether to tell him

115
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,560
I want to be tested for Alzheimer's.

116
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,020
I don't think that I have it yet,

117
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,880
but I want the pills they give you for it.

118
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,840
They help your memory.

119
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:35,000
And it's like, well, how come I can't have those pills?

120
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:36,540
I've heard about those pills.

121
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,680
No.

122
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:41,420
But really, for X Day,

123
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,520
I mean, for all we know,

124
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,300
nobody will be allowed to travel at all in July.

125
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,120
Or maybe it'll kind of peak and be over with,

126
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,180
but I don't think so.

127
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,040
I think it's going to...

128
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:53,260
There's going to be a lot of repercussions.

129
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,200
Plus, everybody's going to be totally broke.

130
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,280
You know that's going to happen.

131
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,840
I already am.

132
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,560
You are.

133
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:04,360
Just take a drive through any small town in the USA

134
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,140
and every place is closed.

135
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,300
Just think of all those bartenders and whiskey drivers

136
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,740
that used to hang out in the Knott's Wheel Station

137
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:17,200
and can't find their way back home.

138
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,620
It's horrible.

139
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,180
Some of them are being...

140
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,720
experimental and adventurous about it.

141
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:25,980
For instance, in Portland,

142
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:29,420
there was a strip club that was losing all kinds of business,

143
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,900
so they decided to have home delivery.

144
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,320
And you can order food,

145
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:38,420
and a stripper or two will come and strip for you

146
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:41,600
at your doorway or whatever.

147
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,360
And it's called Boober Eats

148
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:49,800
from the Lucky Devil nightclub.

149
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:51,480
Well, that's...

150
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:51,980
Yeah.

151
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,260
That's good.

152
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,600
They said...

153
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,520
This is Portland.

154
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,920
They said that most of the people they deliver to

155
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:00,520
seem to be very, very stoned.

156
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,860
So...

157
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,220
Yeah.

158
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,060
Go figure.

159
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:06,100
But, you know, here's the thing.

160
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,020
For the subgeniuses that have their membership card

161
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,980
in their pocket anyway,

162
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,180
the men from Planet X know our addresses.

163
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,400
We tend to forget...

164
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,020
Oh, I'm coughing on you.

165
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:21,240
We tend to forget that...

166
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,100
that we don't have to be at some campground

167
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,500
with a bunch of other idiots.

168
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,960
We can rupture in place.

169
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,700
Yeah, and we're familiar idiots.

170
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,020
We don't have to be with...

171
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,920
Let a thousand little X days bloom, Onan said.

172
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,020
Bob led you all the way to the poorly equipped fallout shelter.

173
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,260
Now laugh.

174
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,080
Did we say fully equipped fallout shelter?

175
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,320
No.

176
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:51,840
We meant...

177
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,080
Say poorly equipped fallout shelter.

178
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:56,780
So...

179
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:56,940
Yeah.

180
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,860
The other thing we can do is the virtual type thing

181
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:04,260
where you just turn on your computer

182
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,280
and use one of those teleconferencing programs

183
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,420
that the government watches you on.

184
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,340
Yeah.

185
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:11,440
And then we can...

186
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,260
Everybody can party and laugh till their lungs bleed

187
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,560
and, you know, stay home to know what they really think.

188
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,560
And you can mock the government,

189
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,140
but people and stuff like that,

190
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,800
and they can come right back on you and say,

191
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,740
ha-ha, that's a good one and stuff like that.

192
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,100
Yeah.

193
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,680
Yeah, we've had some new slogans,

194
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:33,340
like too much toilet paper is always better than not enough.

195
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,660
Yeah, I think everybody agrees with that.

196
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,460
So we're offering a fully expense-paid trip to X day.

197
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,600
In your own home.

198
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,920
In your own pants.

199
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,140
Yeah, the pants.

200
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,360
So, um...

201
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,400
Pants.

202
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:54,980
Yeah, this will...

203
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,940
Oh, Bob prophesied that there would become a great time

204
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:01,220
of false slack for the masses.

205
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:02,800
Yeah.

206
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,800
It's interesting.

207
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,200
Some of them are going nuts

208
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:10,060
trying to live the way I have for the last 25 or 30 years.

209
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:13,060
Fully self-quarantined, you know.

210
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,160
Yeah.

211
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,760
Self-starter.

212
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,560
Well, who would have thought the world was going to come to end

213
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,440
with a pile of bat poop?

214
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,240
Yeah, right.

215
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:26,300
I mean, I thought it was going to be a bunch of nucleus explosions

216
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:31,200
and people beating on drums and banging on highways and stuff.

217
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:32,380
Nope.

218
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,320
Yep.

219
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,720
Ends with a whimper.

220
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,280
Everybody will...

221
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,520
The world will end and everybody will be dressed like that guy

222
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:46,240
in Life, the Universe, and Everything.

223
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,800
The restaurant at the end of the galaxy or whatever.

224
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:50,760
In bathrooms.

225
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:50,860
Throats.

226
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,460
Douglas Adams or whatever his name was.

227
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:53,740
Yeah.

228
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,240
Everybody will go to outer space in their bedclothes.

229
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:58,120
Night...

230
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:58,500
Night...

231
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,400
Nightgowns.

232
00:09:01,620 --> 00:09:03,280
Now, Father Joe Mama,

233
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,680
I actually got a paper letter from him the other day.

234
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,080
Oh, geez.

235
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:08,160
I ought to spray it down.

236
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,320
He's in Florida.

237
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,740
And he said...

238
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,420
He pointed out that this all makes perfect sense.

239
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:19,420
The conspiracy knows that this is the year of the actual landings

240
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,640
of the men from Planet X,

241
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,240
so they designed this disease to shut down X-Day

242
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,320
so none of us can escape.

243
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,220
And those few who still manage to board the saucers

244
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:32,080
will die from this thing in space.

245
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:34,140
As he said,

246
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,540
this is the mentality of crazy conspiracy types

247
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,060
who commit suicide by walking out on a ledge

248
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:41,720
hoping others will try to help

249
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,300
so they can grab them before jumping and killing them too.

250
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,920
Maybe that's why Bob is using the saucers

251
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,700
to swoop down and rescue these innocents.

252
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,860
Who are taken unwillingly along for the suicide ride.

253
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,820
And then we must ponder...

254
00:09:55,820 --> 00:10:00,700
Would Bob want to save a subgenius who almost died trying to save a pink?

255
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,100
No.

256
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:04,580
Or is he? Yes?

257
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,040
Which answer is it?

258
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,480
I don't know yet.

259
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,520
I don't know.

260
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,800
Who knows what Bob will do?

261
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:14,080
Who knows what works in the heart of Bob?

262
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,820
I notice once again that everything resembles the prelude to Neighbor World.

263
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:20,740
Yeah.

264
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,240
Nobody goes to work anymore.

265
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,340
Nobody...

266
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:24,860
Everything is in there.

267
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:28,040
But I didn't say it was caused by a great resurrection

268
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,780
or by a great insurrection.

269
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,340
By a great, you know, chicken wire.

270
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:33,660
Bad poop.

271
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,580
Yeah, no, they...

272
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,020
But it was predicted in other sci-fi books

273
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,700
over and over and over again.

274
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,500
But, you know,

275
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,760
I have faith in...

276
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,940
I have faith that everybody's going to die someday.

277
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,500
But you're right.

278
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,480
Well, at least false hope.

279
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,440
You're not on the internet as much as I am.

280
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,780
But I promise you it is getting to be a lot more like Neighbor World.

281
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,660
In fact, I spent a couple of hours yesterday teleconferencing with subgeniuses.

282
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,720
We were supposed to be talking about X-Day and what we're going to do.

283
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:15,320
But of course, it was like this show, you know, it just went all over the place,

284
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,380
except where it was told to go.

285
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:18,080
Supposed to go.

286
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:18,600
Yeah.

287
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:19,460
Yeah.

288
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:26,560
And today, Princess Wee was doing a Starwood brainstorming session with the same program.

289
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,060
There were a lot more of them than there were subgeniuses.

290
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,340
They were just...

291
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:30,980
You know, it...

292
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,160
And they were younger, too.

293
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:36,160
Is it like Skype where you can see the person you're assaulting or...

294
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:36,500
Yeah.

295
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:44,420
In this case, it's one called Zoom, which works better than the other one called Discord or...

296
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:44,760
Ss...

297
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:45,540
Ss...

298
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:45,740
Ss...

299
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:45,880
Ss...

300
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:46,140
Yeah.

301
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,100
Um...

302
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:50,220
But it also has security problems.

303
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:56,520
And you can assume that, you know, when you stick that frot pipe in your mouth,

304
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:01,620
that they're sending a picture of it to the local constabulary.

305
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,880
On the other hand, they may have better things to do this month.

306
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,460
You know, like stop the looters.

307
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,020
We would hope so.

308
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,020
So...

309
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:14,160
Yeah, it's pretty dismal and geek.

310
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,940
Pretty dark out there.

311
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:16,480
Pretty dark.

312
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:17,940
Oh, no kidding.

313
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:18,880
It's going to get worse.

314
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:20,200
Uh...

315
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,020
Well, so it predicts the regular media saying this would be the worst week of everything

316
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:25,920
in the whole world.

317
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,860
It's going to be worse.

318
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,680
I didn't hear that.

319
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,360
Well, they say that about every week, you know, because of scenes.

320
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,760
I'm having trouble understanding your speech.

321
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,200
Well, because it's not real speech.

322
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,280
It's mufflage.

323
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,180
Yeah, that sounds a lot better, Dave.

324
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:46,740
Yeah, I was holding the phone closer to my ear.

325
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,280
I'm coaching you, man.

326
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,200
I'm coaching you.

327
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:48,500
You gotta...

328
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,540
Remember, I'm deaf.

329
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,680
I'm just guessing what you're saying.

330
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,680
And I'm a little worried about the audience, too.

331
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,940
They're getting old.

332
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:56,860
Some of them.

333
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,060
Yeah.

334
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,480
I guess...

335
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,020
I mean, no.

336
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:00,760
Yeah.

337
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,740
Some may not get a chance.

338
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,920
I already got the chance, Boomer.

339
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,560
Okay, Boomer.

340
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,240
Very funny.

341
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:17,260
Well, it could be to some people.

342
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,480
It fit in your head.

343
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,920
It wouldn't fit that —

344
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,840
I think that

345
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,880
the reporter out there kidding some of your friends cast my name interested because they

346
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,880
were a little追ed by lottery tickets too,orns and they are getting shocked.

347
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,020
I mean, this is a business conversation that is not my thing.

348
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:31,800
Yeah, I would have liked it.

349
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:31,800


350
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,240
Okay, well, do you want them to understand

351
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:38,600
its real sense, even though you can make use of one more stand-up now and then say,

352
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:42,220
well, there are no bad erstmal benefits.

353
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,480
It's all that good stuff now.

354
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,460
People should release a Eles님 film because you cured Bei mais do Edenschen, right?

355
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:55,720
lifespan and and and the the smarty pants people practically quit reproducing so yeah you know

356
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:02,900
there you go i did my job i did my part i really so did you we both reproduced we had to have help

357
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:08,800
from another person another human being unfortunately a certain kind of human being

358
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:17,520
couldn't just be any human being so uh and then they then they had went and doubled so my man

359
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:25,340
my grandkids haven't been to school in a month and uh they're going kind of nuts and and sending

360
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:31,640
little videos and texts and things they have there's a little kid version of messenger that's

361
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:37,500
like kid messenger or something it's i don't know what the difference is a little simpler to use i

362
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:43,920
guess you don't have as many options i can't send pornography on it i know you've tried t

363
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:47,380
there's plenty of oblongs you could send i said

364
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:56,860
i sent out a picture of my hideously bruised and veiny forearm once to to show what it was like to

365
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:02,480
be on blood thinners and a bunch of people got in trouble because the facebook robots

366
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:10,040
interpreted that forearm with a fist at the end of it as something bad and evil that men carry

367
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:14,360
and well yeah and the people i sent it to got warnings

368
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,300
stuff on your

369
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:22,140
computer instead of saying forearm you should have said foreskin and everybody would have understood

370
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:30,960
you there you go yeah i said i said at least 20 pictures of my foreskin every week at least you

371
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:38,940
still have a foreskin well i do aren't you so now we went and put that in the audience's head

372
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:43,820
but it looks just the same as my forearm with the bruises and veins all over it so what's the

373
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,720
and fingers on the end

374
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,820
you know some people

375
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:51,600
suddenly forced to stay at home might

376
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,020
read

377
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,840
but rather than really reading i think most of them are kind of

378
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:04,820
thumbing and quote writing unquote oh my god this background music's my favorite part

379
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:08,660
i'm gonna turn it on wow i can't hear it i know

380
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,660
well i i won't leave it up

381
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:17,360
it sounds great though i mean although i can't hear it i'm gonna turn it on

382
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:27,480
it's um wendy carlos doing uh bach the brandenburg concertos oh and this is concerto number two

383
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:33,500
which is my favorite in the allegro part is my favorite part so i actually know some smarty pant

384
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:41,580
stuff yeah like allegro means happy and stuff like that yeah and disturbo means mentally ill

385
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,800
and yeah i can read all that stuff

386
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,740
sotto voce means soft voice

387
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,240
kakasoto

388
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,780
means quiet pooh pooh

389
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:56,580
i could play anything from sheet music on a piano if i'm given enough time between notes

390
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,460
you know i have to count

391
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:02,260
that's what they call practicing scales thing you got to get down there and practice your scales

392
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:12,460
yeah well there's several things that i'll let my friends do like draw and sing and play guitars

393
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:17,320
and write books and well you didn't write

394
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:23,160
a couple of books well i edited a couple of books i've spliced together a lot of sentences

395
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:28,340
well you can oversee you can oversee the hanging of a new well drilling

396
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:37,160
well that's actually the one thing we need energy said that again we need energy so we any kind of

397
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:41,580
times you can drill oil wells and stuff like that or natural gas

398
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:47,240
i've had natural gas since i was six years old so probably longer than that you just don't remember

399
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:48,820
I bet your mama did.

400
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,380
I bet your mama did.

401
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,780
What the hell's a mama did?

402
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,140
Is it like a thermometer?

403
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,160
I tried to buy a thermometer the other day.

404
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,460
They said they were all sold out.

405
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:04,120
Oh, they probably sold out of everything important that sick people need.

406
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:04,520
Masks.

407
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,920
Yeah, masks and thermometers.

408
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,420
What if they were all just making fun of us?

409
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,420
We're all going to die anyway.

410
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:17,140
You could wear a bright coupon or flowers on your head and it will save you.

411
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,180
Where are the rules in your ear?

412
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,420
Oh, well, there's a whole lot of that going around.

413
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:26,860
The National Enquirer had a headline last week that said,

414
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:31,060
Cures for coronavirus you can make at home out of common household items.

415
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,580
You know, they should be arrested for that.

416
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:35,720
Yeah.

417
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:40,180
There's an entire news organization that should be arrested for that.

418
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:42,620
And I suppose it's possible it could happen.

419
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:47,260
If there's enough of a class, if enough people died from Fox News' advice

420
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,900
they could sue Fox News.

421
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:57,560
Of course, Trump was the one who told them to say that that pointless, useless chemical is the cure.

422
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:58,800
There ain't one.

423
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,220
The cure is...

424
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,060
An old band.

425
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,280
Is to join the church of the subgenius.

426
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:14,220
You may not live, but by golly, at least you'll go to a better class of hell than anybody else.

427
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,320
It's better than anybody else's heaven.

428
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:24,600
And it's just, when you go to subgenius hell, that's just to get you prepared for the intense slack of subgenius heaven.

429
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,460
It's like New Orleans Mardi Gras purgatory or something.

430
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:30,560
Yeah.

431
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:32,980
They just had Mardi Gras, didn't they?

432
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,340
They tried to.

433
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,580
Yeah, and so that's why it's a hot spot.

434
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,200
We all need hot spots these days.

435
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,280
Our hot spot here in Glen Rose is the...

436
00:19:47,380 --> 00:19:58,220
Comanche Peak Nuclear Power Plant, which twice a year, hundreds of people from out of town have to come here to repair the thing.

437
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:01,680
And they shut one reactor down and clean it all out.

438
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,000
And then they fire it back up and shut the other one down and clean it all out.

439
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,700
And it takes a lot of infected people from out of town.

440
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,360
And boy, the locals are like, you've got to be real careful.

441
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,980
There's going to be people coming here from Dallas with them viruses and stuff.

442
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,280
So we better go to church and pray.

443
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:27,020
They're actually holding drive-in church services here at the Cowboy Church up the road.

444
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,140
This is like an old drive-in movie?

445
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:30,780
Yeah.

446
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,480
I almost went this morning.

447
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,160
I thought, well, I wouldn't have to talk to anybody.

448
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,700
I have one good friend who goes to the Cowboy Church.

449
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:41,760
And she'd keep him from killing me.

450
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,560
But you just park in your car and it's like a drive-in.

451
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:48,700
And I guess the preacher's got a big speaker.

452
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,360
And I guess he just stands on the front porch and hollers.

453
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:54,060
And they play cowboy gospel music.

454
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,960
That's the main reason I would go.

455
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:00,320
They have really good cowboy gospel bands there.

456
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:05,040
Yeah, like Bob Wills would be like St. John or something or St. Pete.

457
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:06,240
Yeah, yeah.

458
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,640
I really like that stuff.

459
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,680
It's very heartfelt.

460
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:15,660
So any real gospel, you know, the really swinging gospel stuff,

461
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:18,980
whether it's a black church or cowboy church or both,

462
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,720
that's some of the swinginest, rockinest music you can find.

463
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:24,780
Yeah.

464
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:26,940
In fact, there's a phenomenon now.

465
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,640
You've got to believe me on this because this is not a shtick.

466
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,280
This is true.

467
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:38,320
That European tourists like to go to African-American churches like in South Carolina

468
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,980
where they're real, you know, back where they used to be 300 years ago.

469
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,620
Yeah, my father used to do that.

470
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:45,340
They go there.

471
00:21:45,340 --> 00:21:45,600
They go there.

472
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:45,640
They go there.

473
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,600
300 years ago.

474
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,440
Oh, okay.

475
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:52,860
He would stand outside the black churches in his neighborhood to listen to him sing.

476
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,460
And I've heard him sing those songs.

477
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:59,380
I kind of wish I had a tape recorder next to me at that moment.

478
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,760
He'd just suddenly spontaneously break out into this wild gospel singing

479
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:11,240
and not sounding like the South Carolina white man that he was at all.

480
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,200
Yeah, you better not walk too close to them churches on Sunday.

481
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:15,480
You will feel.

482
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:15,640
You will feel.

483
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:16,520
You're rectum vibrating.

484
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:17,420
Yeah.

485
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,200
I remember this was one of the most important.

486
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,420
I said, wow, this has got my whole body going.

487
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,520
Yeah, but he didn't go in.

488
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:33,100
See, that would have been bad form and everybody would have been shocked on both racial sides, I'm sure.

489
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,400
But he liked their music better.

490
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,620
He'd stand outside.

491
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:43,240
Maybe for all I know, doing some kind of soft shoe dance or something or sing along with them.

492
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,620
And they'd look out and he'd go, dude, it's that crazy white boy.

493
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:46,880
What is he doing?

494
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:50,120
What is that dancing?

495
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:51,980
Is that what he's doing?

496
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:52,360
Singing?

497
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:53,040
I just.

498
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,160
Or his feet moving or any.

499
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:56,840
Yeah.

500
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,140
Yeah.

501
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,020
Well, we're familiar with that.

502
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:09,380
But at least now in South Carolina, a lot of these churches are saying, you know, we've got the hottest gospel choir in the world.

503
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:12,020
But we don't want you coming here going, ooh, la la.

504
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,320
You know, saying all them funny French words.

505
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:16,100
Stuff like that.

506
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:20,920
Expected to have peach cobbler in the basement after everything's done with.

507
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:22,960
Well, no ma'am, no sir.

508
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:33,920
Well, nowadays it's practically illegal in a lot of places to have a church service unless it's by streaming video,

509
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:39,100
which half of the people don't even know what that means and don't have computers.

510
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,140
And then there's on the other hand, though, think.

511
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,080
But look at it this way.

512
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,420
There's going to be a whole lot less.

513
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:48,600
Less Republican voters in about five months.

514
00:23:50,260 --> 00:24:12,180
A lot fewer of all kinds of voters, but especially Republicans, because they were they wanted to really show us what for by congregating and kissing the floors of their churches and, you know, going to NASCAR and Trump rallies and gun shows just to pwn us.

515
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:15,320
You know, just just to show the libtards what.

516
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:24,220
For and meanwhile, the libtards are hunkering inside their houses, hearing the other news.

517
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,320
Yeah.

518
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:26,440
Caves and trenches.

519
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,200
You know, I don't hide in news.

520
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,920
I only read news.

521
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:35,200
I won't look at news on TV or listen to it on the radio.

522
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:41,060
Well, I remember you saying you were not a follower, not a follower of Neil McClune ism.

523
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:45,260
But Neil McClune ism does indeed support.

524
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,180
What you just said.

525
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:55,380
Well, I don't have any problem with McClune and his weird baloney.

526
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,340
It's his fan club.

527
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:04,680
It's had certain members of his fan club are at least as bad as members of the God fan club.

528
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,980
And, you know, it's hard.

529
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:08,660
I hate to.

530
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:12,820
Yeah, I don't judge Jesus by bad Christians.

531
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:13,000


532
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,380
In fact, I don't.

533
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:16,640
I don't even think there was a Jesus.

534
00:25:16,780 --> 00:25:17,860
How could I judge him?

535
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:18,800
Yeah.

536
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,820
So there's no census.

537
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:24,040
There's no census record to say if he ever did or didn't.

538
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,000
But they changed the census this year.

539
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,220
All they ask is, are you Mexican?

540
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:29,960
What kind?

541
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,980
And that's about it.

542
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,420
You know, really, it used to be how much you make.

543
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,560
What kind of car do you have?

544
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,300
How often do you, you know, masturbate?

545
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:38,500
Yeah.

546
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:38,820
Yeah.

547
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:41,340
All kinds of fun stuff to fill out.

548
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:44,040
Well, this thing took about 30 seconds online.

549
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,040
It's like, how many people are in your house?

550
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:49,900
You know, what kind of Mexican are you?

551
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,760
It really means what kind of Hispanic.

552
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,100
And there's about a zillion categories to choose from.

553
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:58,820
Yeah, I heard that.

554
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:02,620
And I don't understand why anything.

555
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:09,140
You know, if you're a mixture of things, you're supposed to say what kind of a mixture you are.

556
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,280
In my case, that was real easy.

557
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,440
Because I can.

558
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:13,920
Honestly.

559
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:18,760
Honestly, as we learn from a DNA test, I just, all I can say is English.

560
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,140
Or British Isles, actually, I should say.

561
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,500
Scotch-Irish English.

562
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,340
British Isles.

563
00:26:25,260 --> 00:26:26,300
And Neanderthal.

564
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:27,960
Neanderthal.

565
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,060
I should have thrown that in.

566
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:33,120
I should have just put English slash Neanderthal.

567
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:34,260
Yeah.

568
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:43,160
Or really throw them off, say Denisovan, which is another early human variety.

569
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:44,500
Yeah.

570
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,340
At the same time as the Neanderthals, but over in the east.

571
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,660
Yeah, they're having all kinds of fun with Denisovans now.

572
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,280
Yeah.

573
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,100
Oh, they use tools.

574
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,120
And monkeys use tools.

575
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,660
Everybody uses tools.

576
00:26:57,820 --> 00:26:59,320
Fish use tools.

577
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:01,820
And you wouldn't say a fish was smart, would you?

578
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,980
You might say they're mighty good eating, but not.

579
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,940
Octopuses are smarter than anybody in the ocean.

580
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,040
And they're mollusks.

581
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:12,320
Yeah.

582
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:13,740
They don't eat bollocks.

583
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:13,980
They don't eat bollocks.

584
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,000
They don't eat bollocks.

585
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,000


586
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,000


587
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,000


588
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,340
They don't eat bones.

589
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:17,720
You can go lobster's how smart they are, and we cook them every day.

590
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:24,620
Well, I don't feel bad about eating octopus, which I really love, because I learned that

591
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,520
they're cannibals.

592
00:27:25,660 --> 00:27:29,700
So it's like, well, when in Rome, eat Romans.

593
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,420
Well, there goes that reason for not eating cannibals.

594
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,160
So, yeah.

595
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,660
I don't know who's...

596
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,100
We're subgeniuses.

597
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,380
We're not going to say who's smart.

598
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,900
We're just going to say who's cool.

599
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:44,960
Who's good.

600
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,780
Yeah, who tastes good.

601
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,240
And who's fun.

602
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:52,320
And, you know, who's the luckiest, not who's the smartest.

603
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,220
Where does smart get you?

604
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,640
Smart gets you nothing but misery.

605
00:27:57,300 --> 00:28:00,780
Yeah, I give you five to ten and eleven worth, or twelve to five and twelve worth.

606
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,500
Yeah.

607
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:02,880
Man.

608
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,940
I don't think they're going to let the prisoners out in Texas.

609
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,880
They're already let the prisoners out in Ohio.

610
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:14,680
They did?

611
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,280
Yeah, they were.

612
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,580
Sixty was the magic number.

613
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:25,400
If you were over sixty years of age, if you have served a certain amount of time out of

614
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,880
the last sixty years, and something else that said sixty.

615
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,500
Oh, this is great.

616
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:30,880
You got to go.

617
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,920
Did they let murderers out?

618
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:35,900
No, no, no.

619
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:42,360
Murders or child molesters were allowed, but, you know, low, low, low, what you call it,

620
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:42,700
criminals.

621
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:49,660
Doesn't it just figure my imprisoned sister is fifty-nine and won't be sixty until November.

622
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,100
Great.

623
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:54,340
And her parole comes up in December.

624
00:28:54,900 --> 00:29:01,180
And I just hired a parole lawyer for her using money that was donated by family and subgeniuses.

625
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,260
So we'll see.

626
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:03,700
Yeah.

627
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:08,180
But I don't think they're going to let anybody out here.

628
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,680
If they do, they, you know, they might let, hmm, you know, they might let, hmm, you know,

629
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:17,700
they might let rapists and junkies out, but not marijuana smokers or, you know, women

630
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:23,100
who went and had an abortion a little too late or illegally because they couldn't get

631
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,040
one legally or whatnot.

632
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:31,940
You know, it's kind of obvious that the powers that be are taking advantage of this chaos

633
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:37,880
to kind of try to lock down their permanent regime of right wing white supremacy.

634
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,180
Yeah, I've noticed that too.

635
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:42,660
You know, and they're basically erasing every single one of them.

636
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:42,660


637
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:42,660


638
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:46,620
They're erasing every single scientific advance that was instituted.

639
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,860
Like for instance, being ready for a pandemic.

640
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,860
They just hate anything scientific because that's related to smarty pants people, which

641
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,100
are mostly libtards.

642
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,840
Yeah, with their funny talk.

643
00:29:59,100 --> 00:29:59,440
Yeah.

644
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:03,580
So what, you know, what can they do but hate?

645
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:07,480
Not really equipped to do much else.

646
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,300
I mean, their idea of science is mostly hearsay from other arch conservatives.

647
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,720
Is it Congressman Burr or Senator Burr?

648
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:17,300
Senator Burr.

649
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:17,300


650
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:18,020
Senator Burr.

651
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,060
Oh, that's even better.

652
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,460
Oh, but everybody's already...

653
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:21,000
It makes even more sense.

654
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:23,780
Yeah, a bunch of senators cashed in on the disaster.

655
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,840
And that was a couple of days ago.

656
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,100
Everybody's forgotten about it.

657
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,780
They just already moved on.

658
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:32,160
Oh no, what's the next big toilet paper joke?

659
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:34,220
Yeah.

660
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:40,060
The president who was so crappy that America ran out of toilet paper.

661
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:40,620
Yeah.

662
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:43,320
That's a good one.

663
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:44,620
That's a polite way of putting it.

664
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:49,020
I doubt if I'll put that on my bumper sticker, but it was a good one.

665
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:52,340
Dave, it's not original to me, believe me.

666
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:58,120
It's so obvious it's going around like other things that are going around.

667
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,920
Just think of the killing we could have made had we known ourselves.

668
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:06,300
We would have bought all kinds of toilet paper and sold all kinds of toilet paper.

669
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:06,600


670
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,080
Well, I did hoard a little bit early.

671
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,540
I started March 1st.

672
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:14,120
And one of the things I did buy extra of was toilet paper.

673
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:18,720
But I wasn't emptying the whole aisle or anything like that.

674
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,780
I just buy one extra package.

675
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,480
I've actually been doing that.

676
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:25,500
I buy one extra of almost everything.

677
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:31,240
And I now have seven boxes of stashed food like a Mormon.

678
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:37,200
I figure it's enough to last one month, which is half as long as I'd need to make it last.

679
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:38,980
I don't even got enough for a week.

680
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,120
I got to go out and get more.

681
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:40,520
Yeah.

682
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:40,640
Right.

683
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,900
I believe you.

684
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,660
I'm lucky I was able to stock up.

685
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,560
But like I say, I've been doing it little by little.

686
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:55,440
We did have one giant fell swoop shop where we spent over 200 bucks.

687
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,520
And that made me feel a little better.

688
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:00,520
That was after the military doctor told me what to do.

689
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:08,340
He said, get two months worth of stash of everything, including toothpaste, soap.

690
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:15,780
We have plenty of soap because we use Triology soap from triologiesoaps.com.

691
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,720
Manufactured by our friend Reverend Ferg.

692
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,820
And they have little Dobbs head inside.

693
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,840
Actually, a fairly big Dobbs head.

694
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,920
Little Bob, little Bob Bobble.

695
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:34,420
Well, it's a silhouette of a Bob head made of a more darker colored soap inside of a translucent soap.

696
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,340
And they all are scented.

697
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:40,400
I think you can get one that's not scented.

698
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,240
And that's the one I have to use.

699
00:32:43,980 --> 00:32:51,700
I can't stand those deodorant smells, those chemical smells, the perfumes and armpit things.

700
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:52,980
Those things just.

701
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:54,300
I used to be.

702
00:32:54,340 --> 00:33:00,360
Back when I smoked three packs of cigarettes a day, the detergent aisle didn't bother me a bit.

703
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,280
Now I can barely breathe in there.

704
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:07,320
Well, that's a sign that you haven't conflicted the detergent.

705
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:10,040
I haven't got the disease yet because you can smell all that stuff now.

706
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:10,700
Oh, yeah.

707
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:11,520
Oh, I haven't.

708
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:13,600
I haven't got the disease yet myself.

709
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:14,480
Probably.

710
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:21,000
Although, you know, a lot of us may have already had it and didn't even know, you know, had something like a cold back in December.

711
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,480
And that was it.

712
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,420
And we just didn't know.

713
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,800
That's what it takes to December.

714
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,400
Doesn't go to January or February.

715
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,720
How about February?

716
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:35,040
How about the middle of January?

717
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,380
I have several friends.

718
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,120
I have several friends who got deathly ill in early December.

719
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:48,340
All that with the severe body aches and high fever, could barely breathe, panicky attempts to breathe.

720
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:52,640
And they got tested for flu and it wasn't flu.

721
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:55,060
And all three of these people are.

722
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,060
Well, one's a mail carrier.

723
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,660
They touch everything.

724
00:33:58,980 --> 00:34:03,580
One was a masseuse who goes to nightclubs every weekend.

725
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,300
So there's.

726
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:07,140
And I don't know about the other one.

727
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,200
Probably not like me.

728
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:17,340
So I rarely touch anybody except my dogs and my two old ladies.

729
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:23,400
My brother was standing six feet away from me the other day.

730
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,820
I didn't know whether he was kidding or not.

731
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:26,920
I think he was serious.

732
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:31,720
He was just probably figured, well, staying and we, they probably all been infected.

733
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,280
They're so huggy and always going into town, talking about it.

734
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:40,820
And people socializing and such, which is actually not all that true.

735
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:42,340
I am friendly.

736
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,880
I am friendly in town.

737
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:46,120
But you're not a socialist.

738
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,140
That's for sure.

739
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:52,080
Because if not, you'd be derided and decomposed for thousands of years now.

740
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,620
Yeah, right.

741
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:56,700
No, I'm a malice.

742
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:58,740
Who needs public libraries anyway?

743
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,700
Who needs public swimming pools or tennis courts?

744
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,380
Who needs public anything, you know?

745
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:04,560
Yeah.

746
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,700
Pull yourself up by your own bootstraps.

747
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:07,840
Yeah.

748
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:11,560
Yeah, and prove how worthy you are by how much money you got.

749
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:14,460
I'll take care of this section of road in front of my property.

750
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,860
Now pay me $20,000 to cross it.

751
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:29,120
Well, we laugh, but you know, these things have happened in Russia, China, Germany, Cambodia.

752
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:30,600
France.

753
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,240
Yeah, they're all over the...

754
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,400
Yeah.

755
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:37,760
These things happen when all the uneducated people suddenly decide to throw everybody

756
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:44,520
who's bilingual or wears glasses into an education camp or just a mass grave in the

757
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,900
case of the Cambodians.

758
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:51,980
Don't you think it's odd that all the world's leaders are all that are into this and telling

759
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:55,580
people what to do and when they can go to the bathroom and stuff like that are all right-wing

760
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,020
dictators?

761
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,160
Yeah.

762
00:35:57,320 --> 00:35:58,420
From the Philippines.

763
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,400
Well, maybe not Germany for once.

764
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,380
But from the Philippines to the subcontinent.

765
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:03,580
I mean, they have a lot of people.

766
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:03,580


767
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:03,580


768
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:03,580


769
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:03,580


770
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:03,580


771
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:03,580


772
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:03,660
Oh, you know, it's a little bit like the Soviet Union.

773
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,880
It's on an autocratic regime everywhere.

774
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,380
Well, that's the only way you can do it.

775
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,520
Yeah.

776
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,980
That's what Bob said, anyway.

777
00:36:15,420 --> 00:36:16,220
That's what we...

778
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:16,440
Yeah.

779
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,660
We all get to do that ourselves.

780
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:25,380
We'll get to be autocratic, totalitarian dictators on our own spaceship, or planet-sized spaceships.

781
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,140
Wear tights and king crowns and stuff.

782
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:30,940
And it's only two weeks away.

783
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:33,080
on the X-Day cruise ship.

784
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,680
It'll be packed.

785
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,460
Like sardines.

786
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,080
Yeah.

787
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:40,400
Yeah, man.

788
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,100
We defy the virus.

789
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:43,820
Listen back to me,

790
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:45,380
you devil-inspired virus.

791
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,680
We got the power of Bob.

792
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:49,740
We're just going to kiss each other

793
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,820
and have a great big orgy

794
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,260
and cough in each other's faces.

795
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,580
Just to show them devil viruses what for.

796
00:36:57,580 --> 00:37:01,340
Therefore, there's people saying that

797
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:02,900
this very Sunday, I believe.

798
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:03,600
Oh, yeah.

799
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:04,940
In many, many churches.

800
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,780
Not just in the South, either.

801
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,260
Yep, and they're all pretty pregnant, too,

802
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,160
after all this time.

803
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,180
Look at it this way.

804
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,300
60% of them won't be voting.

805
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:16,660
Is that high?

806
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,200
They're that old and obese.

807
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,520
Think about it.

808
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:27,280
You know what the average Pobucker looks like?

809
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,180
They're either really obese

810
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,980
or incredibly skinny.

811
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,620
The skinny ones, by the way,

812
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,780
are called Monskos.

813
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,720
They're all of the Monsko-descended family.

814
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:42,640
And the obese ones are called Quaits.

815
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,200
Philo and I discovered this

816
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:46,680
when we drove to a campground

817
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,960
that was having a Quait family reunion.

818
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,900
And it was quite a sight.

819
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,140
It was a heavy view.

820
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,760
Let's put that.

821
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,260
I don't mean to fat shame anyone,

822
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:57,600
but I don't mean to fat shame anybody.

823
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:00,120
That's not my point here,

824
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:01,360
but it is a true fact

825
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,280
that Americans,

826
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,300
60% of Americans,

827
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,140
are overweight.

828
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,660
And the poorer they are,

829
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,300
oftentimes,

830
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,640
the more Twinkies they're eating

831
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,320
and sugar cereal

832
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:17,140
and cheap stuff, you know.

833
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,400
Well, you get your food stamps,

834
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:20,960
and you don't have to prepare the food.

835
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,080
You just shove it in your mouth

836
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,960
as quick as you can.

837
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:23,660
Yeah.

838
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:27,080
I will tell you a weird thing

839
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,300
that I saw on my street.

840
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:29,860
There's this guy that always flies

841
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:30,720
a Confederate flag.

842
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:34,100
And on the day that they started saying

843
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,120
things were going to be rough

844
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,400
and people couldn't believe

845
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:38,580
there was actually such a thing as a...

846
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:42,720
What are we going through right now?

847
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:43,560
Corona...

848
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,840
Surveys of violence, you called it.

849
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,000
Captain Trump's

850
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,580
Cove Theft 19.

851
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,140
The guy was dressed up

852
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:51,320
in full gorilla uniform

853
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,260
and had what looked to be

854
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,160
like a real AR-15.

855
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,040
Now, what...

856
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:57,060
What?

857
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:57,460
What?

858
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,460
What?

859
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:58,960
What?

860
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,440
What?

861
00:38:59,520 --> 00:38:59,720
What?

862
00:38:59,980 --> 00:38:59,980


863
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:02,500
That's the only way he can feel special.

864
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,420
I'm sure at work,

865
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:06,640
everybody treats him like a bozo.

866
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,520
He's a powerless, ineffectual,

867
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,020
babbling idiot.

868
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,880
But he's got a gun.

869
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,020
So who's the dumb one?

870
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:15,860
Libtard?

871
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,720
Thought he was a libtard?

872
00:39:17,820 --> 00:39:18,960
Yeah, because everybody knows.

873
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:21,160
I've actually read this numerous times.

874
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,380
Democrats don't have guns.

875
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,780
Oh, yeah, you're going to see a Democrat

876
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,000
riding his motorcycle.

877
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:28,260
He's got a motorboat around saving people

878
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:29,360
in flooded New Orleans.

879
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,680
Well, yes.

880
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:33,940
It's like, are you...

881
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:36,120
What kind of world do they live in?

882
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,000
Yeah, they live in a world of AM radio.

883
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,540
They're going to be really surprised

884
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:44,980
when they go expecting to take over

885
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:47,600
the homesteads of the libtards

886
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,560
and find out, by golly,

887
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,480
not only did the libtards have guns,

888
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:52,280
after all,

889
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,240
some of them are really crack shots.

890
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,980
Yeah, that would be funny.

891
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,640
Wouldn't it?

892
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,520
I mean, that would be...

893
00:39:58,520 --> 00:39:59,900
Wouldn't that be gratifying?

894
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,920
Well, it wouldn't work in my situation.

895
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,800
I'd have to throw myself on the mercy

896
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,740
of my nephews and my brother,

897
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:08,500
who are all armed to the teeth.

898
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:11,420
All I have is this sort of bob,

899
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,400
which, unfortunately,

900
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,340
is just a very smelly old pipe.

901
00:40:14,920 --> 00:40:17,360
Just think if they were all armed to the teats.

902
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,800
What kind of world would we have to live in?

903
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,900
An all-female world,

904
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,340
and after a while,

905
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,540
they wouldn't need arms.

906
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,080
They could just...

907
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,800
Or legs, even.

908
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:28,600
Any other body parts,

909
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:29,420
we wouldn't need them.

910
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,020
Yeah.

911
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,680
Well, you know,

912
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,860
some think,

913
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,380
well, if there were no men,

914
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:35,400
there wouldn't be any wars,

915
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,400
but come on.

916
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,460
There's always a dame

917
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:39,720
ready to fill that niche.

918
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,020
Yeah.

919
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,720
Just think the Amazons.

920
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:43,900
They were pretty feisty.

921
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,980
Yeah, especially that Wonder Woman.

922
00:40:48,260 --> 00:40:49,040
Ooh-wee!

923
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,200
Ooh-wee!

924
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,800
You're making a funny smell sound.

925
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:56,480
Ooh-wee!

926
00:40:56,580 --> 00:40:56,740
Ooh-wee!

927
00:40:56,740 --> 00:40:56,960
Ooh-wee!

928
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,020
It's hard to disagree with that, you know?

929
00:40:59,080 --> 00:40:59,520
Hey, wait, wait.

930
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,120
There's an army of feral hogs coming all of a sudden.

931
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:02,640
Ah, no!

932
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,740
This is what somebody called

933
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,440
the Church of the Sub-Jesus once.

934
00:41:09,060 --> 00:41:11,440
An army of feral hogs.

935
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:13,260
Ooh-wee!

936
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,180
Oh, Princess Wee just arrived.

937
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:19,180
She's been out walking the dogs.

938
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,680
She's making a chocolate cake?

939
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:25,880
Uh, no, actually,

940
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,740
what we're eating,

941
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:29,260
now, is this cyanobacteria

942
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,280
called Nostoc,

943
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,160
which tastes like...

944
00:41:33,820 --> 00:41:34,760
It's not very nutritious,

945
00:41:34,820 --> 00:41:36,740
but it tastes like whatever it grows on.

946
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:37,960
So around here,

947
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,280
most of it tastes like dirt,

948
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,260
but I've been wondering how,

949
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:42,240
if we grew it on chocolate ice cream

950
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,060
or enchiladas,

951
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:45,060
how would the Nostoc taste?

952
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,100
They say it tastes like

953
00:41:46,100 --> 00:41:47,200
whatever it's growing on.

954
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,920
They say that.

955
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:53,840
Welcome to the show, Princess Wee.

956
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,140
If we grew it on...

957
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,320
Chocolate.

958
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:58,080
There we go.

959
00:41:58,160 --> 00:41:58,420
Cake!

960
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,040
Maybe it would taste like chocolate cake.

961
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:00,580
Yeah.

962
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,000
That's what you want to do.

963
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:05,780
Your mic has an on button.

964
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:06,780
Mine doesn't.

965
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,220
How about that?

966
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,220
I gave you the good one.

967
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,200
Wow.

968
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:10,460
I'm honored.

969
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,100
Yeah.

970
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:11,620
Wow.

971
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,080
I'm honored, too.

972
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,960
Yeah, she gets mic one.

973
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:15,880
I get mic two.

974
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:16,800
There's a mic three,

975
00:42:17,460 --> 00:42:18,580
and then there's you, Dave.

976
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,680
Mic four.

977
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:21,440
Yeah.

978
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,820
Um, actually, you're, you're, uh,

979
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:28,220
coming through my iPhone,

980
00:42:28,460 --> 00:42:29,540
but that's okay.

981
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:31,440
You know, we may end up doing, uh...

982
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,160
I was just hoping I wasn't coming through

983
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,980
your hippocampus or your, uh, uh,

984
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,600
you know, your anthrax or your other disease,

985
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:39,300
because then we could really, really be

986
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:40,700
really, really, really, really.

987
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:43,080
But...

988
00:42:43,860 --> 00:42:45,280
Don't you wish we could get Dave

989
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,900
on one of those streaming parties?

990
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,300
Oh, yeah.

991
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,800
But, uh, Dave, you don't have a laptop

992
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,200
with a camera on it, do you?

993
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,240
I have a laptop, but all it's got in there

994
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,080
is, like, old digits, like, four and six and seven.

995
00:42:59,100 --> 00:42:59,880
No camera?

996
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:00,940
It, it's...

997
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,920
I'm not gonna try to even go there.

998
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:05,860
I couldn't get G. Gordon Gordon to download Telegram

999
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:07,760
or any of those things.

1000
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:08,640
He kept telling me,

1001
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,980
no, it only works on iOS.

1002
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,620
I'm like, no, it works on everything.

1003
00:43:12,980 --> 00:43:14,600
No, it only works on iOS.

1004
00:43:14,740 --> 00:43:15,440
Leave me alone.

1005
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:18,580
He's like, hey, well, I guess we don't want him

1006
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:19,440
in the forum anyway.

1007
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,740
We've had, we've been struggling.

1008
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,100
Well, at least nobody knows what you're talking about,

1009
00:43:24,220 --> 00:43:24,620
you know?

1010
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:25,320
Huh?

1011
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,100
At least nobody knows what you're talking about,

1012
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:28,820
you know what I mean?

1013
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,780
Oh, the young, the, the people with,

1014
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,200
that are computer workers do.

1015
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:34,660
Uh...

1016
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,300
Man, I got a letter from somebody...

1017
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:39,260
That doesn't mean you know what you're talking about

1018
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:40,920
just because you're talking to another idiot.

1019
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:44,380
Well, that's what the church's subgenius is all about.

1020
00:43:44,780 --> 00:43:46,660
It's like a sandbox full of idiots

1021
00:43:46,660 --> 00:43:48,820
just chattering away at each other.

1022
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:51,120
Have you ever heard of the Puzzling Evidence show

1023
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:52,120
or Hour of Slack?

1024
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:52,740
Yeah.

1025
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:53,160
Yes.

1026
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,440
That's where they talk together.

1027
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:57,220
All on top of each other all the time.

1028
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,340
They're old pigs.

1029
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:02,060
The great thing about this one video streaming program

1030
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,240
is it automatically shuts off,

1031
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:08,440
it only allows one person to talk at a time.

1032
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:11,640
And it kind of forces people to have manners.

1033
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:12,900
That, that wasn't working.

1034
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:13,800
It wasn't.

1035
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:14,220
To have manners?

1036
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,640
Is that why I couldn't understand it?

1037
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,860
Yeah, everybody was talking on top of each other.

1038
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,580
Now, see, in the subgeniuses,

1039
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,200
there were six or seven of us,

1040
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,500
and that didn't happen.

1041
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:23,460
Isn't that strange?

1042
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,040
They must not be used to listening to subgenius radio shows

1043
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:28,880
or they'd all be going,

1044
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:31,040
oh, I thought we were all supposed to talk at once.

1045
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,280
Buddy's trying to kill us.

1046
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:34,700
It's rawhide time.

1047
00:44:34,940 --> 00:44:35,720
Oh, it is, yes.

1048
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,020
Come on, boy.

1049
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,960
Come on, boy.

1050
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:39,700
Yeah, that's good.

1051
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:40,620
Dogs keep...

1052
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:42,360
At least Buddy will get what he needs in March.

1053
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:43,300
Oh, yeah.

1054
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,180
At least one of you.

1055
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:45,220
Oh, God.

1056
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:48,260
They keep us to a really tight schedule, man.

1057
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,200
They tell me when it's time to work,

1058
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,720
when it's time to quit working.

1059
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,980
When it's time to take them for a walk.

1060
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,440
When it's time to eat.

1061
00:44:57,340 --> 00:44:58,420
When it's time to play.

1062
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,420
Yeah, they know all that stuff.

1063
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,780
When it's time to rub...

1064
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,200
It's because they got little clocks in there.

1065
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,960
They go off and maybe what's going on next to them.

1066
00:45:05,140 --> 00:45:06,260
Well, I've got the same...

1067
00:45:06,260 --> 00:45:07,500
What are you waiting for, man?

1068
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,660
They program that same clock into me.

1069
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,380
Yeah, me too.

1070
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:15,960
Well, you know, I think dogs and humans

1071
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:18,760
have been training each other this whole time.

1072
00:45:18,860 --> 00:45:20,000
It didn't just go one way.

1073
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,640
I've been thinking that lately.

1074
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:21,160
Yeah.

1075
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,140
I've been thinking, I mean, just think of the origins

1076
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:32,520
of some many famous things like Romulus and Remus.

1077
00:45:32,700 --> 00:45:33,960
They was raised by wolves.

1078
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:36,040
Who knows?

1079
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:37,380
They just could have been scared dogs.

1080
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:43,100
Do you have rock?

1081
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:44,100
How about stick?

1082
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,980
Fashion a dog's head and put it in your window.

1083
00:45:47,180 --> 00:45:49,120
The angel of death will pass by.

1084
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:51,140
Oh, he might come back around a few minutes.

1085
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:51,560
He might come back around a few minutes later.

1086
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:54,420
But in that moment where you demonstrate your faith,

1087
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,160
you're free.

1088
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:55,720
Free.

1089
00:45:56,120 --> 00:46:00,160
A free death with a buck fifty will buy you a cup of coffee.

1090
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,040
You know, maybe I should go sit, tell that doctor about Alzheimer's

1091
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:07,380
because I'm wondering if I didn't read all the same stuff last week.

1092
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,000
Yeah.

1093
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,920
I know I read the sick coronavirus jokes last week,

1094
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,380
but I don't know if I did the X-Day.

1095
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,080
Yeah, I didn't want to use the term X-Day cancellation.

1096
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:19,380
It's not canceled.

1097
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:23,640
But right now, camping is out against the law in Ohio.

1098
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:28,780
And many, many other states, New York as well, and California.

1099
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,180
Just think of all the problems.

1100
00:46:30,260 --> 00:46:32,520
That's where it started was in California.

1101
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,940
Said, hey, everybody's taking a walk together, you know?

1102
00:46:35,620 --> 00:46:40,600
Well, yeah, there's a lot of people who are defiant about science

1103
00:46:41,220 --> 00:46:42,960
because that's smarty pants stuff.

1104
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,040
And it's just the media.

1105
00:46:45,980 --> 00:46:46,940
It's a hoax.

1106
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:48,900
It's a hoax.

1107
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,380
Oh, God, I don't even want to go into that.

1108
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:51,340
The timeline.

1109
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:54,960
You look at it, there's a timeline of statements from the president

1110
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:58,180
that goes all the way up until about a week ago.

1111
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:00,880
And suddenly he's going, many people are going to die.

1112
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:01,940
And I knew this all along.

1113
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:02,980
I knew it was a pandemic.

1114
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,560
I said it was a pandemic from the beginning.

1115
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:04,960
Yeah.

1116
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:10,320
No, he was telling crowds of people that it was a hoax

1117
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,300
and they should come to the next rally too.

1118
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,720
So like I say, there is a silver lining to this.

1119
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:18,880
A lot less Trumpers in the...

1120
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:18,880


1121
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:19,680
In the coming months.

1122
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,620
A lot fewer, sorry.

1123
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:22,500
A lot fewer.

1124
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:24,640
Yes, I'm a smarty pants, you see.

1125
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,100
A grammar Nazi.

1126
00:47:26,980 --> 00:47:30,600
Just think of all the melachromatic problems we're going to be having

1127
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:34,960
over the next few years being led by people who are dumber than the rest of us.

1128
00:47:35,240 --> 00:47:37,860
You're supposed to have people that are like one degree smarter,

1129
00:47:38,140 --> 00:47:40,720
not 10 degrees dumber than the rest of us.

1130
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:47,040
Dave, are you familiar with the classic motion picture by Mike Judge

1131
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:47,880
called Idiocracy?

1132
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:49,740
Yes.

1133
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:51,060
The documentary?

1134
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,920
The current documentary of the current country we're living in right now.

1135
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:01,220
Yeah, oddly enough, it was made 15 years ago or something, but it's...

1136
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,520
Maybe even longer ago.

1137
00:48:03,120 --> 00:48:03,640
Yeah.

1138
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:04,620
Yeah, but it all came true.

1139
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:05,820
Doesn't it have electrolytes?

1140
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:07,000
Does it have electrolytes?

1141
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:07,300
Yeah.

1142
00:48:07,520 --> 00:48:08,040
Yeah.

1143
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,120
They were feeding the crops with Gatorade because it has electrolytes in it.

1144
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:13,780
Right.

1145
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:15,500
So it must be better from the water.

1146
00:48:15,660 --> 00:48:17,860
You can quote Idiocracy just like that.

1147
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:21,080
Just about pretty much on any occasion, right, the way things are right now.

1148
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:21,520
Yeah.

1149
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:21,860
Yep.

1150
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:23,260
Because it is an idiocracy.

1151
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:26,320
Well, I mean, yeah.

1152
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:31,260
Yeah, when you told me the name of that, there was some restaurant, that was the kicker.

1153
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:32,140
Thudruckers.

1154
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:33,600
Oh, well, I said the hoot.

1155
00:48:33,620 --> 00:48:38,100
Well, things like, oh, the Boober Eats.

1156
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:39,320
The Boober Eats.

1157
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,480
Yeah, but that's a...

1158
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,000
Yeah.

1159
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:42,080
Okay, that's...

1160
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:42,820
We're in it.

1161
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:44,860
We're in Idiocracy now.

1162
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:46,820
Price bomb.

1163
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:47,120
Yep.

1164
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:47,840
Yeah.

1165
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:48,500
Yeah.

1166
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,160
In the country of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.

1167
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,700
That doesn't help since none of us only have one eye.

1168
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,100
Yeah, and it sounds convenient and not really fitting the other part of what he said.

1169
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:04,980
And in the kingdom of the blind, actually, a person with two good eyes ends up getting

1170
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:09,500
lynched and operated on unless he or she escapes.

1171
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,680
Yeah, if they can find you, you know.

1172
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,780
Oh, that's the thing.

1173
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:14,720
They can find you better...

1174
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:15,880
Think about at night.

1175
00:49:16,860 --> 00:49:17,720
You're helpless.

1176
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:17,820
You're helpless.

1177
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:17,820


1178
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:21,420
And they can see you at night.

1179
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:22,000
Yeah, I forgot.

1180
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,080
They can see you in the daytime.

1181
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:24,420
I forgot the blind people can see in the dark.

1182
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,180
I forgot that.

1183
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:26,320
It's the country of the blind.

1184
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,920
They can do as well with hearing as everybody else can with sight.

1185
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:35,420
Plus, they've been trapped in that valley for untold centuries, so they really know

1186
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:36,200
their way around.

1187
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:41,960
They're not gonna bump into any trees, whereas a panicking sighted person might.

1188
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:43,640
There's an H.G.

1189
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:46,140
Wells story called Country of the Blind.

1190
00:49:46,140 --> 00:49:46,520
Oh, yeah.

1191
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:47,820
Everybody should read.

1192
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:48,980
You've referred to it many times.

1193
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:50,440
Yep.

1194
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,040
I've never read it.

1195
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,040
It's in my phone.

1196
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:53,740
But you should read it.

1197
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:55,340
It's free.

1198
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:56,040
H.G.

1199
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:57,080
Wells has been dead long enough.

1200
00:49:57,080 --> 00:49:58,080
All his stuff is free.

1201
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:59,380
Yeah, you can read the book.

1202
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:04,880
I actually have read most of his books, and I've read some of them every five years of

1203
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:06,660
my entire life since I was 10.

1204
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:11,500
The Time Machine, War of the Worlds, and The Invisible Man, Food of the Gods.

1205
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:15,140
You require reading if you're an emergentile subgenius.

1206
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:16,120
Yeah.

1207
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:17,960
Heck, H.G.

1208
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,100
Wells predicted the internet.

1209
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:19,700
Emergentile?

1210
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:22,560
Why did you have to stick that Heil Hitler joke in there?

1211
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:24,880
No, emergentile, dear.

1212
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:25,580
Emergentile.

1213
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,020
Oh, emergentile.

1214
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:27,680
Emergentiles.

1215
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:35,580
Yeah, emergentiles are the subgeniuses like me whose descendants will be Morlocks.

1216
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:41,880
The Rewardians are the subgeniuses like Princess Wee whose descendants will be the Eloi.

1217
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,080
The Eloi, yes.

1218
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:45,140
Yeah.

1219
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:49,780
The nice ones will become the Eloi, and the mean ones will become the Morlocks.

1220
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:54,240
Of course, the Morlocks are the only ones that know how to build anything, have any

1221
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:56,200
creative ideas, and so forth.

1222
00:50:56,700 --> 00:51:02,660
Rewardians will sit around being fed and fattened by the Morlocks until the Morlocks get hungry

1223
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:03,780
and it's harvest time.

1224
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:04,780
Yeah.

1225
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:10,580
And they sound that big horn, and the Eloi just parade right into the slaughterhouse

1226
00:51:10,580 --> 00:51:10,960
doors.

1227
00:51:12,000 --> 00:51:12,860
Simple as that.

1228
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,400
As they should.

1229
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:18,740
I mean, the Rewardians come right into the emergentiles' big slaughterhouse factory.

1230
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:25,280
We only take one out of ten, though, because otherwise, you know, it would destroy the

1231
00:51:25,280 --> 00:51:26,280
whole system.

1232
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:27,700
You'd deplete the ranks.

1233
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:28,120
Yeah.

1234
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:28,480
Yeah.

1235
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:36,040
Emergentiles only take one out of every ten Rewardians for their own use.

1236
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:43,380
Yeah, you gotta think of Rewardians as prefrontal, not prefrontal lobotomies, but what we call

1237
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:43,380


1238
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:43,860
them, I don't know.

1239
00:51:43,860 --> 00:51:44,480
Never mind.

1240
00:51:44,620 --> 00:51:46,820
I usually think of them as like you, Dave.

1241
00:51:48,740 --> 00:51:49,220
Subgenius.

1242
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:53,460
Most, almost, yeah, most subgeniuses are Rewardians.

1243
00:51:54,100 --> 00:52:00,200
I mean, there are only one in ten can be emergentiles, or the Rewardians would be extinct, and then

1244
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,440
the emergentiles would be extinct.

1245
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,600
Who's gonna wash the emergentiles' cars for them?

1246
00:52:06,840 --> 00:52:09,080
That was well thought out.

1247
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:09,860
Yeah.

1248
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,360
Highly principled verbiage coming from your time.

1249
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:13,360


1250
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:14,740
Yeah.

1251
00:52:15,120 --> 00:52:20,600
Well, Dave, you said earlier that you were worried about using up time on your phone.

1252
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,080
Well, I just wanted to get in one last dirty word, but I guess I'll go now, because my

1253
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:28,000
little yellow light is flashing also.

1254
00:52:29,100 --> 00:52:32,160
Oh, you can get in a last dirty word?

1255
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:34,900
I'll send you phone money, Dave.

1256
00:52:35,060 --> 00:52:35,560
You will?

1257
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:36,140
Yeah.

1258
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:40,580
Well, you know, whenever you do a show, I send you a copy of the show, and I usually

1259
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,360
send you a little tiny, little...

1260
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:43,340
Oh.

1261
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:43,980
...bitty check.

1262
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,920
We need to let Dave sneak in a last dirty word.

1263
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:48,240
I wanna hear it.

1264
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:48,660
Okay.

1265
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:51,000
Ophthalmolism.

1266
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:53,380
Or, uh, yeah.

1267
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:55,380
Ophthalmolism?

1268
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,080
Yeah, ophthalmology.

1269
00:52:58,220 --> 00:52:58,780
Ophthalmology.

1270
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:01,280
Listen to that smarty pants.

1271
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:04,240
Ophthalmology, yeah, ophthalmology.

1272
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:06,320
He thinks he's smarter than us, don't he?

1273
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,480
Listen...

1274
00:53:07,480 --> 00:53:08,420
Yeah, I'm showing off.

1275
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:13,240
When I was one year old, I said this sentence.

1276
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:13,340
What?

1277
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,340


1278
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,340


1279
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,340


1280
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,340


1281
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,340


1282
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,340


1283
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,340


1284
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,340


1285
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,340


1286
00:53:13,340 --> 00:53:13,840
I'm not gonna lie to you.

1287
00:53:13,840 --> 00:53:14,020
I'm gonna say this sentence.

1288
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,800
My father is an optometrist, not an ophthalmologist.

1289
00:53:18,420 --> 00:53:22,540
And people looked at my parents and said, are you ventriloquists?

1290
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,840
How did that come out of her?

1291
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,780
And they said, well, she's very verbal.

1292
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:32,700
Wow, you must be gifted or something like that.

1293
00:53:32,780 --> 00:53:33,200
I guess.

1294
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:36,380
Well, or else your dad was training you like a parrot.

1295
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,220
I think he was.

1296
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:38,480
Yeah, I think so too.

1297
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:42,200
Supposedly, family legend has it.

1298
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:42,500
Yeah.

1299
00:53:43,340 --> 00:53:48,180
And about two and a half, this doesn't sound right, but about two and a half, they took

1300
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:52,580
me to the Smithsonian and there was a big dinosaur skeleton in there.

1301
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:54,840
And my father said, look, Doug, there's a brontosaurus.

1302
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:59,120
And I said, no, pappy, that's a diplodocus.

1303
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:00,560
And I was right.

1304
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:00,820
You did.

1305
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:02,200
No, I was right.

1306
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:06,080
There's very big distinction between those two shapes.

1307
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:12,540
Brontosauruses were stumpy like me and diplodocus were long and lean like Princess Wee.

1308
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:19,300
When I was seven years old, I solved all the world's social problems and I didn't even

1309
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:20,700
get one kind word for it.

1310
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,660
Oh, Dave, that's terrible.

1311
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:24,160
Dave, that's awful.

1312
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:25,000
Well, I appreciate it.

1313
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,380
They thought I was just some crazy seven-year-old kid, you know, and it turned out five years

1314
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:31,740
later, oh well.

1315
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,380
You did solve all the world's social problems.

1316
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:35,140
I did.

1317
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:37,140
But only for a very, very short time.

1318
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:38,340
There was about one minute.

1319
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:43,180
There was no war, no fights, no cussing, no jealousy, no nothing.

1320
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:43,320


1321
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:43,320


1322
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:43,320


1323
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,580
Dave, and it was all because of Dave, but then it wore off because everybody went, what

1324
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:47,860
are you doing?

1325
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,200
We're acting like five-year-olds.

1326
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,140
We're acting like seven-year-olds.

1327
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:52,260
It's crazy.

1328
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:56,660
Let's get back to killing the others.

1329
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:01,960
Let's get back to killing the others.

1330
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:09,860
Well, we don't have to worry about the others right now until they run out of food.

1331
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:11,740
That's when they'll come.

1332
00:55:12,040 --> 00:55:13,300
They'll be back.

1333
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:14,040
They'll be back.

1334
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,040


1335
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,040


1336
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,040


1337
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,040


1338
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:14,040


1339
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:18,520
So I've been visiting all the neighbors who don't have guns and who have nice big vegetable

1340
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:21,040
garden, which I should have in about two weeks.

1341
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:22,260
No, in two months.

1342
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:25,200
Oh, you've got nice big vegetables growing?

1343
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:29,480
We set up straw bales, seven straw bales.

1344
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,780
We peed all over them so they'd compost.

1345
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:38,640
And now they're soft and mushy and they have tomato plants and eggplants and stuff growing

1346
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,020
on them.

1347
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,060
We didn't have to pee on them.

1348
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:42,260
They already smelled like pee.

1349
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:46,760
Well, we used urea.

1350
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,040
That's pee, basically.

1351
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,100
Powdered pee.

1352
00:55:50,120 --> 00:55:50,440
Yeah.

1353
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,520
Nitrogen.

1354
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:53,200
As per directed.

1355
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:55,340
And they smell like that, too.

1356
00:55:55,340 --> 00:55:56,260
By gardening guides.

1357
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:57,380
Flies love them.

1358
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,540
But the plants are growing on them like crazy.

1359
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:07,340
Supposedly, you can cure yourself of diseases by consuming your own urine.

1360
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:09,080
Well, I've...

1361
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:11,720
Call it mine instead of urine, you know.

1362
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:13,200
Some people do that.

1363
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,000
I actually knew a guy who did that.

1364
00:56:16,100 --> 00:56:18,880
He also made his own methamphetamine.

1365
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,500
Yeah, he was a chemist.

1366
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:22,580
Those are not the same.

1367
00:56:22,840 --> 00:56:26,840
And a urine aficionado.

1368
00:56:27,780 --> 00:56:29,020
So, there you go.

1369
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:30,860
There you go.

1370
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:31,700
There you go.

1371
00:56:31,820 --> 00:56:35,660
The guy who had the Puzzling Evidence show before it was the Puzzling Evidence show.

1372
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:40,140
It was the Bob Nelson show until Puzzling Evidence kept showing up.

1373
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,540
And after a while...

1374
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:44,840
Bob was gone and went to the desert.

1375
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:52,460
And Puzzling Evidence and Paul Mavridis and Dr. Howell and Gary Gabrog, friend, had replaced Bob completely.

1376
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:59,340
But who wants to get up and go to the station at four in the morning and blabber until six?

1377
00:56:59,600 --> 00:57:01,140
Well, those four did.

1378
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:03,660
And Philo did it for decades, too.

1379
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:06,480
So, who knows, man?

1380
00:57:06,580 --> 00:57:07,000
Not me.

1381
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:11,020
Not me either because I'm going to sign off now.

1382
00:57:11,220 --> 00:57:11,540
Don't.

1383
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:14,040
By the way, Dave, did you know that WCSB is...

1384
00:57:14,920 --> 00:57:15,900
There's no one there.

1385
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,060
It's closed down and they're programming remotely.

1386
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:25,140
I'm having to send them MP3s of the broadcast version of the show.

1387
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,640
No, I did not know until you just said that.

1388
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,440
Yeah, there's no one in the station.

1389
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,680
There's no one allowed.

1390
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:34,020
It's part of this university and everything's shut down.

1391
00:57:35,300 --> 00:57:36,280
So, there you go.

1392
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,600
They're still getting fresh shows from us, though.

1393
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,360
They'll probably have this one on sooner.

1394
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:42,900
And they would have if we'd...

1395
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:43,540
I'd mail them.

1396
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:46,820
Praise WCSB and all the stations.

1397
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:47,420
It's the end of the world.

1398
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:47,640
Yes.

1399
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:50,440
All the other millions of stations that carry this show.

1400
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:51,200
Yes.

1401
00:57:51,200 --> 00:57:52,360
And praise Dave.

1402
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,000
Oh, yeah, Dave.

1403
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:54,780
We forgot about that.

1404
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,540
Thanks for the prayers.

1405
00:57:57,720 --> 00:57:58,900
Wow, that was a weird one.

1406
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,520
Buddy is in the process of tearing another bed apart.

1407
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:06,060
Well, he's eating Mr. Bill's arm right now.

1408
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,540
Yes, he is eating Mr. Bill's arm.

1409
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:07,940
I know.

1410
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:09,840
Dave is trying to disconnect.

1411
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:11,620
No, we really did.

1412
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,380
We bought him a Mr. Bill chew toy that says,

1413
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,480
Oh, no.

1414
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:20,460
First thing Claudia does is take out the voice box

1415
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:24,280
and eat the head and dismember the thing.

1416
00:58:24,460 --> 00:58:25,480
Oh, is that the voice box?

1417
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:26,380
Yeah, it's still here.

1418
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:27,840
The Mr. Bill voice?

1419
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:28,420
Uh-huh.

1420
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,220
But I think it's just kaput now.

1421
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,300
That's it.

1422
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,400
Well, I'll see you later.

1423
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:37,540
Okay, Dave.

1424
00:58:37,540 --> 00:58:40,400
We're going to work with Mr. Bill's brain here for a minute more.

1425
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:41,600
Okay.

1426
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,600
How do you hang this thing up?

1427
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,340
Be well, Dave.

1428
00:58:49,900 --> 00:58:54,580
Friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack on Subgenius Radio.

1429
00:58:55,680 --> 00:59:01,120
And whoever else is able to get to a station and make it play over the air these days.

1430
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,740
I bet the short waves are still working.

1431
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:08,560
And friends, for more information, you can see subgenius.com.

1432
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:10,640
And...

1433
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:14,900
If I get Mr. Bill to his brain to speak...

1434
00:59:17,920 --> 00:59:18,860
Oh, it's all...

1435
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,020
She chewed it up.

1436
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:22,180
She chewed up Mr. Bill's brain.

1437
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:22,620
It was still working.

1438
00:59:22,620 --> 00:59:23,500
He can't even say...

1439
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:23,880
It is?

1440
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:27,260
As of the last time I tried it, I could squeeze it together and it would go,

1441
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:28,140
Oh, no!

1442
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:32,980
But I guess it finally gave up the ghost.

1443
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,400
The ghost of Mr. Bill.

1444
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:35,980
The ghost of Mr. Bill.

1445
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,340
God, let that never happen.

1446
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,000
Let him never haunt this house, Lord.

1447
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:44,540
Okay, now we're in the internet part of the show.

1448
00:59:44,980 --> 00:59:45,540
Ah.

1449
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:50,720
And that means we can tell you that Dave is destitute.

1450
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:56,660
I've been tempted to resort to destitution myself, but I honestly can't afford it.

1451
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:01,580
Dave needs help and there's a GoFundMe link.

1452
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,120
It is actually the most poorly written GoFundMe I've ever seen.

1453
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:07,440
But...

1454
01:00:09,460 --> 01:00:10,100
If...

1455
01:00:10,100 --> 01:00:10,360
If...

1456
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:18,540
If y'all want to help an old subgenius who got laid off and I think his unemployment ended

1457
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:20,880
and I don't know what the heck he's living on now.

1458
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,740
He didn't hardly have enough to keep his phone on.

1459
01:00:24,940 --> 01:00:27,320
I literally am going to have to send him like a...

1460
01:00:27,320 --> 01:00:33,200
I'll send him 30, 40 bucks every time he does a show.

1461
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:36,360
That's my form of charity.

1462
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:38,940
It's about the best we can do.

1463
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:39,600
Yeah.

1464
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:39,740
Yeah.

1465
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:46,200
And friends, if you want to live in the coolest house in Cleveland Heights, believe it or not,

1466
01:00:46,300 --> 01:00:47,320
it's still for sale.

1467
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:51,960
We had two buyers who were serious, but it turned out they were broke.

1468
01:00:52,120 --> 01:00:56,860
They didn't really have a job or something.

1469
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,360
No, they didn't have the funds that they thought that they had.

1470
01:00:59,420 --> 01:00:59,600
Yeah.

1471
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,180
Either party.

1472
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:03,660
Their eyes were bigger than their wallet.

1473
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:06,220
But that house is cheap, man.

1474
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:07,800
Oh, I could go ahead and say it.

1475
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:08,500
109.

1476
01:01:08,700 --> 01:01:09,380
It's now...

1477
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,120
It went for...

1478
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:12,540
Okay, we bought it for...

1479
01:01:13,060 --> 01:01:13,920
I don't even want to say it.

1480
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,320
It's just too shameful and embarrassing.

1481
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:16,800
It was so much more.

1482
01:01:17,180 --> 01:01:21,560
But we dropped the price down to 120, then to 112.

1483
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:23,980
Now it's at 109.

1484
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:27,200
1-0-9-0-0-0.

1485
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:28,000
Yes.

1486
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:31,560
And yeah, I just...

1487
01:01:31,560 --> 01:01:32,180
It's fabulous.

1488
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:35,440
It's a classic old house.

1489
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:39,480
It looks brand new because we sunk 12,000 bucks in repairs.

1490
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,980
And clean up into it.

1491
01:01:41,020 --> 01:01:43,760
Princess, we worked on it for the whole year I was away.

1492
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:54,860
It's next to a grocery store, the post office, a whole little mall, and schools and churches.

1493
01:01:55,240 --> 01:02:00,700
And it's a beautiful park-like neighborhood with lots of nice people.

1494
01:02:02,140 --> 01:02:07,800
You know, if Reverend Cosmack were here, he could have this thing running just by looking at it.

1495
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:08,260
Probably.

1496
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:08,560
Probably.

1497
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:10,080
He'd just look at it right and it would work.

1498
01:02:11,120 --> 01:02:16,580
Well, he's the one who has built modern day...

1499
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:19,620
God darn it.

1500
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:20,640
I remember Cosmack.

1501
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,280
He's the one that had that...

1502
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:24,620
Yeah, he makes homemade synthesizers and stuff.

1503
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:27,520
He deliberately uses the most ancient gear.

1504
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,300
He uses a classic Mac and is able to get...

1505
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:34,320
I mean, that's practically a child's toy.

1506
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:38,140
And he was able to do all kinds of magic tricks with it just for fun.

1507
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:38,720
Mm-hmm.

1508
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:40,600
Just because he's a subgenius.

1509
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:47,080
You know, subgeniuses will do things that seem pointless but amaze everyone because, first off, why would they do it?

1510
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,860
But the fact that they did is just amazing.

1511
01:02:49,100 --> 01:02:49,640
Mm-hmm.

1512
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:51,620
So that's...

1513
01:02:51,620 --> 01:02:54,920
He had a white plastic mannequin that he had lighting up from the inside.

1514
01:02:55,220 --> 01:03:00,620
And I was so jealous because I had a white plastic mannequin once, but I never made it light up from the inside.

1515
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:02,060
It was probably the same one.

1516
01:03:02,140 --> 01:03:03,740
And he was probably the guy that stole it.

1517
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:04,700
No, I don't think so.

1518
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:06,480
Missing at a devival.

1519
01:03:06,680 --> 01:03:07,620
Oh, you forget.

1520
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:10,320
The main thing about his mannequin is it talks to you.

1521
01:03:10,380 --> 01:03:11,920
And its nipples light up.

1522
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:14,240
Most mannequins don't even have nipples.

1523
01:03:14,360 --> 01:03:17,440
This one had light-up nipples, and it would talk back to you.

1524
01:03:17,520 --> 01:03:17,860
Yes.

1525
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:19,200
With AI.

1526
01:03:19,620 --> 01:03:20,060
Yeah.

1527
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:20,720
Talk back.

1528
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:21,300
Yeah.

1529
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:28,680
And it was probably an AI made with really old transistors from Japanese radios and stuff from the 50s.

1530
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:31,380
Because that's about all he wants to work with.

1531
01:03:32,480 --> 01:03:34,060
Even if he's a young guy, too.

1532
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:34,460
Yeah.

1533
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:36,260
So, yeah.

1534
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:37,000
It's a good figure.

1535
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:37,600
Yeah.

1536
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:37,600


1537
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:37,600


1538
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:42,360
You know, it's like when the Horizon Zero Dawn world comes, he'll be the guy that takes

1539
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:45,040
apart the robot monsters and, you know, makes weapons.

1540
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:45,580
Yep.

1541
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,240
And titties.

1542
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:50,920
Little mannequins with titties on them.

1543
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:55,860
No head, and yet they can talk to you from a speaker in their chest.

1544
01:03:57,440 --> 01:03:57,880
Huh.

1545
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:58,420
Huh.

1546
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:00,680
Okay, friends.

1547
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:01,580
We're going to sign off.

1548
01:04:01,660 --> 01:04:02,260
Oh, we need...

1549
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:03,540
What about money for us?

1550
01:04:04,260 --> 01:04:05,440
Church is subgenius.

1551
01:04:05,540 --> 01:04:07,600
If you're not a subgenius minister...

1552
01:04:07,620 --> 01:04:14,600
If you're not a pastor yet, you know, your whole life will have been wasted if, say, something terrible happens.

1553
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,200
You get a disease or something.

1554
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:19,360
You're not really saved.

1555
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:21,700
You don't have a chance of getting on the saucers.

1556
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:22,060
Right.

1557
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:29,080
Unless some descendant decides to save you post-mortem, which you can do.

1558
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,340
Think about your sweet old grandpa and grandma.

1559
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,580
Don't you want to see them get on the saucers?

1560
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:36,320
Buy them a membership pack.

1561
01:04:36,920 --> 01:04:37,600
I mean...

1562
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:41,980
I mean, I know they're dead, but they can still be saved if it's in their name.

1563
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:42,320
Right.

1564
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:44,740
The exes will know their address.

1565
01:04:45,220 --> 01:04:47,120
Their Akashic address.

1566
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:49,640
Because the exes can find dead people.

1567
01:04:49,780 --> 01:04:50,220
Mm-hmm.

1568
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:53,300
And live people and make them dead.

1569
01:04:54,040 --> 01:04:55,160
And vice versa.

1570
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:56,920
Find dead people and make them live again.

1571
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:57,740
Easy peasy.

1572
01:04:57,740 --> 01:04:59,420
But it's never quite the same.

1573
01:04:59,560 --> 01:05:03,780
A little bit like that pet cemetery or that mannequin that talks to you.

1574
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,100
Uh-huh.

1575
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:06,080
Not quite the same.

1576
01:05:07,620 --> 01:05:15,240
Oh, and the way to do that is to spend that credit card money that you don't need anymore

1577
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:17,400
at subgenius.com.

1578
01:05:17,600 --> 01:05:22,760
The first sentence you see on that says, become an ordained minister.

1579
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:27,440
It's only $35 plus about $5 postage because it's a big package.

1580
01:05:27,540 --> 01:05:27,820
Mm-hmm.

1581
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:29,260
It's got everything you need.

1582
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:36,000
Bob pins, Bob bumper stickers, a minister's card, instructions on how to actually really

1583
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:36,900
be a minister.

1584
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:37,300
Right.

1585
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:37,600
Right.

1586
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:37,600


1587
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:37,600


1588
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:37,600


1589
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:37,600


1590
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:37,600


1591
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:37,600


1592
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:37,600


1593
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:37,600


1594
01:05:37,620 --> 01:05:37,780
For real.

1595
01:05:41,120 --> 01:05:42,000
Frameable documents.

1596
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,020
Oh, tons of frameable documents.

1597
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:45,440
It's sterable art.

1598
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:46,420
Yes.

1599
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:52,700
Well, the Tree of Knowledge by Paul Mavridis and yours truly is included in it.

1600
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:53,020
Mm-hmm.

1601
01:05:53,080 --> 01:05:57,300
It used to be the inside cover of the Book of the Subgenius, but they don't print on

1602
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,480
the inside cover anymore.

1603
01:05:59,020 --> 01:06:02,420
So the only way you get that is to join up.

1604
01:06:02,600 --> 01:06:05,640
And it is the most sterable piece of art we have.

1605
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:06,440
It sure is.

1606
01:06:06,680 --> 01:06:07,000
It sure is.

1607
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,000


1608
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:07,220
It sure is.

1609
01:06:07,220 --> 01:06:07,500
It sure is.

1610
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:07,600


1611
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:07,600


1612
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:07,600


1613
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:07,600


1614
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:07,600


1615
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:07,600


1616
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:07,600


1617
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:07,600


1618
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:07,600


1619
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:07,600


1620
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:07,600


1621
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:07,840
It's a pamphlet.

1622
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:12,120
Subgenius pamphlet number one and number two, each of which is 16 pages long, which doesn't

1623
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:18,780
sound like much, but there's so much type that's so small, even with the pictures, if

1624
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:21,940
you're me, you kind of need a magnifying glass.

1625
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:22,860
It's quite dense.

1626
01:06:22,900 --> 01:06:25,280
A youthful person wouldn't have any trouble.

1627
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:25,580
No.

1628
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:32,440
I used to kind of chuckle when these old folks would go, why do you make your prints so damn

1629
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:32,860
small?

1630
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:34,560
I can barely read that.

1631
01:06:34,680 --> 01:06:35,500
It's like eight point.

1632
01:06:35,580 --> 01:06:36,420
That's normal.

1633
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:37,240
It's like newspaper.

1634
01:06:37,240 --> 01:06:37,740
Paper print.

1635
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,400
Well, now I know exactly what they mean.

1636
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,040
It's a bit on the small side now.

1637
01:06:44,140 --> 01:06:44,460
Yes.

1638
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:47,120
It's getting, things are getting dim, Princess Sweet.

1639
01:06:47,300 --> 01:06:47,820
No.

1640
01:06:47,880 --> 01:06:48,760
It's getting dark.

1641
01:06:49,060 --> 01:06:50,960
I can't hear you so well anymore.

1642
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,220
It's, everything's fading away.

1643
01:07:02,660 --> 01:07:05,700
Reverend Stang, that was in very bad taste.

1644
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:06,320
I'm sorry.

1645
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:06,900
I'm sorry.

1646
01:07:06,900 --> 01:07:07,820
Don't die on the air, please.

1647
01:07:25,920 --> 01:07:29,960
Well, folks, apparently Reverend Stang has given up the ghost.

1648
01:07:30,060 --> 01:07:33,280
I don't see him waking up anytime soon.

1649
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:34,680
There's no sign of life.

1650
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:36,200
So, uh,

1651
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:46,080
I guess that's it from the subgenius radio ministry for the month of April 2020.

1652
01:07:47,560 --> 01:07:50,340
Reverend Stang seems to have checked out.

1653
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:54,140
Come on, Reverend Stang, come back, please.

1654
01:07:54,340 --> 01:07:55,200
Come on, come on.

1655
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:57,520
Well, now I know what Princess Wheel will do if I'm croaked.

1656
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:59,280
She'll laugh and laugh and laugh.

1657
01:07:59,860 --> 01:08:01,180
Take it real lightly.

1658
01:08:02,600 --> 01:08:03,860
Now we know.
