00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:15,900
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry, Hour of Slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

2
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:27,300
The subgenius Hour of Slack that you are about to listen to is specially designed only to be played on radio station

3
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:31,300
and only in the city of...

4
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:44,640
Yes, friends, we are busting subgenius tiny to catch a breath and stay up with the changing events of the end times

5
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:56,740
as the conspiracy pulls out all stops to solidify their liquidation of this planet Earth before we get to do it.

6
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,280
Let's do it.

7
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:05,160
Dobbs foretold it all. No one heeds the old prophet of doom, however, until it's too late.

8
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:15,460
He prophesied that come the year 2001, at the plane of Armageddon, the army of the West and the army of the East

9
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,400
would come together in a great confabulation of lies.

10
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,960
Well, this would be where the planes of Armageddon are located now, aren't they?

11
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:26,520
They're located somewhere in Chaldea, as they call it in modern-day Iraq.

12
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,220
The Basque.

13
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:29,100
Down by the armpit of Megiddo.

14
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,780
Oh, the armpit of Megiddo.

15
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:34,580
Is that actually something you have to learn by slice or by rope?

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,660
Can you, like, take it off, like, more than one night?

17
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,740
It all goes back to those Sumerian tablets that were lost.

18
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,680
We always wanted to be good Sumerians and...

19
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:46,160
You could just get tablet number 17 to fill in the blank and have the formula.

20
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,920
Get rid of the program. That one worked the best.

21
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:52,720
You take one Sumerian tablet and a half an hour later the world disappears.

22
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,720
In a mushroom soup.

23
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,140
Only we could find...

24
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:05,740
The fifth element and the sixth finger and the fourth dimension and the seventh heaven and the eighth chicken.

25
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,160
I'm feeling psychically empty.

26
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,640
I'm feeling necronomicus.

27
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:17,180
I just take one of these little Sumerian tablets and I'm good to go for the next 5,000 years.

28
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,620
Do you remember when Noah stepped off the boat?

29
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:26,460
He was tired, he was hungry, and a third foot had grown where his third eye had been.

30
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:30,780
But one Sumerian tablet later and he was ready for sphinx-tus.

31
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,080
Build an ark.

32
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:34,000
Build it quick.

33
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:38,940
Keep away the soapshudge and flakes and other anthracic vehicles.

34
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,160
I actually had that album when I was a kid.

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,240
What?

36
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,600
Bill Cosby album.

37
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:46,480
Noah?

38
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,520
Is he God?

39
00:02:49,740 --> 00:02:50,880
God was getting...

40
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:55,820
Okay, Noah, you know, it's like putting the...

41
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:56,340
Noah was...

42
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,520
God was the pudding and God was like the pudding.

43
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:06,060
God is the pudding in some arcane way that we can't decipher anymore than we can eat those Sumerian tablets.

44
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,260
I'm going to eat these little M&M's that Chaz put out.

45
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,120
That's all the holy tablets I need.

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,000
Sing, brother.

47
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,920
It says M or W.

48
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,800
What does sing, brother?

49
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,720
I want you to know before we all blow.

50
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:26,800
They're killing themselves.

51
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,900
Coming in on a wing and a prayer.

52
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:32,560
That's right.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,820
Coming in on a wing and a prayer.

54
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:39,500
Live from WCS Bay, the height of the Rhodes Tower in beautiful Cleveland, Ohio.

55
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,400
Though there's one motor gone, we'll just keep it on.

56
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,180
Coming in on a wing and a prayer.

57
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,980
Tonight, the lovely Mr. Chaz Smith singing On a Wing and a Prayer.

58
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,920
With moving words by...

59
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:58,220
And a song by...

60
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:04,240
He seems to...

61
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,780
Oh, well, fine to sing a hymn.

62
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,980
We'll be right back after these words from Sumerian tablets for the psychically confused.

63
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,240
Don't forget, folks.

64
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,840
Don't forget to buy those war bonds.

65
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,720
What you're doing to me.

66
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,440
Support freedom.

67
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:20,500
I would like to remind our fellow citizens...

68
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:24,500
And all you Democrats, don't you say anything now about George because you can't.

69
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,200
I hate...

70
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:26,920
That guy.

71
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:30,460
You can't say anything bad about it, right, wingers?

72
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:31,080
Now, right?

73
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:33,680
You'll be all anti-American.

74
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,960
We got your asses this time.

75
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,280
We'll do whatever the hell we want.

76
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,380
We shall build a mighty state of steel and armor.

77
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,000
There shall be tanks where there once were sea buses.

78
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,920
And in the world below us,

79
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,320
growing like a huge behemoth inside the bowels of the...

80
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,320
There shall be more rockets and sprockets than man can use.

81
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,940
So we'll just take one of these here

82
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,000
and place it gently on your foreskin.

83
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:08,620
Yes.

84
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,100
Something has happened in the butter cake room.

85
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,880
It tickles.

86
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,040
Oh, look, the president's crying.

87
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,260
Hello?

88
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:15,860
Hello?

89
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,300
What?

90
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,220
Make that two spotted lizards have left the grassy knoll.

91
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,120
Hello?

92
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,820
I repeat.

93
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,280
Two grassy lizards have left the knoll.

94
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,020
Sorry about that.

95
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:36,260
We'd like to resume our interspecial service here tonight.

96
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,940
We know you're having hard times on planet Earth.

97
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,120
Your religions are confusing to us, to say the least.

98
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,740
We'd like to help you.

99
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,700
And we will try to help you.

100
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,340
But first you must explain yourselves.

101
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:55,400
First you must...

102
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:56,760
Sleep.

103
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,500
We look into your dreams.

104
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,440
Sleep.

105
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,900
What makes mankind?

106
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,160
Sleep.

107
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:06,320
What makes you tick?

108
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,200
Happy.

109
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,080
Sleep.

110
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,040
I want to get a little gun, a toy gun,

111
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,520
and I want to go and stab my sister in the butt.

112
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,340
Uh-oh.

113
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,700
Here comes the old man with a belt.

114
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,060
If you boys join the army today,

115
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,260
you won't have to join any dance.

116
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,180
I'm not going to join the armed army tomorrow.

117
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,640
That's the word for me, Senator Blueguts,

118
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:33,320
and I promise you a place in heaven or hell wherever we get first.

119
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,880
You see, once we destroy all the other armies, then we can disarm.

120
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:40,640
It can be a multi-lateral disarmament.

121
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,620
We can just lay our weapons in and it'll be world peace.

122
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:44,600
All we have to do is destroy all the other armies first.

123
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:49,420
I can build a bomb that will out-blow up any bomb ever bombed.

124
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,620
I can make a bomb that will not only blow up this quadrant of the universe,

125
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,320
but that will send ripples throughout the entire time.

126
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:56,320


127
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:59,500
It'll be the bomb to end all bombs.

128
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:00,940
Oh, here it comes now!

129
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,720
Wow, look at the color.

130
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,180
It's beautiful.

131
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:08,460
It's beautiful, man, it's beautiful!

132
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:12,380
I don't know when, but I know when.

133
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:14,980
That's not funny.

134
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,120
All floating entities with red shoes

135
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,120
clip your foreskin three times like this.

136
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,980
Oops, sorry.

137
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:32,280
Rollin' foreskin like this.

138
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,600
And now you may go where you will in the cosmos.

139
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,720
Hey, careful with my foreskin there, Dad.

140
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:40,440
Am I?

141
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,200
Oh, is that yours, foreskin?

142
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:47,040
You were knocking it right where it's rusted.

143
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,260
Man, this body train...

144
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,200
What does this button do?

145
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:50,720
Ouch, ouch!

146
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:52,120
You're hurting us all, Chaz!

147
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,540
You're hurting us all, man.

148
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,380
Oh, no, wait, do that again.

149
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,760
This is one of those secret government black box buttons right here.

150
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,240
You know, man, we're all connected together by that black box.

151
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:04,800
It's a government box, so I guess not one of us can push the wrong button.

152
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,540
Unfortunately, we all feel the same thing.

153
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,860
Who's got the suitcase?

154
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,820
I don't know, did you?

155
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,520
I thought you had the suitcase.

156
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,420
I thought you had the suitcase.

157
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,340
I've got the suitcase.

158
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,180
I've been driving.

159
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,220
I've got the keys, but...

160
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,760
I thought it was sitting under the seat right here.

161
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,000
I don't know, man.

162
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,620
Ah, damn it.

163
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:22,860
Dave, what did you do with the suitcase?

164
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,320
I can't find it around here anywhere, man.

165
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,040
You left it at that filling station, didn't you?

166
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:27,660
Dave, that's the nuclear suitcase.

167
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,540
Did you leave it back there when you went to the bathroom?

168
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,560
This room seems to be hollow, baby.

169
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,420
At that filling station?

170
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:35,780
Dave...

171
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:37,480
No, man, there's no corners in here.

172
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,140
We're like in a little egg thing.

173
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,060
Yeah, it's a car.

174
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:44,320
There's 17 nuclear submarines, and if they don't get word...

175
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,420
I know.

176
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,320
...using that box...

177
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,520
I know.

178
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,660
...they're gonna launch everything they got.

179
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,080
Ouch.

180
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,360
Move, move, X-Lacks.

181
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,280
Hey, look, man.

182
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,300
It's floating in the air.

183
00:08:55,300 --> 00:08:56,700
Look, it's above our heads.

184
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,860
It's been floating there for the last...

185
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:00,600
How did you get in the Army, boy?

186
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:01,680
Look at that, man.

187
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,400
It's floating in the air right above us.

188
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:08,460
That's just one of those pipes in the sky that follows us around.

189
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:08,800
No, man.

190
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,700
Don't worry about that.

191
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,060
Those are...

192
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,040
It's the suitcase.

193
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:11,440
...from the fire.

194
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,420
I'm gonna try and grab it.

195
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,280
You guys are nuts, man.

196
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,020
That looks more like the suitcase than anything I've ever seen since we've been in here for

197
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:18,760
the last two months.

198
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,600
We'll be right back when Lonesome Cowboy Dave joins the Army.

199
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,880
Our first stop.

200
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,320
The gay way to heaven that spins you skyward on the great space wheel.

201
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:34,860
The fabulous gay way where you guide your own rocket and taxi to tomorrow.

202
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,360
Hey.

203
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:40,400
This is exciting, guys.

204
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:41,400
Cool haircuts.

205
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Hey, get your hand off my knee, man.

206
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,360
Hey, man.

207
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:46,600
This ain't part of training.

208
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:47,160
You're supposed to get...

209
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,800
You gotta run for tomorrow, boy.

210
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:49,560
What the hell are you doing?

211
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,740
Hey, it's okay.

212
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,000
This is the gay way, man.

213
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,300
Let me out of this bush.

214
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,140
...kind of love.

215
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,840
I joined the Army to help save the world.

216
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,420
Come on, Dave.

217
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:56,980
It's okay.

218
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:57,960
Help.

219
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:58,200
Help.

220
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:58,200


221
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,160
He's so on time, man.

222
00:09:59,460 --> 00:09:59,840
Help.

223
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,140
Help.

224
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,280
Come on.

225
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,200
It'll feel good.

226
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:01,540
Help.

227
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,660
Let me out of here.

228
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:03,780
You're like the gay way.

229
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,600
Come on.

230
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,500
It'll feel good.

231
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,900
Oh, he's resisting.

232
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,940
It only hurts for a little while.

233
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,200
Look into the pipe, Dave.

234
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:12,880
Look deep into the pipe.

235
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,580
Look into the pipe.

236
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,240
You'll be saved by your own mind.

237
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,900
Just keep focusing there.

238
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,980
Don't think about that.

239
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:21,840
You will be a good soldier, Dave.

240
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,120
I feel like Tanner and Spober trying to figure out what's going on.

241
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,120


242
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,120


243
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,040
Don't think about it.

244
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,100
Private Lone Cow.

245
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,000
Out the window.

246
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:31,440
You will be a good soldier, Coyote.

247
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,460
Yes.

248
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:36,340
You're going to be processed now into the U.S. Army.

249
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,320
Gee, hi, Dave.

250
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,160
Look, it worked.

251
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:47,740
Who came up with this program for him this time?

252
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:51,020
He's ready to have one of them lonesome cowboy jihads.

253
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,860
This is a damn surreal program.

254
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,060
This is better than someone could dream.

255
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,020
His mind's fritzing.

256
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,960
He's like, hey, look.

257
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,800
Oh, no.

258
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,660
That's my mind on the table.

259
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:03,580
I love it when they slide out.

260
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:07,280
So, how long ago was it that Dave had the snow crash?

261
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,180
We have no more snow crab tonight, Monsieur.

262
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,280
What difference does it make?

263
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,540
We have lobster tails.

264
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,380
I mean, well, he's the best sort of ...

265
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,300
Lobster feet.

266
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,340
You can observe this one for a long time.

267
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,340
We have the UN observers under glass.

268
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:24,100
He interfaces with the machinery a lot.

269
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,100


270
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,100


271
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,100


272
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,100


273
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,100


274
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,100


275
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,100


276
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,100


277
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,100


278
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,680
He's a lot better since his snow crash.

279
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,660
We also have the snow crabs with UN machinery under the grass.

280
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,220
It's like when it was all booted up at the same ... He was booted up, rebooted at the

281
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:34,760
same time.

282
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:40,580
We also have the Soviet Army chorus singing the Grassy Knolls song in the key of E-flat.

283
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:45,120
Lonesome Cowboy Dave is the metaverse.

284
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,060
I keep on thinking about it.

285
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,800
The canyons of Lonesome Cowboy Dave's mind.

286
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,100
A babbling idiot metaverse.

287
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,280
I don't want to join the Soviet Army.

288
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,500
A blind babbling god in his own universe.

289
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,200
I don't want to go to Afghanistan in 1981 as a bad trip.

290
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:05,780
He's creating the reality as he imagines it in this horrible nightmare world.

291
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:07,820
And you can toggle in.

292
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:09,260
Soldier Dave.

293
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,060
For only 295 minutes.

294
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:11,700
Soldier Dave.

295
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,160
Soldier Dave, shoulder your weapon, tovarish Dave.

296
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,120
You can see incredible scientific wonders.

297
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,220
Who the hell are you?

298
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,360
Roam the galaxies in a realistic recreation of rocket life.

299
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,160
I am the voice of your arms.

300
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,200
It's the world of ...

301
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,040
It seems totally real to Dave.

302
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,120
...turning in the dark.

303
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:28,740
And to you, if you want to log in too.

304
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,540
That's right, friends.

305
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,300
www.subgenius.com

306
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,080
That's right, friends.

307
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:40,620
And now more than ever during these times of elemental and primordial crisis here in the United Snakes of America,

308
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,060
we ask those of you who listen out there with tinny little ears and huge jaws

309
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:51,800
to think of us here with tinny little jaws and huge ears,

310
00:12:51,800 --> 00:13:00,540
demanding a new erection for a new penetration into the subsov...

311
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,980
Plasma above.

312
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,220
The plasma above.

313
00:13:07,020 --> 00:13:08,260
The plasma Bob.

314
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:09,080
It's alive.

315
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,660
What ever happened to the plasma Bob?

316
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:13,320
Well, he ...

317
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,440
He kind of ran off down the drain.

318
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,100
He got drunk first.

319
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,680
And then he got thrown out of the bar and he tried to get a cab,

320
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:21,780
but I guess somebody ran over him.

321
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:21,960
And then he got thrown out of the bar and he tried to get a cab,

322
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:21,960


323
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:25,680
The plasma Bob followed the path of least resistance,

324
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,240
which happened to be downhill.

325
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:31,320
Which happened to be towards the drain in the middle of the garage.

326
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:31,800


327
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,300
There he went.

328
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:35,640
The master of slack.

329
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,260
So slack that he just...

330
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,100
After they healed off Bob's rubber leg.

331
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:48,260
Friend, you too could just be a dribbling fool if you had true slack,

332
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,060
If you truly could achieve...

333
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,000
the nothingness of non-achievingness.

334
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:01,060
Dr. Piltstone, these flying monkeys are going to be the ruination of mankind rather than salvation.

335
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:02,240
You could be like this man Dave.

336
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,200
Just think of what you're doing.

337
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:09,820
Get your finger off the genetic code and back in your own rectum where it's belonged all along.

338
00:14:10,080 --> 00:14:11,940
And stop playing with my golf cubs.

339
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:13,340
I'm trying to look out the windex.

340
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:16,720
Who could have dozens of winged...

341
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,500
You laugh at him now that he's sitting there in a wheelchair...

342
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:18,940
Just like him.

343
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:20,820
...with his...

344
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:22,080
head all shaved and a...

345
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:25,920
huge muscle-like thing persprouting from his ears.

346
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,380
But you didn't laugh at him last...

347
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:31,760
last week when he promised you a new heart.

348
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:34,980
Shut up you bitch.

349
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,060
It's later than...

350
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,400
you...

351
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:39,940
think.

352
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,160
Later...

353
00:14:44,060 --> 00:14:44,740
than...

354
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,440
you...

355
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,800
think.

356
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:48,840
You...

357
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:49,600
think.

358
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,920
You...

359
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,500
think.

360
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,720
But we are not men.

361
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:01,980
You are the cattle and we are the keepers.

362
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,380
What?

363
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:13,800
You raise the cattle for life and we for centuries have raised such as you and our world for life.

364
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:20,180
But now as I told you, our world has grown too old.

365
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,180
And too cold.

366
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:27,720
The herds of you die and we grow hungry.

367
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:36,280
That is why I am here we need new cattle.

368
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:40,600
Here there are so many of you.

369
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,300
First ...

370
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:43,680
Eric...

371
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,060
Doubt,

372
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,060


373
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,500
Yearman...

374
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:47,020
By attracted by his life here youchez,

375
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,020


376
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,020


377
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,020


378
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,020


379
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,920
It spoke to me.

380
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,160
Russell gave me the internet.

381
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,160


382
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,160


383
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,160


384
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,160


385
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:50,720
get out of here.

386
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,260
Woman.

387
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,600
No, no. Stop it.

388
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:57,340
Don't look at me.

389
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,560
Stop it.

390
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,360
Don't look at me.

391
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,760
Don't listen to him, Diane.

392
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,080
You like talk like that?

393
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
No, no. Don't move, Diane.

394
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:09,160
Stay where you are. Stay right there.

395
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:11,100
You hear only

396
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,860
the woman.

397
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,200
No, you cannot talk like that.

398
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:15,900
No, Diane.

399
00:16:17,460 --> 00:16:18,800
You must be trapped.

400
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,880
You must be kept alone.

401
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,840
Don't look at me.

402
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,840
In the basement of a mystic stone

403
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,420
perhaps 300 or 100 feet high.

404
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:29,640
Surrounded by

405
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,920
more than one youngster.

406
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,280
And people

407
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:34,220
with an extra appendage.

408
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,660
You must be saved for the last moment.

409
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,760
Diane, I beg of you.

410
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,560
Don't go closer to it.

411
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,340
No, sir.

412
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,340
No, sir.

413
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:43,520
Daddy?

414
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:45,500
I hate you.

415
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,040
We were all like cows.

416
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,300
We had big mammary cows.

417
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,600
Some outer space men were farming us

418
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,680
like cattle, like animals.

419
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:59,440
Isn't that the strangest dream?

420
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,240
Did you imagine?

421
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,180
I've got to find a way.

422
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,940
I cannot.

423
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,900
This isn't sorry.

424
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:06,900
I'm dying.

425
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:08,520
I'm coming to you.

426
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:10,400
Your take.

427
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,720
The first left.

428
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:13,320
The next left.

429
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:17,540
Thank you.

430
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:17,660
Thank you.

431
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:17,880
Thank you.

432
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:18,020


433
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,040
Your blessing, my son.

434
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,180
Thank you.

435
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,300
Thank you, Father.

436
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,220
For taking our confession.

437
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,380
Thank you, Father.

438
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,300
Father.

439
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:31,120
Bob finally called in.

440
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,900
Finally called in.

441
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,620
Thank you, Bob.

442
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,960
You proved you were there.

443
00:17:37,080 --> 00:17:38,600
My faith in trouble.

444
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,140
But I know that was you.

445
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,020
But Father.

446
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,220
Dad, Bob.

447
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,820
But Father.

448
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,300
Oh, great progenitor.

449
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:47,180
The sixth direction.

450
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,000
North side.

451
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:48,440
South east.

452
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,160
South west.

453
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:49,580
South east.

454
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,420
South west.

455
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:50,640


456
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:50,680
South west.

457
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:50,940
South west.

458
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,340
Anything you want, Bob.

459
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,000
Of course.

460
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:53,420
Of course.

461
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,120
I'm sorry, Father, for I have sinned.

462
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:56,620
But don't forget, such as you.

463
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,240
It's been three weeks since my last confession.

464
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:02,960
You can't forget the sacraments.

465
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:06,800
Father, in that three weeks I walked on down the hall.

466
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:12,460
I took a vase from the ancient gallery and I walked on down the hall.

467
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,300
And I paid a visit to my brother.

468
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:17,260
And then I paid a visit to my sister.

469
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,560
And I said, well, son, there are many people doing this.

470
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:23,340
And I said, well, you said what, son?

471
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,340
And I said, I want to kill you.

472
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:27,780
So I killed him.

473
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,420
And I said, mother.

474
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,900
And she had on this kind of, like, nice little lingerie thingy.

475
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,720
You know, she got it ambi-owned or something.

476
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:41,220
And I said, Mom, like, dig it, you know?

477
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,880
So that's how I ended up on the show.

478
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:52,340
Well, son, I have to tell you first and foremost that you're not really on the show.

479
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,480
You are the show itself.

480
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,700
So for your penance, I suggest you do Three Hill Fathers and Five R Minkies.

481
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,220
And also a couple of Pastilles Crebes for the old cabbage parts down there, way, way down there.

482
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:13,360
And another thing to get you going is not to forget the, um, what was it now?

483
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,020
I get these books.

484
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:15,680
There's so many books.

485
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,220
I have to go.

486
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,240
The Mountain Doves.

487
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:34,760
It's said that when Mohammed could not come to the mountain, he asked, or asked, asked the mountain if it would kindly like to visit him.

488
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,680
No, but that had nothing to do with that.

489
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,700
It was Jaguar night.

490
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,480
It was a man-eater night.

491
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:40,500
Uh-oh.

492
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,000
That was spooky, man.

493
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,160
It was Jaguar night.

494
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:43,560
Yeah.

495
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,740
And, uh, uh.

496
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,180
Ubu Jaguar.

497
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:47,900
No, it wasn't Ubu Jaguar.

498
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,180
No, that's the Popo Vu.

499
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:49,740
Uh, Jaguar.

500
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,020
Yeah.

501
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,580
Well, that's the real book.

502
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:57,080
I don't know why these people over in Middle East and all that think they got the Bible and Turan and all this stuff.

503
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,460
That's not the real book.

504
00:19:58,600 --> 00:19:59,840
That ain't how it really happened.

505
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,200
You gotta read the Popo Vu to find out how it all really happened.

506
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:07,540
The Popo Vu emerged from the clouds and landed in ink on the Mayan scribes.

507
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,500
These people are arguing about the dumbest stuff now.

508
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,680
Well, they all believe in the same God.

509
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:11,900
They're all wrong.

510
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,140
You know, they all believe in the same God.

511
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,540
We gotta believe in a different God.

512
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,160
Look, it was trial and error, trial and error, trial and error.

513
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,580
One time they tried to make men and they popped out trees.

514
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,180
Right, trees.

515
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:24,800
Yeah, one time they tried to make men and goats came out.

516
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:25,780
You know, that wasn't quite right.

517
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:26,360
That is true.

518
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,660
God was, he tried hard.

519
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,780
That was God's, you know, all the different Jaguars.

520
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:31,560
Perseverance is one of his finer qualities.

521
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,300
Stick with it, ish, nish, nish, nish, nish, nish, nish.

522
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:36,760
So, you know, and the Jaguar twins, too.

523
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:37,880
What about them?

524
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,500
You know, they had a lot to do with all that creation stuff and everything.

525
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:40,780
Oh, of course.

526
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,400
They were the ones around that kind of like, they were the guys on the ground.

527
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,520
They were the man on the stone.

528
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,340
They were the men on the street.

529
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,540
The Jaguar twins.

530
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,820
The men on the street.

531
00:20:47,900 --> 00:20:49,680
They were the twins with the scissors of sight.

532
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:54,020
You mean a couple cats with green eyes were calling in the shots for the Lord Almighty?

533
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,240
There was no one Lord Almighty.

534
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,360
There isn't.

535
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:01,440
It's, you know, you got to read the Popol Vuh, folks.

536
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,840
You got to understand what the real word of the Lord is.

537
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:08,500
If you read the Popol Vuh, at least you get a little better understanding of it.

538
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:12,620
Hey, to all you monotheists out there, don't worry about whether it's unity or the twins.

539
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,860
People don't even know what that is.

540
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:17,380
You can write it down in whatever, your borders or whatever bookstore you go to.

541
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,000
Get to, go to the, I don't even know where you find it.

542
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,340
I don't know.

543
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,000
Maybe they got some anthropology section, something like that.

544
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,280
Oh, Chaz is a preacher now.

545
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:25,560
Right.

546
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,080
He goes to the anthropology section.

547
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:27,280


548
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:27,840
He looks at the big, brushed women.

549
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,880
I just want to see more people taking-

550
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,560
That don't wear shirts in those cultures.

551
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:35,560
Manta ray stinger barbs and shoving them through their penises and their tongues.

552
00:21:36,060 --> 00:21:39,080
And if they did that, I think they'd understand things a little bit better.

553
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:40,560
Yeah.

554
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:42,740
It brings a tear to my eye, I think.

555
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,560
And we should be-

556
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:43,980
Yeah.

557
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:49,640
Why aren't we using the 20-story building to drag people to the top and cut their hearts

558
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,980
out and throw them down to the people who are hungry?

559
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:52,540
That's right.

560
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:57,100
We could feed a lot of the starving people in the world by having public sacrifices.

561
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,320
The Aztecs had the damn right idea now.

562
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,280
That's an old time religion.

563
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,640
Yeah, that's an old time.

564
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,220
Old time American religion.

565
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,460
Old time religion.

566
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:05,920
Yeah.

567
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:09,360
Cut their damn heart out and throw them down the hill for the people who are starving because

568
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,900
they can't grow anything anymore in the desert.

569
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,520
Or we could have a gladiatorial contest in Jupiter's universe.

570
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,840
Or, you know, Jove Zeus's name.

571
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:16,240
With a ball.

572
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,400
And whoever wins, that means God won and so are we.

573
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:18,600
It's their heads locked off.

574
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:18,680
Yeah.

575
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,120
Then they play ball with your head.

576
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:20,420
Yeah.

577
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,380
Well, they do that there, too.

578
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:22,200
Yeah.

579
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,400
They have those ball games there, too.

580
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,520
Sometimes they cut their toenails if they win, though.

581
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:25,900
Yeah.

582
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:27,760
You get the full manicure treatment.

583
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,580
You get the haircut.

584
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,940
You get a pair of those special sandals.

585
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:34,580
But the good old time American religion came with the manta ray barbs stuck through the

586
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,940
penises and the tongues now by the leaders.

587
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,860
That was the leaders.

588
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,800
And so-

589
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,540
That would be like President Bush and-

590
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,160
God came to the Americas.

591
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,240
Bin Laden getting together in a room.

592
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:44,500
Yeah.

593
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:49,220
And with big huge ugly things to stick through their penises and their tongues and the man

594
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,280
who could bleed the most and still stand up.

595
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:53,700
Who do you think would cry Uncle Bin Laden first?

596
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,260
Who do you think would cry first?

597
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:55,820
George?

598
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:56,940
Jaguar God.

599
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,100
Oh, mankind, I weep for you.

600
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:01,840
My children are destroyed for lack of knowledge.

601
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:02,000
They're a mess.

602
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,680
Oh my God, they're a mess.

603
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,840
But who do you think would cry Uncle first?

604
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,820
Let's look at it honestly now.

605
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:12,360
Isn't it civilization itself that's evil?

606
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:13,820
Correctamundo!

607
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:14,160
Correctamundo!

608
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,000
No, civilization is-

609
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,300
Humans lived for-

610
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,580
I can only be sure with that.

611
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,300
We've been-

612
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,800
We would have no comic books without civilization.

613
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:23,760
We would have no rock and roll albums.

614
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:24,420
That's correct.

615
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:24,980
Well, okay.

616
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:29,900
We would have no 3D graphics programs for me to play with.

617
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,880
Well, I guess the trade off then is anthrax.

618
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,640
What a bleak attitude.

619
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,080
Plane's flying into the buildings.

620
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,940
Oh man, we're just the very bare beginnings of civilization.

621
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,200
Alla America.

622
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:41,720
Chasmio as well as-

623
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,580
Do you think it'll really survive though?

624
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,380
That's another question.

625
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,260
I'm not human species.

626
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:45,720
Oh, hello.

627
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:48,700
It has only been around for 100,000 years.

628
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,540
Hello, my friend.

629
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,600
I said open Sesame but can't gain access to the building.

630
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,100
Oh, we see what's going on.

631
00:23:57,180 --> 00:23:58,680
You said open Sesame.

632
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:03,860
We didn't gain access to the palace, to the power, to the tower.

633
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:05,280
DJA?

634
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,300
Yes.

635
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,700
We're afraid we're going to have to come down and assist you in your valiant efforts.

636
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:11,540
Okay, well then.

637
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,360
Thank you, my precious.

638
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,240
Thank you.

639
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:14,360
Thank you.

640
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,360


641
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,360


642
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,360


643
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,360


644
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,360


645
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,360


646
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,360


647
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,360


648
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,360


649
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,360


650
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,360


651
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,360


652
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,360


653
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,360


654
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:14,800
We'll get there soon.

655
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,860
Go to the first floor.

656
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,520
Go to the first floor now.

657
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,020
Go to the first floor of the palace.

658
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,880
Go to the first floor.

659
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,100
Ah, here comes the police officer.

660
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:22,880
Never mind.

661
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:23,480
Okay.

662
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:23,840
Thank you.

663
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,540
That's the night.

664
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:27,080
That's the black night.

665
00:24:27,180 --> 00:24:30,140
Funny how there's been more security around this building.

666
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:32,720
Oh, there's intense insecurity around this building lately.

667
00:24:32,920 --> 00:24:36,800
Well, there have been old people who've been wandering around the halls cursing in Aramaic

668
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,740
and other Sumerian languages.

669
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,860
I guess they didn't take their tablets.

670
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,300
And there have been lost children.

671
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:43,760
It's civilization itself.

672
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,340
Before the Civilization of the World.

673
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:44,340


674
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:44,340


675
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:44,340


676
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:44,340


677
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,980
Before the pyramids went up, there was no reason to get all people together.

678
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,820
Pink stink.

679
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:49,700
And the pyramids started civilization.

680
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,300
And that was only 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 years ago.

681
00:24:53,400 --> 00:25:00,900
The humans have been living the way they've been living with their brains, the way they've been a-braining for over 100,000 years now.

682
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:03,340
And civilization is only 7,000, maybe 10,000.

683
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:03,600
I'm afraid.

684
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:04,340
Put it at the maximum.

685
00:25:04,540 --> 00:25:04,940
10,000.

686
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,320
For 90,000 years.

687
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,040
They're homo sapiens.

688
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:11,700
90% of the time the humans have been homo sapiens standing upright, look at the sky and go stars.

689
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,420
That's cool.

690
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:12,980
Yeah, right.

691
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,260
Things like that.

692
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:18,500
And for 90% of the time, we had no problems at all.

693
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:19,560
We lived.

694
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:20,180
Yeah, right.

695
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:22,240
We only lived to 30 with nature.

696
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,380
If you lived past the first day or two.

697
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:23,680
We understood.

698
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:28,220
We were free and nice while we were catching those starry drifts.

699
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:28,940
No teeth.

700
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,320
No teeth.

701
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,420
You know, no slack.

702
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:34,320
It was a simple time.

703
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:34,880
No food.

704
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,780
There was plenty of food.

705
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,480
They had to work a lot less.

706
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:40,860
Actually, study your anthropology books.

707
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,620
Those hunters and gatherers.

708
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:47,280
They had to put in about four hours a day work to deal with all their needs.

709
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,280
Of course, they didn't need computers.

710
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:53,800
Most people actually only work for about a couple of hours a day, talk.

711
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,020
The rest of the time, you know, busy, look busy.

712
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:01,240
That's certainly the way I've always managed to do it.

713
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:01,860
Praise Bob.

714
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,500
Yeah.

715
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:07,540
Well, then, you know, well, I'll link the whole thing.

716
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:08,420
You got to get back.

717
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,140
You got to get away.

718
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:11,000
Too many people living too close together.

719
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:11,480
You're.

720
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,220
I'm surprised.

721
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:12,580
You're such.

722
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:13,840
Conservative, Chaz.

723
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,480
I mean, I thought you wanted to travel into outer space and all this kind of stuff.

724
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,520
Oh, I do.

725
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:17,940
I do.

726
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,240
I do.

727
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,720
You thought mankind had this glorious destiny.

728
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,960
I don't think it's very conservative to want to go back to.

729
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,980
Now you think a damn chem toilet is too high tech.

730
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:28,040
Oh, I don't care about what you take with you.

731
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,940
You can go back to tribal, self-sufficient communities.

732
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:35,660
Once you get your faster than light spaceship off the ground.

733
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,000
Yeah.

734
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:36,320
Okay.

735
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,760
I get it.

736
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,260
The practical suckling was responsible for this misconception.

737
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,960
You need to read more science fiction, Chaz.

738
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:44,000
And get your head out of these science books.

739
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:50,040
Expand your ears with lovely, lovely manga and mystery mags from the 40s.

740
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:55,540
And also little pieces of literature which show naked women with large vulpine areas

741
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,800
and huge kaboomies.

742
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:02,820
Everything that's happening now is predicted in Isaac Asimov's Foundation series 50 years

743
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,960
or 40 years ago.

744
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:04,620
Is that true?

745
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,560
Yeah.

746
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:05,940
Everything.

747
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:09,500
As a matter of fact, Al-Qaeda means the foundation.

748
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,260
Oh, yes.

749
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,120
Yes, we know this.

750
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:17,560
The Asimov's crappy series was published in Arabic in the 60s.

751
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:18,380
Who cares about any of that?

752
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:19,960
The Gregorians are the one true religion.

753
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:21,440
So, as it turns out, this whole thing.

754
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,520
I thought it was the Chlamydians.

755
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,820
Those guys were inspired by Isaac Asimov.

756
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,060
Dry, foamy people.

757
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:29,960
You know, kind of a bland science writer.

758
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,260
From the great orifice.

759
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,760
You mean it all revolves around some guy who grew up on Mars?

760
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:37,000
I'm feeling fairly sanctimonious.

761
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,300
Gotta share water, brother.

762
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:38,960
No, no.

763
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,280
That's Robert Heinlein.

764
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:42,200
Heinlein and Stranger in a Strange Land.

765
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,320
Yeah, that was Stranger in a Strange Land.

766
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:45,840
I also thought it was rather trite and overly stupid.

767
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:48,660
Now, how does it relate to having sex with anybody?

768
00:27:49,260 --> 00:27:50,140
Like, that moves.

769
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,820
Guys who read all that kind of stuff don't very much.

770
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,380
No.

771
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,380
Well, why is it that they end up writing a...

772
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,840
That's such a big part of their thing.

773
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,000
Sexuality?

774
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,060
Like, sex and that book.

775
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,120
So, what is it about that book?

776
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:02,260
The foundation and sex go together?

777
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,500
Oh, that book had a little bit more sex in it than most of the sci-fi books that those

778
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,780
nerds were reading back then.

779
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:08,180
That's smart.

780
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,820
But does it mean, like...

781
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:14,400
Young women come do it with old, fat, hairy guys?

782
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,440
And old women, too.

783
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,580
Is that what happens in the book?

784
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:16,980
I don't know.

785
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:17,260
I never got here.

786
00:28:17,260 --> 00:28:18,180
Young women did it with old women.

787
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:21,280
Fat guys did it with hairdressers from Portugal.

788
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:21,660
I got bored.

789
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,160
I'm just trying to understand the context of what I witnessed.

790
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:24,880
I never finished it.

791
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:27,520
I got bored, man, and opened a Playboy.

792
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:31,040
He silently walked into the other room and began masturbating next to a dream.

793
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,320
I'm trying to get a picture for all of them.

794
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:38,100
Well, there's only one true religion, Chaz, and that's the Church of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

795
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,200
I'm trying to understand.

796
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:39,660
Which will then tell you...

797
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,260
I'm trying to understand.

798
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:47,780
The one true religion is the temple, the delta, the female delta, in fact, the rose,

799
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,660
you might say, the very...

800
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:52,240
The flowery bud of her sexiness.

801
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,320
The tiny...

802
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,720
Now, what does Bob Dobbs offer to us?

803
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:59,060
And that it is, in fact, a squirting universe.

804
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,420
Yeah, well, what is the deal with that squirting stuff?

805
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:02,920
And when you go, what is the meaning of rivers?

806
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:08,620
Rivers are created by some god shooting his spunk all over some land.

807
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,040
Oh, well, that's all...

808
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,320
That's all poetic symbology.

809
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,160
You know, that's a...

810
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:12,960
Milky way.

811
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:13,680
They're trying to...

812
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:19,600
Star systems created by some big, huge space bimbo squirting her nipple off.

813
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,400
God is in favor.

814
00:29:20,400 --> 00:29:20,920
Well, that's...

815
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:24,100
They do have a more elegant way of putting it, I suppose.

816
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,660
Oh, is there elegant...

817
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,540
Well, it's stroke books, just like everything else is worth a hoot.

818
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:36,580
So the foundation means that God spunked off into a void and suddenly monkeys grew out and flied.

819
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,840
Well, not all the way up because...

820
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,700
Suddenly, as God measures time.

821
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,800
But God is not slack as men count slackness.

822
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:51,540
Each one of the little spermatozoa were actually equipped with beautiful monkey wings.

823
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:57,880
Monkey wings the Lord in his infinite mind and wisdom had supplied each and...

824
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:01,840
You guys need to get your mind out of this monkey wing gutter.

825
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:02,740
Every one.

826
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,600
And, you know, just...

827
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:07,820
Monkey see...

828
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,820
Read Classics Illustrated.

829
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,860
Comics or something.

830
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:11,920
You know, improve your mind.

831
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:15,440
Read The Iliad, The Odyssey, the other classics of ancient Greece.

832
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:16,320
Monkey see...

833
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,340
Read the...

834
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,340
Read the plays.

835
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:19,640
Finnegan's Earthquake.

836
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,700
I can remember now.

837
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:22,100
Funny little monkey.

838
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,300
Funny little monkey.

839
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,700
Funny little monkey to...

840
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:28,860
Oh, sorry.

841
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,220
Earth woman.

842
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:36,420
Shrouded in your own rosebuds.

843
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,520
Come on down.

844
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:40,500
To my house.

845
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:42,760
I'm free on Tuesday.

846
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,260
Well, I'm not free.

847
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,960
I'll have the ankle bracelets on.

848
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,480
But they won't have to know where we're going.

849
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,080
We go by the pool table, I think.

850
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,600
It's not really a table.

851
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,920
It's kind of a pool square.

852
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:58,500
Okay.

853
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,720
I just moved some of those pieces of paper over there.

854
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:02,520
I watched TV for a while.

855
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,060
I got sound white.

856
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:08,380
Shhh.

857
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:08,920
Shhh.

858
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,620
Psssh.

859
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,040
Psssh.

860
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,140


861
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:13,520
Psssh.

862
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:14,340
I don't know.

863
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:16,100
Maybe it's sound like dumb.

864
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:16,440
But.

865
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,080
Want to hear some music?

866
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,080
Yep.

867
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,800
We got to be cutting out of here.

868
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:23,620
Got to be getting going.

869
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:24,180
Yeah.

870
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:25,000
Okay.

871
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,760
Okay, starting a little fire.

872
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:27,120
Okay.

873
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,160
Until next week.

874
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:30,340
In the middle of a living room?

875
00:31:31,340 --> 00:31:32,920
Keep your hat on tight.

876
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:33,760
You're back to the wind.

877
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:34,740
You're sacking the saddle.

878
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,420
Arr, arr, arr, arr, arr, arr.

879
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,820
Say you want to go to the moon.

880
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:39,820


881
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:39,820


882
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:39,820


883
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:39,820


884
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:39,820


885
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:54,500
Oh we can see the needed light now.

886
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:54,500


887
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,900
You got any luck?

888
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:56,900


889
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:57,320
Oh, that makes me want to go to the moon.

890
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:57,320


891
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:57,320


892
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:57,320


893
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:57,320


894
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,280
Reddit my number.

895
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,280


896
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,280


897
00:31:59,280 --> 00:31:59,580
It's time to floor and мы sunset acá в угorde.

898
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:00,980
Where, Trump?

899
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,040


900
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,040


901
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,040


902
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,040


903
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,040


904
00:32:01,040 --> 00:32:01,040


905
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,660
Hahahaha.

906
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,620
All my name stickers shine up on the screen.

907
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:08,900
Alright then, let me ask you something.

908
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,880
When you talk about destruction

909
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:20,080
Don't you know that you can cut me out

910
00:32:22,580 --> 00:32:24,860
Don't you know it's gonna be

911
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,040
Should we do alright

912
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,900
Don't you know it's gonna be

913
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,880
Should we do alright

914
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,680
Don't you know it's gonna be

915
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,700
Should we do alright

916
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:46,860
Say you got a real solution

917
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,640
Well, you know

918
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,540
We don't love to see the plan

919
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,280
Should we do our

920
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,700
Should we do our

921
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:02,560
Ask me for a contribution

922
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:06,440
Well, you know

923
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:11,380
We all do it when we can

924
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:13,100
Should we do our

925
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,540
Should we do our

926
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,740
If you want money for people with minds that hate

927
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:24,600
All I can tell you is brother you have to wait

928
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,080
Don't you know it's gonna be

929
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:31,620
Should we do alright

930
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:34,100
Should we do it's gonna be

931
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,240
Should we do alright

932
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:39,080
Don't you know it's gonna be

933
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:40,680
Should we do our

934
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,020
Alright

935
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,980
Should we do our

936
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:50,560
Say you'll change the constitution

937
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,400
Well, you know

938
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,120
We don't love to change our

939
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,980
Should we do our

940
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,400
Should we do our

941
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,960
Tell me it's the institution

942
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,980
Well, you know

943
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:14,760
You better free your mind instead

944
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,460
Should we do our

945
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,860
Should we do our

946
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:23,140
If you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao

947
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,140
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow

948
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:32,580
Don't you know it's gonna be

949
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:34,960
You are alright

950
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,680
Don't you know it's gonna be

951
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:36,680


952
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:36,680


953
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,100
Should we do our

954
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,920
Should we do our

955
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,000
And now my friends

956
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:43,860
It is with great pride

957
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,520
That the Church of the Sub-G brings to you

958
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,100
The preaching

959
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,560
Of Reverend Susie the Fluesy

960
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,600
At the Tampa

961
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,960
2001

962
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:56,500
Divide

963
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,860
Praise Bob

964
00:34:57,860 --> 00:35:00,020
And Hail Susie

965
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,560
Alright

966
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:06,200
We've got a little list here of things that I need to

967
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,920
to shy away from, just to be on the safe side.

968
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:18,620
Okay, we got, okay, can't mention planes, buildings, airports, offices, city streets, sub-basements,

969
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:27,220
airline pilots, flight attendants, passengers, stockbrokers, commodity traders, secretaries,

970
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:35,240
coffee boys, paramedics, firefighters, cops, the army, hijackers, Arabs, Afghanis, Iranis, Iraqis, Pakistanis, Julianis.

971
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:46,540
New Yorkers, Washingtonians, Pennsylvanians, death, dismemberment, suicide leap, suicide plunge, suicide fall,

972
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:58,900
blood, pain, squashing, crushing, crashing, slamming, burning, smoldering, falling, jumping, splatting, collapsing,

973
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:05,880
flight manuals, flight schools, knives, box cutters, and forget about,

974
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:06,180
forget about,

975
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,040
Barney Rubble.

976
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,980
Well, fuck me blind to call me Shirley.

977
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:16,020
There goes my rant.

978
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,000
Oh, man.

979
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:32,060
I mean, with all the hard-hitting topics that are left, I mean, I guess I'm down to doing a speech about fluffy bunnies and kitties.

980
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,860
Well, hell, Bob, I can't live that way.

981
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:37,720
Oh, man.

982
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:42,100
And living has got to be real important to me lately.

983
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:44,780
For somebody who's got a death wish, that says a lot.

984
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:49,400
Because the con has had an Armageddon agenda for centuries.

985
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:55,600
And they are about to fully eminentize the eschaton out from under the subgenius race.

986
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,960
We, we who deserve to bring about the end of this planet.

987
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:02,340
Some bodunk amateurs have moved in.

988
00:37:02,780 --> 00:37:06,000
And we just got to watch this.

989
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,080
Spectacle on CNN.

990
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,280
Well, that's hardly fucking fair.

991
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,720
I mean, we, we had it coming to us.

992
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:22,100
We are the true inheritors of this shitball planet.

993
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:32,940
Heaven knows goddamn amateurs are dragging us along on their end times apocalypse like a drunken chicken run into the yawning jaws of hell.

994
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:36,160
Another side has any interest in slamming us.

995
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:42,820
And on the breaks before the hot napalm, hellfire starts splattin' fundamentalist meat all over the cosmos.

996
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:51,740
And as nice as that sounds, seekers, could you believe that there's a downside?

997
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:54,540
Well, I mean, hell no.

998
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:57,040
I don't want to clean up after that in the first place.

999
00:37:57,060 --> 00:38:03,960
But I feel like I'd still be around after the echoes of the last blast are reverberating through the vacuum of space.

1000
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:05,560
Oh.

1001
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:13,140
Yeah, the human swarm has been quiet, the sticky, wicked, and the subgenius agenda for loathes many years.

1002
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:20,960
And yes, our plans for world ravaging and planet porking have kind of been put on hold.

1003
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,100
But it's not like Bob didn't try to warn us.

1004
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,620
If you will remember, seekers, I believe it's in the pre-scriptures,

1005
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:36,140
our sacred high epoch dogs had a fight with neighbors in the 1950s.

1006
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,860
During which he transpouted a bit of damning future prophecy.

1007
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:48,180
You'll all be eating roach crap by the turn of the century!

1008
00:38:51,940 --> 00:38:55,540
And you thought the millennium got you off the hook, seekers?

1009
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:59,860
Hey, when you ban something, it's got two turns!

1010
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:03,520
We're still on the turn of the century, and you know?

1011
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:08,360
Bob's probably fucking right this time.

1012
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:13,220
Oh yes, our supreme zen master of sales and slack.

1013
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,760
Oh, he knew it all.

1014
00:39:17,960 --> 00:39:22,160
So it looks like we're stuck, and for some reason, known only to dogs,

1015
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:26,340
the bright and shining promise, the deliverance from X-Day,

1016
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,120
came and went.

1017
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,200
And I, for one, didn't come.

1018
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:32,480
Oh.

1019
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:32,820
Oh.

1020
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:34,520
Oh.

1021
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:35,320
Oh.

1022
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:36,260
Oh.

1023
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:36,740
Oh.

1024
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:37,940
Story of my fucking life.

1025
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:41,820
Yes, we did not get off this shit ball in 1998.

1026
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:47,060
And boy, do I ever have a major bug up my ass about that little point.

1027
00:39:47,260 --> 00:39:48,200
Oh, fuck.

1028
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:53,580
Oh, thanks a whole freakin' lot, Bob, all the trains I pulled for you.

1029
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,940
This is the thanks I get.

1030
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,860
And I made those trains run on time like Mussolini, too, baby.

1031
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:00,740
What?

1032
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:05,140
Oh, and instead, what do we get for our trouble?

1033
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:13,920
Permanently marooned on some tenth-rate jerkwater backwoods ass-bite planet

1034
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:24,600
with too much gravity, too much radiation, and way too much human content.

1035
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:29,740
Oh, sure, they're actively working on cutting that population down.

1036
00:40:30,140 --> 00:40:31,080
They're doing it for us.

1037
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,200
Right now.

1038
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:37,040
But that's a case of too little, too late, if you ask me.

1039
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:44,560
Oh, and their misguided global urban removal project is going to horrendously affect our

1040
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:47,340
lives in this, the new police state.

1041
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:54,020
So, I mean, we didn't think it could get worse, did we?

1042
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:58,200
I mean, before, the world sucked like a crackhead nymphomaniac.

1043
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,200
On Spanish fly, but...

1044
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:08,620
And since these goddamn stupid pinks shifted into a fuck-it-all overdrive,

1045
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:15,560
well, life has really become like a bucket of shit with the handle on the inside.

1046
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:23,880
And, oh, we were in an extremely unenviable position.

1047
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:27,520
We got right smacked between the two stupidest,

1048
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:31,140
meanest bullies on the global playground right now.

1049
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:36,780
And whether you even give shit what about this grudge fight,

1050
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:41,540
you're still gonna get a face full of hot meat shrapnel anyway once these

1051
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:48,160
titanic, inbred, microcephalic limpwicks start duking it out.

1052
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:56,520
But, you know, children, as the sounds of battle are zinging all around us,

1053
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:03,880
children of dogs can take solace in the fact that these jerk-offs may actually be paving the way

1054
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:07,480
to a bright, shining subgenius paradise for us.

1055
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:13,440
How is that, you might ask?

1056
00:42:18,700 --> 00:42:21,680
I'm glad you asked me that.

1057
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:25,860
Oh, it seems there's been a major impasse between us,

1058
00:42:25,860 --> 00:42:27,620
the superior mutant race,

1059
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,080
and our intended, divinely ordained goal,

1060
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:32,640
SLACK.

1061
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,040
And that is...

1062
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:35,980
THEM.

1063
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:38,400
Plain and simple.

1064
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,920
A big, meaty clot of the fuckers.

1065
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:48,540
Oh, and we here at the Church of the Subgenius have long looked into taking care of this

1066
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:51,620
planetary clusterfuck ourselves.

1067
00:42:52,860 --> 00:42:55,720
But the sad truth is, it's just not cost-effective.

1068
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:00,380
It's not cost-effective to mow down so many billion effective, miswired units of humanity.

1069
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:05,720
Even though at first blush it does sound like it's a lot of fun.

1070
00:43:05,940 --> 00:43:09,720
But I've tried it after the first 100,000 or so.

1071
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:13,640
Not only do your arms fucking ache, but it gets boring!

1072
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:15,120
Ugh!

1073
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:20,300
You know, I thought it was gonna be all shits and giggles, but now it's just like work.

1074
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,200
And you know how I feel about that.

1075
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:34,240
But you know, Seekers, the human problem might just take care of itself without us having to dirty our little fingers.

1076
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:40,320
And when it comes to wiping out that annoying human race,

1077
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:44,200
better late than never, I always say.

1078
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:53,180
But you know, there has been a whole lot of blather going on on the Tube since this deadly high-stakes murder.

1079
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,540
And I think it's time to get this slap fight started.

1080
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:59,440
I mean, some maintain that it's all in the fingers.

1081
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,760
It's a matter of, we need to get right with God.

1082
00:44:05,020 --> 00:44:09,900
Or else, we need to visualize world peace.

1083
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:15,720
But Seekers, it's like this.

1084
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:20,600
One fucking thing after another.

1085
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,560
And there it goes again!

1086
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:36,580
Oh yeah, a lot of old boots paying lip service to national security, financial security, social security.

1087
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,960
But what about the security of our slack?

1088
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,080
Have you heard anybody even mention that?

1089
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,000
Any of these...

1090
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,720
No, we haven't.

1091
00:44:46,740 --> 00:44:48,240
No, we haven't, no.

1092
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,200
Oh, those craven cocksuckers.

1093
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:51,640
Yes, the slack!

1094
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:52,980
The pressure!

1095
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,760
The precious, tasty slack!

1096
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:58,920
Oh, it's not just a choice.

1097
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,100
It's not merely a food group.

1098
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:03,720
Oh no!

1099
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:10,840
We desperately need our slack to survive, even more so than Teddy Kennedy needs booze.

1100
00:45:12,980 --> 00:45:16,320
If you can freakin' imagine that, that's how critical it is.

1101
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:21,220
Oh, but none of these spewing pundits are even mentioning it,

1102
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:23,660
which makes me think.

1103
00:45:25,220 --> 00:45:28,340
And that feels real fucked up, because I'm not used to it.

1104
00:45:28,860 --> 00:45:31,460
But all I can think is, what are they planning, Seekers?

1105
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,200
I mean, what could it possibly be?

1106
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:37,720
Is this a deliberate obfuscation of the slack issue?

1107
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:43,460
Designed to draw us off our blessedly crooked footpath at this,

1108
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:48,220
the most single, most critical moment of the church's existence?

1109
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,200
Could it be they're skirting the slack?

1110
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,440
Or are they making the slack issue because they don't want us thinking about slack?

1111
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:59,500
Because then we might start missing it.

1112
00:46:01,280 --> 00:46:08,980
I mean, what if it gets down to where subgenius Americans are issued slack rationing cards?

1113
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:13,580
Or worse yet, what if they just outlaw the shit because it's in their way?

1114
00:46:13,980 --> 00:46:15,940
We've got to consider those possibilities.

1115
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,840
This is an attack on us.

1116
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,200
Ah!

1117
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:24,880
And then, you know, they're probably going to herd all of the subgenius Americans

1118
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:27,840
into those nice, convenient little internment camps.

1119
00:46:28,460 --> 00:46:33,060
And, you know, they're going to offer us that, check out the free showers deal.

1120
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:38,580
I mean, we were expecting hard times for Bubba.

1121
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:43,560
In fact, Dobbs predicted hard times for Bubba, and I clung to that hope,

1122
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:47,080
but I didn't think I'd be sweating alongside the fuckers.

1123
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:49,180
I mean, it was a hard time.

1124
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:52,620
Hard times for Bubba, one of these even harder times for the Bobbies.

1125
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:54,780
Where is the Bob in that?

1126
00:46:55,180 --> 00:47:00,920
Well, Seekers, I'm here to tell you that the outlook ain't all that bleak.

1127
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:03,500
Not if you plan ahead.

1128
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,900
I'm trying to look at it this way.

1129
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:11,720
All we have to do to come out on top is just survive.

1130
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,820
And it's pretty simple.

1131
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:18,200
If you have a bunker.

1132
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:29,020
If you have a bunker, then you can get a mentality that goes with the bunker,

1133
00:47:29,160 --> 00:47:32,180
and you will be set up in style, Seekers.

1134
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:32,880
It's simple.

1135
00:47:32,980 --> 00:47:37,780
If you don't have a cellar or a basement, start digging right now.

1136
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,480
Start digging anything you can get a hold of that will move Earth.

1137
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:45,120
A spoon, anything, a kitty litter scooper.

1138
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,940
Get out there and just start fucking digging.

1139
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:49,900
Start digging.

1140
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:55,980
It seems like a lot of bother, but you'd be surprised how much shit you can move out

1141
00:47:55,980 --> 00:48:01,980
when you can have a few evenings of excavation with a big soup spoon and a good head of steam.

1142
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:07,500
And you don't have to go overboard with the design or the hospital corners or any of that shit.

1143
00:48:08,600 --> 00:48:14,100
I mean, just dig like your life, your subgenius life, depended on it, because it does.

1144
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:16,040
It does, Seekers.

1145
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,540
Your mental life depends on it, critically.

1146
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:29,240
Another handy tip, when you're digging yourself a hole, make it a lot bigger than a grave.

1147
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:36,040
We really don't need to give these cocksuckers any ideas, okay?

1148
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:45,040
Once you have your multi-chambered earthen womb all dug out, stock it with only the most crucial necessities.

1149
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:45,900
Wrong!

1150
00:48:46,040 --> 00:48:53,700
You know, dope, porno, loo, copies of the book of the subgenius, well, I guess that goes with the porno.

1151
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,860
And tapes of the hour of slack and pills.

1152
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:01,160
You know which kind of pills, right?

1153
00:49:04,940 --> 00:49:09,140
I have one left, but lucky for us, it's room-sized.

1154
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,960
But unlucky for you, it's a suppository.

1155
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,060
And froth.

1156
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,500
You'll need lots and lots of froth.

1157
00:49:20,980 --> 00:49:26,720
In fact, if all you can get is dope, I'm sorry, I'm not gonna cut it, you're really gonna need the fucking froth at this point.

1158
00:49:27,300 --> 00:49:32,780
In fact, a hydroponic froth farm is the first neat thing you need to start digging out.

1159
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:41,800
I mean, if the shit rain starts falling, you can at least curl up under your plants in your troglodytic retreat and be happy as a clam.

1160
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:46,020
So just climb in and seal that motherfucker's shirt.

1161
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:50,160
And don't come out until you pick up an all-clear signal on your potato radio.

1162
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:55,800
It may take time, but that's something we have.

1163
00:49:56,100 --> 00:50:02,440
If you were paying attention to Father Joe Mama, you heard him talk about subgenius time control.

1164
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:06,180
That's one of the aces in my hole.

1165
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:16,000
Yes, with Bob's patented technique, the minutes and seconds will no longer flow past you.

1166
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:19,680
You're desperately clutching fingers in a stinking, peristaltic rush.

1167
00:50:19,920 --> 00:50:21,260
Oh, no.

1168
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:25,080
No, you will be time's master.

1169
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:29,040
Time will get on its knees and bark like a dog for you.

1170
00:50:29,980 --> 00:50:38,380
And tell the Seekers it works, because thanks to J.R. Bob Doggs, right now, I can remember this afternoon like it was yesterday.

1171
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:43,580
So this is just crazy enough to work.

1172
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,420
Of course, the pills do help.

1173
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:54,980
But safe within Bob's technochemical embrace, you will still maintain that blessed, blissful bliss blessing

1174
00:50:55,580 --> 00:51:02,420
that comes from a fully realized covenant with Dobbs and a butt full of his vision.

1175
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,940
Butt full, I know, by that.

1176
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,800
Sorry, a little too much tongue got unreal.

1177
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:19,780
And come hell, high water, hell and high water, even some lame-ass world war, you'll still be fixed.

1178
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:29,400
Yes, while the still-smoldering, crispy body parts puree is splashing all around us, we will survive.

1179
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,500
Oh, yes.

1180
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:44,780
And yeah, don't worry, Seekers, your anus will be back to normal when Bob's done with it in a few months.

1181
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:54,500
Normal for a hippo or some large land mammal, but he will give you your ravaged ass back, unlike the conspiracy.

1182
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,160
Oh, yes, Seekers, it's a gift.

1183
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:04,820
Oh, yes.

1184
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:12,920
And, uh, having a chance of dying, you can't buy motivation like that.

1185
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:20,060
Because genetically, I'm not predisposed to having a very long life.

1186
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:26,760
And I've had that borrowed time healing for the past couple of years, and you know what?

1187
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:34,800
That, that has been the main motivation in me getting it back together and getting back up on the road.

1188
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,060
And I've had enough of the rails running this train again.

1189
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,560
The fact that I shouldn't even be here.

1190
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:45,120
And now we all have that rhythm, right, Seekers?

1191
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:48,820
So, bless you, Easy.

1192
00:52:50,620 --> 00:52:53,000
Enjoy your end times.

1193
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,000
They're for you.

1194
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:34,800


1195
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,520
Thank you.

1196
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:51,320
Excuse me.

1197
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,480
I'll just pause right here.

1198
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:04,780
It only takes about two minutes.

1199
00:54:04,780 --> 00:54:07,880
Through the sun they grow white

1200
00:54:08,780 --> 00:54:13,240
Through American time

1201
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,260
There's a wife in the sky

1202
00:54:20,740 --> 00:54:25,340
And I'll follow it anywhere

1203
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:31,340
Through the floor of the ocean

1204
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:37,100
Through the mountains so high

1205
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:47,380
But never sick, he's never been ill

1206
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:52,940
Except for the time in the Andes

1207
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:58,880
And then there's the time on our fallow sea

1208
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,320
When he ain't back yet

1209
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:04,960
The Holy Spirit can't beat

1210
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:07,960
But for the most part

1211
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:10,900
He won't let you down

1212
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:15,340
When you find yourself lost for time

1213
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,620
Just suffer and fall

1214
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:22,640
And your mind will unlock

1215
00:55:22,640 --> 00:55:27,120
Cause you have a piece of the rock

1216
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:30,140
There's a wife in the sky

1217
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,320
There's a wife in the sky

1218
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:36,220
And I'll follow it anywhere

1219
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:42,140
Through the sun they grow white

1220
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:47,900
Through American time

1221
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,800
There's a wife in the sky

1222
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:59,940
And I'll follow it anywhere

1223
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,300
Through the sun they grow white

1224
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,620
Through American time

1225
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:17,700
There's a wife in the sky

1226
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:20,420
There's a wife in the sky

1227
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:21,160
Through American time

1228
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:21,160


1229
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:21,160


1230
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:21,160


1231
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:21,160


1232
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:21,160


1233
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,940
And I'll follow it anywhere

1234
00:56:23,940 --> 00:56:26,640
There's a wife in the sky

1235
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:26,640


1236
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,880
Through the sun they grow white

1237
00:56:29,880 --> 00:56:31,160
Through American time

1238
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:35,660
Through the hurricane tide

1239
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:41,280
There's a pipe in the sky

1240
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:47,640
And I'll follow it anywhere

1241
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:53,500
Through the dark of the ocean

1242
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:59,260
Through those mountains so high

1243
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:04,900
There's a pipe in the sky

1244
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:11,120
And I'll follow it anywhere

1245
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:16,860
Through the simple highway

1246
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,840
Through the hurricane tide

1247
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:28,720
There's a pipe in the sky

1248
00:57:30,560 --> 00:57:35,020
And I'll follow it anywhere

1249
00:57:35,020 --> 00:57:41,620
Through the dark of the ocean

1250
00:57:41,620 --> 00:57:46,980
Through those mountains so high

1251
00:57:48,820 --> 00:57:52,460
There's a pipe in the sky

1252
00:57:54,500 --> 00:57:58,700
And I'll follow it anywhere

1253

00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:13,560
Through the hurricane tide

1256
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:29,240
You're listening to the subjection of the show.
