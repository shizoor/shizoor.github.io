1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,800
The poltergeist is working tonight because one of these tape decks won't turn off.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:08,200
Get your finger out of the hole there, Dr. Stang. You're liable to hurt yourself.

3
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,140
There you go.

4
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:15,780
Well, let's turn on the dampers and see if we can get the nuclear power plant started here, Doctor.

5
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,640
I'm anxious to take off.

6
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,600
Would you get all those guys out of the other side there, please?

7
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,900
What'd you do, Doctor?

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,240
Central control processor off.

9
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:31,340
There, central control is on, Doctor.

10
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,580
Good, good. Okay, you want to close the watertight doors here?

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,800
Yeah, oh, watch out for that squid, man. There's a prairie squid right by the door.

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,660
Speaking of which...

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,220
And inject some of those collar soles, would you, into the retribution chamber?

14
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:49,280
Primary and secondary circuit tests commencing now.

15
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:51,540
Well, we really...

16
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,080
Swine 2 has a prayer request. Is that so, a friend?

17
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:54,920
Well, tell them to pray.

18
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,880
That's right. They're just going to have to pray.

19
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,220
Oh, yes, dear friends, and we could say this was Hour of Slack number 1,649,

20
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:10,420
but actually it's a rerun of the classic Hour of Slack number 40,

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:16,900
combined with number 722 around the year 2001.

22
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:21,260
Actually, Hour of Slack 40 would have been from 1986,

23
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,460
and stars G. Gordon Gordon and myself,

24
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:29,040
and the subject is prairie squid.

25
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:59,220
Hour of Slack 40

26
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,380
Hour of Slack 40

27
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:01,980
Hour of Slack 40

28
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,700
Hour of Slack 40

29
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,920
Not good chicken, man.

30
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,620
conviction

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,220
Am conqu Alice

32
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:29,220


33
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:35,520
A musician, if you consider the normal pattern of modern civilized life, is on the outside of it all.

34
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,640
He doesn't build things, he doesn't work regular hours like a decent God-fearing citizen,

35
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:51,800
and the life he leads in many ways seems useless and irrelevant to those of us who prefer a quiet evening in front of the television and a bottle of beer.

36
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:59,880
Amazing as it might seem to some of us, musicians have basic physical needs, just like real people.

37
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:05,760
If I could just get my hands on a big, fat, juicy prairie squid.

38
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,140
Oh, yeah!

39
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,660
Prairie squid, prairie squid

40
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,720
Prairie squid, prairie squid

41
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,620
Prairie squid, prairie squid

42
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,780
Prairie squid, prairie squid

43
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,160
Well, we're going to, probably half of our audience doesn't even know.

44
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,080
What is that?

45
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,180
Half of our audience has probably never seen.

46
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,520
Well, you left the airlock open.

47
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,300
That's what that is.

48
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,460
Oh, kill the airlock.

49
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,100
Yeah, well.

50
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:37,940
Okay.

51
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,520
Okay.

52
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:39,680
Friends, let me tell you something.

53
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,520
First off, number one.

54
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,540
Let's get serious about this, Doctor.

55
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,260
First of all.

56
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:42,820
Cassette deck two.

57
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,480
It's not working.

58
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:48,000
And the ports on the starboard side are completely.

59
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,420
That's okay.

60
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:54,460
We're losing air fast, and we're going to have to try to keep up with it.

61
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,660
Well, I'll open up this big blue cylinder of church air over here, Doctor.

62
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:58,440
Ah, yes.

63
00:03:58,620 --> 00:03:59,100
Have a look.

64
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,900
Now I feel considerably better.

65
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,080
Ah, yes.

66
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:07,240
I'm in this church air.

67
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,900
Oh, yes.

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,960
Praise God.

69
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,780
I feel that church air now.

70
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,940
Do you feel it?

71
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:17,200
Friends, can you feel it out there in the radio audience?

72
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,200
I bet you can.

73
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:19,040
I bet you can.

74
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,300
It is.

75
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:19,620
Yeah.

76
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,560
Reach out and feel it, friends.

77
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:24,540
And if you can't reach down and feel it, then you're going to.

78
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:28,000
And then you probably don't even know what a prairie squid is.

79
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,920
You probably don't even care what one tastes like.

80
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:31,680
When you were.

81
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:38,240
Now, I know about half our audience, Doctor Gordon, probably remember when they were teenage

82
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,160
boys and girls out in, you know, West Texas or wherever they're from, going out in the

83
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,400
fields and taking off their clothes and spreading some prairie squids.

84
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,860
And, you know, at that time you had paper jackets around and tent jackets and L soaking

85
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:51,860


86
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:51,860


87
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:52,400
What do you thing?

88
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,240
The men like that Ortega nice shirt.

89
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,240


90
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:00,380
I'm not kidding.

91
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:00,680
It wasn't right.

92
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,320
That's right was the winter away superstition that's with no flu just liked

93
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:06,120
one dad to the west and worst of all, they were.

94
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:12,700
You know, it wasn't little rollGrief that really worked that month because they were

95
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:12,700


96
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,280
Now, there is.

97
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,220
I'm very successful on changing the music to nativeestatcher работает Ö it got me very

98
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:17,800
upset You were getting washed away.

99
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:18,440
I had to!

100
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,080
Well, that's what it was.

101
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:19,080


102
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:27,900
And, you know, just to give you an example, it's just like, do you remember back when you were a kid, there were all those thousands of those little cute horny toads around?

103
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:31,620
Why do you think they called them horny toads?

104
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,720
Because they counter exist.

105
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:39,860
You know, they're part of a symbiotic relationship with that favorite outdoor mollusk of ours.

106
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,620
Yes, and dare we say the name again?

107
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,920
The mighty prairie squid.

108
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,820
Oh, yes.

109
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:53,720
And, of course, as you know, Dr. Stang, I have just come back from a fact-finding tour through the Amazonas regions of Brazil.

110
00:05:54,040 --> 00:06:04,020
Yes, friends, just to fill you in exactly on what's going on here, we have as our special guest tonight Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

111
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:04,960
Yes, indeed.

112
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:15,700
The erstwhile head of the Green Hill Dobstown encampment and now commandant of Dobstown II just outside Rio de Janeiro.

113
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:20,340
Yes, friends, right on the coast where the surf is high and so is everybody else usually.

114
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:34,680
And, friends, you know, and this, what you're listening to, dear friends, is the hour of slack on NAOAN 89.9 in Dallas, Texas.

115
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:41,640
Now that the uranium has warmed up, the airlock leak has been stopped, I think it's about time we launched this show, doctor.

116
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,800
I can feel the mighty thrust of that show.

117
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:49,180
The mighty thrust, yeah.

118
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,300
As Dr. Mothersbaugh's beautiful hymn, the Bobcata, plays in the background.

119
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,460
And maybe if I hit this tape deck hard enough.

120
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,200
Hit it hard, here.

121
00:06:59,320 --> 00:06:59,960
Wait a minute.

122
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,440
Let me shoot it for you, doctor.

123
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,240
Hold on.

124
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:02,920
Please do.

125
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,260
Ha!

126
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:04,900
Ha!

127
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,480
Ha!

128
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,240
stop.

129
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:23,880
It oozes like a farm fresh prairie squid on a hot slick platter.

130
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,200
If you buy one, you get one free.

131
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,360
Big money, fast luck, all yours for only a buck.

132
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:41,080
It's so cute and cuddly.

133
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,800
It can smash a cow's skull with a single swipe.

134
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:45,800


135
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:45,800


136
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:45,800


137
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:45,800


138
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:53,120
right but friends this is uh we're going to focus on an endangered species that probably

139
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:57,980
you know half of you who weren't raised in the south probably don't even know what a prairie

140
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:02,460
squid is and we might as maybe we ought to identify you know just so people will know

141
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:09,040
who don't know what a prairie squid is doctor perhaps we ought to at first sort of as best we

142
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:16,560
can define our terms and say that a prairie squid is really it's a sort of a physical metaphor for

143
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,040
a lot of things and it's probably exactly what you think we're talking about a metaphor it's a

144
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:26,760
it's an endangered species yes i know but it used to live on prairies and the fact that most of these

145
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,060
callers don't even know what a prairie well they don't even know what a prairie is it's all been

146
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:37,340
covered up with most of the los colinas and all that kind of stuff right well yeah but at the

147
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,800
same time it is a metaphor for

148
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,020
example

149
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:44,240
resistance doug uh the very struggle of who's doug of the uh prairie squid

150
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:51,540
doug the guy the struggle the struggle of the poor now friends you know what you do see prairie

151
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:59,040
squids nowadays you can go to the supermarket and buy a dead cellophane wrapped plucked shaved

152
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:05,300
prairie squid yeah i mean it's shocking it's shocking to us to us old-timers i mean most of

153
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:09,020
you you you that's the only way you're ever going to see it they've never seen them

154
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,240
alive

155
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:15,200
i know and a lot of people don't even know that they are actually a wild animal and friends that's

156
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:25,020
such a waste because frankly frankly what the prairie squid is best used for is the sexual act

157
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:32,600
sexual congress and i i'm you know i know this may uh we don't want to offend any radio but this

158
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:38,360
is a well-known fact yeah i mean you can look in the encyclopedia under prairie under squid sub

159
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:44,200
Or subgenius, and it'll say, subgenius, see prairie squid.

160
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:44,820
Exactly.

161
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,360
And, you know, yes, it is.

162
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:50,580
That's its best use, and some people might find that offensive,

163
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:53,860
but they're the people that don't like to think about things like that

164
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:57,940
because sometimes they're not sure how to do things like that,

165
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,960
or they're afraid that somebody will laugh at them if they said that they did something like that,

166
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,380
that they had them a prairie squid or two.

167
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:08,380
Most of them think the prairie squid is a myth.

168
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,140
Oh, yeah.

169
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,220
They get real embarrassed if you talk about a prairie squid in polite society.

170
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:17,720
The polished ears of the rationalists.

171
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,240
Oh, yes.

172
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,200
The modernist, the so-called humanistic.

173
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:27,000
You know, if they were humanists, if they were really concerned about humanity,

174
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,480
they'd free the prairie squid prisoners,

175
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:35,120
and they'd quit killing prairie squids and making purses and shoes out of them.

176
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:38,140
Well, I mean, it's worse than killing whales.

177
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:42,320
For dog food, Reverend Stang, I mean, if you think about it,

178
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:47,400
I mean, at least you're benefiting some canines who would otherwise not have anything else to eat,

179
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:53,060
but the very idea of killing and tanning prairie squid and turning them into purses and basketball shoes.

180
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:56,980
It's repellent to anyone who's really lived with nature,

181
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:01,440
anyone who is really a nature-oriented person who's concerned about the environment

182
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:06,360
would, despite the stigma, despite the embarrassment,

183
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,700
They would be proud, Doctor.

184
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:08,300
They would be.

185
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:08,360
They would be.

186
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:08,840
Proud.

187
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:09,160
Proud.

188
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,920
Nay, they would find it their Bob-born duty.

189
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,820
Duty, my dude.

190
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:15,360
Duty, yes.

191
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,560
To seek out that prairie squid and protect them.

192
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,260
And nurture.

193
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:20,640
I mean.

194
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,600
And nurture that prairie squid.

195
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,340
I'm Grapeape.

196
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,700
I sing now.

197
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,900
I got a big fat squid in my refrigerator.

198
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,100
Ooh.

199
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,740
Ooh.

200
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,020
I got a big fat squid in my refrigerator.

201
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:36,180
Ooh.

202
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:37,820
Ooh.

203
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:41,480
I found him in the frozen food.

204
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:44,540
I got him five new pairs of shoes.

205
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,280
And now he lives in the refrigerator.

206
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,540
Ooh.

207
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:50,080
Ooh.

208
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:50,660
Ooh.

209
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:54,020
I bought him for 99 cents a pound.

210
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,140
Ooh.

211
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:56,160
Shoot.

212
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:56,760
Shoot.

213
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,280
It costs $45, weighs 35 pounds.

214
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:01,120
Ooh.

215
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:02,280
What?

216
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:02,940
What?

217
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,700
I'm the cutest ape in the neighborhood.

218
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:06,700
Ooh.

219
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:06,740
Ooh.

220
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,020
Ooh.

221
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,340
Ooh.

222
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:07,820
Ooh.

223
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,340


224
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,340


225
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,340


226
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,340


227
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,340


228
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,340


229
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,340


230
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,340


231
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,340


232
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,340


233
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,340


234
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:08,340


235
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,560
Ooh.

236
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:12,700
Ooh.

237
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


238
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


239
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


240
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


241
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


242
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


243
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


244
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


245
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


246
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


247
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


248
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


249
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


250
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


251
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


252
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


253
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


254
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


255
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


256
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


257
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


258
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


259
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


260
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


261
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


262
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


263
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


264
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


265
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:12,700


266
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,000
Oh, look at this.

267
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,880
We got a note here.

268
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:17,520
There's an anti-bob person on line two.

269
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:19,860
Anti-bob.

270
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,940
They all want to be.

271
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,400
There's a common psychosis.

272
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,340
This anti Messiah complex.

273
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,380
Well it's the only.

274
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:29,040
Well, if you get your name in the paper as an anti Messiah.

275
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,100
It's in the same size type.

276
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:41,940
They're just saying that so they can have their name linked with Bob.

277
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:43,240
You understand?

278
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,020
Exactly.

279
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,340
It's a hate-love relationship.

280
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:51,300
They know they aren't good enough to be Bob or to even serve Bob right.

281
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,540
And they're mostly anti-squid people.

282
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,940
You know, you see them at these squid suppression rallies.

283
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:00,920
Yeah, and no right to squid.

284
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,660
Burning records.

285
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:06,320
Yeah, burning records trying to stamp out prairie squid.

286
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:12,660
And those are the same kind of intolerant people who the only way they can react to something is to kill them.

287
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,520
If they don't understand it, they kill it.

288
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:20,400
And if they can't eat it, they make socks or shoes or something like that out of it.

289
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:26,540
There's people out there that would kill a Playboy magazine if they saw it crawling around through the bushes like a prairie squid.

290
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,920
Especially if they thought it would hurt.

291
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,820
And since they're good for the same things.

292
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:35,960
Well, except that, of course, a Playboy magazine is by no means a prairie squid, Dr. Stang.

293
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,300
I mean...

294
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:44,240
I'm sure that you and I know that perhaps a Playboy magazine might be employed with a prairie squid, but certainly no such thing.

295
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,220
Man, I've never needed a playboy, anything besides just the squid.

296
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,220
The squid itself is all one really needs.

297
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,740
A prairie squid, it's like a snail without a shell.

298
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,320
A really large, about a foot long.

299
00:13:56,080 --> 00:14:02,820
They've got a light, they're differing variations of color of hair and how much hair, how curly it is.

300
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:06,160
Yeah, and where it's distributed and, you know, whether they're an Elon.

301
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,260
Or a long-gated squid or a small, squamous, flattened-out squid, you know.

302
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,220
And just as a snail is like one just, it's a pseudopod, it's a big foot.

303
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:20,540
A prairie squid, friends, is a huge erogenous zone.

304
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:21,620
That's all it is.

305
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,480
A mobile erogenous zone.

306
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:26,540
And we're not talking about one of them camper conversion kits either.

307
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:27,620
That's right.

308
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:33,340
And this is not, this isn't some chauvinistic thing because I know a lot of country girls out there know what we're talking about.

309
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,520
Because a prairie squid...

310
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:36,200
Well, it interfaces both ways, right?

311
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,320
Doctor, I mean, that's the deal.

312
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:40,900
Without expensive interfaces, you can plug right into this amazing new pet.

313
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,680
I mean, you don't need attachments or rubber washers or anything like that with a...

314
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,780
It just one serves the entire family.

315
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:53,740
And back in the old pioneer days, when they first came across this prairie from little towns up the northeast...

316
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,920
It was a family thing.

317
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,480
Yeah, sure.

318
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:58,700
You had the little prairie squid cage right there on the back of the covered wagon.

319
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,400
Everybody had them.

320
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,340
I mean, you nurtured them.

321
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:04,400
And now, now they're almost extinct.

322
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,140
Now, you could cruise.

323
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:13,300
You could cruise Turtle Creek from one end to the other and never find, never find an ambulating prairie squid.

324
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:22,920
About five years ago, I saw the first wild prairie squid I'd seen since my childhood running around near Glen Rose, Texas, near the power plant.

325
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:24,340
So, well, who knows?

326
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,160
Maybe there'll be real big glowing prairie squids in a few years.

327
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,540
Yeah, that's true.

328
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,940
Maybe there'll be mutated prairie squids, you know?

329
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:34,100
I mean, other things are changing fast and people's social habits are changing.

330
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:36,100
And perhaps one day, Doctor...

331
00:15:36,100 --> 00:15:38,140
Or perhaps one day, the squid will...

332
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:42,700
The squid, if Dobbs is willing, will return in all of its glory.

333
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,040
After Bob comes again.

334
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:44,960
And the squid will.

335
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:45,760
The...

336
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:46,560
Yes, friends.

337
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,580
Yes, after Bob comes the squid.

338
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,860
Giant eel.

339
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,440
That is very nice, dancing around in my mouth.

340
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,100
One way or another, she's gonna get you, Doc.

341
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,440
Giant eel.

342
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:10,540
The squid, the live ones, their livers are quite small.

343
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:13,140
And the squids were very small.

344
00:16:13,360 --> 00:16:15,600
It makes them difficult to handle, you know?

345
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,520
Uh-huh, I see.

346
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,180
I was scrambling like crazy.

347
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,260
Oh, so nice.

348
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:35,240
Oh, so nice.

349
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:35,780
Oh, look.

350
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,160
It wobbles in my mouth.

351
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:40,540
Oh, so nice.

352
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,560
If I had a nice cold beer...

353
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,940
I thought it was going to be really greasy.

354
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,000
This is so good.

355
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,320
It's really good.

356
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:53,340
It's like jelly.

357
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,240
This is wonderful.

358
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,520
Look at the fat.

359
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,360
Lobster brains.

360
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,640
And it wobbles in my mouth.

361
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,640
All kinds of different...

362
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,220
This is wonderful.

363
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,200
Look at the fat.

364
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,500
Lobster brains.

365
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,020
Oh, so nice!

366
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,020
Oh, so nice.

367
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,980
Oh, so nice!

368
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,260
What is that?

369
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,620
He doesn't know what he's doing.

370
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,320
When it wobbles in my mouth...

371
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,500
And it wobbles in my mouth!

372
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,620
And it wobbles in my mouth!

373
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:35,620


374
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:35,620


375
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:38,620
I thought it was going to be really greasy.

376
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,740
Not greasy, but bulbous.

377
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:46,220
Bulbous also tapered.

378
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:52,180
Friends, Thelonious Squid was the name of that piece there by Champion Jack Codini.

379
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:59,760
Posted to alt.binaries.slack earlier, we heard Big Fat Squid by, I think, Space Ghost.

380
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,900
And a short piece by Likewise.

381
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:08,340
Likewise, an art link letter cut up by Ray Brunel, some ESO, and mostly, of course, dear friends,

382
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:15,240
this show, number 772, has reverted to hour of slack number 40,

383
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:19,260
The Squid Inn with Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

384
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,460
Oh, that reminds me, I almost forgot, Suzy the Flusie's squid.

385
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:23,780
Oh, yeah, yeah.

386
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:25,080
Wait, where's that furry squid?

387
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:31,880
Now, if we put the squid out today, he's going to be pretty used by tomorrow.

388
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:39,140
I don't want to have to throw him out before tomorrow, because I think we may unveil the squid on Saturday morning.

389
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,060
Because the squid is, you know, it's not going to live forever.

390
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,080
Yeah, I've got to figure out what to wear.

391
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,540
I prefer the mountain squid.

392
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:57,040
Well, this is a Mississippi Delta squid, which is not the, they actually smell funny.

393
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,820
Unlike a mountain squid or a straight prairie squid.

394
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,760
Well, the smell is an aphrodisiac.

395
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:01,880
Yeah.

396
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,960
It's an aphrodisiac all in itself.

397
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:04,220
Well, for some people.

398
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:09,700
No, the smell of a good rotting squid inflames your pheromones all the way down.

399
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:16,160
It could twist up your DNA helix like an old mangled twist tie if you're not careful, but the trip's an e-ticket.

400
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:16,900
Yeah.

401
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,440
So, which night should I get naked, Doug?

402
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,000
Huh?

403
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,520
Which night should I get naked?

404
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:21,860
Saturday.

405
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:22,700
Saturday.

406
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:23,780
Saturday night.

407
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:27,300
Okay, so I don't get the squid on my bustier.

408
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:28,760
We're going to rape Bob.

409
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,980
Jesus is going to nail him to the cross.

410
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:31,640
We're going to...

411
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,500
Nothing will happen to me.

412
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,200
Watch it.

413
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,420
You self-righteous hypocrite.

414
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,520
I am the head of Hadron of Hastor.

415
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,060
My father is Had Urter.

416
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:44,760
Well, I'm not a self-defiling hypocrite.

417
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:45,640
I'm a surfer.

418
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,180
You know, that's what I am.

419
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,900
But I don't want to get into that.

420
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,540
Let's go to...

421
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,760
Only three more minutes.

422
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:54,680
I'm sorry that that neurotic woman got on the air, but you know what happens sometimes.

423
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:55,740
They get on Hastor.

424
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:56,700
By all means, let's...

425
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,260
We're sorry.

426
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:57,840
We're sorry.

427
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,740
I just can't believe someone would call in and have the nerve to say,

428
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:02,380
say things like that about Prairie Square.

429
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:02,840
I know.

430
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:06,720
Not only that, but they call somebody else's show using our airtime.

431
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,160
Using an our area code, for that matter.

432
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:15,360
That show that they're not speaking its name in Berkeley, out in California.

433
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,440
Oh, they're hip out there in California.

434
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,300
Oh, yeah, but they...

435
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:18,740
They're so hip.

436
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,940
They've got their crack, so to speak.

437
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:22,600
Yes, yes.

438
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,640
Their drugs and their wild sex.

439
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:30,720
But have you ever heard a person from one of these hot tubbers...

440
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:30,720


441
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:33,220
Talking about a prairie squid, friends?

442
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,060
No, you never have.

443
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:34,560
Never.

444
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,800
You haven't heard about those...

445
00:20:35,800 --> 00:20:36,280
They don't even...

446
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,300
They've never heard of it.

447
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,640
Those organic boys with their avocado dips and everything.

448
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:41,360
They're city folks.

449
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,060
Yeah, they don't know about prairie squid.

450
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:43,940
Oh, they know everything.

451
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,040
They know everything.

452
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:46,380
But they don't know that.

453
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:50,240
And if you told them, if you tried to tell them about it, they'd think, oh, how quaint.

454
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,580
He's talking with his southern accent.

455
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:54,060
How folksy.

456
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:54,440
Yes.

457
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:55,580
Oh, he must...

458
00:20:55,580 --> 00:20:57,640
He must be near to the earth or something.

459
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,060
Yes.

460
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,800
Yes, yes.

461
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,060
But I'm an artist.

462
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:00,720
I don't have to...

463
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:00,720


464
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:03,260
I don't have to lower myself to those demeaning...

465
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:12,420
I'm involved with such incredibly cerebral machinations over the politically correct aspect of my art.

466
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:14,080
Yes, I'm not obsessed with...

467
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,060
And how it applies to prairie squid, that I don't really have to think about the humorous side of these things.

468
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:20,640
If there is a humorous side, because I'm serious.

469
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,260
I'm from California.

470
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:29,820
I don't have to do veiled juvenile humor, guising as some sort of highfalutin environmental concern citizen.

471
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:30,580
Satan.

472
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:30,920
I'm not a liar.

473
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:31,520
Yes.

474
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:32,940
I'm not that kind of person.

475
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,600
Oh, no, no, no.

476
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:34,480
Of course not.

477
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:35,400
That's what they'll tell you every time.

478
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,480
Yeah, that's the line they'll spring on you.

479
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,580
The sophisticated lie.

480
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,460
The conspiracy is...

481
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,820
Their bourgeois lie.

482
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:45,120
The conspiracy is insidious, friends.

483
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,040
Incredibly, they make you want what they have.

484
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,300
And make you feel stupid because you haven't got it.

485
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:54,740
Yeah, and they make you think it's better than what you already have.

486
00:21:54,940 --> 00:21:59,280
That way, once they get your attention directed at what they have,

487
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,460
they can get your...

488
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:01,820
Slack.

489
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,860
Your slack, friends.

490
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:04,020
That's right.

491
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:06,420
And you're a prairie squid, too.

492
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:11,100
And as long as you're the kind of person that can still...

493
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:16,900
You know, if you can find one, you can go out in the woods and have a short relationship with one of these harmless animals.

494
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,020
Or a long relationship.

495
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:21,280
I mean, you know, like, there's no limited time.

496
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:28,440
The tantric sex magicians in India and the ancient cultures of the earth have known of...

497
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,440
I mean, these creatures are not just...

498
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,200
Common to the continental U.S.

499
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:32,660
That's right.

500
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:38,880
And Reverend Stang, I don't know if you know it or not, but in Tibet, they breed in the temples a special variety.

501
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,160
Oh, the fattened special prairie...

502
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,480
The special prairie squid.

503
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:43,820
The soft squid, they call it.

504
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,040
Yeah, it's the one that the Dalai Lama has.

505
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:46,840
Uh-huh.

506
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,480
And they still breed them there.

507
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:48,740
Those things eat...

508
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:51,600
And they have to ship them out to India where the Dalai Lama is now.

509
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,420
You know, the Chinese let them because...

510
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:56,580
They're better fed than almost anyone in Tibet.

511
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,480
They're better fed than...

512
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:57,920
Any human being.

513
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,960
They're better fed than most of Tibet put together.

514
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:06,960
And, uh, friends, when you become a member of the Church of the Subgenius, you become eligible.

515
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:07,860
Yes.

516
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,580
Eligible, friends.

517
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:14,380
We'll give you your very own prairie squid direction and survival package.

518
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,760
Give yourself to the feeling, friends.

519
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,020
Uh-huh.

520
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:32,360
Uh-huh.

521
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:34,800
Uh-huh.

522
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,320
Uh-huh.

523
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:45,220
Orgasmantra by Ziza.

524
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,880
Remember to write for information.

525
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,140
We don't want you to send money.

526
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,920
We want you to send your whole wallet.

527
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:53,620
That's right.

528
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:54,680
You can take the money out.

529
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:55,520
Just send us the rest.

530
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:59,040
Especially those little pictures that you keep in the secret compartment.

531
00:23:59,360 --> 00:23:59,740
A few products...

532
00:23:59,740 --> 00:24:00,440
That you don't show...

533
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,440


534
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,440


535
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,440


536
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,440


537
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,060
We'll take the credit cards and things, too.

538
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:02,700
Well, we'll take those.

539
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:07,740
But those little pictures that no one else knows about, that's what the Bob already knows about those.

540
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:13,860
And we can judge just how highly to rank you in the great hierarchy of this church.

541
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,240
And Bob collects them, too, we might add.

542
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:20,700
And the better ones, the better the pictures that come out of that little tiny secret embarrassing compartment in your wallet,

543
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,820
the higher up the rungs you move.

544
00:24:24,060 --> 00:24:24,780
Yes, friends.

545
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:33,060
And we also found that one person who sent his wallet in had a picture of a prairie squid in it and didn't even know what it was.

546
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:41,900
He thought it was some curious little life form or a blowup of a bacteria or something.

547
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:46,000
And he'd been carrying it around for years because he felt it gave him good luck.

548
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,080
And it did.

549
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,940
It did.

550
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,420
It gave him incredible good luck because it brought him to Bob.

551
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,760
And you see that just a picture of a little thing.

552
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,560
A little thing like a prairie squid can set you on the right path.

553
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,040
It'll put you right.

554
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,740
The path to Dobbs and salvation.

555
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,900
Praise Bob.

556
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,560
Bob loves you.

557
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:13,340
Bob loves you.

558
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:16,540
Bob loves you, friend.

559
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:23,700
And, you know, if you could just let go of those hang-ups that have kept you tired.

560
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,820
And you could talk back down, friends.

561
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,520
You could just shine.

562
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:30,460
Shackled by your own insecurities, as they might say, Reverend Stang.

563
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:31,460
Your ignorance.

564
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:33,360
Your pathetic ignorance.

565
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,400
Your pathetic, pink ignorance is what it is.

566
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:41,580
Your ignorance of the subgenius P.O. box number, which we were about to forget to give.

567
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:43,080
Oh, can we do that?

568
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,000
You bet we can.

569
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:44,620
We have to.

570
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,780
Oh, well, in that case.

571
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,300
Bob said we had to party.

572
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:48,360
Yes, well, that box number.

573
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,420
Why are you sitting there listening to this radio show?

574
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,920
Why aren't you out partying?

575
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:53,700
Why aren't you out partying?

576
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,740
Bob said to party.

577
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,480
Party! Party!

578
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:58,320
Bob said you had to party.

579
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,600
You had to party.

580
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:01,260
You better party.

581
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,900
If you felt like it.

582
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,080
Yes, indeed, Frank.

583
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,100
Get out there. Where's that?

584
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,800
Where's that?

585
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:09,240
We want Bob says to get out there and do it.

586
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,720
Bob says, find the squid.

587
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,560
Now, if you look at the head, it has a lump on it.

588
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,840
And it almost looks prehistoric, doesn't it?

589
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,560
Right. That's a good description.

590
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,680
A good way of putting it.

591
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,380
Ooh, squid rings.

592
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:24,780
Yeah.

593
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,140
And 30 minutes gone, 30 to go.

594
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,860
The squid battle enters the second half.

595
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,060
From here on out, no wiggle room. Go!

596
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,580
Tell us.

597
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:51,080
You like squid?

598
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:51,960
Yes, squid.

599
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,780
Yes, I like it very much.

600
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,920
We don't only sing, but we dance just as good as we want.

601
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,380
You aren't perfect yourself.

602
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:31,440
And most people usually end up with pretty much what they deserve.

603
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:36,880
And you deserve that music by champion Jack Codini.

604
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,440
I know I did. I wanted it.

605
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,960
And I know what I don't want, friends.

606
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:45,080
I don't want the conspiracy and the squid haters.

607
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:48,540
To make these Christians into a political force.

608
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,520
They don't want it!

609
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:51,260
They want us involved!

610
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,300
Let's tell them we're not listening to them anymore!

611
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,880
We're going to be involved!

612
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:03,840
It isn't going to take Ronald Reagan three years to learn about the godless, aggressive nature of communism.

613
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:16,920
Over the last two or three decades, the federal government seems to have forgotten both that old-time religion and that old-time constitution.

614
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:18,880
I'm a squid.

615
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,040
Squid.

616
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,460
You know that old-time?

617
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:28,740
It's been 1984 since 1953, friends.

618
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,600
That's right.

619
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:35,620
That was probably the last time your parents told you about the Perry Squid.

620
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,880
After that, you know, there was a law against them.

621
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:43,800
Yeah, but you weren't even allowed to talk about it until J. Edgar Hoover passed on.

622
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,420
There's a law, friends, on the books that says this.

623
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:51,480
No subgenius can do anything it wants.

624
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:53,760
Now, is this a free country?

625
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:54,700
Yeah.

626
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,480
Friends, when they...

627
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,420
What kind of a repressive...

628
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:03,060
I mean, they talk, oh, America, home of the free.

629
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,380
Land of the brave.

630
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:04,660
Home of the brave.

631
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:05,160
Sure.

632
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:06,620
Are they brave enough to...

633
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,160
Are they brave enough to talk about prairie squid?

634
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:09,840
Oh, no.

635
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,260
No, no, no, no.

636
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:13,060
That's a little rough.

637
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:16,880
And that doesn't sound too good to the polished ears.

638
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,280
Of the liberals and the modernists.

639
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,940
So they soften it down, you see.

640
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:24,320
And of course, they would read that verse,

641
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:32,420
Let God be true and every man be an untruth in a measure to a degree by chance, in my opinion, they'd say.

642
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:36,080
Yeah, let's soften that because somebody might get offended.

643
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:37,000
Yeah.

644
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:41,720
But the Bible says, let God be true and let every man be a liar.

645
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,020
Where's the squid?

646
00:29:43,780 --> 00:29:46,320
I was going to consummate my marriage up here.

647
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:46,640
Friends.

648
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,580
Are you going to tell him?

649
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,160
Oh, he brought the squid.

650
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,080
Oh, oh, oh, oh, praise Reverend Gordon Zola.

651
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,480
Oh, he brought the squid.

652
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,200
Friends, now.

653
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:57,240
This isn't any, this is just a larval squid.

654
00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,520
This is actually, it's been stunned.

655
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,600
It's still alive, but it's, uh, we've had it in the refrigerator.

656
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:11,860
This is a, for those of you who have, you know, city kids, Yankees, no offense.

657
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:16,860
For those of you who've never known the pleasures of life out of a, you know, a, you know,

658
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:23,860
the small towns in the woods and fields, the cattle ranches, concentration camps, this

659
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,400
animal is known as a prairie squid.

660
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:33,860
You'll notice that it's got a sort of a penis like appendage on the top and a little, almost

661
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:36,880
like a vagina here in the middle.

662
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:43,640
And you know, there's been many a sub genius lad and lass who's gone out into the field

663
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:46,500
with mom and pa were busy going to church.

664
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:51,420
covered their laps with honey or molasses or something,

665
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:54,400
laid and started honking on their squid call,

666
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:55,840
laid back there in the grass,

667
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,240
waiting for that fecund, mighty little cephalopod,

668
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,960
that little mollusk to come crawling up

669
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,540
and join you in sacred matrimony, holy love,

670
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:09,040
with this beautiful little animal.

671
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:10,780
Nowadays, most people,

672
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:13,220
most people, if they even know what a prairie squid is,

673
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:16,120
they see them at the supermarket, dead,

674
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,620
shaved, wrapped up in cellophane

675
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,820
in the freezer compartment.

676
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:25,480
But friends, Bob Dobbs himself had a vision.

677
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,980
He had a vision that someday,

678
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:32,440
someday the skies would break open,

679
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,460
Jehovah One would have mercy on the human race,

680
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:41,240
and literally, prairie squid would rain from the sky.

681
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:43,800
Any pretty squid,

682
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,300
falling from the sky.

683
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:46,480
Any pretty squid,

684
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,360
having a good time.

685
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,060
Any pretty squid,

686
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,820
now they're falling, I know.

687
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,340
Any pretty squid,

688
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:55,060
I'm gonna head to town.

689
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:01,460
Oh, there's nothing like a rain in prairie squid.

690
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:14,880
Princess, we are done.

691
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:15,920
Whoa!

692
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:23,040
backed by Einstein's Secret Orchestra at the Euclid Tavern, Cleveland, 1998.

693
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,980
And now, let's go...

694
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,320
Someone said to Barry McGuire,

695
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,720
said, all you Christians, you're all the same.

696
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,620
You've all been brainwashed.

697
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,980
And Barry thought for a moment, he said, yes, that's true.

698
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,220
But you sinners have been brainwashed also.

699
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:42,620
The only difference between you sinners and us Christians

700
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:47,400
is that us Christians, we have chosen to wash our brains.

701
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:58,280
Well, that seems to be value received for value given, if you ask me, Doug.

702
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:00,080
But friends, when you write to P.O. Box...

703
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:09,380
807 Glen Rose, Texas, 76043.

704
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:11,740
That's Box 807.

705
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:12,600
Glenn Rose.

706
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:15,220
Glenn Rose, Texas, 76043.

707
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:18,020
You can get information, and you don't have to send money.

708
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,580
You'll get lots of printed information.

709
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,840
It'll tell you where to write.

710
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,360
The good sex for mutants in Salt Lake City.

711
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:35,120
We'll send you the little maps of the known existing prairie squid wildlife refuges in your area,

712
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:39,320
if there are any, if you're fortunate enough to live in a part of the country

713
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:42,220
where there are still a few of these precious creatures.

714
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:42,760
Left.

715
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,940
Where they're still legal.

716
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:44,480
Yeah.

717
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,700
Well, they're not really.

718
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,900
Oh, Dr. Dool, you just got back from the mutant beauty contest.

719
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:53,980
Yeah, I was one of the judges at the good sex for mutants dating league

720
00:33:53,980 --> 00:34:00,720
first annual beauty contest in Salt Lake City just ten days ago, Reverend Stan.

721
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:01,540
Those lovely...

722
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:04,920
How were those lovely and disgusting subgenius mutants, Dr. Dool?

723
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:11,140
They were some of the most beautifully disgusting mutated sickly creatures that I have ever seen.

724
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,160
Beautiful mutants.

725
00:34:12,620 --> 00:34:15,940
And there was actually a close runner-up.

726
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,800
She was voted Miss...

727
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,580
Well, we think she was voted Miss Congeniality.

728
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:25,620
It was actually a mutated variation of prairie squid.

729
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,400
Praise Bob.

730
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:28,580
Praise Bob.

731
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:33,300
And it was the biggest, the biggest prairie squid that I have ever seen.

732
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:37,680
I say it was about a hundred and ten pound prairie squid.

733
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:42,600
I think we'll just play this side of the tape out and have that as the male side.

734
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:50,880
And you can run it out and we'll then go over to the other side and talk about the female structure and function.

735
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:57,100
Jimmy the squid, hugely late, came home to see his mate.

736
00:34:57,380 --> 00:35:00,040
Caught her in bed with another squid.

737
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:03,120
He saw red, he flipped his lid.

738
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:31,880
PeterCC spiced his blue crab.

739
00:35:33,500 --> 00:35:35,000
From the

740
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:39,620
The

741
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:41,800
energy says'

742
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,680
systolic contraction, there is now increasing evidence that the connective tissue surrounding

743
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:51,480
the individual muscle cells, as well as the tissue linking the cells, also plays a role.

744
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,360
And I think that about sums up how the prairie squid actually moves, Doctor.

745
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:05,100
And friends, somewhere at the edge of your mind is a sort of a tiny cluster of memories that date

746
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:12,080
back to human prehistory, to a time when every man, or in those days, they weren't men at all,

747
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:18,560
they were yetis. Yes. And the women, even the women were yetis too. And in those days, friend,

748
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:27,120
the prairie squid didn't have to live among horny toads to stay stimulated. It was able to,

749
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:34,980
to, let us say, converse physically with the yetis at any time that they,

750
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:40,480
you know, the yetis, friends, your ancestors, those of you who are true subgeniuses. Except for

751
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:44,940
that one variety of self-stimulating prairie squid, Doctor, which, as you know, became extinct

752
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:51,240
in the late devouring period, I think it was. Yeah, well, that was, there was, yeah, but that

753
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:56,260
was long after the yetis were extinct themselves, and that's probably what killed them off. Now,

754
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:04,000
I'm holding in my hand here a book titled Things You Never Knew Existed, a very forthright

755
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:14,880
friends, one might say, and right here on page 44, there it is, squid, comma, prairie,

756
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:20,400
and there is an entire summation. Now, you can get this information on this prairie squid

757
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:26,120
by merely writing to the Church of the Subgenius. That's right, friend. And if Reverend Stang would

758
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:31,780
be so kind as to give them that sacred box number really quick one more time, and I believe we'll,

759
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:35,080
we might get a guest telephone caller as the lights go on.

760
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:38,340
Well, no, it looks like he's drifted off again, Doctor.

761
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:42,980
Oh, we'll, we'll get one, we'll get one. Friends, that address to write to for more information

762
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:49,100
about J.R. Bob Dobbs, the only, only individual who could save your soul and then give it back

763
00:37:49,100 --> 00:38:03,080
to you again, that address for Bob is Subgenius Foundation, P.O. Box 140306, dear friend,

764
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,640
in Dallas, Texas.

765
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:14,980
5214. And, uh, oh, friends, you don't know what, you don't know what, what could be coming your way

766
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:21,980
in the mail once you sign up with this amazing church with your free information. Uh, you can

767
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:27,680
find out the inside story on not, not just things like prairie squid. You can find out

768
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:31,380
why you've been losing at the races and how to start winning again.

769
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,000
How come you didn't get that big raise at your conspiracy job?

770
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,360
That you're nailed to.

771
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,300
How come that special date with her didn't work out?

772
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,600
And remember that first time you found you couldn't do it for the second time? Yes, friends,

773
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,260
that's the only, almost as scary as the second time you find that you can't do it for the

774
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:51,820
first time.

775
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,780
It's scary, friends. It's a scary, scary world out there. People, you won't have to see what

776
00:38:58,780 --> 00:38:59,400
you can do.

777
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:04,520
You won't have these problems if you just let Bob solve them for you. Get right with

778
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:05,080
Dobbs.

779
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:07,000
Let Bob into your life, friends.

780
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,080
Let Bob into your heart. You need Bob. You have to have Bob.

781
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,620
You have to have him.

782
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,880
You better have him.

783
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,740
You know you want him.

784
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,400
Because I'll tell you, friends, when those...

785
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,360
You have to have it.

786
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:22,220
Because when those end times come down, if you're not right with Bob, you're gonna

787
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:22,980
fry.

788
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,280
And you'll probably deserve it.

789
00:39:26,420 --> 00:39:27,680
You will deserve it.

790
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,980
You'll wish you could die, friends. You'll wish you could die. But Bobby...

791
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,640
But it'll be worse.

792
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:35,080
Oh, Bobby, he won't let you. He won't let you die. You'll be going, Bob, kill me.

793
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,080


794
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:35,080


795
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,660
Give me a car right now.

796
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:41,000
Please, Bob. You didn't tell me the end times was gonna be worse than a Sidney Sheldon

797
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,580
mini-series on TV.

798
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,560
Friends, we're gonna take that collar right now.

799
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,780
Where are we gonna take it to?

800
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,320
...continues to be shaken under these conditions.

801
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:52,760
Squid.

802
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:54,520
It's squid.

803
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,280
It's been a long time since we've been trapped by the tiny...

804
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:56,740
You've got squid all over.

805
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,420
Well, you know what?

806
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,180
That's a squid ick for the uninitiated.

807
00:39:59,180 --> 00:40:01,600
Yes, this is the show that continues to be trapped by the tiny collars.

808
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,420
An icky squid is a sticky pill.

809
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,920
You call in, we are forced to listen to you.

810
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:05,080
They always just say, you know what?

811
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,080


812
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,080


813
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:05,080


814
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:05,620
They had the academy.

815
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,060
That's right. An icky squid is one that's actually ick-

816
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:09,060
And if you were just to call in-

817
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:09,700
The ick-theus.

818
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:10,800
What is ick-theology?

819
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,020
If you're awake, it won't make a difference.

820
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,920
It's a giant ick-theosaur.

821
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:16,160
No, you're asleep right now, and this is the ugly show.

822
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:20,000
Is that a squid, or is that an ick-theosaur in central California at this hour?

823
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,460
...and even people in the building refuse to listen to you.

824
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,400
Well, let's hear what that other collar has to say.

825
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:25,280
Okay.

826
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:27,100
Oh, he's calling another collar.

827
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:27,940
Let's see what he has to say.

828
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,980
He's calling another collar.

829
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,780
It's a chain reaction.

830
00:40:29,840 --> 00:40:32,480
Call callers and find out what they have to say.

831
00:40:32,540 --> 00:40:35,080
The last person who broke the chain, something terrible happened.

832
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:36,120
So don't do anything.

833
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:36,940
That's the way you're adjusting-

834
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,840
Do what it says and call the next collar.

835
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:39,820
...relevations of this-

836
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:41,760
Squid Jiggin' Ground.

837
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:48,980
The man with the whisker is old Jacob Steele.

838
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,200
He's getting well up but he's still pretty sound.

839
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:59,360
While Uncle Bob Hawkins wears six pair of stockings whenever he's out on Squid Jiggin'

840
00:40:59,360 --> 00:40:59,700
Ground.

841
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,460
Holy smoke, what a scuffle.

842
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:04,940
All the hands are excited.

843
00:41:04,940 --> 00:41:05,060
I don't know how many people in the building know what you're doing.

844
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,060


845
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,060


846
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,060


847
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,060


848
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,060


849
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,060


850
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:05,060


851
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:08,360
It's a wonder to me that there's nobody drowned

852
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,880
There's a bustle, confusion, a wonderful hustle

853
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:16,160
They're all jigging squid on squid-jigging ground

854
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,400
Says Bobby, the squids are on top of the water

855
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:24,720
I just got me jiggers about a one-five and down

856
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,000
But a squid in the boat's curled right down his throat

857
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:32,440
And he's swearing like mad on squid-jigging ground

858
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:37,840
There's poor Uncle Billy, his whiskers are spattered

859
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:41,000
With spots of the squid juice that's flying around

860
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:45,380
One poor little boy got it right in the eye

861
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:48,780
But they don't give a darn on squid-jigging ground

862
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:54,020
Now if ever you feel inclined to go squid

863
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,420
Then leave your white collars behind in the town

864
00:41:57,420 --> 00:42:01,900
And if you get cranky without your silk hanky

865
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:05,020
Better steer clear on the squid-jigging ground

866
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,620
And you'll see the squid down around New Orleans

867
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,320
But I don't know about that Delta squid

868
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,400
It kinda tastes muddy

869
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,260
That's my favorite kind, boy

870
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,060
You like that, with red beans and rice going down

871
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:45,740
Yeah, after you use them, I'll only eat them after they've been used

872
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:46,800
Well, they aren't even good

873
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,960
That's right, they're tough

874
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:50,680
You gotta soften them up a bit

875
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,120
Gotta tenderize them a little, as the doctor would say

876
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:54,880
Ah yes, ah yes

877
00:42:58,220 --> 00:43:02,420
You drink a whole lot of Everclear and eat as much pan chili as you can

878
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:02,420


879
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:02,980
Exactly

880
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:05,340
To make the compost

881
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,740
Yeah, well the idea is to find that cosmic termite queen

882
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:11,600
You gotta get on that termite queen

883
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,520
And as it spews out them little termite, you know

884
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:18,160
Those little babes with the high heel shoes

885
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,860
The little termite go-go girls, you know

886
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:24,360
Those are gonna propel you through space

887
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:27,440
So compost's no good unless you got the termites too?

888
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,480
They don't need the compost

889
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:29,800
One corn, one dollar

890
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,420
Yeah, one good loaded up termite

891
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:33,680
The termite queen will get you there

892
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,560
Actually, that might explain it right there

893
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:36,560
And back

894
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:36,920
Yeah

895
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,660
Now, now, now, wait a minute

896
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:44,700
I mean, you know, we, we, have we forgotten the prairie squid

897
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,300
If we drifted so far from our roots

898
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,360
From primordial America

899
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:54,220
That we no longer remember the prairie squid

900
00:43:54,220 --> 00:43:57,840
We're talking about termite queens pulsating their giant egg sacs

901
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,840
Prairie squid is so A's, Reverend Stang, come on

902
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:01,720
It was the pumpkin

903
00:44:01,720 --> 00:44:02,700
It was the pumpkin

904
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:03,180
So A's

905
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:05,020
Prairie squid get on the pumpkin

906
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:06,460
Zero biological

907
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:06,880
Ride the pumpkin

908
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,920
What is a prairie squid?

909
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,700
Ride the bug

910
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,400
You gotta get on that bug queen

911
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,420
Prairie squid and stretch it around the pumpkin

912
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:15,180
Woo hoo

913
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:21,100
Well, hey, well, you West Coast people are into that kind of stuff

914
00:44:21,100 --> 00:44:26,380
That's a little bit, that's a little bit advanced for us Midwesterners

915
00:44:26,380 --> 00:44:30,260
A one, a two, a one, two, three, four

916
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:34,880
La Holk

917
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,340
La Holk

918
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:35,940
La Holk

919
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:39,660
…

920
00:44:39,660 --> 00:44:39,700
Way up there

921
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:39,700


922
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,460
Oh, ho there

923
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:41,460


924
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:41,460


925
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:41,460


926
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:42,480
Lone

927
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:42,660
1918

928
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:51,380
He's gone

929
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:53,080
It changes

930
00:44:58,220 --> 00:44:59,260
L 드

931
00:44:59,260 --> 00:44:59,300
Only kind we pouvoir

932
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:02,540
that we had ever seen before.

933
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:03,720
Seem to flow.

934
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,100
83-D Squids.

935
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,920
83-D Squids.

936
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,640
83-D Squids.

937
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,280
83-D Squids.

938
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:12,920
83-D Squids.

939
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:14,660
83-D Squids.

940
00:45:14,660 --> 00:45:16,260
83-D Squids.

941
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:17,820
I got them head to toe.

942
00:45:18,940 --> 00:45:22,280
I'm afraid this child's covered with 83-D Squids, Doctor.

943
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,220
Look at them wiggly squids.

944
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:30,980
Look at them wiggly squids.

945
00:45:30,980 --> 00:45:33,100
We pulled off to the side.

946
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,440
We just knew they wanted to ride.

947
00:45:37,320 --> 00:45:39,740
The sweetest squid you'll ever know.

948
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,200
Blow you right through the door.

949
00:45:44,600 --> 00:45:46,640
83-D Squids.

950
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,120
83-D Squids.

951
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,020
83-D Squids.

952
00:45:50,040 --> 00:45:51,760
83-D Squids.

953
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,380
83-D Squids.

954
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:58,320
There comes a tentacle.

955
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,340
Oh, no, no, it's two.

956
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:02,820
Three.

957
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,920
Watch out, there's three or four squids over there.

958
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,060
My God, one of them is a Greek squid.

959
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:09,880
It's okay.

960
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,200
Embrace the tentacle, boys.

961
00:46:11,260 --> 00:46:12,260
Embrace the tentacle.

962
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,600
Embrace the tentacle.

963
00:46:16,620 --> 00:46:17,580
Oh, yeah.

964
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:21,080
Okay, I'll embrace the squid.

965
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:21,700
Come on, officers, on your knees.

966
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,760
Oh, it's starting to feel good.

967
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:29,020
I always embrace the squid back at the station.

968
00:46:29,300 --> 00:46:33,820
I said, if you're ever out in your ride,

969
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:37,340
don't think you have to hide.

970
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,680
Is that right, Captain?

971
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:40,380
When you see some hairy pink, pink snow

972
00:46:41,860 --> 00:46:48,040
coming down from the sky,

973
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,300
just pull on over, let them come inside.

974
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:54,780
Falling prairie squid is the best, best kind.

975
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,300
And you sub-Dinos enjoy the ride.

976
00:46:58,380 --> 00:46:59,040
And then, um,

977
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:02,360
83D squids, they're falling from the sky.

978
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,660
83D squids, they're falling from the sky.

979
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:05,820
One of them is your sister.

980
00:47:06,180 --> 00:47:09,060
83D squids, they're coming on now.

981
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:12,560
83D squids, now that's slack galore.

982
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:15,600
83D squids, get beside.

983
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,280
83D squids, they're falling from the sky.

984
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,940
83D squids, come on.

985
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,520
83D squids, I can't believe it, mon.

986
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,240
I can't believe we got this.

987
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:31,400
I can't believe we got this far either.

988
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:31,760
Yeah.

989
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,960
Don't congratulate yourself yet.

990
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,740
We still have these squids to deal with.

991
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,860
Oh no.

992
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:45,560
They're pretty damned potent, aren't they?

993
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,480
Oh no.

994
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,380
83D squids.

995
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,060
83D squids.

996
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,280
Falling from the sky.

997
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,180
83D squids.

998
00:47:58,240 --> 00:47:59,020
Come on, let's go.

999
00:47:59,020 --> 00:47:59,880
83D squids, the picture is so high.

1000
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,160
83D squids, they're falling on now.

1001
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:04,880
83D squids.

1002
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:06,680
83D squids.

1003
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:08,500
83D squids.

1004
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:09,500
83D squids.

1005
00:48:10,240 --> 00:48:11,660
83D squids.

1006
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,580
83D squids.

1007
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:14,900
83D squids.

1008
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:16,920
83D squids.

1009
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:20,280
83D squids.

1010
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,220
83D squids.

1011
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:23,920
Oh.

1012
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:25,000
Oh.

1013
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:28,400
Oh.

1014
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:29,000
Oh.

1015
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:29,000


1016
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:56,960
83D Squid

1017
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:01,240
Friends, a studio version from Einstein's Secret Orchestra Swamp Radio

1018
00:49:01,240 --> 00:49:05,000
with Princess We Are Doe, Lonesome Cowboy Dave, and Chaz Smith, and Bleepo.

1019
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:11,420
Stay tuned, friends, for a rare type of the short-lived Sister Chris of WFMU of old,

1020
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,660
no matter what you think of our love.

1021
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:20,600
Look, back in... I mean, I don't care how repugnant the idea of Prairie Squid,

1022
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:24,800
a physical love with a land mollusk,

1023
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:26,740
is maybe repugnant.

1024
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,260
...to some of these more polished ears of these San Francisco liberals.

1025
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:35,140
We're gonna nail these guys, let me tell you.

1026
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:41,400
I think so. We got enough lawyers, we got enough money, we got time, we got press releases, I think.

1027
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:45,360
That's right, we have the sponsors. The listeners are gonna sponsor us.

1028
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:46,140
We got it, so...

1029
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:56,540
Well, the survey tested 25 suggestive words and phrases all less sensitive than the famous, quote,

1030
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:56,940
seven-word phrase.

1031
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:57,760
Seven dirty words.

1032
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:04,840
Uh, terms receiving the highest unfavorable reaction were Prairie Squid, Slack...

1033
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:22,480
Hello, this is Dr. Chris, and your turn to WFMU, Cephalodically Speaking,

1034
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:26,860
where I will, uh, try to educate the public on...

1035
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,960
...everything you've always wanted to know about Prairie Squids, but were afraid to ask.

1036
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:39,260
Most people today, whether they are single, married, divorced, monogamous, gregarious,

1037
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:46,060
or even downright slutty, are unaware of the importance of the nearly instinct Prairie Squid.

1038
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:53,220
This widespread ignorance is the cause of much dissatisfaction with regards to our slippery habits.

1039
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,900
So, for first, you should know...

1040
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:04,380
...that the Prairie Squid is an intelligent, albeit wild, crazy, and unpredictable mollusk...

1041
00:51:04,380 --> 00:51:13,260
...possessed of a long, tubular body, two cardal fins, many suckers on its myriad tentacles, and highly developed eyes.

1042
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:14,700
Or should I say eye?

1043
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:21,680
When the Prairie Squid is excited, such as in the instance of being engaged in the act of social intercourse,

1044
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:24,560
they emit a copious amount of black ink.

1045
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,500
It is this ink...

1046
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:26,940
...that is...

1047
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:27,620
...used...

1048
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:28,200
...in...

1049
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:34,280
...to enhance the sensations inheriting what the teenagers of today anachronistically call...

1050
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,160
...squidding.

1051
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:43,840
It is sad to note that our friend, the Prairie Squid, is no longer an integral part of our modern relationships.

1052
00:51:44,340 --> 00:51:52,140
They have been shunned by the puritanical segment of society, and have been herded into these so-called Prairie Squid reservations.

1053
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:56,860
It is on these reservations that the Prairie Squid is harassed...

1054
00:51:56,940 --> 00:51:57,940
...abused...

1055
00:51:57,940 --> 00:51:59,200
...and what have you...

1056
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,000
...by the neo-Nazi groups who even go so far as to lynch these creatures.

1057
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:11,620
They become self-pitying, fourth-class citizen mollusks, suffering from such psychological problems as...

1058
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:12,480
...alcoholism...

1059
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,760
...drug abuse...

1060
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:14,720
...gambling...

1061
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:15,940
...depression...

1062
00:52:15,940 --> 00:52:17,580
...and most tragically, suicide.

1063
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:24,200
There is a hopeful future for the Prairie Squids, thanks to the efforts of the subgenius foundation.

1064
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:26,920
They are establishing safe outposts...

1065
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:34,780
...in prairie squid centers all across the U.S. to combat the malicious neglect and prejudice against the prairie squid.

1066
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:44,200
Food, shelter and recreation programs utilizing purient underground adult comic books are just the beginning for our struggle...

1067
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:50,760
...to reinstate the prairie squids to the rightful place in the master bedrooms of the world.

1068
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:54,360
But this requires money.

1069
00:52:54,360 --> 00:53:00,620
And the subgenius foundation's funds for the SUPS programs are dwindling to dangerous levels.

1070
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:06,200
So please, won't you find it in your heart to give to the Save Our Prairie Squid program?

1079
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:39,880
I want you to either stand up or shut up.

1080
00:54:40,180 --> 00:54:40,820
That's right.

1081
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,740

1083

00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:31,780
In the pink car lounge, that's a sandbar, worked the former Miss Lake Champlain.

1097
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:39,760
A beautiful mollusk, a real living dollusk, her name, it was Glamity Jane.

1098
00:58:41,080 --> 00:58:47,960
Now this dive was as hard as a barnacle, it was real barracuda terrain.

1099
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:56,200
Where the groupers and grunts pulled unsavory stunts, which was tough on poor Glamity Jane.

1100
00:58:57,180 --> 00:59:04,820
One night through the door swam a stranger, to the corner he squirted and slid.

1101
00:59:05,960 --> 00:59:12,980
All the fish in the room grew as hushed as a tune, and they saw it was Billy the Squid.

1102
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:17,300
He said, Glammy, I done hurt your feelings.

1103
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:21,620
And I've caused you some pain, this I know.

1104
00:59:22,720 --> 00:59:29,340
But before it's too late, I'm gonna go straight, or as straight as a squid can go.

1105
00:59:30,380 --> 00:59:33,800
He asked for her hand, but she had none.

1106
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,580
And to prove it, she lifted her lid.

1107
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:42,500
Then how about a foot, and her foot out she put.

1108
00:59:42,660 --> 00:59:45,520
It's a beauty, said Billy the Squid.

1109
00:59:46,380 --> 00:59:47,940
Then he gathered up.

1110
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,100
He gathered her up in his tentacles.

1111
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,800
And as into the sunset they rid.

1112
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:59,000
She looked at him clammily, let's start a family.

1113
