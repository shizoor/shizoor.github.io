Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show, except
that actually it's not.
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays
and holy days and the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of salad.
Selling.
Selling.
Yes.
Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.
But anyway, happy whatever you do.
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.
It's cool, man.
Cool.
And praise Bob and the whole world.
Oh.

Oh.
I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree.

I wish I had that problem.
Definitely.
I have to give it back.
I have to.
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree
When this angel heard
A dreadful fear went right into my heart
Those pine tree needles sting me
Ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-ding-dong
You'll never know how much that smarts
So who put the stump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong
Who stood the wood where I boop-sheep-boop-sheep-boop
Who put the stick up my hip-a-dip-a-dip
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush
He made this angel beg for mercy, please
Too tight, too tight
Too tight, too tight
And I'm gonna say to you
It's already 9 p.m.
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him
Don't go walking down to the bar
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard
I mean, I'm gonna park my store and look at the credits
And in the right
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw, yeah
And I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells
Till I get to bed
I have chainsaw fixed and back in my arm the way it was Tuesday
Now you boys be good and I'll give you some of this here
Apple mango pie
You ain't no good of a child
That dog's running off with them brain cells
Can you do something about that, boy?
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right

Oh, Jazz is giving,

Boy, I really need one of those.
What am I going to do about Laundromat and his suit, though?
I need the show bath.
The show de-lousing.
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.
That's enough of that.
Oh, he's got headphones.
I also have the part of my pancreas
that I'd like to show you now.
It's been increased in size to...
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.
Look, it's swelling.
I actually have the capability of a man

I'll put more pills out for everybody.
Oh, those pills.
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.
And my brain feel like it's a puddle

I'm shocked by the...
The red pills are really good.
I like to take the red one and the blue one

We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.
It will empower this resistance.
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.
It will be a baller for kids.
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?
Good has lots of muscles.
Good. Good!
The primitive Earth societies should accept this value judgment.
Good will have great physical attributes according to human desires.
Sexual desires.
Latent in children.

Once upon a time, there was the baby Jesus, and he had two eyes made out of coal.
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.
And he wanted his two front teeth
And he got McDonald's gift certificates
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper
And he took all the presents from Whoville
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy
But he couldn't
He wanted 10s and 20s, 10s and 20s
And he got McDonald's gift certificates
And he got Zuzu's pedals
And that's the real story of Christmas

Santa Claus
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas
He wanted an electric train
He had the whole thing in his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up
What was his dream?
Which would be increasingly likely?

He would dream so hard that the whole thing would come to the light right before his eyes
To be continued

Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy-looking train set with locomotives and freight cars.
And a station and a gateman.
The mortar tower and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.
So grand that you might think Tommy was waiting for something that just didn't exist.
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.
It is turnover.
The time of the year when all things sell.
The end of the year sale.
So come and get it, everyone.
And just buy it.
Buy our products.
Now, are we...
I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.
But the present subgenie tried to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now.
And sell everything to the pigs.
Oh, yes.
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.
And it was something else in between there.
Before it was...
After it was a pagan holiday and before it was a...
Shopping season it was something else.
But I think they started the war over it.

Really? The historical Saint Nicholas?
Over the trinity of God
The original Saint Nicholas in Turkey?
Who the hell is God?
Who the hell is God?
Who the hell is God?
Ask Dobbs one day
Who the hell is God?
That's the question we should be asking
Suddenly, a lightning bolt struck from nowhere on that bright sunny day
Bob did a backflip and from that day on, he too was a believer
And from the snowdrift truck, a little child bearing flowers emerged
Each one a dirty flower
The historical Santa Claus is originally lived, as the caller knows,
as a bishop in, uh, was it, was it Constantinople?
Yeah, like one of those
It was an ancient Byzantium
Asia Minor in general, yeah
Yes, he was, and he was, uh, he was known for
sneaking into the rooms of young women and leaving
gifts
Light-sized lumps of coal, complete with a fake beard and a CIA Wall Street credit card
A saint he was
Well, that's the thing that Saint Nicholas invented the CIA
That's good, that's, you got it, brother
He snuck into people's houses through the chimney
You got it, brother
They knew when they were sleeping, they knew when, he knew when they were awake
That, you got it, brother
But like the CIA, he was
That's Foucault, baby
He was protecting them
Foucault knew that Saint Nick was a creepin', stinkin' spy
What?
He knows when you've been sleeping
He knows what you've been eating
Hey, man, my kids still believe in Saint Nicholas
And who keeps that belief alive in their fevered, sick little eyes?
It'll break your...
Madison Avenue, of course
No, the surveillance community
And Disney
Under your direction
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company
Miller Bear, you know
He's a very powerful being, if you're bad, he punishes you
If you're good, he rewards you
He's probably the closest thing to Jesus, walking the earth
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is
He rewards those who knows when they are smiling when they're awake
I think, I think really if you want to make a deal, you have to do it with, you know
Could Dr. Claus in fact be the...
...hungering, quote, milkman rumored to have fathered our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?
Well, we find it a very likely possibility from the falsified documents we have here
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on Bob's feet
You better watch out
You better not
You better not tell them, tell them you won't
Saint Nicholas is coming
To town
He's broken in this chocolate twas
Gonna find out who's nobody in there
Saint Nicholas is coming
To town
He knows when you're awake
He knows when you're in bad or good
So be goodness, goodness sake
Oh, you better watch out
You better not tell them, tell them you won't

Can you believe that?
The kids were asking if their parents, maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets
And the mom said no, no, he won't because he bills us, we can't afford that
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas
Yeah, but at least he totes the note

I sort of understand because I understood the way any old fool would understand.
There was no Jesus.
No flatulent old woman waving her panties over the wall.

There was no Jesus on the hill.
It's not that you don't want to. It's that they won't let you.
No, there's just a cry in the wilderness.

I am yours truly, Rudy Ray Moore, bold and still beautiful.
Baby, I want to talk to you for this Christmas,
because Christmas holds a lot of memories for me.
Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmas time.
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old.
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece,
and the health department made us take them down.
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece,

I remember my father well, you know.
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.
He used to have, you know what caused it then?
He used to put a stocking cap on his head,
and put a knock light in front of it.
Daddy wake up with that stumping headache,
and he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad.
Said, I don't know what Santa's gonna get y'all for Christmas,
but he gonna bring you something.
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside,
and shot up in the air, and come back inside,
and told us the biggest lie ever heard.
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new century?
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle,
but Satan claws?
Whose father, Paul Bunyan,
and whose mother, Big Sister,
created the conspiracy?
Before there were malls,
there was no such thing as Christmas.
Yes, there was a down-home Norman Rockwell style,
it's a wonderful life type of Christmas.
It was a kite-flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas,
not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.
Rolled holy dough.
It was a...
When your little brother fell through a hole in the aisle,
he was a little boy.

Sometimes he'd sit around by the porch,
or maybe some decent,
and he'd curse in the family,
just drunk himself.
And Uncle Bud,
and we pulled him,
and we pulled him,
and we pulled him,
and we pulled him,
and then we'd put candles,
like most people have,
and he would have that smile on his face,
and a big red nose,
But today, Christmas has lost its meaning.
He'd have beaten the crap out of Santa Claus.
Scott, you made your choice.
When you rejected me,
my word, you rejected me.
And to your eternal soul,
you have found that only could you afford
to give to God that which was his.
But you could not afford to do otherwise.
The Senate still stands.
In the outer darkness,
where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir.
I don't want to go to hell, sir.
Sir, no, no.
I don't want to go to hell.
No!
No!
As alive as he could be.
And the children saved,
who could laugh and play just the same.
You and me.
The tail-bearer will be at the judgment.

Well, what do you think I am?
Tell me.
Please!
When I'm friends,
I will lose my sei t,

when I lack memory,
He would listen,
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.
Dare I ask it? Yes.
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?
The answer? Yes, definitely.
Take that and shove it up the tube, mark certainty,
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.
Merry Christmas to all! Now you're all gonna die!
The night Santa went crazy
The night Saint Nick went insane
Realized he'd been getting the wrong deal
Something finally must have snapped in his brain
Well the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet
And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage
He got dancer and prancer with an old German Luger
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger
And he picked up a flamethrower and a barbecue blitzer
And he took a flamethrower and a barbecue blitzer
And he grabbed a big bite, and said it tastes just like chicken
The night Santa went crazy
The night Kris Kringle went nuts
Now you can't hardly walk around the North Pole
Without stepping in reindeer guts
There's the National Guard and the FBI
There's a van from the Eyewitness News

The time of the Lord
Of the fat man of the crowd
How many before you reach your limit?
How many do you get?
Jesuses
Jesuses?
Yeah, how many can you bag?
How many Messiahs can you bag?
Hail Jesuses
If you're doing it in season
If you're doing it out of season
You need a special permit
Oh, you never do
And you can only take one
You never bag the Lord in C
You bag the Lord in B flat
So you get that kind of rough sound
But when there's a season




When you're in season
It's every God for himself
This is the season for the fighting Jesus
Obviously
We're between a rock and a hard place
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea
In the old age
And he got a very, very hard foot
And he got elephantiasis of the rectum
You know, it's not something well known
By many Christian scholars
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was
Chalam chalam
Well, I like the story
I kind of like those stories
Where the Lord dies
And then comes to your grave
To America and settles
You know, tames the West
I like when he moves into a trailer park
I like the cowboy job
With his dog
Jesus fought for the Confederate Army
The Ranger
I like the Texas Ranger
Jesus, Texas Ranger
Johnny Rambo was Jesus
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police
Or maybe the Hopi police force
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus
He was the white brother
Billy Jack
Instruct the Indians how to be liberal
Well, what about
Old Peacemaker
The Jesus of the Iroquois
Who was actually Huron
A Huron
You didn't know that, did you?
I gotcha
Jesus
Elrond
I got a Jesus
Like no other Jesus you've ever seen
Oh, it tastes like butter
A different Jesus
It tastes like
A few crappy pieces
Like Jesus
A pipe-smoking Jesus
Hey, Dave, you know where it is
Go kick that window open
I already kicked it
I'll kick it again, though
Okay, I'll kick it again, though
Kick it good this time
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God
We hope that
We thank you for all the nice things
That you've done for us
This Thanksgiving
Clap it
We appreciate all that
And we're just trying to insult your fan club
That's all
That's why we do this blasphemy stuff
But we knew that you knew that
Because you're in all things and everything, right?
Jesus
Right, I could hear him say that
Praise God and Bob
And Jesus
And God and Jesus
And the devil
Next topic
Terrorist insurance
And the atheist
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?
And science
Well, that's the life of Brian, isn't it?

And Norse mythology

Santa and his reindeer
Are really wicked
Wrapped in wrapping paper
We're gonna break our necks

Sleigh ride to heck
The elves are full of cheer
The kids are tucked in

Their dreams are filled with toys
But they're out of luck

The greatest scary Christmas song ever, friends,
from his new album, Don't Trust Whitey,
James Kochalka, Superstar.
You know, see, a subgenius has so much faith
that he not only can accept
somebody making fun of him,
but he can also make fun of Bob,
stomping on a picture of Bob.
He'll do it himself.
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.
Now, we subgeni,
I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,
but we subgeni may be bad,
but our way of bad is holy,
is holy compared to the evil of so many,
not all, by any means,
but so many American fundamentalists,
charismatics, evangelicals, etc., in general, of course,
and we're not going to be doing that.
They and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya,
South Africa, etc., if you ask me,
are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve.
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends,
just like Jesus warned about.
We're, Jesus and Bob, like we say,
our old drinking buddies, got nothing against Jesus.
It's just his fan club.
And now, we aren't saying that Bob is the ace up God's sleeve.
He's more like the smear on God's handkerchief,
just like Jesus.
Just like you or me.
But the uptight rival cults,
they don't think God has a handkerchief.
Uh-uh, no, because God's perfect.
He doesn't even sneeze.
We're made in his image,
except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us,
and we have to go in the secret room,
the bathroom,
to do awful things.
But God, oh, he's clean and pure,
according to them.
Oh, and he's male,
but he doesn't excrete juices and sweat
and smelly stuff out of him like we do.
Because we sin.
Oh, yeah, we all sin.
We're bad.
We're worthless.
We're no good to God,
unless we sign a contract with his agent.
We interrupt this program
for a special promotional announcement.
We turn.
Bob and the bastards of the universe
will be back after this message.
Yes, we'll wow Bob by dying!
Anything good from Bob?
Oh, don't pout, Bob.

Please, stop.

You won't see us again.
Over the ancient god's head
Just like the ones I used to know
Buried tree, soft smoky
An windshield baby said
Pear-paned on surface snow
I'm dreaming about the kids you guys have.
If everyone can come back right.
May your days be rich and short.
And may all your guns can be white.
Bye.

What do you think?
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob,
as he's been referred to in some early prescriptures?
You need to know where to write to the Jethro's, they're at...

It's all Christmassy right now. There's a bright green bob in the window and Christmassy
lights.
Is there a DJA? Is DJA out there?
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.
No, that's something just left for DJA.
It's all Christmassy.



It's all Christmassy. It's all wrapped up in a perfumed ribbon-wrapped present under the tree.
Smell that cinnamon.
Open the door all the way so we can see if he comes in.
And those sugar plums. Something's up the chimney hole in sight and it's his name.
Yeah.
Of Santa, I mean.
Otherwise, gosh, I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.
Our beloved Santa.
I have wanted to...
Put your bag down for a minute.

Hey Bob!




Don't go there, don't go there.
Long cow Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?
Don't despair just because it's Christmas.
Children there are so gay at Christmas.
All the children on the street hope they get something good to eat.
But for me, it's not so great.
Fuck!
Fuck Christmas!
It was the night before Christmas and all through the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse
The stockings were hung by the tree
Merry fucking Christmas
Merry fucking Christmas
Merry fucking Christmas
Merry fucking Christmas
To you
Merry fucking Christmas
Merry fucking Christmas
Merry fucking Christmas
Merry fucking Christmas
Merry fucking Christmas
Merry fucking Christmas
Rockin' in the winter wonderland
Jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle bells, jingle...
Wheeee!
