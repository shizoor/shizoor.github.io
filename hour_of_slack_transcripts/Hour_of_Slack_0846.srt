1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
It's chaotic.

2
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:55,880
It's gonna be a particularly crazed show tonight.

3
00:00:56,020 --> 00:00:56,820
That's okay.

4
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,580
In a few moments, you will be wide awake.

5
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,760
Now, I'm going to count to three,

6
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:04,140
and when I reach three, your eyes will open.

7
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,460
You will be wide awake, feeling completely refreshed,

8
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:11,360
in fact, feeling better than you have in a long, long time.

9
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,720
You're going to feel fantastic.

10
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:14,740
On the count of three, wide awake.

11
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,640
One, drifting up higher and higher.

12
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,260
You are now drifting up farther and farther and farther.

13
00:01:21,380 --> 00:01:22,840
Such a beautiful feeling.

14
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:26,300
Two, drifting up a little bit higher now

15
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:28,880
and a little bit farther, coming up higher and higher.

16
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,440
In fact, you are now almost awake, just about there,

17
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:33,520
eyes opening.

18
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:34,660
Three.

19
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,020
Now, there's like hideous,

20
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:43,220
worms of reincarnation in the hell spirit world

21
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:46,040
that you don't even know about because you're too ignorant.

22
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,280
Ignorant because you're just a listener, that's all.

23
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,400
Just a mere listener.

24
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,960
Oh, the pathetic fool.

25
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,920
The earth fool.

26
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:58,160
Oh, ye stiff-legged.

27
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,300
Ye, ye pathetic, third-dimensional creatures.

28
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:09,620
If you could but know, could but dream for an instant of that which could await you,

29
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:13,200
were you good enough to...

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,180
Friends, friends, there's no escape.

31
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:18,820
I guess we should...

32
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:34,000
Jehovah and his son, Jesus, are strange gods.

33
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,360
We see ye eat ye no more.

34
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:40,620
And now then, I wish God would give me a Holy Ghost machine and I'd blow your head off.

35
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,440
Latter of us.

36
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:46,140
Have a big time, the refrigerator full of beer.

37
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,360
The cigarette smacks on the fingers.

38
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,700
The dirty jokes that came from evil hearts.

39
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,960
God forgotten.

40
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:54,800
Now I want to tell you, brother, this generation of youth

41
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,340
has been raised in an environment like that.

42
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,860
I hate to be a son.

43
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:00,260
as negative as I am tonight

44
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,580
But they've been raised in an environment

45
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,040
of sexual lust

46
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,180
They've been raised in an environment

47
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,500
I forget God

48
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,680
Monkey rectums

49
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,700
Hot oil massages

50
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:15,600
X-Wing magazines

51
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,920
Get mine

52
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,160
Live it up

53
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:19,180
Forget God

54
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,000
Sin

55
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,420
Get mine

56
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,540
Live it up

57
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,660
Forget God

58
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:27,400
Make all the sexual conquests you can make

59
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,000
They've been raised in an environment

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,320
of

61
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,820
So rule my country

62
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,340
They've been raised in an environment

63
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:33,860
of

64
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,500
Gently awakening us into remembering

65
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,640
who and what we are

66
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:45,680
But there are other ways we can be communicated with

67
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,040
besides the obvious evidence

68
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,920
Don't have to raise a single man for my dad

69
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,360
I don't need to get you serious

70
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,860
I don't need to get you serious

71
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,720
I don't need to get you serious

72
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,040
I don't need to get you serious

73
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,340
I don't need to give you a compulsive attitude

74
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,880
I lost my father

75
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,160
Because he lost his family

76
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,700
He said I'm not the worst

77
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:02,700


78
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,040
This world And my girls

79
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,040


80
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,040


81
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,040


82
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:05,040


83
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,640
We grab our life

84
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,300
Oh oh oh

85
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,260
Its not fair

86
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:09,640
Gonna know who's God

87
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,200
那 Connect in the emphasize

88
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:12,340
I need the Miles

89
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,700
They had no칙

90
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,900
but I know who he was

91
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,320
Who will I become

92
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:18,540
I can't chime with his comments

93
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,620
What he did was good

94
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:19,620


95
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,000
You got to let everyone know how I feel

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,400
I'm just stupid he's patronizing on YouTube

97
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,200
slash interbulator.

98
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:33,640
That's spelled E-N-T-U-R-bulator.

99
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,280
That's right.

100
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:36,780
I mean, here we are.

101
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,520
Your mind's left nostril in front of the speakers.

102
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:43,120
To represent pictures which themselves represent actual live,

103
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,060
let's say it, human naked women,

104
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:49,380
which themselves represent for us, in a way, an ideal,

105
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:53,100
which we as lads can never attain.

106
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:53,620
Truly attain.

107
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,900
Unless we go down to the red light district over there in Holland Headland.

108
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:02,000
Unless you work construction night and day and save your dollars and dimes

109
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,680
and eat bologna sandwiches for lunch instead

110
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,780
when everybody's getting that hot stewed biscuit and left nostril pie.

111
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:09,820
You're in the backyard eating your own chickens.

112
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:12,440
You know, but it doesn't have to be that way.

113
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,560
Some people are less uptight about it.

114
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:21,080
The butch people of Neanderthal land display their women and their wares

115
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:22,320
right up front of boys.

116
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,080
Whatever.

117
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,860
Right up front they have memorials to the...

118
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,360
The drool.

119
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,380
Well, let's go ahead and say it.

120
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,020
The drool.

121
00:05:31,140 --> 00:05:35,220
The jism cartel and the jism conspiracies.

122
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:35,700
Jolene.

123
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:40,240
They won't let you even talk about it anymore in the open.

124
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:43,240
Because of the jizney corporation, of course.

125
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,180
Well, they want to keep our depleted mankind accordion from expanding.

126
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,020
The jizney corporation.

127
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:51,780
Suddenly.

128
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:52,220
Suddenly.

129
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,200
Jizneyland.

130
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,880
The all creator himself.

131
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,620
There's jizneyland and jizneyworld.

132
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:59,280
Whack jizney, the creator of all creators.

133
00:05:59,600 --> 00:05:59,660
Euro jizney.

134
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,340
That's right.

135
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:02,120
There's the euro jizneyworld.

136
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,280
That's a really good one.

137
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:03,780
The one in Amsterdam.

138
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,780
That was where we were.

139
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,180
Euro jizney.

140
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,460
A lot of piercings.

141
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,080
The euro jizney.

142
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,140
And boy, Dr. Philodrummon must have gone on every ride.

143
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,880
I swear to God, he must...

144
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:16,340
That guy must have spent a fortune.

145
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:19,480
I like the Indonesian babe in the teacup that spins around my shelf.

146
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,740
When you wear a Mad Hatter thing and she goes around...

147
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:24,600
Kind of a different way than a teacup going, if you know what I mean.

148
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,440
I was a...

149
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,720
Kind of like the old Nook Mile basket hoist.

150
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:30,180
As they used to call it in...

151
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:31,880
I couldn't even look at that one.

152
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,840
It just made me dizzy.

153
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,560
Well, you know, that's kind of what the spectator arena is for.

154
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:39,880
Is actually to make the emasculated young woman scared.

155
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,660
The man's scared also.

156
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,220
And to watch the pink coiffed women literally lick the...

157
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:51,720
Let that image drill into your synapse there because next time you drop acid, you're going to have a bad trip when you do it.

158
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:55,260
That's what I call a good trip, actually.

159
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,780
Well, if she was looking at you, perhaps, but if she was just coming after you, I don't know.

160
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:00,160
I want that hair.

161
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,560
That color. I want that color.

162
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,920
You want a fistful of hair. That color is what you want.

163
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:08,620
I know what you want, Commander.

164
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,360
Aw, she's a happy young lady.

165
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:13,260
Commander, come.

166
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,040
What a good girl.

167
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:21,660
Now, we're viewing a shot of a woman who looks like she's just accepted the body of Christ, or at least one of his, you know, proboscis.

168
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:21,700
I'm not sure.

169
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:28,680
And after having accepted it, she is so happy. She's beaming. The Lord's kind of beaming.

170
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,660
There's a hooker Jesus and a John Jesus, and I love you, man.

171
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:40,020
Once that Christ principle, which, you know, was always keeping us after class and making us write obscure straightens on the blackboard.

172
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:45,040
Once that Christ principle is given us a swat...

173
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,980
There you see it right there.

174
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,560
He's asleep.

175
00:08:04,460 --> 00:08:05,800
...and he's sleeping.

176
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:14,940
I know that Bob is once again, is, came to Amsterdam ahead of us.

177
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,500
We have found the clues.

178
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,780
The, uh, his...

179
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:19,820
Well, we know this.

180
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,440
...counterpins and jello.

181
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,160
A big pile of old cotterpins and old jello.

182
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,040
Well, we're still...

183
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:25,780
Piled up inside...

184
00:08:25,780 --> 00:08:26,180
The bottom line.

185
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,540
...the hotel. Our own hotel. Bob was there.

186
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:29,220
The bottom line is...

187
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,680
Bob is somewhere in Amsterdam now.

188
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:31,520
We've seen him. We saw him today.

189
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,180
We must find...

190
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,020
The bottom line is...

191
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,740
We must find Bob.

192
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:36,060
The bottom line is that we're still here, right?

193
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,520
Yeah.

194
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,920
And the pipe's still smoked.

195
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,180
The pipe is still lit.

196
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,740
I don't, I don't understand that.

197
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,280
Thanks, Bob. Thanks, Bob. That pipe is still lit.

198
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,440
And we're still...

199
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:43,860
And we're self-evident.

200
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,920
It's self-evident.

201
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,200
Right?

202
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,440
Which coffee shop is Bob in now?

203
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:48,980
Listener.

204
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,500
He's walking...

205
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:49,740
He's seated with it.

206
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:54,580
I'm self-evident in sound of my voice. If you see Bob, call this station now and tell

207
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,840
Bob that he must come home.

208
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,320
We need a number to the station, please. What's the number here to the station? Call,

209
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:01,480
call here to the station if you don't see Bob.

210
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,600
We don't have a phone.

211
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:04,260
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

212
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,760
...with a cotterpin and then you will have it.

213
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,800
Oh, aren't we supposed to advertise a, a DeVifle?

214
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:15,580
Uh, yeah, we're actually, we're actually gonna do a DeVifle. March 23, 2001.

215
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,700
I do doubt what you're hearing now.

216
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,020
What do you mean?

217
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,720
If you want to see the proof, the miracle...

218
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:19,720


219
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,280
...proof of Bob in the lives of freaks, abnormals, weirdos, giants and midgets, those of the

220
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:29,500
most bizarre, you will not believe that these creatures, they live, they breathe just like

221
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,180
you and me. And these are members of the Church of the Subgenius. Come and see the weird subgeniuses.

222
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:41,300
See their strange sex acts and their strange talents. Give them your, uh, grass and hash

223
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:47,280
and see them grovel and do strange tricks for you in the name of Bob and learn what

224
00:09:47,280 --> 00:09:48,260
Bob is all about.

225
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

226
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:58,440
The free prostitutes for Bob. The free drugs for Bob. The free money. The free heavenly

227
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:01,380
money. The free pills.

228
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:08,740
And this preaching and spirit-filled revival has come here to Amsterdam. We're so proud

229
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,720
to be, to be bringing the t-shirts of Bob to the city.

230
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,800
The t-shirts of Bob.

231
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,540
How much does the revival cost to get in there?

232
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,580
Friends, it costs only the effort of getting in there.

233
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:19,580


234
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:24,000
We're getting out of the bed this morning and get that morning and coming to church.

235
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,240
That's all it takes.

236
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:30,380
Uh, yeah, it's, for those who want to come actually, it's, um, yeah, it's completely

237
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,960
free. It's, uh, gonna be at the Bad Kuip, which is on the, uh, the corner of Albert

238
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:37,720
Kuipstraat and the Eerste Zwelingstraat, number 10.

239
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,180
Bad Kuip.

240
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,100
It's in Bad Kuip.

241
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:40,680
Bad Kuip.

242
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,100
Actually, Bad Kuip actually means bathtub.

243
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:45,540
Yeah, well anyway, uh.

244
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,560
The what?

245
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,480
The wash tub.

246
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,560
23rd of March, from 9 o'clock in the morning, we're going to be at the Bad Kuip.

247
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:49,560


248
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:49,560


249
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:49,560


250
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:53,980
Good evening, uh, come there, Bad Kuip, come and see the Church of the Subgenius live.

251
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,160
The butt plug.

252
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,040
The butt plug?

253
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,420
The butt plug.

254
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,300
The Bat Cave.

255
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,860
The Bat Cave.

256
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,420
The Bat Cave.

257
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:01,880
The Bat Cave.

258
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:04,200
And now.

259
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,040
Can someone get me a beer?

260
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,160
What?

261
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:16,920
And now, ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for me to introduce the following member

262
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,640
of the Church of the Subgenius.

263
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:26,140
This man is known to be the second luckiest man alive.

264
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:32,200
He is the Pope of all Europe.

265
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:37,560
He's the one, he's the only, Paul Black!

266
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,560
First of all, Paul Black is the Pope of Europe.

267
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:49,560


268
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:49,560


269
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:56,080
I want you to point your fingers out, every one of you I want you to point your fingers

270
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:59,500
out, and I want you to point to that man!

271
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:00,880
J.R.

272
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,220
Bob Dobbs!

273
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,060
And say, Hallelujah!

274
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:05,920
Hallelujah!

275
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,000
Hallelujah!

276
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,560
Hallelujah!

277
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:10,700
Hallelujah!

278
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:11,720
Hallelujah!

279
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,340
Hallelujah!

280
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:12,460


281
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,740
First of all, I want you to take your finger

282
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:25,820
and I want you to point it to this band.

283
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:30,700
Oh yes! Oh yes! Oh yes!

284
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:40,900
Now I know why each and every one of you

285
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,960
have come to Amsterdam.

286
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:46,880
You're like salmon swimming up the river of slack

287
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:50,700
back to that land of profit and money.

288
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:55,520
Amsterdam, hallelujah! Praise God!

289
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:05,520
Friends, there's only three things you need to understand

290
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,180
about the Church of the 17th.

291
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:08,540
Only three things.

292
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,760
And those three things are

293
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:11,820
Bob

294
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:12,620
Bob!

295
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,700
Slack

296
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,480
Slack!

297
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,660
and the Conspiracy!

298
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,000
Slack!

299
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,320
Friends, I must say, I must ask your forgiveness.

300
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,460
I must apologize to you.

301
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:35,240
Because one year ago, the church came here to Amsterdam

302
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,060
to preach to the Dutch about Slack!

303
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:41,100
Typical dumbass Americans!

304
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,720
Friends, this year we're in Amsterdam

305
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,740
to learn about

306
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,200
HESANIC!

307
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,180
Because we learned last time

308
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:56,840
we have nothing to teach the people of Amsterdam about Slack.

309
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,380
They can teach us about Slack

310
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,640
because they have always had

311
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:02,000
HESANIC!

312
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,200
HESANIC!

313
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:03,740
HESANIC!

314
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:05,980
HESANIC!

315
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,720
HESANIC!

316
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,840
HESANIC!

317
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:10,940
HESANIC!

318
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:13,740
HESANIC!

319
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,120
Yes, very strange.

320
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:18,200
Teaching me, huh?

321
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,240
Now I remember indeed.

322
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,440
We both left the front line.

323
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:30,640
He took me to a cave.

324
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,080
And inside he lighted a lighter.

325
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:39,920
And I saw a stall there.

326
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,520
He opened the door of it.

327
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:46,640
And inside was something that looked like a porcelain altar.

328
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,140
And then...

329
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:51,200
And it exploded!

330
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,900
I was farting fire!

331
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,900
It was unbelievable!

332
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,860
For the first time in my life!

333
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:08,520
Could this be the ancient rite of pyroflagellation?

334
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,180
What?

335
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,700
Pyro what?

336
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,320
Pyro what?

337
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,320
Anyway...

338
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:23,120
I have shown this trick to my kids many times.

339
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,260
And they too...

340
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:31,860
They too play this game

341
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:33,900
which sometimes is very dangerous.

342
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,320
Sometimes it can backfire, you know.

343
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:46,220
Pyroflagellation, dear friends.

344
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:46,240
Yes, yes.

345
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:52,120
The backfire can result sometimes in dangerous incidents such as the gut blowout.

346
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,680
Or the bladder splatter.

347
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,100
Beware the pyroflagellation, dear friends.

348
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,440
It can beat deadly.

349
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,280
Some other strange things have surfaced.

350
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,280
Like this.

351
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:05,740
What would happen if you were to say this name?

352
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,400
If I were to invoke this name right now?

353
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,140
What would happen?

354
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,180
Oh, you can't do that.

355
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:12,760
You just...

356
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,680
You would not be able to.

357
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,560
It's anti-slack.

358
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,280
You don't know the name.

359
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:21,300
No, but what would happen if you did?

360
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,620
They would come.

361
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:26,820
The time would be nigh for their arisal.

362
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,940
And what would happen?

363
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:29,780
What would this mean for mankind?

364
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,680
Those who are true would turn false.

365
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:37,080
And those false would be held upside down over the precipice.

366
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,380
But yet, they will always be there.

367
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,500
And they will all end up on their heads.

368
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,560
Mark my words.

369
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:45,580
All, from the greatest to the smallest, shall end up on their heads.

370
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:46,580
All of ye.

371
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,420
All of ye.

372
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,040
Huh.

373
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,000
Phooey.

374
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,940
Those who know don't say, and those who say don't know.

375
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:57,740
Spoken like a true subgenius there.

376
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:58,600
Hallelujah.

377
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,320
Hallelujah.

378
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,480
Praise Bob.

379
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:01,000
Hallelujah.

380
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,200
Praise Bob.

381
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,160
Yeah.

382
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,440
But who is this man, Bob?

383
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,480
So many ask.

384
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,980
They say, who is Bob?

385
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,560
I see Bob's face.

386
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,240
I want to know Bob.

387
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:13,280
I want to follow Bob.

388
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,760
Friends, you better be careful getting too close to Bob.

389
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,680
He's got all the slack in the world.

390
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,240
And where do you think he gets it?

391
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:22,480
So, some people don't believe in Bob.

392
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,740
They say, oh, Bob's just a joke.

393
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,020
He's just a cartoon head.

394
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:29,960
Friends, if Bob is a joke, what do you call yourself?

395
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:37,460
Somebody once told me, they said, I don't want to be a subgenius man.

396
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:37,900
I don't want to be a minister.

397
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:43,040
I don't want to have two paradises, one while I'm alive, and one after I'm dead.

398
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,840
No, I don't want that.

399
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,060
I don't want to be a subgenius.

400
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,140
You know what that tells me about that person, friends?

401
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:53,260
It tells me what they do want is they want to take themselves seriously.

402
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:56,700
I'm sorry, but I don't take them seriously.

403
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,420
I don't take you seriously.

404
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,940
I don't take me seriously.

405
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,240
I don't even take Bob seriously.

406
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,960
The only thing I take seriously is what Bob said.

407
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,440
Fuck if they can't take a joke.

408
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,440


409
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,440


410
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:07,440


411
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:14,180
That sounds harsh to the polished ears of the modernist perhaps, but friends, you just

412
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,700
try it.

413
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,460
It's the only workable philosophy.

414
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,280
I got involved with Bob.

415
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,940
I saw Bob at the supermarket.

416
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,120
He was looking up at me.

417
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:26,280
And I looked down at Bob and I thought, well, that looks really...

418
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:31,380
I just felt drawn to this picture of this man with a pipe in his mouth, right?

419
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:35,940
And I reached down and I picked up this book and it said, Book of the Subgenius on it.

420
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:39,480
And you know what?

421
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,960
After reading this book, I was hooked on Bob.

422
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,680
I had to send my $30 into Bob.

423
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:51,120
It was like an obsessive compulsive thing.

424
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,620
I think that every subgenius goes through.

425
00:18:53,800 --> 00:19:02,160
When you decide to have Bob and you decide to send that $30 and you are really...

426
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:02,880
You're almost...

427
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,580
You're gone.

428
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,580
You're gone.

429
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,320
You're too far gone when it comes to that point.

430
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,860
When you send that $30 into Bob, what happens with that $30?

431
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,640
Let me tell you what happens with that $30.

432
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,200
A miraculous thing happens to you.

433
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:22,360
The minute that that money leaves your hand, the minute that that money leaves your hand,

434
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:27,940
it goes in the hand of Bob Dobbs, you start getting quivers all over your body.

435
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:28,900
You start shaking.

436
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:32,880
You start shaking and your body starts to swell.

437
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,560
It gets worse.

438
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:38,780
It gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and your body swells up and you fall

439
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,760
to the ground.

440
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:46,200
And little holes break out in your body and white comes out of these little holes, burning

441
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,820
beams of light come out of these holes in your body.

442
00:19:49,780 --> 00:20:00,120
And then your body explodes, and like white doves at a wedding, a thousand winged cherubs

443
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,920
flow out from your body.

444
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:04,280
And you're like, oh, my God.

445
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:04,540
I'm so sorry.

446
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:04,540


447
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:04,540


448
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:04,540


449
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:04,540


450
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:04,540


451
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:18,140
And then, and then like a phoenix of slack, rising up from the ashes of your former pink self, a subgenius emerges.

452
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:25,640
And the world hears the howl of a new yeti.

453
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:26,340
Woo!

454
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:44,720
As Bob himself said, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.

455
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,060
Bob doesn't think about things.

456
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:54,020
What Bob wants to happen just happens to be what's going to happen anyway.

457
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:57,620
20, 20, 24 hours to go.

458
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,240
I want to be sedated.

459
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:03,720
Nothing and nowhere to go.

460
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,820
I want to be sedated.

461
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,560
They just get me to the airport, come in the show.

462
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,780
Hoey, hoey, hoey, before I go, I'll go.

463
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:17,420
I can't control my fingers, I can't control my toes.

464
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,700
Oh no, oh no, oh no.

465
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:28,580
Before I get on with the evening's heavy duty sermonizing, I do have an announcement to make

466
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:33,100
about one of the latest business ventures of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

467
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,540
The Dobbs Trash.

468
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:36,920
The

469
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:37,060
best.

470
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,900
Now most of my air travel experiences have been on U.S. and Australian based carriers,

471
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:04,040
so I don't know what it's like in Europe, but if it's anything like what I'm used to,

472
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,100
it sucks.

473
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:10,920
Now the problem is that most airlines are flat out unable to accommodate the traveling

474
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:12,580
needs of the subgenius.

475
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:19,160
They gear their services towards the pigs, who are used to, if not actually enjoy being

476
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,680
treated like herd animals and loaded into flying cattle cars.

477
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:29,440
Not so with we subgeni, which is why traveling can be so uncomfortable for us.

478
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:32,360
Well brothers and sisters, not anymore.

479
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,020
Dobbs Trash.

480
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:40,140
The Grands Megaglom Co. Corp. is proud to announce the formation of Yeti Air, the first

481
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,060
airline designed to cater to the subgenius travelers.

482
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:49,900
As you may know, Bob has had dealings with the airline industry before, most notably

483
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,940
the fine Dobbs Food Service company that services many airlines.

484
00:22:55,300 --> 00:23:02,620
But now Dobbs has branched out and is offering high quality air travel specifically to accommodate

485
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,880
the subgenius.

486
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,760
Yeti Air is a great example of this.

487
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,600
Yeti Air is a great example of the difference between all the other pink airlines.

488
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,540
The differences, brothers and sisters, will astound you.

489
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,520
First of all, Yeti Air will be truly egalitarian.

490
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:20,680
None of this first class, business class, tourist class crap.

491
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:27,700
All of the seats on all Yeti Air flights will be roomy enough for the largest subgenius,

492
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:32,380
and not towards these emaciated dwarfs that the pink airlines seem to be gearing their

493
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,360
passengers for.

494
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:42,660
The one exception will be on our specially designed aircraft, that consists of nothing

495
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,900
but rows and rows of MES-2 cercaps.

496
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:54,740
Also, for the agoraphobic subgenius who wishes to travel with the minimum amount of an internal

497
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,380
contact capacity in these thyroid aches.

498
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:01,980
Yeti Air there will be no overhead luggage bins.

499
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:03,860
There can't be anywhere in the sky under your feet!

500
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:03,860


501
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:03,860


502
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:08,960
tiresome than watching some jerk trying to stuff a lawn tractor sized piece of

503
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:14,540
luggage into one of these bins. So at Air Yeti we have a policy about carry-on

504
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:22,340
luggage. You have to be able to fit it in your mouth. If you can't get it in your gob, it goes in the hole.

505
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:29,600
The space normally used for overhead luggage bins will instead be used for bunks.

506
00:24:29,600 --> 00:24:34,700
This is part of Yeti Air's Mile High Club, which is a more entertaining

507
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:40,860
version of the Pink Airlines frequent flyer programs. Yeti Air will not hit up

508
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:45,840
their passengers for hidden service charges either, brothers and sisters. Seven

509
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:51,220
bucks for a cocktail? Not on Yeti Air, where all booze is free.

510
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:58,800
Free booze! You can't beat it. Nor will passengers be charged a five dollar

511
00:24:58,800 --> 00:24:59,460
entertainment fee.

512
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:07,240
For to borrow a little nasty earwax encrusted pair of headphones so they can listen to the dialogue on

513
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,500
whatever lowest common denominator pink movie they're hoisting on the

514
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:17,100
passengers. Instead, with arm-mounted personal video streams, each Yeti Air

515
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:23,560
passenger will have a choice of a wide selection of porn, sci-fi, comedy, or more porn.

516
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,020
Absolutely free!

517
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:25,780
Woo!

518
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,720
Also, more porn!

519
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,160
MOREHORN!

520
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:35,220
Also there will be none of these no-smoking restrictions on any Yeti Air flight.

521
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:40,180
Instead, all Yeti Air flights will be mandatory fropping flights.

522
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,120
YEEEESS!

523
00:25:41,820 --> 00:25:49,500
Flying high again! That's going to be the slogan of Yeti Air. The Ozzy song will be cranked at volume over the PA system

524
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,800
before each flight.

525
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,360
Oh, yeah!

526
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:58,640
Also, in the unlikely event of boredom, a mask will drop from an overhead compartment. Pull the mask, and firmly

527
00:25:58,640 --> 00:25:58,700
slide through the anti-air system into space.

528
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:02,740
fastened around your head and the flow of church air will begin automatically.

529
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:08,100
You won't have to worry about fastening the mask of a small child, however,

530
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:12,440
because there will be no small children on any Yeti Air flight.

531
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:19,000
Most of the airlines I've dealt with, it seems like they have a minimum requirement for

532
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:24,240
screening children and obnoxious kids, but not on Yeti Air. If you're not of the

533
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:31,040
legal age of consent, you can take the damn bus. Lastly, we have the Yeti Air

534
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,740
flight crew. Now on most pink airlines, this is something that irritates me no

535
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:39,540
end. They have important sounding names for these people like uniformed crew

536
00:26:39,540 --> 00:26:44,220
member or some such nonsense and they'll promulgate the important sounding mission

537
00:26:44,220 --> 00:26:48,460
statement that their primary job is passenger safety, like they're some sort

538
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:53,440
of flying rent-a-cock rather than a stewardess. So unfortunately these people

539
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:54,220
have started to believe that they're not the only ones who are being treated like that.

540
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:58,140
Yeti Air seem to believe their own propaganda and consequently most pink airlines seem to be

541
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:03,040
crewed with aging bitter harridans or flighty young men who seem to have

542
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:08,480
gotten their personalities from an ad in the back of People magazine. At Air Yeti,

543
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:12,900
we dispatched with such high-flown BS and recognized that the job of these

544
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:19,840
stewardesses and stewards is to service the passengers. On Yeti Air flights, the service crew

545
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:23,940
consists entirely of exotic dancers, porn stars, and

546
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,200
ex-pilots.

547
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:31,000
The flight crew is a team of experts in oriental massage. Thongs and knee pads will be part of the standard-issue uniform.

548
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,320
And any Yeti Air crew member will be happy to initiate you into the mile-high

549
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:43,200
club. So remember fellow mutants, when it's time to fly, fly Yeti Air. Flying high again.

550
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:54,200
And I say as long as you're alive, shout, make noise, or whatever, you're a hero.

551
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:59,200
Because we know you shot up like hell.

552
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:07,820
But Jeroen had a great philosophy which he told us last year. He was walking through the streets shouting because he's very loud.

553
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:13,200
In fact, at times to be the loudest man in Holland that he might be. And he was saying,

554
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:23,440
my friend, said Jeroen van Bram in Amsterdam, he said, you have to shout and make a lot of noise?

555
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:30,520
Or whatever, because when you die, you shut up like hell.

556
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:46,760
I'd like to quote another crazy crackpot book, sort of like the book of the subgenius that says the same thing.

557
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,640
Ecclesiastes chapter 9 verse 10.

558
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:54,120
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do,

559
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:55,940
do it with thy might.

560
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:02,040
For there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom in the grave.

561
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,560
Where you're going.

562
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,620
In other words friends,

563
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:12,820
shout, make a lot of noise, or whatever, because when you die, you shut up like hell.

564
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,840
Another way to put that would be as Bob said,

565
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:22,340
when you eat a hamburger, don't just eat that hamburger, eat your hamburger.

566
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,280
You're going to hell.

567
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,060
You're all going to hell.

568
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,400
Praise Bob, but we're going to subgenius hell.

569
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:36,320
My friend, by the time you get to the Christian heaven, you'd be wishing to God you'd made it to subgenius hell.

570
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,780
You wish you'd made the cut.

571
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:39,880
And you can from me.

572
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:40,800
Thirty dollars American.

573
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,800
Tell your mom to whip us up some lemonade.

574
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:44,820
About 70 guilders.

575
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,340
70 guilders to save your soul.

576
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,420
All your souls.

577
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,600
And your pet's souls.

578
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,080
And your dead animals.

579
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,020
Oh actually, they're already saved, Dr. Rob.

580
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,700
They already have some of this.

581
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:03,760
What happens if you actually pay this money, and you don't get eternal salvation?

582
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,720
What happens then?

583
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,180
Bob will give you triple your money back.

584
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,660
Ninety dollars in your pocket.

585
00:30:09,740 --> 00:30:10,520
There's that echo again.

586
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:13,020
So what you're saying is, if I die,

587
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:13,840
That's how sure he is.

588
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,640
That's how sure Bob is.

589
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,480
If I die, I'm boiling in the fiery brimstone of hell.

590
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,180
And I'm burning there.

591
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,820
Bob will come to me with a thirty dollar check.

592
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:25,940
Actually, I think the...

593
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,080
A ninety dollar check.

594
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:28,220
A ninety dollar check.

595
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:31,360
That's how sure Bob is of his deal.

596
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,480
Floating on a bowl of ice.

597
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,580
That's right.

598
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:37,120
And I've been classed up in this world.

599
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:39,380
And just a couple of miles away.

600
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:43,140
I've been through five senses of eternity.

601
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,660
And that was my stomach growling at the end.

602
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,160
Yeah.

603
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,460
So, you know.

604
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:49,880
You know, he said,

605
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,480
Bob will be there.

606
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:50,880
Now, some...

607
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:53,540
Many people, many intelligent people,

608
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,080
Don't believe that there is a hell.

609
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:55,800
And they...

610
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,240
Or rather, they know that hell is there for those who believe in hell.

611
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,440
And since they don't believe in hell,

612
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:01,940
They ain't going to hell.

613
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:02,980
They're more interested in heaven.

614
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:05,220
Well, Bob guarantees you two heavens.

615
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,480
Two heavens.

616
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,620
For the price of war.

617
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:08,260
One before you die.

618
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,020
Two for the price of war.

619
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,540
It lasts as long as you want.

620
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:12,280
How many times do you say?

621
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,040
Two.

622
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,040


623
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,040


624
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:13,240
How many times do you say?

625
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:14,620
If you get bored with it,

626
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:14,780
Two.

627
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,820
You can choose to die.

628
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,240
And move on to the heaven that you get after you die.

629
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:18,620
Two.

630
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:18,980
Two.

631
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:26,060
on the side to die for boredom there stops bad it ain't just it's heaven of all die for them

632
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:34,280
for several millennia because it's full of sin this is full of pure essence of sin a gluttony

633
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:42,980
greed totally satisfied at every step of the way it's better than heroin it's better than

634
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:49,320
heroin mixed with uh with with the propane with propane it's better than mixed mixed with angel

635
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:57,380
dust it's better than beach sand mixed with vodka it is the finest feeling when you have real slack

636
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:00,640
oh i forgot i wasn't going to preach to the dutch about slack they've already got

637
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:09,500
the only country we've come to that already already knew of slack and in fact had much to teach us

638
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,780
that's when we're going to get as fast as we can

639
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:30,580
we have the best reason in the world i hate him simplest reason in the world we've got bob

640
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:42,800
if you ever wonder what do they see in this bob man why do they think his words

641
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:42,960
are going to grow even more and what do you see in this bob man why do they think his words are

642
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:48,180
so wise. Forget his words. Don't use your mind to think about your religion. You only

643
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:57,160
have to do one thing with Bob. Look at his face. And if you have a friend who doesn't

644
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:03,620
understand, make them look at that face and they will see.

645
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:28,760
I just came here and outside there's a wagon that says Bob on it. And so I thought, okay.

646
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:41,260
It's just the way it goes. Everything leads to Bob. My dad was called Bob. The thing outside

647
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:41,980
is called Bob.

648
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:42,940
I don't know why I'm saying that. I don't know why I'm saying that. I don't know why

649
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,460
I'm talking about it here. I think that was it.

650
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,780
Praise Bob!

651
00:33:54,300 --> 00:34:03,440
Friends, we're so sorry that Jesus couldn't be here and answer him. He was here last year.

652
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:11,840
Jesus paved the way. Jesus and his lovely wife Mary Magdalene, risen again on this world,

653
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:18,160
paved the way for the subgenius church to Amsterdam, to the sex-hurt corridors of this

654
00:34:18,160 --> 00:34:19,120
lovely city.

655
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:27,020
The church of the subgenius, these guys walked across the Atlantic on the backs of pontoon

656
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,760
Jesuses. They really did it.

657
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:37,020
Many thousands of dolphins died so that Jesus and Magdalene could walk across the Atlantic

658
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:41,820
and come to Amsterdam and lead the way and show us all the best to come.

659
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:41,820


660
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:41,820


661
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:46,220
It's absolutely son don't shout at me even if I'm wrong.

662
00:34:46,220 --> 00:34:52,940
Hope you have a wonderful Labor Day, and hope Holy Mother gives it to you.

663
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:55,920
To make it up for everyone, to celebrate this special day of accountable worship and start

664
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,180
running and giving back for Your glory.

665
00:34:57,180 --> 00:35:02,520
And for that and that, around that very moment, we soon reached our journey.

666
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:10,920
What a great day that it has been.

667
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:17,180
actually follow up all black to Amsterdam never to be seen again never

668
00:35:17,180 --> 00:35:20,940
to be seen again that's true there are people I met here last year and I've

669
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:29,060
never seen them again never seen them again they were voted out of the big

670
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:34,020
brother life hey you know who the most famous person to ever follow me was it

671
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,880
was this guy not the guy he died for stealing and killing the Lindbergh baby

672
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,700
it was a guy who actually did it this is the most famous person to ever follow

673
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:49,380
me the guy who killed that really did kidnap the Lindbergh baby yeah he was

674
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:54,040
that he was the first person to ever follow me and that was a second that was

675
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:58,120
the second thing he ever did was he kidnapped and killed the Lindbergh baby

676
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,500
and actually somebody else got blamed for it even get credit for it didn't get

677
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:08,180
the award I think the main excuse we used to come here

678
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:08,820
really?

679
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:13,880
is the coffee shops where where something like Haber-Fraub Zipulops is

680
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:19,080
available it's called marijuana or cannabis or something like that but you

681
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:26,420
notice that my pipe here a duplicate of the type of J.R.R. Hobbs himself is entirely

682
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:34,420
empty and that is because I only use this for the real Haber-Fraub Zipulops

683
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:38,600
and it's just not available what few supplies there are

684
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:44,580
go straight to Bob and the leftovers grab his go to Ivan Stang and that's why

685
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:50,240
that's why I went with senior sub-genius Minister a doctor and he prescribed

686
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:59,940
these slack patches for me here it's it's okay it's okay it doesn't get me

687
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:06,820
through life in England which is a slackless, cursed nation right now a nation that I'm not a good fan of

688
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,580
that there's a nation in the world that doesn't give you a good life in England which is a slackless cursed nation right now there's a nation that's not good enough to be a good man

689
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:15,480
In the thrall of the conspiracy headed in our country by the Queen and her husband,

690
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:25,080
the lizards who have been taking the slack away from the English subgeniuses since Magna Carta way back when.

691
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:31,220
Oh no, you mean the commies, no you mean the Nazis. No, no, there is only one conspiracy

692
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:37,480
and it only takes one such conspiracy to bring all of our little conspiracies down.

693
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:43,340
One conspiracy, the conspiracy of the normals. And it is the dumbest conspiracy.

694
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,920
It doesn't even know it's a conspiracy. It's no more smart than Bob.

695
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:56,360
But friends, yet those peeps, those con men, those Barbies and Kens and cage dwellers,

696
00:37:56,440 --> 00:38:05,000
the normals, those mindless cow-like stereotypes, as dumb as they are, yet they could destroy the world.

697
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,320
And that was the voice of J.R. Bob Doe.

698
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,560
What did he say?

699
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:16,680
He said to me, that is exactly what the conspiracy has been doing to you all your life.

700
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:17,820
Brave Bob.

701
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:27,300
You have been manipulated by an alien finger up your rectum, making you dance like a puppet all your life.

702
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,260
At first you didn't like it, but then you got to be used to it.

703
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:36,740
And then you got to quite like it because it says,

704
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,100
jump this way and you'll win a thousand dollars.

705
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:41,540
Jump this way, there's a promotion.

706
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,200
Jump this way, there's some really good comedy on TV.

707
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,840
And other times it pulls you away in some kind of punishment.

708
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:54,560
Friends, you think how bad things are now.

709
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,260
Think what they're not telling you. Think what they're hiding from you.

710
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:01,340
You know, all of us are in a cult.

711
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:05,900
If we let our leaders bury poisonous waste in our backyard,

712
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:09,260
how is that any different from those heaven's gate idiots,

713
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:13,680
you know, offing themselves hoping the spaceships would hurry up and save them.

714
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,880
Friends, we don't even trust those aliens anymore.

715
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,840
We don't trust pipe-smoking salesmen.

716
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,460
We build our own rocket ship. We build our own Amsterdam.

717
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,540
Friends, and we have to do it ourselves.

718
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,440
It's tough working within the conspiracy.

719
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,240
But, you know, as Bob said, if you act like a dumb shit,

720
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:38,680
they will surely treat you as an equal.

721
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:47,680
And if Einstein came up with that,

722
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:50,180
instead of building our own spaceships,

723
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,420
we ought to be building our own damn Amsterdam's.

724
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:03,460
You know, the thing about building your own Amsterdam,

725
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,460
versus building your own spaceship,

726
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,860
is when you're saying,

727
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,720
I'm gonna build my own spaceship,

728
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,660
you're saying I'm stuck here with them.

729
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:20,720
But if you're saying I'm gonna build my own Amsterdam,

730
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:24,280
that means they're stuck here with you.

731
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:30,420
Bob is slack, Bob is sex, and Bob is money.

732
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,000
And that's all we need.

733
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,640
Well, actually, we need more subgeniuses.

734
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:36,380
There aren't enough subgeniuses.

735
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,060
So you have to have more.

736
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:41,080
That means you have to fuck more.

737
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,580
And make more little subgeniuses.

738
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,500
It's that simple.

739
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:50,660
Or, can you also donate to Bob through food?

740
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,160
Or, uh...

741
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,200
Sex, most important, sex.

742
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,180
Donate to Bob with sex.

743
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:59,280
Or secrets. Secrets are valuable.

744
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,120
Give your secrets to Bob.

745
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,520
Let's pledge 100 dollars to us right now.

746
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:04,460
Give us your money.

747
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:05,740
Give us your money.

748
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:06,820
What are you gonna do with it?

749
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:07,340
Nothing!

750
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:09,160
You're gonna go out tomorrow night,

751
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,000
you're going to go to a club perhaps,

752
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:11,840
you're gonna get drunk,

753
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,740
you're gonna enjoy yourselves,

754
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,480
you're gonna go home,

755
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:14,400
you're gonna pull the sleeves.

756
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:15,220
That sounds pretty good.

757
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:17,120
Alternatively, just give us your money.

758
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,580
We've got the alien face mask of slack here,

759
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,880
my brothers and sisters.

760
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:25,360
And we're gonna pass it around.

761
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:28,860
And put your hard-earned money in this thing,

762
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,120
and give it to that man over there, I can stay.

763
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:32,180
Hallelujah!

764
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,360
Deep, deep in them pockets.

765
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,020
Give to Bob!

766
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:37,800
Give!

767
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,600
It's been a long time since I rock and roll

768
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:45,360
It's been a long time since I've done this draw

769
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,920
Let me get it back, let me get it back, let me get it back

770
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:53,320
The paper I come from

771
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,580
It's been a long time, been a long time

772
00:41:59,580 --> 00:42:02,160
Been my lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely life

773
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:07,100
Been my lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely life

774
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:11,000
Friends, we're not working for the devil.

775
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,200
I want you to know that.

776
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:14,760
We make small deals with the devil.

777
00:42:14,980 --> 00:42:16,680
But you know, to believe in the devil,

778
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:18,640
you have to be kind of a Christian to begin with.

779
00:42:18,760 --> 00:42:23,340
All we're doing is tempting sinners away from the devil.

780
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,380
We don't care what they do after that.

781
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:30,220
We believe in the God that doesn't want us to believe in it.

782
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,320
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

783
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,420
Ah, yes, friends.

784
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:38,760
And so that is why, one reason why I don't practice what I preach

785
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,560
because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to.

786
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:43,680
As Bob said.

787
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:51,220
But Bob also said, friends, that too much is always better than not being.

788
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,960
Too much, friends! Too much!

789
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:58,020
And I say, as long as you're alive,

790
00:42:58,460 --> 00:43:00,660
shout, make noise,

791
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,460
or whatever,

792
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,440
because when you're dead,

793
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:08,380
you shut up like hell!

794
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,440
Wham, bam, wham, bam, wham, bam!

795
00:43:11,580 --> 00:43:13,660
Ah, yes, bam!

796
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,340
Does Bigfoot strike you as well put together?

797
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:25,060
Well, let's say he has one foot in this dimension and one in the other,

798
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,260
which makes him sort of well put together in itself.

799
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,720
Beware the black yeti,

800
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:36,260
for he has the biggest feet and the biggest teeth.

801
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:40,280
And the Bigfoot makes a big smell, you know.

802
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,420
Look out for the big smell.

803
00:43:50,480 --> 00:43:52,920
Sometimes the subgeniuses,

804
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,460
they aren't always what we expected.

805
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:01,380
Sometimes I find myself really frustrated at the sheer,

806
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:09,520
I don't know, nerdiness or wimpiness or not funniness of some of our followers.

807
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:11,400
And it used to really bother me.

808
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,800
It kind of depressed me.

809
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,620
Gosh, these subgeniuses are kind of fucked up.

810
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:18,340
Well, God! God!

811
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,960
It finally sunk in!

812
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,080
That is what this is all about!

813
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:26,440
They are fucked up because there is a conspiracy of normal people.

814
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,340
Sapping away their slack.

815
00:44:28,480 --> 00:44:29,960
Of course they're fucked up.

816
00:44:30,040 --> 00:44:33,460
And of course that's why Bob is their God.

817
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:43,140
The conspiracy labors ceaselessly to suppress sacred abnormality at a very early age.

818
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:47,200
Children's television, preschool and public schooling,

819
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:53,580
social groups, education, church, and other institutional learning facilities.

820
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,440
The sacred abnormality that everyone knows about.

821
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,760
The nail that everyone possesses is suppressed.

822
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,540
The nail that sticks up is hammered down.

823
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:05,620
And the result is a majority of bland conformists.

824
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:11,300
That are fearful of doing or saying anything that might make people think they're weird.

825
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,460
It's up to us, brothers and sisters,

826
00:45:13,740 --> 00:45:18,980
to help all these poor schmucks find and love their sacred abnormality.

827
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,640
So they too can give their mental life the growth it needs

828
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:25,380
and blossom into full Yetihood.

829
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:31,100
You can do this by giving your own sacred abnormality a workout in the presence of others.

830
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:36,380
Be deliberately strange, amaze and confound your acquaintances with your weirdness.

831
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:43,180
These outbursts, particularly if they refer directly to J.R. Bob Dobbs and the Church of the Subgenius,

832
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:48,180
plants the seeds in the mind of all those other latent subgeniuses out there.

833
00:45:48,340 --> 00:45:52,960
And that too will help them find and love their own sacred abnormality.

834
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:55,560
Oh, it won't be easy at first, brothers and sisters.

835
00:45:55,660 --> 00:46:01,100
The abnormality suppression reflex is so strong in all these poor con dupes

836
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:04,280
that very few will initially be able to overcome it.

837
00:46:04,380 --> 00:46:05,840
But some will, oh yes.

838
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,740
And pretty soon there will be more and more subgeniuses

839
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:11,760
all bulking up their mental lives

840
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:16,660
and planting the seed of the sacred jest in other latent subgeniuses.

841
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,320
This growth will be exponential.

842
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,420
And before too very long, the dream of Bob's will be realized.

843
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:29,600
A world teeming with healthy, happy and flagrantly weird subgeniuses.

844
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:33,120
Yitzy paradise on earth, brothers and sisters.

845
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:37,220
So get on out there, fought your sacred abnormality,

846
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,340
build up that mental life,

847
00:46:39,540 --> 00:46:42,000
be as weird as you can be.

848
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:44,520
Our world depends on you.

849
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,580
Thank you very much.

850
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:47,820
Weird, weird, weird, weird.

851
00:46:50,580 --> 00:46:52,060
That was...

852
00:46:52,960 --> 00:46:54,420
