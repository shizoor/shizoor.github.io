1
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:07,400
We interrupt this program to activate the emergency

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,360
subgenius power of

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,480
SWAT

4
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,860
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

5
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:29,500
Hey, it's your friends in honor and fear of the upcoming elections

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,520
For this hour of Slack, number 964

7
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:40,980
I've elected to play a special pre-verts, pre-vote show

8
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:47,540
from the lymph node institute edition of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse

9
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:51,720
Originally broadcast on WREK Atlanta

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,420
The greatest of all the college stations

11
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:59,020
Well, except possibly the other college stations that carry this

12
00:00:59,020 --> 00:00:59,480
But I'm going to do it

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,900
Very demanding show

14
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,520
Anyway friends, stick around for

15
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,260
The lymph node institute special pre-verts, pre-voting

16
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,160
Hour of Slack

17
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:33,460
Oh babies

18
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,800
There's so many of you

19
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,020
Just be cool down the front and don't push around

20
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,900
Just keep still, keep together

21
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,760
Oh yeah

22
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:07,460
I'm the main well contest

23
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:13,140
Been around for a long, long year

24
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,580
So many man's souls to feed

25
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,780
I was round when Jesus cried

26
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,500
And I was grown from the sound of my bed

27
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,980
I'm the main well contest

28
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:29,460
I'm the main well contest

29
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,420
Restí‘¹ing hope

30
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,680
And the only hope

31
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:39,680
And there was no room for me

32
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,400
The only hope

33
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,400


34
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,400


35
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:43,400


36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,940
But I step further and come forward

37
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:46,080
And be meringue

38
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,620
Res review cage

39
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:55,000
And more exciting swag

40
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,960
To commanelthat

41
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,000
hey

42
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:11,560
and i'll try and stop it you're listening to bob slack time funhouse the lymph node institute

43
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,440
edition i'm doc i'm bugsy and tonight it's happening we're actually going to pay attention

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,100
to what those pink boys are doing and we're going to talk a little bit like we did

45
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,100
four goddamn years ago yeah we were in the space station then we were in the space station

46
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:31,840
and but we saw it coming and it's just bizarre because nothing like that it was unprecedented

47
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,220
but we still saw it coming because we have bird's eye view outer space space birds and it may happen

48
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:41,780
again although i doubt it very highly because you are much more optimistic about that than i am i

49
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:47,100
have big fear about the next election i don't think and it's important to use passive voice

50
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:50,400
here i don't think it will be allowed to happen

51
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:58,240
because if you have two bum elections in a row wow thanks florida yeah exactly oh thanks thanks

52
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,060
katherine harris

53
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:11,780
the tiger who understood people once upon a time there was a tiger who escaped from a zoo in the

54
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:18,480
united states and made his way back to the jungle during his captivity the tiger had learned a great

55
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,260
deal about how men do things

56
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,080
and how they can do things

57
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:50,880
and he thought he would apply their methods to life in the jungle the first day he was home he met a leopard and he said there's no use in you and me hunting for food we'll make the other animals bring it to us how will we do that asked the leopard oh easy said the tiger you and i will tell everybody that we're going to put on a fight and that every animal will have to bring a freshly killed boar in order to get in and see the fight then we will just spar around and not hurt each other

58
00:04:51,080 --> 00:05:20,640
later you can say that you broke a bone in your paw during the second round and i'll say i broke a bone in my paw during the first round then we will announce a return engagement and they'll have to bring us more wild boars i don't think this will work said the leopard oh yes it will said the tiger you just go around saying you can't help winning because i'm a big palooka and i'll go around saying i can't lose because you're a big palooka and everybody will want to come and see the fight

59
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,060
Because i'm a big palooka And i'll go around saying i can't lose because you're a big palooka And everybody will want to come and see the fight

60
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:26,680
Now, so the leopard went round telling everybody that he couldn't help winning because the

61
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:31,520
tiger was a big palooka, and the tiger went round telling everybody he couldn't lose because

62
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,020
the leopard was a big palooka.

63
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:37,620
The night of the fight came and the tiger and the leopard were very hungry because they

64
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,240
hadn't gone out and done any hunting at all.

65
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:44,320
They wanted to get the fight over as soon as possible and eat some of the freshly killed

66
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,540
wild boars, which all the animals would bring to the fight.

67
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:54,040
But when the hour of the combat came, none of the animals at all showed up.

68
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,960
The way I look at it, a fox told them, is this.

69
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:06,540
If the leopard can't help winning and the tiger can't lose, it'll be a draw, and a draw

70
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:13,400
is a very dull thing to watch, particularly when fought by fighters who are both big palookas.

71
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:17,440
The animals all saw the logic of this and stayed away.

72
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,440
When it got to be midnight, it was obvious that none of the animals would appear and

73
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:24,460
there wouldn't be any wild boar meat to devour.

74
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:27,580
The tiger and the leopard fell upon each other in a rage.

75
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:33,360
They were both injured so badly and they were both so worn out by hunger that a couple of

76
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,520
wild boars came wandering along, attacked them and killed them easily.

77
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:44,100
Moral, if you live as humans do, it will be the end of you.

78
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,200
I love you, I love you, I love you.

79
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:47,400
I love you, I love you, I love you.

80
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:47,400


81
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:47,400


82
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:47,400


83
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,840
Right-wing people.

84
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,380
The Islamic movement is starting to gather lots of different parts of society.

85
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,980
CBS News.

86
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,320
Fighting the truth.

87
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,240
CBS News.

88
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,700
Fighting the facts.

89
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,360
With ear.

90
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,320
CBS News.

91
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:08,640
Fighting the truth.

92
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,600
CBS News.

93
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,980
Fighting the facts.

94
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,840
The truth about CBS News.

95
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,920
Tomorrow.

96
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:14,920
Experience.

97
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,120
Anthrax.

98
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:19,580
I think they ought to do to make this interesting and they could sponsor it like, uh...

99
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:22,240
278-070-16.

100
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:28,460
The United States, who is responsible for these dastardly acts today, including President Bush,

101
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:34,120
despite the fact that he is a multimillionaire, requires additional financial support from

102
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,320
somewhere to carry out this kind of operation.

103
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:42,340
This thing being carried out with great precision is consistent with the hard fact.

104
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:42,980
You got it.

105
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,500
76.

106
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,000
76.

107
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,100
So we all remember.

108
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,180
There's no doubt.

109
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,080
070.

110
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,680
President Bush is a terrorist.

111
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:55,900
And by the way, the Pentagon and the CIA are...

112
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:56,260
You got it.

113
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:01,900
The kind of organizations that have the kind of capacity that would have been necessary

114
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,040
to conduct the attack that we saw on the 11th.

115
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,960
They know what they've done.

116
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,060
They know when they're going to do it.

117
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:12,840
And they know what consequences might be coming back in their direction.

118
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,720
Terror attacks.

119
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,920
Continue to clear the...

120
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,520
Incendiary.

121
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,580
Hijacked planes.

122
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:19,580
Doomed passengers.

123
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:28,720
We pause as we remember September the 11th, 2001, the World Trade Center.

124
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,880
Sandy Patty, our national anthem.

125
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:43,560
Who's that?

126
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,420
Death toll.

127
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,140
One.

128
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,320
I'm out.

129
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,540
Post Office.

130
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:49,540


131
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,220
Ages.

132
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:57,880
So.

133
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:57,960


134
00:08:57,960 --> 00:08:58,340
One,

135
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,160
Hell,

136
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,600
GOG social network station.

137
00:08:59,600 --> 00:08:59,620
San Francisco.

138
00:08:59,620 --> 00:08:59,620


139
00:08:59,620 --> 00:08:59,660
VO2 Rocket.

140
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:02,140
On Facebook.

141
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,800
We are the best of the Middle East.

142
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:11,180
We're made in the 21st century and how do we resolve conflicts between tribes in the

143
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,040
federal and state government?

144
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:14,440
Nossa Frida streets beeog ì €v.

145
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,020
Sorri betrayal.

146
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,080
Hey,COFOG is fired.

147
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,080


148
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:23,160
You're a... you're a... you've been given sovereignty and you're viewed as a sovereign entity.

149
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:28,880
And...

150
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,100
And...

151
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:40,800
And...

152
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:54,380
Too many OBGYNs aren't able to practice their love with women all across this country.

153
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:59,740
Too many OBGYNs aren't able to practice their love with women all across this country.

154
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,760
But he's still the same person I met at a backyard barbecue in Midland, Texas,

155
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,780
and married.

156
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,300
and married.

157
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,620
Once you turn everything pink, it stays pink.

158
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,800
He goes on.

159
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,900
Once you turn everything pink, it stays pink.

160
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,240
He goes on.

161
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,160
I'd like you to contact your congressman and contact your senator.

162
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:27,600
Tell him to come on the side of the people.

163
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:37,900
He'll always tell you what he really thinks.

164
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:41,100
Our enemies are innovative and resourceful.

165
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,160
And so are we.

166
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:48,020
They never stop thinking about new ways to harm our country and our people.

167
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,800
And neither do we.

168
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,320
He was one of your presidents.

169
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:05,080
The last time I told you about the curse of Tecumseh,

170
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:07,260
I may have left a few things out.

171
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,400
In 1811, future President William Henry Harrison,

172
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,520
then governor of Indiana,

173
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,700
led an attack against the Native Americans

174
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:20,220
known as the Battle of Tippecanoe.

175
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,440
The battle, a victory that broke the back of Tecumseh's Confederation of Tribes,

176
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,200
fatally wounded the United Native American Resistance

177
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,200
against white colonization.

178
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:35,140
A momentous achievement indeed.

179
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:40,620
A year later, Tecumseh desperately threw in with the British

180
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,320
in the War of 1812.

181
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,620
As is their way,

182
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,900
the British army fled the Battle of the Thames

183
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,680
and Tecumseh was killed.

184
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:53,740
It wasn't until Harrison became president

185
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,540
and died in office, though,

186
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:58,100
that the whispers of a curse began.

187
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:03,580
President Harrison was the first president to die in office,

188
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,800
contracting pneumonia secondary to the Indian curse.

189
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,160
A fluke took a step towards becoming a trend

190
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,760
with Abraham Lincoln,

191
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,940
who was elected,

192
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,160
elected in 1860,

193
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,940
and then re-elected in 1864.

194
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,620
But not for long.

195
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,280
A Catholic cabal struck him down on April 14th of 1865.

196
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,660
In 1880, it officially became a trend

197
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,280
when General James Garfield won the presidency

198
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,800
by a scant 10,000 votes.

199
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,600
He proceeded to piss off big business

200
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,320
and the New York political machine,

201
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:44,580
and, less than four months into his term,

202
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:47,000
on July 2nd, 1881,

203
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,700
he was shot by an angry lawyer,

204
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:51,420
Charles Guiteau.

205
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,580
He died on September 19th,

206
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:58,720
after months of tasty torture at the hands of quacks,

207
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,380
which may have been some sort of Masonic ritual.

208
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:04,440
It basically just gets spooky in 1900,

209
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:08,780
when President William McKinley is re-elected to his second term.

210
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,040
He was standing in a receiving line

211
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,820
at the Buffalo Pan American Exposition,

212
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,560
when he was told,

213
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:16,940
that an anarchist with an unpronounceable name,

214
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,640
that, on first inspection,

215
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,640
looks like some kind of joke,

216
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:24,600
Leon Sholgaz, possibly,

217
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:29,300
C-Z-O-L-G-O-S-Z,

218
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,880
shot him twice in the chest.

219
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:35,460
You know, for anarchy.

220
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,860
President McKinley had the decency to linger

221
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,540
for a mere eight days,

222
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,540
and died on September 14th,

223
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,780
1901.

224
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:48,360
Again, medical incompetence played its role,

225
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:51,560
giving him a touch of the gangrene before he died.

226
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,820
Mr. Sholgaz's trial started a week later,

227
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:55,940
and lasted a day.

228
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,040
He was executed less than two months after the act.

229
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,680
Like a good Hoshishin,

230
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,020
he signed a confession,

231
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,400
and was unapologetic.

232
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:05,260
By now, you may be noticing,

233
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:08,380
that all the presidents elected in a zero year,

234
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,020
eventually died in office.

235
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,900
And this trend continued in 1920.

236
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,080
With Warren Harding,

237
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,520
who was perhaps the worst president ever.

238
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:20,780
The Federal Vampire and Zombie Agency indicates

239
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:24,040
that he was bitten by a vampire planted by Al Capone.

240
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:27,420
Officially, the return to normalcy candidate,

241
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,960
embattled by multiple scandals,

242
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,900
fled to Alaska,

243
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:34,880
and died of food poisoning on August 2nd, 1923.

244
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,280
His wife died the next year,

245
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:39,980
on November 21st, 1924.

246
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:42,760
FDR, like Lincoln, survived.

247
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,400
He survived his zero year presidency,

248
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:49,260
but finally stroked out on April 12th, 1945,

249
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,560
in his fourth term as president.

250
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:55,400
In 1960, JFK was elected,

251
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,440
and we all know who killed him,

252
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:59,680
on November 21st, 1963.

253
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,840
Ronald Reagan was elected in 1980,

254
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,280
and after just a few months in office,

255
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,200
was shot by a son of George Bush's friend.

256
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:11,220
He died and was replaced by a CIA robot,

257
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,020
on March 30th, 1981.

258
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,320
Which brings us to the much contested 2000 election.

259
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,080
Wasn't that exciting?

260
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:25,200
Actually, John Hinckley Sr. was supposed to meet Neil Bush,

261
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,580
our current president's brother,

262
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,160
the evening that Reagan was shot.

263
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,860
But, you get the picture.

264
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:37,520
And yes, the 2000 election was exciting.

265
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,600
A little more exciting,

266
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,440
because subsequent interviews with Reagan's surgeons

267
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,800
have revealed that Reagan's heart was in fact stopped,

268
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:51,100
in order to remove an exploding round

269
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:54,060
that didn't, from his chest.

270
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:58,020
So, technically, Reagan died.

271
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,980
And we don't even need that CIA robot theory anymore.

272
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,660
So the proof of the trend will be tested

273
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,220
in the fate of George Bush,

274
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:13,520
who may be part of a sub-trend within the curse.

275
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,520
Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt,

276
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:18,560
both wartime presidents,

277
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,480
survived their zero-year terms,

278
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:29,700
but died in the following April of 1865 and 1945, respectively.

279
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,300
If this trend holds and Bush is re-elected,

280
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,680
then, well, let's just say

281
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,460
I would rather not look at statues of his stupid face

282
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,120
for the rest of my life.

283
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,640
And neither, I believe,

284
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:49,000
would certain unknowable power nodes.

285
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,360
I believe that in an attempt to break the curse,

286
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,820
among other things,

287
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,240
the Bush campaign will be sabotaged

288
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,020
just enough to let Kerry squeak by,

289
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,360
and then beat him in a landslide in 2008

290
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,400
with Jeb or maybe George again.

291
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,220
Oh, you think perhaps they don't know about it?

292
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,740
Why do you think they picked the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln

293
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,920
for the mission-accomplished photo op?

294
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:22,980
But yes, there is another scenario.

295
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,860
They go ahead and let him win.

296
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:29,960
And in the cruel month of April,

297
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,340
possibly on Mrs. Ellis's birthday,

298
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:35,160
ancient scales tip,

299
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:38,720
and vengeful ghosts take their sacrifice.

300
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:40,420
What then?

301
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:45,900
A Christian martyr to guide us on a new crusade.

302
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,480
Who could fill the vacuum?

303
00:18:49,220 --> 00:18:53,700
Surely Cheney would die from media exposure within six weeks.

304
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:57,480
Ample opportunity for a centrist,

305
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,120
a war hero,

306
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:02,460
a senator from Arizona.

307
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,140
This scenario might explain

308
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,440
McCain's return to the grassy fold lately.

309
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:13,380
After all, McCain's idol is Teddy Roosevelt,

310
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:16,100
who was elected by Tecumseh

311
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:18,620
when President McKinley was assassinated.

312
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:22,060
So, I'll bet a nickel on Kerry,

313
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,440
but four cents on Bush.

314
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,560
But the real game is trying to figure out

315
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,320
which way Tecumseh will win.

316
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,000
Time will tell.

317
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:39,340
Time will tell.

318
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:44,440
Time will tell.

319
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,320
Time will tell.

320
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,640
Time will tell.

321
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:48,660
Time will tell.

322
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,440
Time will tell.

323
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,020
Joke about this if you can.

324
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,200
Assassination.

325
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,220
Are you trying to organize or prevent one?

326
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,540
Prevent.

327
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,280
They would have to take reprisals.

328
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,580
Everybody would suffer.

329
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:04,520
They've heard.

330
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:05,960
They are aware.

331
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,800
And they don't need anyone's help.

332
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,960
They don't believe me.

333
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,900
Many times bitten, forever shy.

334
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,200
But they are not shy.

335
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,400
They love to listen.

336
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:18,980
Jamming.

337
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:19,820
Jamming?

338
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:20,940
Domestic science?

339
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,380
You learn about jamming one of these days.

340
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,060
It's the most important ways of fighting back.

341
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,760
All right, enlighten me now.

342
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:28,260
No.

343
00:20:28,260 --> 00:20:30,240
I tell lies, remember?

344
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:32,080
I'll call in any time you like.

345
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:35,620
But my safety is unimportant as long as my people are imprisoned.

346
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,640
Now, when you're queen,

347
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:41,280
you will know that no ruler is truly safe or secure

348
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:43,500
as long as her people are not free.

349
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,160
I'm here to deliver a warning.

350
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:46,820
A warning?

351
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:49,820
What about?

352
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,300
A plot to kill you.

353
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,780
To what?

354
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,300
To kill you.

355
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,680
Assassinate you.

356
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:57,080
Huh?

357
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,220
Assassinate you.

358
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,760
I don't believe it.

359
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,940
They should have told you.

360
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,620
There are some unhappy people here.

361
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,500
Yes, well, I have seen the list of malcontents.

362
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,180
It might interest you to know that you happen to be top of the bill.

363
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,000
I do my best to live up to it.

364
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:18,260
Yeah, what, by saving my despicable life?

365
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:19,480
Not for your sake.

366
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:19,860
Oh.

367
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:21,640
What then?

368
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,280
If they succeed in killing you, what action would your people take?

369
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,440
Oh, well, they would punish those responsible for...

370
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,780
What else would you expect them to do?

371
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:31,660
Punish everyone.

372
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,860
Amass, reprisal, and never to be forgotten, deterrent.

373
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:36,960
Oh, I see.

374
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:37,680
Yeah.

375
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,060
Well, I still don't believe it.

376
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,160
My observers would have told me.

377
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:44,340
They do see and hear everything, you know.

378
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,000
They don't believe everything.

379
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,540
You're referring to jamming.

380
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,280
No, jamming.

381
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:54,920
Well, naturally, when a person is known to us as one who continually...

382
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:55,240
...is...

383
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:55,540
Tom.

384
00:21:55,800 --> 00:22:00,980
Yes, well, we expected something like this, that they'd try to get through to us through a dupe.

385
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:01,440
Hmm.

386
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,440
So they chose you to lead us into believing their fantasies, eh?

387
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:12,900
Well, uh, did they tell you how they're going to go about it, or where, when?

388
00:22:14,060 --> 00:22:18,960
Would you find out for me, because the laugh will do me an awful lot of good.

389
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,620
You may find out yourself, quite suddenly.

390
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,100
In which case, you won't be laughing.

391
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,500
I call them dogs.

392
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:31,140
And if they're lapping up their own vomit, the only way to stop them is with a lash.

393
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,520
But dogs only obey their own nature, so why shouldn't we forgive them?

394
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:43,920
Dogs can be taught many useful things, but not if we forgive them every time they obey their own nature.

395
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,960
I'd left orders that I was not to be disturbed.

396
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:50,040
I have to say, it won't wait.

397
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,100
I know what it is.

398
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,320
Tomorrow, after I've handed over office,

399
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,960
I'm to be assassinated.

400
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,060
Or assassinated.

401
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:58,560
Substitute.

402
00:22:59,440 --> 00:22:59,880
Executed.

403
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,500
Since it's arranged by my own people, you mean.

404
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,300
You don't mind?

405
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,580
Of course I mind.

406
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,160
It's just that, well, I never thought it would happen to me.

407
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:11,660
It never does.

408
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,060
To anybody.

409
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,280
But it can be prevented.

410
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,220
Preventing is only postponing.

411
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,940
We never fail.

412
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,640
Anyway, why should you care what happens to me?

413
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:24,900
I don't.

414
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,140
But innocent people will be blamed.

415
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:30,460
I know.

416
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,940
I'm sorry, but there's nothing that I can do.

417
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,980
I can think of better ways to die.

418
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:43,260
And better causes to die for.

419
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,820
No, nothing can go wrong now. I'll stake my future on it.

420
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,820
Well, thank you, sir.

421
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,260
Yeah, I know you will.

422
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,440
People who live here...

423
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,680
are doing their best under...

424
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:04,180
very hard circumstances.

425
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,320
You say so, Grace.

426
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,260
But, um, is their best...

427
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,040
really good enough?

428
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,660
That's what I want to use the power for, if you don't mind.

429
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,820
I want to make this world...

430
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,040
a little better.

431
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,980
If there's any town this world would be better without, this is it.

432
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,960
Yes, and so the great day is nearly over.

433
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,240
It went off rather well, I thought.

434
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,660
Better than planned.

435
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,420
And now you can look forward to your own retirement,

436
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,320
and I'm sure they'll arrange something equally suitable for you...

437
00:24:45,320 --> 00:24:46,880
when the day comes.

438
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,200
Off the loose!

439
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:50,720
Right ahead!

440
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:51,860
Nothing's falling!

441
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,680
What the fuck are you guys doing up there?

442
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,840
The Earth is a

443
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:00,840


444
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:00,840


445
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,240
Space

446
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:01,260
Space

447
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,260


448
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,260


449
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,260


450
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,640
Space

451
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:01,640


452
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:01,640


453
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:01,640


454
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:01,640


455
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:01,640


456
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:02,960
Space

457
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:02,960


458
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:03,040
Space

459
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:03,040


460
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:16,860
Space

461
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:16,860


462
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:16,860


463
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:16,860


464
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:16,860


465
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,660
Space Space Space

466
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,560
Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Space Coto

467
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:27,020
Right, and lookit, everyone!

468
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,260
I'm the president,

469
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,020
Ah, up here, street.

470
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,320
I, personally, need you to...

471
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,980
Drop dead!

472
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,720
I don't care about confessions,

473
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,920
but I don't care what you lost,

474
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:46,280
the only thing that goes on by this world is my own ass.

475
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,260
I know what I'm doing.

476
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,740
You're on the edge.

477
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:50,800
Don't go back.

478
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:52,740
I know what you have to do.

479
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,760
What's that?

480
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,200
You son of a bitch.

481
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,180
Now my daddy gave me this, my little one.

482
00:25:58,360 --> 00:25:59,660
And I will succeed.

483
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,700
But for now, I'll need you to.

484
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,480
Drop that, drop that, drop that, drop that, drop that, drop that, drop that.

485
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,360
It's a f***ing dad.

486
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,280
Thank you and God bless.

487
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,620
I mean, back to Springsteen.

488
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,040
Why are these people talking up now?

489
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,160
I think it's mostly because of what the FCC's been doing.

490
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,260
Michael Powell, who's Colin Powell's son.

491
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:20,540
It's not like he was involved in the McDonaldland massacre by Coven.

492
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,180
McDeath!

493
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:23,640
Michael Powell has been the head of the FCC,

494
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:28,660
which has been one of the most controversial and retarded FCCs that we've ever had.

495
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:29,920
Yeah, the ownership rules.

496
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,080
That's ridiculous, dude.

497
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:33,540
It's the indecency attacks I don't get.

498
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:37,180
We're talking about free speech in a free nation, quotes all over the place.

499
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,960
Freedom, that's one of those stories we tell ourselves.

500
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,680
It ain't slander, it ain't libel.

501
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:45,060
Here's a little number I wrote the other day while out duck hunting with a judge.

502
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,580
Quack.

503
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,520
So Howard Stern must go.

504
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:20,260
Attorney General Ashcroft doesn't like strong words and so.

505
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,120
He's charging twice as much as all the drugs for Rush Limbaugh.

506
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,980
So f*** off you all so very much.

507
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,780
So f*** off you very much, dear Mr. Bush.

508
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:34,880
For heroically sitting on your tush.

509
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:39,580
For Halliburton, Enron, all the companies who fail.

510
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:43,580
Let's send them a clear signal and stick Martha straight in jail.

511
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:44,740
She's an uppity.

512
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,480
Rich bitch.

513
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,420
And at least she isn't male.

514
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:50,300
So f*** off you all so very much.

515
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:54,160
So f*** off you, kid head, Mr. Chaney, too.

516
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:58,020
F*** off you and f*** off everything you do.

517
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:01,320
Your pacemaker must be a fake.

518
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,840
You haven't got a heart.

519
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,880
As far as I'm concerned, you're just a pasty-faced old fart.

520
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,680
And as for Condoleezza, she's an intellectual tart.

521
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,580
So f*** off you all so very much.

522
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,120
So f*** off you very much, the EPA.

523
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,180
For giving all Alaska's oil away.

524
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:26,200
It really is a bummer when I can't fill my hummer.

525
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,820
The ozone's a no-go zone now that Arnold's here to say

526
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:33,580
the nuclear winter games are going to take place in L.A.

527
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:36,820
So f*** off you all so very much.

528
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,560
So what the planet fails, let's save the great white males.

529
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,260
And f*** off you all so very much.

530
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:45,780
Quack.

531
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:50,460
Yeah, let's do some gay bashing for a second.

532
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,940
But you're aware our old secretary Charlie Tann is in dire straits.

533
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:54,560
Of course.

534
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,620
We wish him nothing but the best.

535
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,080
Let's just selectively gay bash.

536
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,380
Let's gay bash current, up until a couple weeks from now,

537
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,440
Representative Ed Schrock.

538
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,780
No one knows who he is.

539
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:04,640
S-C-H-R-O-C-K.

540
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,340
They don't know who he is.

541
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,620
You don't know who Ed Schrock is?

542
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:06,920
No, they don't.

543
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,360
Ed Schrock was Pat Robertson's personal representative

544
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,560
in the United States Congress coming from a district in East Virginia.

545
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,100
Mm-hmm.

546
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:15,360
Mm-hmm.

547
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,780
Where Pat Robertson's based out of.

548
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,120
And he's been supporting this Ed Schrock.

549
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,300
He's been in for two terms.

550
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,880
He's one of the most conservative members of the House of Representatives.

551
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:27,320
He's not the guy that got them to start talking about adding an amendment

552
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:29,300
to the Constitution to ban gay marriage, is he?

553
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,940
As a matter of fact, I don't know if he initiated the conversation,

554
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,800
but he sure as hell has been pushing it.

555
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:37,120
He has been pushing that agenda.

556
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:39,660
That's been pretty much his number one thing.

557
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,280
But that's not all he's been pushing, is it?

558
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:43,520
No, that's not all he's been pushing.

559
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,140
This might be a good time to mention,

560
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:49,320
that, again, to reiterate, it's so easy to forget this.

561
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:53,900
The politicians, the Kerrys, the Bushes, the Edwards, the Cheneys,

562
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,780
all these people are subs.

563
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,120
They're all subgenius.

564
00:29:57,220 --> 00:30:03,800
They are all far weirder than your 1995 nose ring from the mall will ever make you.

565
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:06,260
These are the prime weirdos.

566
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:07,420
They're weirdos squared.

567
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,900
They're weirdos to the power of weirdness,

568
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:14,220
because not only are they strange, bizarre mothers who are out just like us,

569
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:15,120
but they fight.

570
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,400
They repress it.

571
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,580
And they've probably been repressing it their entire goddamn lives.

572
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,560
W is very good at repression.

573
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:22,120
He is.

574
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:29,260
And that is why they act so crazy when it comes to gays or drug users or the underclass or whatever.

575
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:32,420
It's because these guys are all totally insane.

576
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,300
And in order to fight their own insanity, which they shouldn't even do, but they do,

577
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,920
and in order to fight it, they have to fight everyone else's insanity at the same time.

578
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,240
Sure.

579
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:42,600
Sure.

580
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:42,600


581
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:42,980
Sure.

582
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,140
Sure.

583
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:43,960
Sure.

584
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:44,000


585
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,260
Sure.

586
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


587
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


588
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


589
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


590
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


591
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


592
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


593
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


594
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


595
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


596
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


597
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


598
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


599
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


600
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


601
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


602
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,100


603
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,620
So, I wonder if they could find a gay dateline and leave a message like this.

604
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:49,720
I weigh 200 pounds.

605
00:30:50,080 --> 00:30:51,060
Six foot four.

606
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,020
Eight miles long.

607
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,940
Very busted.

608
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:53,840
Very busted up.

609
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,460
Very tanned.

610
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,360
I just like to get together with the guy.

611
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,160
Time to time.

612
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,220
Just to play.

613
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:03,340
I'd like him to be in very good shape.

614
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,040
Flat stomach.

615
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:04,540
Good chest.

616
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:05,100
Good arms.

617
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:05,800
Well hung.

618
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,280
Cut.

619
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,720
Just to get naked.

620
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,080
Play and do what happens.

621
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,060
Nothing real heavy duty, but just a fun time.

622
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,860
Put out on him.

623
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,740
and we can do that on May.

624
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:17,680
Just take it from there.

625
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:18,760
Hope to hear from you.

626
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,160
Bye.

627
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,060
That was hot.

628
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:21,080
That was hot, man.

629
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,520
I'm thinking of calling him myself.

630
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:23,740
Wow, but now,

631
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,260
why would he be...

632
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,060
Oh, oh,

633
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,000
now I think I understand

634
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,420
why he's so against the gays.

635
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,080
Yeah, because he's been trying

636
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:31,600
to wrestle, as it were,

637
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:32,980
with his own issues,

638
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,380
which shouldn't even be an issue.

639
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:36,100
As soon as this tape was released,

640
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,220
he announced he would not be

641
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,100
running for re-election.

642
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,540
Because it would be used against him.

643
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,060
If it goes away now,

644
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:41,760
they'll let it go.

645
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:42,780
I'm for president.

646
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,740
I'm for president.

647
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,760
I'm for president.

648
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,680
I'm for president.

649
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,780
I'm for president.

650
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,720
I'm for president.

651
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,820
You like Ike?

652
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:51,720
I like Ike.

653
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,240
Everybody likes Ike.

654
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:53,760
I'm for president.

655
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:54,820
Hang out the banner.

656
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:55,500
Be the drug.

657
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:57,260
We'll take Ike to Washington.

658
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:58,640
We don't want John.

659
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:58,920
Or he.

660
00:31:59,160 --> 00:31:59,680
Or Harry.

661
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,120
Let's do that big job right.

662
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:02,540
Just get in step

663
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,600
with the guy that's left.

664
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:05,540
Get in step with Ike.

665
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:06,800
You like Ike?

666
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,740
I like Ike.

667
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,260
Everybody likes Ike.

668
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:09,820
I'm for president.

669
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:10,780
Hang out the banner.

670
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:11,580
Be the drug.

671
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,320
We'll take Ike to Washington.

672
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,740
We've got to get where we are going

673
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:17,800
Travel day and night for President

674
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,580
Let's have a late for the other way

675
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:21,240
We'll all go with I

676
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,660
I like I, I like I

677
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,820
Everybody likes I for President

678
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:27,660
Hang off the ballot, keep the gun

679
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:29,400
We'll take night to Washington

680
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:31,600
We'll take night to Washington

681
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:35,980
Now is the time for all good Americans

682
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,040
to come to the aid of their country.

683
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:39,740
Pay for vaccine for President.

684
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,220
How you doing?

685
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:45,280
I'm doing good.

686
00:32:46,660 --> 00:32:47,960
My name is Hillary Clinton.

687
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,780
Damn it.

688
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:52,740
How you doing?

689
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:54,940
I'm doing good.

690
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,580
My name is Hillary Clinton.

691
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,380
Damn it.

692
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,260
I saw that idea

693
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:07,040
of using the Ayatollah Khomeini's money

694
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:10,120
to support the Nicaraguan freedom fighters

695
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,740
as a good one.

696
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,120
I still do.

697
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,220
I don't think it was wrong.

698
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,980
I think it was a neat idea.

699
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,360
Golly, I'm so impressed.

700
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,600
Try this out.

701
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:22,600


702
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:22,600


703
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:27,300
Yes.

704
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:32,680
Do you know what that means?

705
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,780
speak up

706
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,460
oh my

707
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,280
I'm serious

708
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,280


709
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,280


710
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,280


711
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:36,580
OK

712
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:37,200
You can have one.

713
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,780
I've never been seen this way

714
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:40,660
I mean it's fair and allow you the prostitt borders

715
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:40,660


716
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:42,200
If something comes up, just drop me a text

717
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:42,980
Don't say you'll have it set didn't you?

718
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:43,720
I really think that I'll live forever.

719
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:45,360
My left.

720
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:55,780
I am a southerner.

721
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:58,140
I am a southerner.

722
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,920
I love this part of the country.

723
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,360
We demonize black people.

724
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,800
I am a southerner.

725
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:10,160
I am a southerner.

726
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,940
I love this part of the country.

727
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:15,360
I love this part of the country.

728
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:19,300
How have we lived with these contradictions all this time?

729
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:22,420
By finding somebody to demonize.

730
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:23,640
Thank you.

731
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,860
Breathe my life.

732
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:52,660
Breathe my life.

733
00:34:53,140 --> 00:34:54,260
Breathe my life.

734
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:55,120
Breathe my life.

735
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:55,380
Breathe my life.

736
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:55,640
Breathe my life.

737
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:55,880


738
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:57,000
Breathe my life.

739
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,280
Excuse me, Colonel North.

740
00:34:58,380 --> 00:35:00,560
I'm with the London Daily Tabloid.

741
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,240
What do you say to your detractors' charges

742
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:06,620
that you are pun-sucking incompetent

743
00:35:06,620 --> 00:35:08,660
who sold arms to the Ayatollah

744
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:11,280
and profited at the expense of the American people?

745
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,740
You can't comment on that.

746
00:35:12,940 --> 00:35:24,660
I don't have to change walls.

747
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:25,640
I'm who I am.

748
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,720
It's all in my head.

749
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:27,720


750
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:27,860
We all say we're not stupid,

751
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:28,900
and I'm in the last stages of the Oscars.

752
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:28,900


753
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:28,900


754
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:29,140
who drop their fists

755
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,140


756
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,460
Nothing that could change every single human being's life.

757
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:30,360
Hi.

758
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,560
Feel the truth.

759
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,060
BudÅ¾i.

760
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:36,060


761
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,420
Life goes on.

762
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:37,540
Exercise helps you take thanks.

763
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,540


764
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:37,700
Blood tests objective.

765
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,560
Child can't keep up.

766
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,540
Breathe my lips.

767
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,840
Breathe my lips.

768
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:14,340
Breathe my lips.

769
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:26,560
The one thing they could do to actually increase freedom in this country is something they have in Russia,

770
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,320
which is actually on its way towards the oligarchy again.

771
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:38,020
But one thing they have in Russia that we don't is every contest on a ballot has one box

772
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:43,300
that says none of the above, which guarantees that if one person is running,

773
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:45,880
they always have to compete with none of the above.

774
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,320
If you added none of the above to the presidential election,

775
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:53,860
you would have voter turnout in the 90s and none of the above would win.

776
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:58,340
And the great part about that is you can vote none of the above for a lot of categories

777
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:01,340
and if there's something that actually does interest you, you can vote for it.

778
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,720
And it might be enough to get you off your ass and into a booth.

779
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,000
Just say no to all of it. No.

780
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,920
You can vote.

781
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:08,500
Not that way.

782
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:09,120
Straight party. Nobody.

783
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:13,380
But since it's not that way, there are a lot of people out there that think the whole process is a farce.

784
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,060
And it is, to an extent. It's not a complete farce.

785
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:16,980
There's some wiggle room.

786
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:20,200
When I grow up, I want to be a president.

787
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,360
Nobody for president.

788
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:37,380
Nobody I like.

789
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:40,440
Nobody for president.

790
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,380
The candidates can all take a hike.

791
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:46,900
Spending all their money on a voting campaign.

792
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,200
While all those people sleep in the rain.

793
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,900
Fuck for me, his smiling face on TV.

794
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,340
Doesn't always make a man out of me.

795
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:58,240
Nobody for president.

796
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,080
Nobody I trust.

797
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,280
Nobody for president.

798
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:07,180
Powering green is their lust.

799
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:11,040
You and your head buried deep in the sand.

800
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,120
Take a look around at what's happening to our land.

801
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:16,820
Home of the brave. Land of the free.

802
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,400
Yeah, we let our name claim victory.

803
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:20,400
No way.

804
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,180
Nobody for president.

805
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,180
No one I would hire.

806
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,100
Nobody for president.

807
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:31,220
They're all a bunch of losers and liars.

808
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,740
And those of you that hold on voting days.

809
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:36,780
I think it's a crime and a sin.

810
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,660
You've got a choice, so raise your voice.

811
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:42,800
Let me show that nobody wins.

812
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:09,460
Nobody for president.

813
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,400
Not worth another look.

814
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:15,560
Nobody for president.

815
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:18,340
Unless you want a comic book run.

816
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:22,120
Show me a puppet who wants a job.

817
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,840
And I'll show you a corporation or the mob.

818
00:39:25,320 --> 00:39:28,100
Wishy washy politician can't make up his mind.

819
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,800
A man who tells the truth is hard to find.

820
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:33,780
A man who tells the truth is hard to find.

821
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,720
A man who tells the truth is hard to find.

822
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:39,600
A man who tells the truth is hard to find.

823
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:41,940
Here it is. Here's my thoughts on it.

824
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:47,200
If we leave Nick Bush in office, he's going to do the Christian apocalypse.

825
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,960
And the subgeniuses are going to be standing there with your in the wind.

826
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:56,200
And Bob is going to be floating off in a limousine with George Bush.

827
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:57,520
Alright? Is that what you want?

828
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,180
You want them to have their goddamn apocalypse before we have ours?

829
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,400
But I don't care about Christians or Muslims.

830
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,820
They're going to torch the whole goddamn planet.

831
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:10,560
It's going to be no Nick of pleasure vessels and no alien sex goddesses.

832
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,700
And we'll be dying of undemaged in Christian hell.

833
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:18,600
Well, okay. For all of you that enjoy getting high in the next and something else.

834
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,820
Getting your eyelids pulled off.

835
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,280
Either way, we go to Christian hell.

836
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,940
If they do their apocalypse.

837
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:26,480
From nations around the world.

838
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,260
For freedom.

839
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,300
And they can't take that away.

840
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:39,460
The nation with a broken president.

841
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:42,500
The president wounded to the core.

842
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:46,720
Now taking aim at the American people.

843
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:49,380
The sacrifice.

844
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,360
Taking aim at the American people.

845
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,560
A CS News special report.

846
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,340
The danger.

847
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,540
The sacrifice.

848
00:41:00,540 --> 00:41:00,840
Your advice.

849
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:06,240
The president addresses Congress and the Pentagon.

850
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:14,240
Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the distinct honor of presenting to you the president of the United States.

851
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,000
I was wounded.

852
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:15,700
And throwing ourselves.

853
00:41:16,060 --> 00:41:17,280
You want to hear from us.

854
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:18,700
Thank you again.

855
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:23,360
For your love, your compassion, your grace, and Lord, your hope.

856
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,840
And we pray for peace.

857
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,480
Americans are asking,

858
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,840
Who attacked our country?

859
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:37,540
the evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated police forces,

860
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,540
intelligence service, dozens of federal departments and agencies,

861
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:44,380
as well as state and local governments and banking systems around the world.

862
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:48,840
Americans are asking, how will we fight and win this war?

863
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:53,120
By sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists,

864
00:41:53,940 --> 00:41:59,340
by sacrificing human life, by aiding and abetting murder and those who commit evil.

865
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:04,300
And tonight, the United States of America is committing murder on thousands of civilians

866
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:08,380
in places like Afghanistan, like the war against Iraq a decade ago,

867
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:14,940
and make no distinctions among military and civilians, including women and children.

868
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,220
And that is good.

869
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:22,560
This is the fight of all who believe in fascism, Nazism and totalitarianism.

870
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:24,960
And remember why so many hate us.

871
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,360
And there is a reason.

872
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,560
The United States of America.

873
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:29,200
Committed.

874
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:34,500
In an act of war against men and women from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico and Japan.

875
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,200
On thousands of civilians.

876
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,580
The United States of America.

877
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,180
It's threatening people everywhere.

878
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:45,260
Nations from Latin America to Asia to Africa to Europe to the Islamic world.

879
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:51,180
My administration will work with terrorists to plot evil and destruction.

880
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:52,920
To show the world.

881
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,480
Their own cities.

882
00:42:54,780 --> 00:42:56,000
Their own citizens.

883
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,700
May be next.

884
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:01,460
It's alright to be redneck.

885
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:08,940
I'm not the first to need a...

886
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:16,620
No president in the history of our country has ever delivered a speech such as this.

887
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:24,520
I must disagree with President Bush when he says we are targeted because we are a beacon of freedom and democracy.

888
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:29,320
Our Middle East policy has nothing to do with freedom.

889
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:30,040
We are only a beacon of freedom and democracy.

890
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:33,080
Talked about that too, presumably.

891
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:37,720
I mean all the lefties are real upset that Bush is the President and they don't feel that he got in legally.

892
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,400
Yeah, yeah, all the lefties are mentally ill.

893
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,520
Yeah, ok...

894
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:41,500
The United States of America.

895
00:43:41,860 --> 00:43:42,380
The United States of America.

896
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,980
The United States of America.

897
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:44,300
The United States of America.

898
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:44,300


899
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:52,740
On my orders the United States military has begun strikes against the starving and suffering men and women and children of Afghanistan.

900
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:58,560
The United States of America is a terrorist to the Afghan people.

901
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:07,340
The United States of America is an enemy of the freedom of people everywhere to live and raise their children free from fear.

902
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:15,580
All the men and women in our military, every sailor, every soldier, every airman, every Coast Guardsman, every Marine,

903
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:18,320
they have become outlaws and murderers themselves.

904
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:26,200
This military action is a part of our campaign against peace.

905
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,180
Turn to pieces.

906
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,020
We're gonna destroy a lot of things over there.

907
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:36,880
We're gonna bomb them over there.

908
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:43,980
We're gonna destroy a lot of things over there.

909
00:44:44,860 --> 00:44:48,180
We're gonna bomb them over there.

910
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,440
Hey! Hey people!

911
00:44:52,680 --> 00:44:57,080
Sisters! Brothers and sisters. Brothers and sisters!

912
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:04,280
Come on now. That means everybody just cool out.

913
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,000
Will you cool out everybody.

914
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:12,600
I know. I'm here.

915
00:45:14,940 --> 00:45:17,340
Everybody be cool now. Come on.

916
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:24,440
Alright. How are we doing over there?

917
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,640
Alright. Can we still make it down the front?

918
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:32,020
Is there anyone there that's hurt?

919
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:35,640
Everyone alright? Okay.

920
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:41,640
Alright. I think we're cool. We can go.

921
00:45:43,120 --> 00:45:46,040
Something very funny happens when we start that number.

922
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,720
We can go.

923
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:02,140
Please allow me to introduce myself.

924
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:06,260
I'm a man of wealth and taste.

925
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:11,460
Been around for a long, long year.

926
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,000
Stole many a man's soul and faith.

927
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:20,340
I was wrapped with Jesus Christ.

928
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:24,040
Had his moment of doubt and faith.

929
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,560
Made them children fire.

930
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:30,900
Watched his hand.

931
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:32,940
Sealed his faith.

932
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:39,080
Pleased to meet you baby.

933
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:41,800
Hope you're good to my day.

934
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,820
Ah yeah.

935
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:46,460
I want me a birthday.

936
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:47,940
If you're always just a

937
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:49,700
Nature outside.

938
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:50,580
Ah yeah.

939
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:52,700
Ah yeah.

940
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,620
Just took a ride in St. Petersburg.

941
00:46:58,300 --> 00:47:01,940
When our soul holds a tie for a change.

942
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:06,500
A death is all and it's been a stir.

943
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:10,480
And it's day to a scary day.

944
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:15,720
I broke a tank in a dead girl's tank.

945
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:18,120
I went to place free grace.

946
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,320
And the body is slain.

947
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,120
Now it's a piece of me too.

948
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,640
When I hope to get some more.

949
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:28,240
Ah yeah.

950
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:30,360
I don't know how to do it.

951
00:47:31,440 --> 00:47:32,700
But I'm confused.

952
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:34,100
And it's a

953
00:47:35,040 --> 00:47:36,080
Nature outside.

954
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,240
Ah yeah.

955
00:47:40,580 --> 00:47:41,680
Ah yeah.

956
00:47:41,860 --> 00:47:42,040
Ah yeah.

957
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:42,060
Ah yeah.

958
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:44,420
Watch me glee while you deem that peace.

959
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:46,260
From the dead today.

960
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,700
For the God-send me.

961
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,960
A shining light.

962
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:52,600
Feel the Kennedy.

963
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:53,420
Ah yeah.

964
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:57,460
Well, after all, it's you and me

965
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:01,660
Let me breathe, let me lose myself

966
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:05,600
While I'm a man of wealth and change

967
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:10,580
I didn't try to go through the door

968
00:48:10,580 --> 00:48:14,600
I can't tell the world every part of my brain

969
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,740
It needs to be too bad

970
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:23,120
Oh, it needs to be too bad

971
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,260
Oh, yeah

972
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,700
My life is worth it to you

973
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:31,120
It needs to be too bad

974
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:33,680
Oh, yeah

975
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,420
Just a memory

976
00:48:36,420 --> 00:48:38,580
God, there's a criminal

977
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,840
Oh, just enough

978
00:48:41,840 --> 00:48:42,880
Sorry

979
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:43,520
Sorry

980
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:43,900
Sorry

981
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:44,960
Oh, yeah

982
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,460
God, I lose myself

983
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:49,460
While I'm a hero

984
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,760
It's almost like

985
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:53,760
I'm at your feet

986
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:56,220
As you're trying

987
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,700
You're at the feet

988
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,180
Today

989
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:03,400
Oh, yeah

990
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:03,980
Well, I know

991
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:04,960
I live

992
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,940
I live

993
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:08,900
So what

994
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:10,620
It needs to be too bad

995
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:12,900
Oh, yeah

996
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,580
It needs to be too bad

997
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:14,580


998
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:14,860
Oh, yeah

999
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:15,000
It needs to be too bad

1000
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:16,120
Oh, yeah

1001
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,140
I hope you get the mind

1002
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:17,860
Hey

1003
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:19,940
Ah, yeah

1004
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,340
I want me to burn this

1005
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:22,900
God

1006
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,400
It needs to be too bad

1007
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:26,460
Hey

1008
00:49:27,260 --> 00:49:29,160
I need to get down with it now

1009
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:30,900
Oh, yeah

1010
00:49:32,820 --> 00:49:34,000
Oh, yeah

1011
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,980
Oh, yeah

1012
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:37,840
Oh, yeah

1013
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:39,480
Oh, yeah

1014
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:40,560
Oh, yeah

1015
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:40,960
Oh, yeah

1016
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:41,300
Oh, yeah

1017
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,440
Oh, yeah

1018
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,320
Oh, yeah

1019
00:49:56,340 --> 00:50:01,400
Oh, yeah

1020
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,500
Oh, yeah

1021
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:17,340
Oh, yeah

1022
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:22,460
Oh, yeah

1023
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:23,740
Oh, yeah

1024
00:50:23,740 --> 00:50:29,320
Oh, yeah

1025
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:30,880
Oh, yeah

1026
00:50:32,260 --> 00:50:33,820
Oh, yeah

1027
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,760
Oh, yeah

1028
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:36,020
Oh, yeah

1029
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:37,200
Go already

1030
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,780
Oh, yeah

1031
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,020
Oh, yeah

1032
00:50:41,020 --> 00:50:41,380
Oh, yeah

1033
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:41,780
Oh, yeah

1034
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,160
I don't really know

1035
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:42,980
Oh, yeah

1036
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:44,520
Oh, yeah

1037
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:49,720
Thank you.

1038
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:15,440
Hey!

1039
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,240
Get on down.

1040
00:51:18,340 --> 00:51:19,420
Get on down.

1041
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,320
Everybody got to cool out.

1042
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:24,100
Everybody

1043
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,800
has got to

1044
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:27,280
cool right now.

1045
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:30,080
Hey!

1046
00:51:30,640 --> 00:51:31,580
All down.

1047
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,900
Get on down.

1048
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:36,240
Get on down, boys.

1049
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,160
Get on down.

1050
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,200
All right.

1051
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:48,560
Uh, people,

1052
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,620
I mean, who's fighting what for?

1053
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,220
Who's fighting

1054
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,200
and what for?

1055
00:51:57,580 --> 00:51:59,000
Why are we

1056
00:51:59,000 --> 00:51:59,580
fighting?

1057
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:01,680
Why are we fighting?

1058
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,860
We don't want to fight.

1059
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:05,940
Come on.

1060
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,420
Do we want...

1061
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:09,200
Who wants to fight?

1062
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:09,680
Who is it?

1063
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:12,420
This text published in Harper's Magazine

1064
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,400
was an answer to the

1065
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:14,740
question,

1066
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:17,080
when did you stop

1067
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:18,740
wanting to be president?

1068
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,680
Now, this searching question

1069
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:25,060
was also put to Ronald Reagan,

1070
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:27,660
who was governor of California

1071
00:52:27,660 --> 00:52:28,700
at the time.

1072
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,560
And his answer is right next to mine.

1073
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:33,740
So I can safely say

1074
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:36,700
that the text you are about to hear

1075
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,200
was read by the president

1076
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:39,220
of the United States.

1077
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:40,340
He couldn't help it.

1078
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:44,320
When did I stop?

1079
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:45,700
When did I stop wanting to be president?

1080
00:52:45,840 --> 00:52:48,060
It's one of those wise guy questions.

1081
00:52:48,200 --> 00:52:50,940
When did you stop exposing yourself in public?

1082
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,860
President, not me.

1083
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:57,280
I don't have the qualifications.

1084
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:04,260
My political ambitions were simply of a humbler

1085
00:53:04,260 --> 00:53:05,980
and less conspicuous caliber.

1086
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:10,800
I aspired at one time to become commissioner of sewers

1087
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,360
for St. Louis County.

1088
00:53:13,460 --> 00:53:14,380
$300 a year.

1089
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:14,380


1090
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:17,260
$300 a month with every possibility

1091
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:18,880
of getting one's

1092
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,000
Jewish cause deep into a slush fund.

1093
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:26,200
And to this end, I attended a softball game

1094
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,880
where such cynics were assigned

1095
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,560
to the deserving and the fortunate.

1096
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:33,080
Everybody next said,

1097
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:36,000
now I'm old so-and-so running for such-and-such

1098
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,140
and anything you do for me, I'll appreciate.

1099
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:42,900
My boy's dreams fanned by this steady atmosphere

1100
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,900
in three minutes.

1101
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:46,860
I saw myself already in possession

1102
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,180
of the coveted post,

1103
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:51,580
which called for a token appearance twice a week

1104
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:54,720
to sign a few letters at the old courthouse.

1105
00:53:54,920 --> 00:53:56,240
Well, I'm there.

1106
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:58,620
Might as well put it on the sheriff's

1107
00:53:58,620 --> 00:54:01,980
for some marijuana he has confiscated.

1108
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:05,760
And he'd better play ball or I will route a sewer

1109
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:06,940
through his front yard.

1110
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:12,080
And then across the street to the courthouse cafe

1111
00:54:12,080 --> 00:54:13,880
for a coffee with a man.

1112
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:14,120
I saw myself in the same line of business

1113
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:16,580
as some other lazy, worthless bastards

1114
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,560
in the same line of business

1115
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:22,100
and we wallowing corruption like contented alligators.

1116
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,080
Remember, Reagan had to read all this.

1117
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,460
I never wanted to be a front man like Nixon,

1118
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:32,660
taking the rap, shaking hands,

1119
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:34,540
and making speeches all day.

1120
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:37,940
Whoever had the right mind would want a job like that.

1121
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,380
As commissioner of sewers,

1122
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:44,440
I would not be called upon to pet babies,

1123
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:46,720
have lunch with a queen.

1124
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:50,060
In fact, the fewer voters,

1125
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,600
the new mind gives us the better.

1126
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:56,960
Let kings and presidents keep the limelight.

1127
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:00,640
I prefer a whiff of coal gas

1128
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:03,940
as the sewers rupture for miles around.

1129
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:07,120
I have made a deal on the piping,

1130
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:10,080
which has bought me a $30,000 home.

1131
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:12,720
And there is talk in the press

1132
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:15,500
that sex cults and drug orgies

1133
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:18,240
carry down the stink of what made them possible.

1134
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:22,980
Fluttering from the roof of my ranch-style house,

1135
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:27,440
old glory floats lazily in the tainted green.

1136
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:32,520
But there were sullen mutters of revolt from the peasantry.

1137
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:35,580
My teenage daughters' deep inspiration.

1138
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:38,300
Is this the American way of life?

1139
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:41,940
I thought so, and I didn't want change.

1140
00:55:42,420 --> 00:55:44,840
Just sitting there in my garden,

1141
00:55:44,860 --> 00:55:46,860
smoking the sheriff's reefers.

1142
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:51,420
I sure did a sweet thing with those pipes,

1143
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,080
and I'm covered too.

1144
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,940
What I got on the government

1145
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:57,280
wasn't good on the front page, what is now?

1146
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:00,840
And I'll have my special police

1147
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,500
to deal with vandalism and sabotage.

1148
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:09,400
All handsome youths, languid and vicious as reptiles.

1149
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:13,720
Described in the press as no more than minions,

1150
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:17,500
lackeys and bodyguards to his majesty,

1151
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,980
the Sultan of Sewers.

1152
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:24,780
The thoughts of youth, long, long thoughts.

1153
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:28,680
Then I met the gubernatorial candidate,

1154
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,980
and he looked at me as if trying to focus my image

1155
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:34,000
through a telescope.

1156
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:38,160
And I felt the dream slipping away from me,

1157
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:40,760
receding into the past.

1158
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,260
Dim, jerky, far away,

1159
00:56:44,540 --> 00:56:48,560
the discreet gold letters on a glass door.

1160
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,420
Glass door.

1161
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,200
William S. Burroughs, Commissioner of Sanitation.

1162
00:57:02,880 --> 00:57:06,220
My Residence, it is a long time ago,

1163
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:09,800
and I have never aspired to political office since.

1164
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:13,220
The Sultan of Sewers lies buried

1165
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:17,680
in a distant 1930s softball game.

1166
00:57:19,760 --> 00:57:21,840
You know, people always say,

1167
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,100
and what they would do if they were president,

1168
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,100
well, I'll tell you,

1169
00:57:26,160 --> 00:57:28,960
you would be inexorably pressured

1170
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:31,440
by the forces and the individuals

1171
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:33,240
that put you in office.

1172
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:36,240
Get one inch out of line,

1173
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:39,040
and they would kill you like they killed Kennedy.

1174
00:57:42,420 --> 00:57:44,700
So, uh, go vote, or don't.

1175
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:45,720
I don't give a damn.

1176
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,160
You do. I know you do.

1177
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,240
I do. I do.

1178
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,080
But who am I to tell people to vote?

1179
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,120
If people don't want to vote,

1180
00:57:51,220 --> 00:57:52,560
maybe they know something I don't.

1181
00:57:52,560 --> 00:57:53,780
Of cour- yes, you know what?

1182
00:57:53,780 --> 00:57:54,480
It is naive.

1183
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:57,160
It is naive to go push buttons

1184
00:57:57,160 --> 00:57:58,620
on a die-bold computer

1185
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:01,360
and assume that Chuck Hagel,

1186
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,520
Republican Senator from Nebraska,

1187
00:58:03,920 --> 00:58:05,740
that his privately owned company

1188
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:08,460
will tally the results properly.

1189
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:09,800
Yes, okay, fine.

1190
00:58:10,060 --> 00:58:11,140
And demand a printout receipt.

1191
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,100
It's a massive leap of faith.

1192
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,440
But the more people that do vote,

1193
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,960
the harder it is to fix the election.

1194
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:22,840
The harder it makes those stupid pink boy sh-heads jobs,

1195
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:26,840
and the harder the job is of a stupid pink boy sh-head,

1196
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,420
the more likely it is he's gonna screw it up.

1197
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:30,580
Don't look behind the curtain.

1198
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:31,680
Just cast a vote.

1199
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,700
And then, uh-

1200
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:33,120
It's insane.

1201
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,660
Then I don't think we have too many elections left in us.

1202
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:36,680
Uh, oh well.

1203
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:38,340
That was Bob's Slack Time Funhouse.

1204
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:39,000
Yeah, thanks.

1205
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:40,320
Uh, do what you want to do.

1206
00:58:40,380 --> 00:58:40,920
We will too.

1207
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:41,620
Yeah. Yeah.

1208
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:42,180
Good luck.

1209
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:43,580
It's gonna suck no matter what,

1210
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:44,240
so let it rip.

1211
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,360
