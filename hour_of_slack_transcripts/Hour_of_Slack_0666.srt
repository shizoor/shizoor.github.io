1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
If you enjoy assembling your own high fidelity or stereophonic sound systems

2
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:07,780
with their complicated components and speakers on every wall,

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,060
then you will be especially interested in what I'm about to show you.

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,880
I have just developed what I consider the latest in sound reproduction.

5
00:00:17,740 --> 00:00:23,280
This is designed for those persons who desire simplicity rather than fidelity.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:28,620
As you can see, there is only one speaker, nor is that the only improvement.

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:32,160
We have also eliminated the old fashioned record changer.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,240
Now only two attachments are necessary.

9
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,800
A small crank and a hearing aid.

10
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,200
By the way, neither of those items is needed for our next number.

11
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:47,680
The subgenius, our own slash.

12
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:56,760
And he has power to give life unto the image of the beast.

13
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,600
That's the image.

14
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:58,600


15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:05,280
The image of the beast should both speak and cause that as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed.

16
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:14,700
Because of all, both small and great, rich and poor, free and enslaved,

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:22,440
to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads,

18
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,900
and that no man might buy or sell except he that had the mark.

19
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:35,100
And the name of the beast is the number of his name.

20
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:45,160
Mark, name of the beast, or the number of this show, of his name, of this.

21
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:45,960
Here is wisdom.

22
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:53,560
Let him that has understanding count the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man.

23
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,740
The number of a man.

24
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:58,600
His name.

25
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:58,600


26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:04,720
His number is 600, three score and six.

27
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,360
Thank you, Father, for the anointing of the Holy Spirit.

28
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:16,500
We bring into captivity every thought, every intent, every heart, and every mind.

29
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,860
Now we consider the eternal truth of your word.

30
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,080
Now we confront the plans of Satan.

31
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,640
That's what we need as a good.

32
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,840
We've got to get a bunch of bobbies to just off themselves.

33
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,060
Just get a bunch of bobbies, like a hundred bobbies, just get them to off themselves.

34
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,180
And then we'll have great advertising for the subgenius webpage,

35
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,060
which totally kicks ass over any kind of Heaven's Gate webpage.

36
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:45,940
And that's it.

37
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,180
You know, it'll be great.

38
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:49,740
I mean, maybe they even have this in the works or something.

39
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,180
I don't know.

40
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:50,740
But, uh,

41
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,140
Well, I kinda got a homesick feeling that I'm faking that it won't be long till I live.

42
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:04,900
You know, part of the problem is that we're in as far as Cancer is concerned, as many

43
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,100
of you who have been in emergency situations as us all know, they're getting extended service

44
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,100


45
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,100


46
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,100


47
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,100


48
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,120
The timing is going to strike a balance between what I intended.

49
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,200
Jim Bakker said

50
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,340
When you help The Shepherd, you're helping the Sheep.

51
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,800
the irreverent Friday Jones, and...

52
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,460
Where are we? Where are we?

53
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,840
I know where we are because I've been keeping count.

54
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:40,920
Have you been keeping count, sheeple children?

55
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:47,040
For this is a very propitious Hour of Slack show,

56
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:54,480
for this is Hour of Slack number 666.

57
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,080
Ah, yes.

58
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,780
The Harvest.

59
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,580
I never thought we'd make it this far, friends.

60
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,900
I thought for sure we'd be ruptured last July,

61
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,620
but now, as we enter 1999,

62
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:13,440
which is, after all, 1,666 upside down.

63
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:15,880
No. Yeah, that's right.

64
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:22,540
And did you know that 666 times 3 equals, yes, 1998?

65
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:27,520
The Antichrist was born last year inside my Macintosh.

66
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:27,620
Macintosh.

67
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,560
But I don't want to get lost in the spirit, my friends.

68
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,720
I want to tell you something that blesses my heart.

69
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,820
Can't you feel it, children?

70
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:39,560
Can't you feel that these are the last days,

71
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,160
the very end times themselves?

72
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:47,620
For are there not every day in our newspapers and Internet

73
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,880
signs and portents, my friends, signs in the heavens,

74
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,420
omens and divine hints from the before life?

75
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,500
It's just like the Roman.

76
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:57,620
It's just like the Roman.

77
00:04:57,620 --> 00:04:59,520
It's just like the Roman Empire just before the Roman Empire fell.

78
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,820
And the prophecy, the prophecy.

79
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:08,000
Let he who hath subwisdom know

80
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,780
it is the number of a man with a pipe and a grin,

81
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,780
and that number is 999.

82
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,020
Yes, for as we know, friends, within subgenius numerology,

83
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:26,380
999 is Bob's number, for Bob is the Antichrist.

84
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,280
The Antichrist.

85
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,800
Not the Christ.

86
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:33,520
He ain't that well connected, but certainly the sworn-born enemy

87
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,380
of that old fiend, old split-tongue,

88
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:38,540
the Antichrist of the conspiracy.

89
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,220
The embodiment, friends, of evil,

90
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:44,580
which will lead the pinks astray

91
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,720
under a false subgenius one-world religion

92
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,460
that will lead the sheeple into a perpetual timeless bondage

93
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,980
to their TV sets upon which,

94
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:03,160
they shall see him, the one who gives life to the image of the beast.

95
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:03,780
That's me.

96
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,880
And the image of the beast is the computer-animated 3D Bob,

97
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:12,740
which is what I've been working on in my lab all this time,

98
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,020
and Dr. Legume, too.

99
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,180
We're bringing life to the image of the beast.

100
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:18,040
Bob's not around.

101
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:21,300
Who's to say he didn't mean for us to do this?

102
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:25,940
Anyway, I say this all right out in the open, friends,

103
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:27,260
to ensure disbelief.

104
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,220
Hiding it right in front of everybody's faces.

105
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,280
That's right.

106
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,540
Luke Skywalker is going to have to whoop me

107
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,820
if he wants to shut down the Antichrist.

108
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,460
Heh.

109
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,480
Eh.

110
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,340
Actually, that would make a good movie.

111
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,740
Actually, friends, you know,

112
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:50,200
the millennium is a nice, round, even number

113
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,280
for the humans and crackpots to fixate on.

114
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,600
Everybody knows that the...

115
00:06:56,600 --> 00:06:56,860
that the...

116
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,260
that the...

117
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:57,260


118
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,440
that the...

119
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,620
have no resources.

120
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,100
Oh, yeah.

121
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:03,840
I've used, you know, on the Internet,

122
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:03,840


123
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,140
They're at birth control.

124
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,680
They're going to have to go ahead and put my hands up.

125
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:06,720
For any reason.

126
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:06,720


127
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,720
it's only, let's see,

128
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,800
half a top high on the horizon.

129
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:26,220
So that's still out in the space than it should be,

130
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:29,100
from the old four-track T-Act reel-to-reel

131
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,720
and jolted it back to shambling life

132
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:34,600
so that I might share with you listeners

133
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,080
for the first time in years

134
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,400
the old media barrage.

135
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,560
Number eight, the 666 special

136
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,640
direct from the master tape,

137
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,500
which may actually sound kind of glitchy

138
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,500
on this beat-up old machine.

139
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,020
Plus, Lordy Mercy, dear friends,

140
00:07:51,020 --> 00:07:53,880
the Fire Sign Theater

141
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:56,520
has a new album out,

142
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,000
and it's great, it's perfect,

143
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:01,360
and it's about this final day.

144
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,560
And you youngins will soon realize

145
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,840
why the Fire Sign Theater

146
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,000
was probably the biggest influence

147
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,640
on my poor teenage brain

148
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,980
in the early 1970s

149
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:12,760
and all through the 70s

150
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:16,360
besides Zap Comics and The Three Stooges.

151
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:19,060
Their new album, friends, is called

152
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:20,260
Give Me Immortality.

153
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,340
Give Me Immortality or Give Me Death.

154
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,940
And this music,

155
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:26,980
in the background,

156
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:29,100
was by

157
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,000
Ennio Morricone

158
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,300
from the Italian movie

159
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,900
L'Antichristo.

160
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,780
Yes, the music of the Antichrist.

161
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:41,220
Oh, listen, I can hear him.

162
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,060
I can hear the devil fiddling.

163
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,020
And with his big farmer boot

164
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,900
gonna come stomping down.

165
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,620
Bob's gonna come down with his big pipe,

166
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,900
and that farmer's gonna come down,

167
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,540
take his big boot,

168
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:52,980
and we're gonna stomp out the devil.

169
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,200
We're gonna root him out.

170
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,580
We're gonna root out the hate.

171
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:58,020
Yeah, yeah.

172
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,460
Half of you be the big dog with the big boy.

173
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,000
Half of you be the big dog with the big boy.

174
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:30,220
be the poor little scared dog. Are you ready? Big dogs first. Bow, wow, wow. Ooh, dog on

175
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:34,600
bow. When you live in a computer-generated world that you've created on your own, are

176
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:39,120
you not the god of that world? These are the implications of virtual reality, and they've

177
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,820
got to make us wonder how this could possibly fulfill the prophecy of the image of the beast.

178
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,440
You can see how important it is to have this video, and if you round that gift off to $100,

179
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:51,160
I'll throw in my brand-new book, In the Name of Satan.

180
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:59,380
I believe that 10% is good enough for Jesus. It ought to be enough for Uncle Sam.

181
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:06,840
He starts to roar out against you. You say, wait just a minute, Mr. Devil. I'm not fighting

182
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:12,460
this battle. You can roar all you want to toward me, but I'm going to tell Jesus on

183
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:18,420
you. Hallelujah, hallelujah. It's a safe way. He said, no lion shall be thine. He said,

184
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,460
no cat or any rabious beast.

185
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:25,600
The Cuban insurgents, the Sandinistas, and the enemies, the guerrillas in El Salvador

186
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:31,580
are our enemies, enemies of freedom, and they have one thing in mind, not El Salvador, but

187
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:35,940
eventually Florida and Texas and California and the United States and South America in

188
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,480
world conquest.

189
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:42,840
It's going to happen if we don't have a moral awakening, a spiritual revival. That's why

190
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,960
I want to put that program in prime time. I'm going to ask you to write me, make your

191
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,420
check paper, the old-time gospel writer.

192
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:48,420


193
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:48,420


194
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,980
This creature is trying to tell me something.

195
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,240
I can see it in his face.

196
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,620
Are its lips moving?

197
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:58,440
No.

198
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,200
His lips aren't moving.

199
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,660
But he's looking at me and he's saying to me,

200
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,020
don't be afraid.

201
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,400
Did you hear him tell you this?

202
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:12,260
No.

203
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,600
You felt he said it?

204
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:20,900
Uh, I know.

205
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:30,100
And, and, I, I, oh, God, give me strength.

206
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:32,020
I'll fight it off.

207
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:34,120
I'm not afraid.

208
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,360
And I run out across the road and there it is up there.

209
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,560
Oh, those eyes.

210
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:46,000
Oh, can't I please wake up?

211
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:51,600
I'm not afraid.

212
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:51,600


213
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,000
Come, my creatures.

214
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:53,940
I summon all of you to attend.

215
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,900
Be silent, all of you.

216
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:03,640
I've opened the surface of the earth.

217
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,580
It's time to attack.

218
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:07,700
Oh, no.

219
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:10,420
I've given the earthlings an ultimatum.

220
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:14,220
Either they agree to become my slaves or they'll be destroyed.

221
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,580
It would be futile to fight them.

222
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,060
With military power, it would lead to defeat.

223
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,760
The end of civilization.

224
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,720
This is why the bad movies, the low-grade science fiction films,

225
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:32,600
those directors, those are true subgeniuses.

226
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,340
More sub, perhaps, than others.

227
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:39,360
But for that very reason, they're more in touch with the, uh, the...

228
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:45,180
What we call the possible fewest.

229
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,460
There aren't that many.

230
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,420
There aren't that many possible fewest.

231
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:48,820
It's not an infinite thing.

232
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,200
There's like six or seven paths that can be taken.

233
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:54,940
And we must keep the pinks on the bob path.

234
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,500
The problem is probably, uh, the problem getting through the pinks is that

235
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:06,000
the love of bob can kill normals.

236
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,180
The love of bob has killed normals.

237
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,420
Normals who were not ready for the church have, uh, gotten into it,

238
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:15,700
misunderstanding a lot of the dogma and found themselves, uh,

239
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:17,380
uh, overcome.

240
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,080
And they, when they do that, if they're not ready,

241
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,940
they open themselves up to the dark side.

242
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:26,240
The, uh, the off powers, the powers of the demons, uh,

243
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,180
need you as a main tension.

244
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,840
I don't understand.

245
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,500
Their eyes don't have no body.

246
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,100
They're just eyes.

247
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:38,440
Oh.

248
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:42,500
Oh, that's what it's got to be.

249
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:46,040
It's a, a wild cat.

250
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,200
Of a tree.

251
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,400
Oh.

252
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,220
Oh.

253
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,460
That's what it's got to be.

254
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:53,620
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

255
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,540
Oh.

256
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,820
I know.

257
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:02,440
It's the Cheshire Cat in Alice in Wonderland.

258
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,620
It disappeared, too, and only the eyes remain.

259
00:14:08,340 --> 00:14:10,420
Keep telling yourself that, buddy.

260
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:10,920
Darth.

261
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:15,520
And once you start seeing it and looking at it and see the game they play,

262
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:24,800
it's nothing.

263
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:24,800


264
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:31,400
And they're already signed forpmeme,

265
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,040
and uh, I know this is, where the scene to sucks.

266
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,080


267
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,340


268
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:35,340


269
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:35,500


270
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:35,500


271
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,060
so that's gonna be anotherless in doors.

272
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,060


273
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:36,300
Terrace,

274
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,320
I'll tell you what you're standing on.

275
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,480
Oh, come on.

276
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,260


277
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,260


278
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,380
You could be an longevity activist.

279
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:45,280
You could be M-ывают,

280
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,180
can't stand with who?

281
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:51,600
that they injected syphilis 40 years ago into 600 black men.

282
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:57,120
And only four years ago, accidentally, we discovered it.

283
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:59,680
And y'all wondering what's happening in Atlanta because you're crazy.

284
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,340
None of you want to deal with reality because y'all are all hooked up into that other thing.

285
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,260
Well, you're fixing to lose all that mess.

286
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,840
Check them movies out.

287
00:15:10,960 --> 00:15:12,660
Check out Capricorn One.

288
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:15,040
It's about how he ain't never landed nobody on the moon.

289
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,060
He ripped that money off and didn't do nothing but put weather satellites up there.

290
00:15:18,080 --> 00:15:20,520
That's why you got a drought going all the way across this country.

291
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:23,580
And come this summer, the whole damn country can burn to the ground.

292
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:26,220
They have made it that dry.

293
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:32,620
And right now, as we sit here, there are forest fires that is raging across this country

294
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:34,980
to the likes that we ain't never had them before.

295
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,300
I don't know, the whole world gone crazy.

296
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,400
Hi, baby cake.

297
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,800
Hi.

298
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,920
It's a toothbrush.

299
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,640
And it's loaded with toothpaste.

300
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,820
Be filled with their own devices.

301
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,700
For the turning away of the simple shall slay them.

302
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,380
And the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

303
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,160
But who?

304
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,060
There's no body there.

305
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,360
There's no corpse there.

306
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,820
The angel shouted it.

307
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:03,500
He's not here, but he is risen.

308
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,440
I said, now, I want to continue to receive offerings and all that.

309
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,860
I said, I'm just not going to give you any report of it.

310
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,120
You'll never know till you get to heaven where I went over the budget and all that.

311
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,020
And I said, even when you get to heaven, you're not going to get any report of it.

312
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,020


313
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:15,020


314
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,540
And I said, even when you get to heaven, God will have to tell you, because I'm not knowing.

315
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:21,680
We're not against it.

316
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:29,840
The true education facilities is in the top of your head.

317
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:31,500
Not in no college university.

318
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,060
Controlled by the same force that controls the university.

319
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:42,700
And that true education facility in the top of your head will never open up until it's around an oasis of love.

320
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,700
Most of these colleges and universities, numbers say,

321
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,360
says, who's a patriot?

322
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,120
That whole game.

323
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,740
That whole game, somewhere.

324
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:56,800
And once you start seeing it and looking at it and see the game they play.

325
00:16:57,720 --> 00:17:01,280
And Matt, can you imagine George Washington and Jane Fonda?

326
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:03,760
Mmm.

327
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,820
The ultimate incompatibility.

328
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:10,440
The strongest male of the pack.

329
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,100
Just like the damn apes, you know.

330
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:14,240
The biggest, meanest male of the pack.

331
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:17,160
And, you know, that's the...

332
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:27,120
And we run kind of a limited merchant trade situation, barter system.

333
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,480
A collective bartering system.

334
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,740
Like a barter pool situation in a small township between certain patriarchs of that area.

335
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,040
Very much like the feudal system, you know.

336
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:41,320
Back to the dark ages again.

337
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:42,600
That's what I want.

338
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,000
I don't want one world government.

339
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:44,680
I want a regime.

340
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:45,940
I want a return to the dark ages.

341
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,840
That's what I want.

342
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,640
Philo speaks.

343
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,320
We're the big guy one.

344
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:56,200
You know, what's the ideal situation?

345
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,720
The ideal situation is that you're like an enlightened despot.

346
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:04,520
Although you're a patriarch, you're enlightened to the point that you provide for your children.

347
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:05,880
They love you.

348
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,200
You know.

349
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,360
You take good care of your children.

350
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,900
You lead your flock like a good shepherd.

351
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:14,480
But...

352
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,280
Right?

353
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,480
Like a good antichrist.

354
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,960
Ah, yes, fine.

355
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:26,680
And you're Phyllox production, and, and, uh, see, you know, that's where Polygamous

356
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:27,720
Kingdom comes in.

357
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:28,800
Polygamous?

358
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,940
That's where Polygamous Kingdom comes in.

359
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,300
Praise the Polygamous Kingdom.

360
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:35,000
Yeah, all the lives we can to pump out all the kids we can so that our clan can get bigger

361
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,820
than the next clan, and we can be a more powerful clan, you know?

362
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,640
Yeah, yeah.

363
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:44,080
And beat the hell out of the damn, you know, the Jablonskis down the street.

364
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,080
Yeah, the Jablonskis.

365
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,020
Let's get out of here.

366
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,920
To give, to receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, God is truly just.

367
00:18:53,340 --> 00:19:01,400
There's coming a day, listen, there's coming a day when a God of justice will judge all

368
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:01,680
men.

369
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,220
We have Ivan the what?

370
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,340
Ivan the Targeter.

371
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:10,740
Ivan has some, today, some 7,000 nuclear weapons on missiles and bombers in the Soviet Union

372
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,360
that he has to pick out targets for in the United States.

373
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,420
Ivan the Targeter will probably lay...

374
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:18,640
Damn near anything he can get his claws on.

375
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:18,960
Phew!

376
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:28,740
But don't you see, you'd be doing exactly what you say you're fighting, killing, using

377
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,520
force because you're certain you're right.

378
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,580
But it wouldn't be the same thing because we'd be advocating nothing, forcing nothing.

379
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:39,500
Now, there are many strong men in the world today fighting for tolerance, compassion,

380
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,280
wisdom.

381
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:43,360
For your right to be different, to be wrong even.

382
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,060
They wouldn't be touched.

383
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,300
Only the dogma hurts.

384
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,760
The infallible.

385
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,880
Trying to play God.

386
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,560
You just can't do that.

387
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,480
Why not?

388
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,360
If God's too busy.

389
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,980
Who's to say that it's not his will, that we're not his agents?

390
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:10,180
Every man shall bend his knee and bow his head and call Jesus Lord to the glory of God, the

391
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,460
Father.

392
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:15,940
On past that, justice and judgment.

393
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,700
Jesus said, you're here to prevent the putrefaction.

394
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:27,380
But this putrid world only tells that we're not doing our job.

395
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:29,320
As we should.

396
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,360
God help us.

397
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,680
Wake up.

398
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,320
Wake up.

399
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,200
Wake up.

400
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:50,200


401
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,900
They've come to steal my dreams.

402
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,660
Wake up.

403
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:54,460
Knock the door down.

404
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,240
No, go away.

405
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,700
Go away.

406
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,880
Go away.

407
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:58,780
No.

408
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,240
Ah, get up lady.

409
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,340
It's the trade of the century.

410
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,080
Rise now.

411
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:09,480
And turn over your old mattress to me, Lord Eddie.

412
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,260
Who is this?

413
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,480
Lord, I can't.

414
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,600
Monsters?

415
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,640
There's money in that mattress.

416
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:16,380
That's right.

417
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,980
There's monster money in every sweaty mattress

418
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,500
when you trade in your used dreams at Unconscious Village.

419
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:26,820
But those dreams have been with me since the beginning.

420
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:30,940
Don't be stuck with leftover dreams in the terrible days to come.

421
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,040
Open mattress.

422
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,740
Oh, look.

423
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:36,740
A pig.

424
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,520
It looks like a locomotive.

425
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,840
I'm a bullhead.

426
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:45,500
Three hundred million swaps in his yo-yo.

427
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,280
Three monkeys.

428
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,240
It's the most in-for-mice.

429
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,920
And loud, don't whine.

430
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,920
A noble woman condemned to most of this earth.

431
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,320
Why, that's... that's me.

432
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:02,680
Yes, that's yesterday's you being reborn today on tomorrow's mattress.

433
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,900
A Golden City Yeti Dad Double Duck Infit

434
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,880
inside us from Naughty Nights Newsmakers.

435
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,700
We're from...

436
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,080
Unconscious Village!

437
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:14,340
I am asleep!

438
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:17,680
Radio Now.

439
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,420
Oh, no, it's not now.

440
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:21,500
It sucks, okay?

441
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,320
All right, too fast the hour.

442
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,620
And those hours are passing quickly.

443
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,800
And I am in your ears.

444
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,700
You're in my mix.

445
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,880
I have left my body.

446
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:28,880
I'm in your head.

447
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,500
I am Bebop Loco.

448
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,720
Yeah, that's me, baby.

449
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,500
The suspect.

450
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,400
The outsider.

451
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,220
Not looking for the hoochie-cootie song.

452
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,660
Weirdly cool.

453
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,260
Perfect.

454
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:39,860
The

455
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,100
And that's who we are.

456
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,400
No, no, not anymore.

457
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,220
Bebop, there's been a format change.

458
00:22:47,560 --> 00:22:50,560
Mr. Producer, do we have a new focus group?

459
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,840
Yeah, they focus us up real good this time.

460
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:53,880
Well, what are we now?

461
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:55,140
Uh, coming at you, Bob-Man.

462
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,440
Extreme.

463
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:57,940
No sense of humor.

464
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:58,700
Aggressive.

465
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,980
In your face.

466
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:00,660
Now.

467
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:01,200
Radio.

468
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,240
Man, all right, all right.

469
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,520
It's three past the last on this day of all days.

470
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,500
And me and the Now crew counting down with you till the end of the day.

471
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:08,500


472
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:08,500


473
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:08,500


474
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:08,500


475
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,000
End of time.

476
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,780
I got Danny Vanilla on the street.

477
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:13,520
I'm right here dogging the dirt till the end of the world.

478
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:15,060
I got Chump Threads in the booth.

479
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:17,920
I got sports and new shorts coming at the sevens, Bebop.

480
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,600
All right, but every crew needs a captain.

481
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,800
Let's go to our dizzy devil over Fun Fun Town.

482
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:24,660
Captain Heffy painted in the Now Chopper.

483
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:25,920
Copy that, Bebop.

484
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,060
And hello, folks.

485
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:30,760
If you aren't swilling office coffee in the cube farm by now, you're probably one of the

486
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,120
gas govers I'm looking down at here on the 666.

487
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,620
From Oil Heights to the Santa Baby off ramp, it's a mess.

488
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:38,340
All lanes crawling.

489
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:38,480
I'm looking down at the Santa Baby off ramp.

490
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:38,480


491
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:38,480


492
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:38,480


493
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,420
I'm looking slow and go behind two sacred cows pulling the Ark of the Covenant in the

494
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,160
show off lane.

495
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:43,500
I need to back up.

496
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,020
You hear a person sitting around.

497
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:45,360
Roger.

498
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,440
Just a hearing now.

499
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:52,020
The Edom Intern is still being blocked by hostile natives in robes diverting uncircumcised

500
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,440
motorists onto the Goyim Cut-Off.

501
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,220
So if you're not a helmet head, I would stay away from there.

502
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:57,820
Looks like locusts down there.

503
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:00,080
Hey, those are locusts we hear, Captain Heffy.

504
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,700
Aren't those fumigants on their way to the Zillion Bug March?

505
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,360
Nuggets are.

506
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:03,840
Bebop.

507
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:04,660
Okay.

508
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:05,740
All right.

509
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,160
Yeah, sorry.

510
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:06,280
Sorry.

511
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:09,080
The chopper cops are backing me off to 1500 ticks.

512
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:15,100
So this is Captain Heffy recycling off in the environmentally souped up News Now chopper.

513
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:15,580
Get out of there.

514
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,660
Me vida loca.

515
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:18,660
It's an unholy mess out there.

516
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:24,500
Oh, we got another take from one of our rolling eyeballs on the ground, Mrs. Caroline P. on

517
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:25,460
the car phone, baby.

518
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:26,420
Hello.

519
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,700
My car just stopped in the middle of the freeway.

520
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:30,380
Is it the bugs?

521
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,380
Oh, it's the motherboard under my hood.

522
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,840
It's going zeroes.

523
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,240
Why?

524
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:35,720
Y2K.

525
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:36,140
Why?

526
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,140


527
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,140


528
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,140


529
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,480
It's the millennium, stupid.

530
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,480
Well, I know that.

531
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,900
I can't move it.

532
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,080
Calm down, Mrs. P.

533
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,300
Get away from my car.

534
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:43,620
How bad can it be?

535
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,540
Get away from my car.

536
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:46,700
All right.

537
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:49,720
Things are beginning to unravel out there.

538
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,180
Hey, we're at four.

539
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:54,540
Get ready for more on Radio Now.

540
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,280
Well, if it's not happening now, who cares?

541
00:24:59,060 --> 00:25:02,040
Because of us, it's morning in America.

542
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,040
Breakfast, honey?

543
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:03,700
Thanks.

544
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,140
Hey, is this real corn?

545
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,140


546
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,140


547
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,140


548
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,140


549
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,140


550
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,140


551
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,140


552
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,140


553
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,140


554
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,140


555
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:06,360
Is this pork?

556
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:10,740
Because of us, people in the Great Plains are just plain doing things.

557
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:13,760
Little things, like taking money from machines.

558
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,540
Hey, hey, stop, kid.

559
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,660
I'm not a machine.

560
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:22,300
Because of us, they're roasting East Coast marshmallows on the West Coast.

561
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,000
Wow.

562
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,300
These taste like pork.

563
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,920
We're the people of US+.

564
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,700
Guess what we do?

565
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,260
Chemistry?

566
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,000
Transportation?

567
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,000
Pork?

568
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,520
Kind of.

569
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:33,880
US+.

570
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:35,760
We own the idea.

571
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:36,120
We're the people of US+.

572
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,120


573
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,120


574
00:25:36,120 --> 00:25:36,120


575
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,760
We're the people of America.

576
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,440
It's five past the last.

577
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,960
Time to give you the business.

578
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,860
And the only business we care about here is show business.

579
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:48,360
We got Radio Now celebrity stalker Danny Vanilla.

580
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:49,380
He's really out there.

581
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,240
Danny, what's the gossip, man?

582
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,280
What's the dish?

583
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,320
I got the dish.

584
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,980
I live for dish.

585
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,680
I live for her dish.

586
00:25:55,860 --> 00:26:00,780
And I've been up all night here at the unbelievable, fun-believable Hotel Millennium.

587
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:04,100
Bebop, here's my very, very now dish.

588
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:04,540
All right.

589
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:05,980
Princess goddess.

590
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,500
Just as virtually gorgeous in full digital.

591
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:10,860
She wasn't a fab flesh.

592
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,100
Wow.

593
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:17,740
She couldn't get to the Ebola virus ball here at the hotel last night because she was

594
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:21,500
reading fairy tales by satellite to young plank victims.

595
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,460
Wow.

596
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:26,180
Well, man, she may be dead, but she's obviously a very caring person.

597
00:26:26,280 --> 00:26:26,720
She's...

598
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,100
Okay.

599
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:28,520
Well...

600
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:29,360
Let's get back to Ebola.

601
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,740
You got your yellow ribbon on, right?

602
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,860
Well, frankly, I'm not wearing mine, Danny.

603
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:34,840
You know, it could be infected.

604
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,040
Oh, come on, people.

605
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,720
You gotta wear your princess plague ribbons.

606
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:42,380
The money goes right to keep the deadly organisms from getting across our designer borders.

607
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:43,000
Come on.

608
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,120
I can't even get across our designer borders, man.

609
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:47,900
Danny?

610
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,140
Is he okay?

611
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:50,880
It's not...

612
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,240
It's not...

613
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,120
It's not...

614
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:53,300
It's not...

615
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,160
Now they're all in there after the post.

616
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:57,980
Oh, belly up and put them down.

617
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,400
I'm Chump Threat.

618
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,560
And I'm coming up at you with sports in your shorts.

619
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,820
Lately, I've been getting more and more people to come and get me.

620
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:04,820


621
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:04,820


622
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:04,820


623
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:04,820


624
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:04,820


625
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:04,820


626
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:09,540
I'm getting weep-eyed wooscrams and punk-ass calls from fans who are bummed by the blood

627
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,140
on the ice.

628
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:15,480
They say they're way gross by the broken bones on the boards and the poor babies are bopping

629
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,400
over the twisted bodies in the bowls.

630
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,200
Hey, you don't want to see it?

631
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:20,880
Get yourself blinded.

632
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:21,980
You're the man, Chump.

633
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,280
Yeah, I am the man.

634
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,480
And here's my pick of the day.

635
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:25,740
Don't bet the pros.

636
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,340
They're cons.

637
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,720
And the colleges, they're goons on the tape.

638
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,080
Put your money on junior high soccer.

639
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,400
You're the man, Chump.

640
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,800
The George X Middle School fruit bats are holding you back.

641
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:34,800


642
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:34,800


643
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:34,800


644
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:35,800
They're going home to the St. Stools Sandabs.

645
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,340
The bats are totally pumped.

646
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,220
They're going to punk them and pork them.

647
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,920
The Sandabs are bacon.

648
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:44,640
The fruit boys are going to have their Elvis day.

649
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,420
The bats by 30 goals.

650
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,580
I'm Chump Threat.

651
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,540
And I'm out.

652
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:50,400
The Chump has left the building.

653
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,180
Radio Now.

654
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:56,820
And if it's not happening now, when did it happen?

655
00:27:57,020 --> 00:28:00,480
Give me immortality or give me death.

656
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,780
That's the motto here at Ralph's Ball Sports New and Used Body Shop in the St. St. St.

657
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


658
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


659
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


660
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


661
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


662
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


663
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


664
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


665
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


666
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


667
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


668
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


669
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


670
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


671
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


672
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


673
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:04,780


674
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,260
St. City of the Future.

675
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:06,940
Hi, friends.

676
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,000
Ralph's Ball Sports here to tell you that everybody must die, but you don't have to

677
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,480
be there when it happens.

678
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:15,400
That's why we're having a great going on a body sale.

679
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,900
Yes, you can live forever while your friends fall apart around you like rotten fruit.

680
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:20,940
And here's how.

681
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,340
Lease an organ or limb from our headless body farm.

682
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:26,700
It's made in America from Americans.

683
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,640
Enter the new century with these exclusive clone-ons.

684
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:34,120
Nat Velour designer jeans, deluxe follicle hair mat grafting with upgraded media sensitive

685
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,780
stimulated wrapper filler, rear rolled non-glossy carbon-intensified glue guards, power moons,

686
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:42,580
and tinted tent Ralph's Follies in slash dash or faux flannel.

687
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:47,820
So come on down to Ralph's Ball Sports City of the Future and do it today because there

688
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,340
may not be a tomorrow.

689
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:51,020
Now, Ralph is always with us.

690
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,120
The fruit is around us.

691
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:58,020
Open, aggressive homosexuals.

692
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,240
No more a sense of shame.

693
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,100
But really a demand for a change.

694
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,640
A demand for recognition as a form of life.

695
00:29:07,820 --> 00:29:17,700
And God's judgment is going to come and fall again upon a godless, Christ-rejecting, blasphemous

696
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:18,220
society.

697
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,460
Well, if this sounds paranoid, you're right.

698
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:26,320
But I think I have good reason to be paranoid.

699
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:32,160
It's a strange world out there.

700
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,160


701
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,600
I think I've been there.

702
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:35,180
I'm going to say that again.

703
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:35,200
You didn't go.

704
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:35,200


705
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:38,000
Well, that was some real Uber driving there, Dr. Drummond.

706
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:39,960
I almost thought we were going to get killed.

707
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:42,100
That made me disconnect my mind.

708
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,460
I gained a glimpse of true slack for a minute there.

709
00:29:46,140 --> 00:29:49,960
And you know, as fate smokes apart, we live the life.

710
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,320
Ah, yes.

711
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:52,480
We're done.

712
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:53,180
We're done.

713
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:56,960
We're done.

714
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,260
We're done.

715
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,880
...on the nines with my man Ray the Hamburger.

716
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,840
Thank you, Bob.

717
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:11,920
This is your Radio Now on the Spot,

718
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,020
actually now News Team.

719
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,280
I'm Ray Hamburger.

720
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,180
And I'm Harold Hiphugger.

721
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:20,020
Hey, hey, hey, wait, wait a minute.

722
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,000
Since when did you two guys become a team?

723
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,140
Hey, wait a minute in there.

724
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,860
Harold, you're supposed to be out in the now mobile van

725
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:26,980
making news happen.

726
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,900
Yes, well, someone forgot to gas up the now mobile van.

727
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,660
Dios mio, it was me.

728
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:32,460
But it was an emergency.

729
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:35,140
I had to take Mrs. Bebop to the birthing class.

730
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,680
By the time she got open, man, everything was closed.

731
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,160
We'll have a story on that coming up.

732
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,060
Very exciting.

733
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,560
I don't think so.

734
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,600
Okay, make it up, boys.

735
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:43,060
Make it happen.

736
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:45,680
Well, we could do that Camel on the Lamb story again

737
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,180
if you got the copy there.

738
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,540
Oh, yes, it's here in the wake.

739
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,220
Is that mine?

740
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,660
Camel on the Lamb.

741
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,940
Disgraced icon Joe Camel

742
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,960
had to climb down...

743
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,660
from his last billboard this morning

744
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:01,740
before a jeering mob of addicts and ex-children.

745
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,500
It's about time, Ray,

746
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,700
but instead of handing over his pool cue,

747
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,780
dog glasses, and smoking boots to the jackbots,

748
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:08,180
he...

749
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,060
Smoking butt.

750
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:10,100
My smoking butt.

751
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,740
That should be smoking butt.

752
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,600
Let's just go to that tape one more time.

753
00:31:16,300 --> 00:31:17,640
One at a time.

754
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:18,720
One at a time.

755
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,540
I'm not the president.

756
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,700
Here's the story.

757
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,820
They took my smokes.

758
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,500
They snatched my axe.

759
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,380
I could see the handwriting on the wall.

760
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,660
Yeah, where'd you learn to move?

761
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,740
I learned a glyphic script.

762
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:28,720
Very funny.

763
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:29,360
Very funny.

764
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,220
Yes, sir.

765
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,860
Joe, I had it to gun through your head yet

766
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:33,120
that you're just a drawing,

767
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,080
a drawing of a camel,

768
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,140
a cartoon.

769
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,620
I do know I'm not a camel, Hal.

770
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,440
I know that much.

771
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,640
I am a logo.

772
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,440
Get that straight.

773
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:43,200
Joe, they say your stomachs are gone, Joe.

774
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:45,100
I got two stomachs left, Wiley.

775
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:45,540
Who cares?

776
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,100
Joe, Joe,

777
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,700
box into Babelizer here.

778
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,180
Yes, ma'am.

779
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:49,640
Any plans for the future?

780
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,780
Yeah, party.

781
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:52,920
What's the problem?

782
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:53,900
What's the problem?

783
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:55,100
The problem is

784
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,700
they crossed the line.

785
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,120
They wanted to take my shades.

786
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,760
That's the way you have to, Joe.

787
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:00,560
Where are you going?

788
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,700
I'm going where everyone else is going.

789
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,260
It's the millennium, stupid.

790
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,620
I'm going to the big one.

791
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,080
Let them try and keep me out.

792
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:07,340
Yeah.

793
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:14,060
And so Joe vaulted through his signature smoke ring.

794
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,800
And the defeated dromedary

795
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,700
peeled off behind the wheel

796
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:19,360
of his horse-heavy muscle car.

797
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,380
A beautiful machine.

798
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:23,080
It certainly is to the big to-do.

799
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:23,680
The big party.

800
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:24,860
That's tonight.

801
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:25,880
Couldn't keep me away

802
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,140
if it was the end of the world.

803
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,100
Well, I think it is.

804
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,780
See you there.

805
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:30,740
Here on souped-up,

806
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,700
suggestive, desensitized,

807
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,180
bite-me,

808
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,160
environmental now radio.

809
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:37,520
Fly the goddess.

810
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,920
Multi-sex plugs for your laptops,

811
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:41,740
international mini-meals,

812
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,560
unlimited plague-free air,

813
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,180
no bloody babies,

814
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,580
and extra knee room

815
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,780
for your extra knee.

816
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,560
Isn't that where you want to be

817
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,020
at midnight

818
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:51,460
when the big eyeball drops

819
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:52,800
on those sub-millionaires

820
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,840
30,000 feet beneath you?

821
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,940
Goddess air.

822
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,360
She'll get you there.

823
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,320
Hello?

824
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:00,980
Don't worry.

825
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:04,520
Number six in a series of good nature programs

826
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,780
designed to address your profoundly

827
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:07,760
unreasonable fears

828
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:09,480
and mindless superstitions.

829
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:09,940
Yes.

830
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:12,360
And today we shred another paper tiger

831
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:15,000
as we confront the millennium,

832
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,480
a.k.a. the end of the world.

833
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,660
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

834
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,980
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

835
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:24,820
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

836
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:25,000
Ha, ha.

837
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:25,580
All right.

838
00:33:28,220 --> 00:33:30,880
And that's our program for today.

839
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,280
Of course it is.

840
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:39,040
All right, you live,

841
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:40,140
you learn, I guess.

842
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:42,720
I guess that's what de-sensithiz climate radio

843
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,380
sounds like, I guess.

844
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,440
It's certainly weirdly cool.

845
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,620
Ha, ha, hey, Mr. Producer Man, you there?

846
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,500
You're Bob Stitt.

847
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,460
I got an idea.

848
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:51,520
You got another one of those

849
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,540
that's long enough for me to take a whiz behind?

850
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,700
Bob, if you're short,

851
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,420
enough. You're long enough. I'm out the door. Shake it.

852
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,380
Fly the

853
00:33:58,380 --> 00:34:00,220
Goddess Air Plush Bus

854
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:02,220
and leave the luxury to us.

855
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,680
It's the end of the world in air travel.

856
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,640
From the dizzying disorientation

857
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,520
of its gyro seats to the old world

858
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,260
fermentation cushions and drop-down

859
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,280
ale masks, you may not know

860
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:14,400
where you are, but you'll never forget

861
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,700
how you got there.

862
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:18,100
Goddess Air. Let her take you

863
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,380
for all your worth.

864
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,500
Hello, don't worry.

865
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,360
Number two in a series of jolly

866
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:26,360
good programs designed to confront

867
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:28,480
your shallow, infantile phobia.

868
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:30,360
Yes, and today we

869
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:32,440
pop yet another paranoid piñata

870
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,260
as we take a good, hard

871
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:36,180
full Monty at your fears

872
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,860
of eyeball hats.

873
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,420
It's a silly, semi-sentient fixation

874
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,240
that quite ignores the clear

875
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:44,300
and unpleasant danger of the mumbling

876
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:46,240
millennial morons beneath the hat.

877
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:48,500
But it's the I and the ball.

878
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:49,480
You see, the one.

879
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:52,140
The one and the Z. It's the null.

880
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,540
El Cipher.

881
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,940
And that's our program for today.

882
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:57,820
It's the code.

883
00:34:57,920 --> 00:35:00,920
The virus is eating us.

884
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:04,120
Hey, Bebop, man, where are you?

885
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:04,960
You're on the...

886
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,260
Yes, friends,

887
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,180
we're still here and

888
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,900
I just, uh,

889
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,980
well, I hate to interrupt that

890
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,360
Firesign Theater new album.

891
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:18,600
Give me

892
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,340
immortality or give me

893
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:22,200
death. I think it's just...

894
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:24,340
I'm hearing it for most of the time.

895
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,060
I'm hearing it for most of this for the first time with you

896
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:27,320
tonight, but

897
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,960
um, you know,

898
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,040
it is a commercial out-of-CD

899
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,860
that's available in stores.

900
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:36,380
And I'll probably

901
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:38,420
play the entirety of the whole thing

902
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,060
on the Hour of Slack, but friends,

903
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,320
Reverend Nikki Deathchick just walked

904
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,160
in with a package

905
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,780
from Reverend Chaz

906
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,960
Smith of Einstein

907
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:50,160
Secret Orchestra holding four

908
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:51,980
tapes, including an

909
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,600
edited volume 11

910
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,340
of the book, and I'm going to read it to you.

911
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,340


912
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,340


913
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,340


914
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,340


915
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,340


916
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,340


917
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,300
Live radio shows

918
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,820
from the last couple of months

919
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,620
and our New Year's

920
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:02,380
show, and I guess

921
00:36:02,380 --> 00:36:03,760
that since we're talking about

922
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:06,580
centuries and millennia

923
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:08,520
and next days and end of the world,

924
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,460
it probably makes some sense

925
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,180
to whip it out

926
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,580
and share with you this...

927
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,820
We were...

928
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:17,720
We called in

929
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,460
to the show from

930
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,140
Dobstown 4 in Austin

931
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,220
where the subgenius

932
00:36:24,220 --> 00:36:25,620
hierarchy had gathered

933
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:27,820
to confab

934
00:36:27,820 --> 00:36:29,380
converse and otherwise

935
00:36:29,380 --> 00:36:31,100
hobnob and...

936
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,580
Anyway,

937
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,620
we did call in

938
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,920
and we'll listen

939
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,360
to this wonderful Einstein

940
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,580
Secret Orchestra in the background

941
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:43,760
for just a minute, and then we'll go back

942
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:44,980
to the talk.

943
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,420
This is Chaz's new space

944
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:48,020
theme.

945
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,100
...

946
00:36:50,140 --> 00:36:51,020
...

947
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,100
...

948
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:00,640
...

949
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:00,960
...

950
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,260
...

951
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:08,080
...

952
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:08,080


953
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,240
...

954
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,620
...

955
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:11,760
...

956
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:12,040
...

957
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,040


958
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,300
...

959
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:17,780
Now she's got something on the net called teen sex.

960
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,160
Will you just stop right now?

961
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:21,940
I just typed in Bill Clinton.

962
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,200
Oh, she typed in Bill Clinton?

963
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:26,180
Bill Clinton.com and it came up on a site

964
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,260
called teen sex with a big X behind the sex.

965
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,500
Oh, yep.

966
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,340
The X's are putting their...

967
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,960
their two cents worth everywhere.

968
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,180
Are all the porn sites run by the X's?

969
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:40,280
No, actually, I doubt seriously

970
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:42,320
if God like aliens from outer space

971
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,800
or ne...

972
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,960
Although, why not?

973
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,840
You know, there's money in that, I understand.

974
00:37:46,300 --> 00:37:46,620
Yeah.

975
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,220
Oh, there we go.

976
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,980
Yeah, that's interesting.

977
00:37:50,860 --> 00:37:53,000
Well, then, are we on the air?

978
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,080
Yeah, we actually are.

979
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:54,520
Now, what...

980
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:55,700
Well, Chaz, why...

981
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,720
Aren't you supposed to be playing like, you know,

982
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,360
popping balloons or getting drunk or something like that?

983
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,240
No, those are all the other radio stations.

984
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:03,340
We're doing a...

985
00:38:03,340 --> 00:38:05,760
We're doing the show for the people who are sitting home alone

986
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,980
tripping their brains out or...

987
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:10,240
or smoking their four-foot bong

988
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,980
or drinking that bottle of wine with the candles lit.

989
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,060
That's who we're doing the show for tonight.

990
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,380
Well...

991
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,380
All them poor, lonely souls.

992
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:19,940
The...

993
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,660
The...

994
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:21,220
The...

995
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:22,880
Those happy, lonely souls.

996
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,560
The club members...

997
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,100
The club members...

998
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:24,660
They're not alone with Bob.

999
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:28,220
Every one of them is a card-carrying member of Sex Without Partners.

1000
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,080
And that's cool.

1001
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,180
Hey, man.

1002
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:36,840
If Bill Clinton would've been a member of Sex Without Partners, he wouldn't be

1003
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,500
impeached.

1004
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:39,800
But...

1005
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:40,900
Well...

1006
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:41,280
Oh, wow.

1007
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,400
But, yeah, by the same token, if...

1008
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:44,000
if...

1009
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:47,240
if all of those people who think it's the government's business to...

1010
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:50,160
to poke into somebody's private pants...

1011
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:50,640
That's right.

1012
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:50,940
I don't know.

1013
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,820
I don't like the government looking down my pants.

1014
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,640
Oh, well, yeah.

1015
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:54,060
Would you stand up and say to the people who are sitting in the back...

1016
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,060


1017
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:54,060


1018
00:38:54,060 --> 00:38:55,940
You particularly, Mr. and Mrs. America.

1019
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,760
I'm not the president.

1020
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,960
Answer this question.

1021
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:01,640
Did you lie about cheating on your spouse?

1022
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,480
You don't.

1023
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,540
We'll know if you tell the truth, you're going to lose your job.

1024
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:11,100
And if you lie, you're going to lose your job.

1025
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,820
Now feel free to answer yes or no.

1026
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,120
And probably go to jail too.

1027
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,840
Did you lie about cheating?

1028
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:23,800
Did you lie about all the times that you stole from all those people?

1029
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:26,360
Did you chop down that cherry tree?

1030
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,820
Well, it depends on how you define the word.

1031
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,180
I cannot tell a lie.

1032
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,360
I did not have sex with that woman.

1033
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,620
Well, I am your Uncle Sam, son.

1034
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,020
And you have to tell me.

1035
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:43,140
And your big brother here.

1036
00:39:43,420 --> 00:39:44,700
Big brother Bob.

1037
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:51,000
Well, I mean, it's obvious because Clinton was a fan of JFK, not George Washington.

1038
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,980
So George Washington.

1039
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:57,000
George Washington was the one who said, you know, I cannot tell a lie.

1040
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,940
Well, that's the mythology behind it.

1041
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,680
But, you know, and the whole cherry tree thing.

1042
00:40:01,740 --> 00:40:04,160
But JFK, I mean, that was Bill's hair.

1043
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:09,680
Well, of course that cherry tree story is true because, you know, the history, the American history books cannot tell a lie.

1044
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,700
No, not at all.

1045
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,760
They do not lie.

1046
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,900
What did Bob tell you, Dr. Herman?

1047
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,020
He told me.

1048
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,240
He told me to pick up your butt.

1049
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,680
Get going.

1050
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:24,300
Yeah.

1051
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,860
Because I know you're dragging ass.

1052
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:30,620
I know you get tired and low at times, but you got to just get yourself in the butt.

1053
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,580
And get back up there, boy.

1054
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,940
And keep on going.

1055
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:36,060
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1056
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:49,640
Here is wisdom.

1057
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:54,040
Let him that hath understanding count the number of the beat.

1058
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:57,320
For it is the number of a man.

1059
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,500
The number of a man.

1060
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:08,540
His number is six hundred three score and six.

1061
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:12,240
Thank you, Father, for the anointing of the Holy Spirit.

1062
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:22,840
Jehovah One is a space deity from the corporate sin galaxy, which exists somewhere in the distant corners of the universe as we know it.

1063
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,860
The earth is his test tube.

1064
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:41,260
The materialization of an experiment that Jehovah One started roughly seven million years ago as the result of a bar bet.

1065
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:44,400
In his presence now kneel and make thy covenant.

1066
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:49,000
In this new life nothing shall come between us.

1067
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,520
To thee will I cling, though all the powers of heaven shall rage about me.

1068
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,360
Thou art my God.

1069
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:54,040
And I am your God.

1070
00:41:54,040 --> 00:42:01,300
God to use you individually and collectively to begin to address and deal with those problems.

1071
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,080
This is the way they did it in the New Testament.

1072
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:05,600
God scolded his people in the old testament.

1073
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:06,960
The greatest people on earth.

1074
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:12,120
And you walk in with the Judas tribe and the wife of Judas might be one of the ladies I've laid to make a socialist.

1075
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:19,660
This is Jim Jones.

1076
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,460
She might give you slow poison in your champagne.

1077
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,200
You don't know how clever I am.

1078
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:29,020
One thing you've all done to underestimate me.

1079
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:33,240
I made plans for treason long ago because I knew I couldn't trust nothing.

1080
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:36,720
I knew I couldn't trust anything but communism and the principle in me.

1081
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:42,480
Yes, I knew that that's what I had to depend upon, not depend upon the arm of the flesh and never put all your eggs in one basket.

1082
00:42:42,580 --> 00:42:44,420
So honey, I put my eggs in many places.

1083
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,680
You figure that out if you want to.

1084
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:52,540
Some of you are too naive.

1085
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,440
You don't know what I'm, what I'm talking about.

1086
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,440


1087
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,440


1088
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,440


1089
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,440


1090
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,440


1091
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:53,440


1092
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,320
You don't know what Jim Jones is all about.

1093
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,200
You can't even follow him.

1094
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,680
You haven't even, you haven't even smelled where he's at yet.

1095
00:42:57,940 --> 00:42:59,000
Much less followed him.

1096
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:03,760
You don't even know who he is and you might miss him if you didn't have a real good look at him.

1097
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:05,060
You wouldn't even know who he looked like.

1098
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,980
You really haven't got an x-ray.

1099
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,660
But I've got all kinds of things in store.

1100
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:13,940
It be cleansed.

1101
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:17,480
It be cleansed.

1102
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:17,800
It be cleansed.

1103
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,020
It be cleansed.

1104
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:19,180
It be cleansed.

1105
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:23,380
You, you who are stupid piss ants and reptiles and lower than the price.

1106
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:25,500
You could make a hoopie if you want.

1107
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,860
But your hoopie makes me sicky.

1108
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,760
So you can make your hoopie while I do something far more sicky.

1109
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:34,240
I got me some big plans.

1110
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:37,520
Both here, there and everywhere.

1111
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:39,240
Both here, there and everywhere.

1112
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:40,340
Got lots of plans.

1113
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:41,180


1114
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:44,780
Planning to be missionaries.

1115
00:43:44,820 --> 00:43:46,060
Training to be missionaries.

1116
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,360
He would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.

1117
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:50,740
He would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit of the old ultra-violence.

1118
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:52,460
The enemy is at the gate.

1119
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:52,860
The enemy is at the gate.

1120
00:43:53,380 --> 00:43:55,300
And the enemy is the human mind itself,

1121
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:56,840
or lack of it,

1122
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:57,960
on this planet.

1123
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:00,340
Hey, Bebop, man, where are you?

1124
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,280
You're on the air.

1125
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,380
Alright, I'm on the air and I'm back, the outsider, the sus.

1126
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:04,920
What's happening?

1127
00:44:05,220 --> 00:44:06,700
Look at your monitor, Essie.

1128
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:07,580
Oh my gosh.

1129
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:11,220
Hey, we've got a developing chase situation down on the Tribulation Highway.

1130
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:15,060
So let's go now to Happy Fandit in News Chopper One.

1131
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:15,900
Happy, what's happening?

1132
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,820
You know it was gonna be a hell of a ride in the last hours,

1133
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:20,000
but look out below.

1134
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,020
Just seconds ago,

1135
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,380
a Maroon Sports utility convertible Babylon SX 4x4

1136
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:26,880
came rolling right out of the scene

1137
00:44:26,880 --> 00:44:28,860
across the center divider

1138
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,940
and it's going hell-bent against the arrow of time.

1139
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,180
Oh man, that's spooky,

1140
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:33,180
but that's a great car.

1141
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,200
Somebody could get hurt. Who's driving it?

1142
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:39,980
It's a female woman drinking out of a large trophy or gold cup.

1143
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,280
It's a female woman drinking out of a large trophy or gold cup.

1144
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,860
Yeah, the Rattler Baptist is saying it's a chalice

1145
00:44:43,860 --> 00:44:45,060
and the PG Amish,

1146
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:46,960
yeah, they think it's a big gulp.

1147
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,360
Well, this is Harold Hippogor in the newsroom.

1148
00:44:49,540 --> 00:44:49,980
I'm Harold Hippogor.

1149
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:51,800
What are you doing in the newsroom?

1150
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,620
Why aren't you out in the now mobile van

1151
00:44:53,620 --> 00:44:55,160
chasing that booty?

1152
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,560
Out of the now mobile van.

1153
00:44:57,960 --> 00:44:59,260
Oh, that's what these keys are.

1154
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:00,840
I found the keys in the bathroom.

1155
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,620
I'm looking at the Channel 86 news picture down here

1156
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,960
and this redhead weaving along the trip,

1157
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:07,860
she appears to be drunk driving,

1158
00:45:07,980 --> 00:45:09,500
she's talking on her cell phone

1159
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,860
and there's a wonderful shot of the license plate

1160
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:13,600
of her 4x4,

1161
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:16,100
it's a vanity plate with a one and a zero.

1162
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,600
That's an eye and a ball.

1163
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,180
I've got the angle on her.

1164
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:20,500
I'll take over here, Harold.

1165
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:23,820
Yeah, I can see from here that they're sealing

1166
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:24,820
the next seven exits

1167
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:28,000
between Perdition Pass and Great Satan's Village.

1168
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,260
Oh boy, oh boy.

1169
00:45:29,380 --> 00:45:30,600
They're laying down funny foam

1170
00:45:30,600 --> 00:45:32,840
that's going to block the quadruple bypass

1171
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:35,000
and clog every major artery into the city.

1172
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:35,980
I'm glad I'm not...

1173
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:39,240
Throw it! Stay on top of it!

1174
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:41,800
Is he gone?

1175
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:44,700
Holy virgin, what is happening out there?

1176
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:46,060
Spot coming at you.

1177
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,000
All right, well, run, spot, run.

1178
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,280
The critics are unanimous.

1179
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:57,440
They hate Pull My String.

1180
00:45:58,440 --> 00:46:00,760
A new level of low.

1181
00:46:01,660 --> 00:46:05,920
A morbid exploitation of the freshly dead.

1182
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:10,060
The end of film.

1183
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,400
But what do the people say?

1184
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,060
I'm going back in as soon as my seat is dry.

1185
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,880
They've done some big things with their chest.

1186
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,020
Oh my goodness, the mudboarding was dope.

1187
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:24,700
Yes, it's weirdly cool.

1188
00:46:24,900 --> 00:46:25,500
It's very cool.

1189
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,920
It's Titanic without the water.

1190
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,000
Hey, that's Pull My String.

1191
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:34,500
Yeah, me too.

1192
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,300
Princess Goddess had to die

1193
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,020
to star in the movie of her life.

1194
00:46:40,620 --> 00:46:42,600
Now she'll live for you

1195
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,320
in Pull My String

1196
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:47,840
from Bottom Fiedler Films.

1197
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:48,040
I'm Harold D.

1198
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:48,040


1199
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,960
And don't forget the Radio Now Princess Goddess doll drop

1200
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:54,740
at Homeless Stadium when it all comes down tonight.

1201
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:55,940
Bring a kid

1202
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:58,480
and maybe a doll will drop on her.

1203
00:46:59,440 --> 00:47:01,340
It's five after five alive

1204
00:47:01,340 --> 00:47:03,060
on this day in Fun Fun Town

1205
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:04,840
that's going by, woo, way too fast.

1206
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:06,220
But on the fives,

1207
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,880
we got Danny Vanilla, the celebrity stalker.

1208
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:10,000
He's on the move again.

1209
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,520
Hey, Danny, it sounds kind of wet there.

1210
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:14,100
It is, Bebop.

1211
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:15,600
I'm partially submerged

1212
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:17,120
in the celebrity storm drain

1213
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:18,680
and I'm getting boxed, Tony.

1214
00:47:18,740 --> 00:47:21,840
I can eyeball Princess Goddess inside

1215
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,720
attending a brunch, of course,

1216
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:24,260
with Prince Harold.

1217
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,920
Now right above me is a stretch dumpster

1218
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:29,400
ready to speed Princess Goddess

1219
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,140
to the White Tie and Black Ribbon Affair

1220
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:31,880
at Dead Center Hall.

1221
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:35,620
There, a replica of the solid platinum cord

1222
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,880
the doctors pulled out of her back,

1223
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,760
making it possible for her to speak again.

1224
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,640
Will be auctioned off along with Rose Mud,

1225
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:43,220
the mudboard she was riding

1226
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:46,040
at the time of her final encounter.

1227
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:47,560
I'm sorry.

1228
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,440
With a landmine on the slopes of the English Alps.

1229
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:53,920
Here she comes, here she comes.

1230
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,420
Pull over my string.

1231
00:47:55,720 --> 00:47:57,880
Pull over my string.

1232
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,160
Come and see my very fast feet.

1233
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,700
Oh, she's so exquisite.

1234
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,140
Wait a minute, beg you.

1235
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,040
Here come the celeberoxies

1236
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,600
taking pictures of themselves.

1237
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,180
There's Tony Eatery with his latest

1238
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,220
Wet Girls Storm Drain.

1239
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,620
And there goes the stretch dumpster.

1240
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:16,580
Princess Goddess, she's rolling down her window.

1241
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,520
You know, she's digitally winking at me.

1242
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:22,840
I love you, Denny.

1243
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,140
What did she say?

1244
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:28,640
I love you, Denny.

1245
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:29,040
What did she say?

1246
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,380
I got my teeth in your ears

1247
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:31,440
and I'm biting through

1248
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:32,800
because I'm Chump Prince

1249
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,540
coming at you with more sports

1250
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:35,780
in your shorts.

1251
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,040
You know, watching the game without betting

1252
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,820
is like having sex with your hat.

1253
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,620
Oh yeah, it's got you covered,

1254
00:48:41,660 --> 00:48:43,180
but it just don't fit.

1255
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,420
Hey, give me my hat.

1256
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:45,520
I'm gonna take some corks.

1257
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,400
Hey, Chump, am I on?

1258
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:48,260
How would I know?

1259
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:49,460
I need a tip.

1260
00:48:49,720 --> 00:48:50,580
First one's free.

1261
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,520
What's the spread on midnight?

1262
00:48:52,780 --> 00:48:55,440
Well, the desert says 3 to 1 on the end of the world,

1263
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,440
but for my money, you'll be mowing the lawn

1264
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:00,000
and popping brewskis per usual tomorrow morning.

1265
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:03,400
No, no, I bet Mom's farm on Armageddon.

1266
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,320
Oh, well, if you can't stand the heat,

1267
00:49:05,380 --> 00:49:06,300
don't bet the kitchen.

1268
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,400
Greased dog on two.

1269
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,060
You got a problem, Chump. Yeah?

1270
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,160
Greased dog, sit up and tell me something I don't know.

1271
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,380
It's over, Chumper.

1272
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:17,760
We're pulling the plug.

1273
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:20,060
You're drinking out of the toilet on this one, dog man.

1274
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,580
Oh yeah. Oh yeah.

1275
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,140
Check your screen.

1276
00:49:23,420 --> 00:49:26,040
Hey, what's that big eyeball doing there?

1277
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,840
Hey, hey, hey, it ain't CBS, pal.

1278
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:31,540
Hey, I'm starting to get sleepy.

1279
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,460
Yeah, we're coming in.

1280
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,020
Yeah, well, I'm out here.

1281
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:36,500
Oh, no, you're not.

1282
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:38,420
Hey, let me out of here.

1283
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,680
Let me out of this place.

1284
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:42,480
Yeah, there was a time.

1285
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,560
I forgot what I was going to say.

1286
00:49:44,740 --> 00:49:46,280
We're five minutes away.

1287
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,620
Are we? Yeah.

1288
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:50,900
See, my watch says it's only three minutes,

1289
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,460
but I'm not tied to Greenwich.

1290
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:55,220
Hey, the Lord Jesus Christ just walked into the room.

1291
00:49:56,320 --> 00:49:57,240
Praise Jesus.

1292
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,920
A native of your noble state of Ohio.

1293
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:00,580
Yes.

1294
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,280
Send our greetings to Jesus.

1295
00:50:03,780 --> 00:50:04,480
Here, hold on.

1296
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:06,480
Chaz?

1297
00:50:06,660 --> 00:50:08,400
Jesus. Hey, how's it going?

1298
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:11,400
Good. We're stumping it out here in Cleveland.

1299
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:16,440
Getting ready to count down the seconds to the last year.

1300
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:17,840
Yes, the last year.

1301
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,180
Now we will be entering the next year.

1302
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,000
How's the rocket going?

1303
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:27,720
We have, actually, we have 15 vessels ready for test launching.

1304
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:28,320
15?

1305
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,340
I've been collecting those SD rocket packs.

1306
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,280
You know, the ones that go into the smaller rockets.

1307
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:34,080
Okay, well, we need...

1308
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,040
I think we have about 16 million of those.

1309
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,480
What we need are D engines.

1310
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:38,340
D engines?

1311
00:50:38,340 --> 00:50:40,280
D. We need a lot of D engines.

1312
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,240
Okay, well, we should tell the listeners to send those in.

1313
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:43,520
Yeah.

1314
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,480
It's going to take a lot of D engines to get off the ground.

1315
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:46,980
Yeah, you're right.

1316
00:50:47,380 --> 00:50:49,860
D and E. We can do D and E engines,

1317
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,280
but E engines are more expensive.

1318
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,840
What about the double E?

1319
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:55,040
Do you want to stay away from the double E?

1320
00:50:55,080 --> 00:50:56,920
No, then you step up to the F and the G.

1321
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:59,780
Actually, there is a... I'm going to pick up an H engine.

1322
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:01,360
You know what? We were talking.

1323
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,140
Maybe we should, instead of building your own spaceship,

1324
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,900
how about the idea of stealing

1325
00:51:06,740 --> 00:51:08,260
another one that's already finished?

1326
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,900
Well, there is one down at...

1327
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,580
Steal your own ship.

1328
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,180
At Cape Canaveral. They have that last...

1329
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:16,140
the Saturn V that's

1330
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:17,780
disassembled, you know?

1331
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,960
Can we get in?

1332
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:20,700
Yeah, I think we could.

1333
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,100
Who's there tonight? Is it just you?

1334
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:25,740
Michelle and myself are here.

1335
00:51:25,860 --> 00:51:26,640
Oh, hey, Michelle.

1336
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:29,000
Hey. How's it going? I can't hear you.

1337
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:30,860
Oh, that's okay. You don't need to hear me.

1338
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,560
I can barely hear you. You can just feel my presence.

1339
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,460
Yes, yes. Wow. So you guys are going to

1340
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:37,380
count down the new year together there.

1341
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,820
I'm surfing around on porno sites

1342
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:41,380
on the web here in the studio.

1343
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:42,980
Oh, no. Yeah.

1344
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,720
Go to, um, AltDog

1345
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,480
Legless Children.

1346
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,480
Gosh.

1347
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:51,740
We got another one out here.

1348
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:53,680
Oh, you still there? Yeah, I'm still here.

1349
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:55,180
Steal your own rocket ship.

1350
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:58,280
Go to Alt... Did you check... Check out this.

1351
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:01,600
www.prairiesquidsex.com

1352
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:01,940
Really?

1353
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:03,260
Check it out. Yeah.

1354
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,600
www.prairiesquidsex.com

1355
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,060
Yeah. It's mostly... It's pretty good pictures

1356
00:52:08,340 --> 00:52:09,440
but, you know, it's... She's on it.

1357
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,140
I don't know if it's a legal site. It might be blocked out from the school.

1358
00:52:12,260 --> 00:52:13,980
So make sure that you... You plan

1359
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,280
a really good... I mean, this has

1360
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,320
to be a real sacred moment when all these rockets

1361
00:52:18,320 --> 00:52:20,260
go up. Yeah. So...

1362
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:22,300
When are we planning the launch? July 5th?

1363
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,220
Oh, absolutely. No, like...

1364
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,940
We're... You mean we're going to have... You're saying

1365
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:27,960
at X day we're going to have a completed ship

1366
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:29,900
for people to get on board? Yeah, it should.

1367
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,120
If we put them all together.

1368
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:34,340
No. Well, actually, yeah, schedule it

1369
00:52:34,340 --> 00:52:36,180
before the 5th because they're just tests.

1370
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,000
And, uh... And so there's tests.

1371
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:40,420
Yeah, they're just... So we're going to have to just pick a random person

1372
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:42,060
to send off. It's just... Yeah, it's just...

1373
00:52:42,060 --> 00:52:44,160
I'm just going on the thing like, look, if Bob

1374
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,880
screws up again...

1375
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:48,760
Look, at least we'll be taking a little step towards... What do you mean, if Bob?

1376
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,020
You mean when Bob...

1377
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:52,260
Screws up again. I mean, what do you mean

1378
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:54,140
if Bob screws up again? Of course he won't

1379
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:54,600
screw up.

1380
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,960
But at least we'll have some tests.

1381
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,180
At least we'll be... We'll have something to

1382
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,480
do until the... Until it all hits.

1383
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:04,240
Wow. Everyone should build their own ship,

1384
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,140
bring it to X day. That's right. We'll hook them all up

1385
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:08,320
together with, like, some duct tape or something. That's right.

1386
00:53:08,340 --> 00:53:10,160
Right, yeah. Who's going to be our...

1387
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:12,200
What's the name of that little monkey that was

1388
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,240
the first monkey in space? Uh...

1389
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:16,240
Uh... I don't know. Bonzo?

1390
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,600
Or... J. Fred Muggs?

1391
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:20,300
No. I remember the first

1392
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:22,080
dog was Laka. Laka?

1393
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,120
Yeah. Who will be our Laka?

1394
00:53:24,300 --> 00:53:25,960
Yeah. Who's going to be our... I mean, is

1395
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:27,840
Lonesome Cowboy Dave doing anything?

1396
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,140
Well, he does have a dog.

1397
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:32,160
He does? Yeah. I think I'm going to just use him.

1398
00:53:32,340 --> 00:53:33,300
His name's Jake.

1399
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:34,320
Jake.

1400
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:38,180
But which one would we rather send into space, though?

1401
00:53:38,340 --> 00:53:39,380
Dave or Jake?

1402
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:40,620
Both of them.

1403
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:44,220
Jake would probably be able to work the controls better,

1404
00:53:44,320 --> 00:53:46,280
but, you know, it'll be

1405
00:53:46,280 --> 00:53:48,440
more fun to watch Lonesome Cowboy Dave go up.

1406
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,460
Hey, you're mine!

1407
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:52,220
Hey! Let me out of here! Let me out of

1408
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:52,680
this place!

1409
00:53:54,340 --> 00:53:55,520
You know, Rex?

1410
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:58,480
Yeah. I think that's

1411
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,740
me. Well,

1412
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,320
I've been drinking this popular

1413
00:54:02,320 --> 00:54:03,600
brand of beer

1414
00:54:03,600 --> 00:54:05,880
for a pretty near hundred years.

1415
00:54:07,060 --> 00:54:09,580
I'm still so depressed.

1416
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:11,160
Me, too.

1417
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:13,040
I can't even

1418
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:15,140
lie down, Sandy.

1419
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,360
You boys are down in the dumpsters

1420
00:54:19,360 --> 00:54:21,120
because your adult beverage

1421
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:22,620
is only an alcoholic

1422
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:24,700
enhanced dietary supplement.

1423
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,440
How come you're so

1424
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:29,080
peppy, Roy?

1425
00:54:29,160 --> 00:54:31,200
Here, take a swig of what my

1426
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,960
grandkids put me on

1427
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,860
the last roundup.

1428
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:35,860
I'll take a swig of what my grandkids put me on

1429
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:35,860


1430
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:36,320
the last roundup.

1431
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:36,860
I'm trying. It's a

1432
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:38,920
Polar Pro.

1433
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,880
Dang, I do feel

1434
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:45,420
a whole lot less

1435
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,760
suicidal. And I got

1436
00:54:47,760 --> 00:54:49,640
the Texas Trots

1437
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:50,040
again!

1438
00:54:50,740 --> 00:54:52,300
Yee-haw!

1439
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:55,580
Polar Pro, a prescription beer

1440
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,460
for older Americans with natural

1441
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,780
Alaskan bear urine and Prozac.

1442
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:01,720
Consult your doctor if you're

1443
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:03,600
pregnant over 80 and operating

1444
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:04,460
heavy equipment.

1445
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,660
Whoa, don't fire in the air.

1446
00:55:07,740 --> 00:55:09,300
You don't know where it's coming down.

1447
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,880
Well, we are here at a

1448
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,960
subgenius last year party.

1449
00:55:14,020 --> 00:55:15,320
Hey, it's time to

1450
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,800
do it, man. Get everybody on the phone.

1451
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:19,340
It's a countdown. It's like

1452
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:21,360
20 seconds. It's like

1453
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:23,180
20, 19,

1454
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,700
yeah, here we go, into

1455
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:27,680
next year. Into next

1456
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,580
year. 15, yes.

1457
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:31,940
Into the future.

1458
00:55:32,320 --> 00:55:33,660
10, 9,

1459
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,800
8, 7,

1460
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,560
6,

1461
00:55:37,880 --> 00:55:38,920
5, 4,

1462
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,900
3, 2,

1463
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,180
1. Happy

1464
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,480
next year!

1465
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,400
Wait, I gotta kiss Michelle.

1466
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,320
Happy

1467
00:55:49,880 --> 00:55:50,820
New Year!

1468
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,100
Ho, ho, ho!

1469
00:55:52,700 --> 00:55:55,100
The sun's Santa Claus!

1470
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,760
Bringing you little babies

1471
00:55:57,760 --> 00:55:59,340
full of cash and

1472
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:01,720
old, just, jelly-bearing

1473
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:03,840
cysts walking, shuffling

1474
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:04,800
off into the horizon.

1475
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:07,800
New Baby 1999

1476
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:09,700
comes crawling around the bend.

1477
00:56:09,960 --> 00:56:11,820
His machine gun in

1478
00:56:11,820 --> 00:56:13,700
one hand and a crack pipe in the other.

1479
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:15,880
And Old Man 1998

1480
00:56:15,880 --> 00:56:17,860
with his broken bob pipe

1481
00:56:17,860 --> 00:56:19,300
and his crashed sawtooth.

1482
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:20,900
Go watering.

1483
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,840
Go down into the pond. His pink feathers.

1484
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,920
Yeah, into the pond.

1485
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,880
Into the pond with Old Man

1486
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,940
time. Old Man 98.

1487
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,920
And your machine gun toting

1488
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:35,140
Baby 1999.

1489
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:38,120
Crawls up out of the pond.

1490
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:40,360
You can plug these in.

1491
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,320
But, uh,

1492
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:42,980
yeah.

1493
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,580
Old Bob goes into the

1494
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,140
outhouse and out crawls

1495
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:49,180
Baby Bob.

1496
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,100
Baby Bob.

1497
00:56:51,140 --> 00:56:53,360
Just plug him in anywhere and turn it up.

1498
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,620
Oh, yeah.

1499
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:57,880
Jesus is gonna go get G. Gordon Gordon

1500
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,980
since he represents the old year.

1501
00:57:00,260 --> 00:57:01,540
Well, Old Man

1502
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,600
19, the Old Man

1503
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:05,780
time has come crawling.

1504
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,920
Oh, and Baby, young Baby

1505
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:09,860
1999 is here too.

1506
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:10,600
Ooh la la.

1507
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:13,300
Old Man time, say farewell

1508
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:15,080
to the peaks of 1999.

1509
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:17,240
So it's 1999 there.

1510
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,620
Hey, hey. Yes. Howdy.

1511
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:22,000
Howdy. You people are a year ahead of us.

1512
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,260
Do you realize that? Yeah.

1513
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,860
So it's already X day coming up over there.

1514
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:27,180
It's next year already.

1515
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:29,700
We are already in next year here in Cleveland.

1516
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,780
So it's a time. You're talking

1517
00:57:31,780 --> 00:57:33,460
across time. That's right.

1518
00:57:33,900 --> 00:57:35,740
Talking across time. We're an hour behind.

1519
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,020
You are one light hour behind me.

1520
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:39,380
One hour behind you.

1521
00:57:39,380 --> 00:57:41,580
You people have already moved into the future

1522
00:57:41,580 --> 00:57:43,220
and we're all hung up here in 98.

1523
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:45,160
You still have an hour to go.

1524
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,120
Yeah, exactly.

1525
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:49,520
To reach the destination we, the plateau

1526
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:51,240
we have already stood upon.

1527
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,140
Yeah, that's it. You've already

1528
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:55,280
achieved the, the pathiosis.

1529
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,520
You have reached the peak.

1530
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,820
And we're still scrambling up the side of that

1531
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:01,640
damn, you know, sidereal

1532
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:03,520
mountain. We haven't gotten anywhere near

1533
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,220
the peak yet. Yeah, but it's in view.

1534
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:07,640
Well, yeah, you can sort of reach up. The light's at the end of the tunnel.

1535
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,860
Yeah, you can focus on the light

1536
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:11,500
at the end of the tunnel. Yeah.

1537
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:13,580
Or the drink at the end of the tunnel or something.

1538
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,380
I don't know. Yeah. That big,

1539
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,920
that four foot

1540
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:19,500
bong at the end of the tunnel.

1541
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:20,900
Ah, yes.

1542
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:23,600
And the healing sound

1543
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:25,300
of a frappy new year.

1544
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,680
Frappin'. A frappy

1545
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:29,080
new year. Absolutely

1546
00:58:30,020 --> 00:58:31,840
frappin'. Yes, we be. And I'm being

1547
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,180
filmed even as I speak.

1548
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:34,440
Stain cam.

1549
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:36,680
Stain cam is on me. Stain cam?

1550
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:38,600
It's in my trousers. Wait just a minute.

1551
00:58:38,740 --> 00:58:41,000
Stain cam is in my, get that stain

1552
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:42,260
cam. That is disgusting.

1553
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,220
You know, ever since he and Ken

1554
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,980
Starr became friends, it's been the

1555
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:49,320
same old stuff over and over again.

1556
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,140
Well, I should

1557
00:58:51,140 --> 00:58:53,120
probably relinquish this to other people who need

1558
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:55,080
more important things to say. Hey,

1559
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:57,000
well. For the new years. But happy new year

1560
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,040
to all you people up there in the northern

1561
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,220
areas. I bet you're freezing your buns off.

1562
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:02,800
We are indeed. We are indeed.

1563
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,260
Well, we're out the back porch jammin', man.

1564
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,380
That's pretty good. We're out here jammin' on the back porch.

1565
00:59:07,800 --> 00:59:08,940
We'll see you at

1566
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:10,800
next day, brother. Okay, man.

1567
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,200
Alright. It's, it's, I think it would be kind

1568
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,120
of dangerous to go outside around

1569
00:59:15,120 --> 00:59:17,060
these parts. Sounds like there's a

1570
00:59:17,060 --> 00:59:19,260
small war going on. Oh, I need to put on,

1571
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,220
I need to put on Miss, Miss

1572
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:22,920
Baby, Miss Babe

1573
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:24,880
New Year 99, Sister

1574
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:26,600
Decadent. Oh,

1575
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,260
Sister Decadent. Happy new year to you too,

1576
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:31,200
darling. Hello, Sister Decadent. Oh,

1577
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,080
happy new year to you. We have already

1578
00:59:33,180 --> 00:59:34,940
achieved the nirvana of next

1579
00:59:34,940 --> 00:59:36,000
year, 1999.

1580
00:59:37,060 --> 00:59:38,940
We will be with you soon,

1581
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:40,180
my brother. Yes.

1582
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:42,960
We will be arriving in approximately

1583
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:45,140
one hour, first time.

1584
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:46,780
What is that,

1585
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:48,880
boom-booms out there? Oh, man. Yeah.

1586
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:50,860
It's like a war, like, like a,

1587
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:53,060
actually not even a small war, it's like a

1588
00:59:53,060 --> 00:59:55,060
big war. Lots of bombs

1589
00:59:55,060 --> 00:59:56,740
going off and, um,

1590
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,940
automatic rifles and

1591
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:01,320
guns. It's, it's quite exciting,

1592
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:02,200
actually.

1593
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,260
We were seeing Bob's in the stoplights

1594
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:06,100
on the way over.

1595
01:00:06,820 --> 01:00:09,060
He's showing his head even as we

1596
01:00:09,060 --> 01:00:10,740
speak, pre-new year.

1597
01:00:10,960 --> 01:00:13,120
He is at P.O. Box

1598
01:00:14,220 --> 01:00:14,820
140306.

1599
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:17,300
Yes, we can, here's an update, a news update

1600
01:00:17,300 --> 01:00:20,820
from the 9th floor of downtown Cleveland. Dallas,

1601
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:20,880
Texas,

1602
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,280
75214.

1603
01:00:24,320 --> 01:00:25,280
It does indeed sound

1604
01:00:25,280 --> 01:00:26,000
like that. That's

1605
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:28,180
Bob at Box

1606
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,880
140306, Dallas, Texas,

1607
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:32,980
75214.

1608
01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:36,460
www.subgenius.com

1609
01:00:37,180 --> 01:00:38,340
Just calm yourselves.

1610
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,720
They say it sounds like a war.

1611
01:00:40,860 --> 01:00:42,900
And when you're in the midst of it, it sounds

1612
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,780
even more. It sounds

1613
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,800
exactly like the footage from

1614
01:00:46,800 --> 01:00:49,000
Baghdad. Exactly. That's

1615
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:50,940
what it looks like. I swear to God, I'm

1616
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:52,840
looking out over the east side of Cleveland

1617
01:00:52,840 --> 01:00:54,220
and it looks like the foot...
