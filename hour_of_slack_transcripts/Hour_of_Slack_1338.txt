Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show, except
that actually it's not.
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays
and holy days and the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of salad.

Yes.
Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.
But anyway, happy whatever you do.
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.
It's cool, man.

And praise Bob and the whole world.
Oh.

I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas tree.
I'm not sure I can stop that.
Yeah.







And left me stranded on this Christmas tree
When this angel heard
A dreadful fear went right into my heart
Those pine tree needles sting me
Ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-jam-a, ram-a-ding-dong
You'll never know how much that smarts
So who put the stump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong
Who stood the wood where I boop-sheep-boop-sheep-boop
Who put the stick up my hip-a-dip-a-dip
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush
He made this angel beg for mercy, please
Too tight, too tight
Too tight, too tight
And I'm gonna say to you
It's already 9 p.m.
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him
Don't go walking down to the bar
Cause old Frankie died last night in the backyard
I mean, I'm gonna park my store and look at the credits
And in the right
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw, yeah
And I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells
Till I get to bed
I have chainsaw fixed and back in my arm the way it was Tuesday
Now you boys be good and I'll give you some of this here
Apple mango pie
You ain't no good of a child
That dog's running off with them brain cells
Can you do something about that, boy?
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to

Oh, Jazz is giving, gives Dave the show pills.
What am I going to do about laundromat in this suit though?
I need the show bath.

Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.
That's enough of that.
Oh, he's got headphones.
I also have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.
It's been increased in size to...
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.
Look, it's swelling.
I actually have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain.
I'll put more pills out for everybody.
Oh, those pills.
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.
And my brain feel like it's a puddle of liquefied...

I'm shocked by the...
The red pills are really good.

It will empower the students.
Yes, sir.
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.
It will be called Bobber for Kids.
But how?
How will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?
Good has a lot of muscle.
Good.

The primitive Earth societies should accept this value judgment.
Good will have great physical attributes according to human desires, sexual desires,

Ah, yes, and next up, The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.
Once upon a time, there was the baby Jesus.
And he had two eyes made out of coal.
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.
And he wanted his two front teeth.
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.
And he took all the presents from Whoville.
And his friend Yukon Cornelius came with the three wise guys.
And he wanted to play the drums and be the little drummer boy.
But he couldn't.
He wanted tens and twenties, tens and twenties.
And he...
He got McDonald's gift certificates and he got Zuzu's pedals.
And that's the real story of Christmas.
Take the halls and the miles of holly
Tears of the season to be jolly
Don't we know I'll get a barrel
Roll the engine and take care

La la la la la la la la la la

He-Bob and the bastards of the universe will be back after this message.

Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas.
He wanted an electric train.
He had the whole thing on his mind, even to the table where it was going to set it up.
I'm going to picture the whole thing.
He would dream so hard that the whole thing would come to life right before his eyes.
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher.
And what he started wishing for was a pretty fancy looking train set with locomotives and freight cars.
And a station and a gateman.
The mortar tower and all the kinds of wonderful equipment and accessories.
So grand that you might think Tommy was waiting for something that just didn't exist.
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.
It is turnover.
The time of the year when all things sell.
The end of the year sale.
So come and get it everyone and just buy our products.
I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.
Are we?
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.
But the present subgenie try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now.
And sell everything to the pigs.
Oh yes, once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.
And it was something else in between there.
Before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season.
It was something.
There was something else, but I think they started to war over it.

The Weirbobs and Ima, those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands.
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole.
Oh, friends, it's tough.
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob.
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids that Santa Claus,
Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.
Can you believe that?
The kids were asking if their parents, maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.
And the mom said, no, no, he won't because he bills us.
We can't afford that.
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

he used to put a stocking cap on his head and put a knot right in front of it.
Daddy wake up with that stomping headache.
And he said, the kids are saying, my head's hurting so bad.
I said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas,
but he's going to bring you something.
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside and shot up in the air
and come back inside and told us the biggest lie ever heard.
Said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.
And whose birth do we celebrate with this new century?
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle but Satan Claus?
Whose father, Paul Bunyan, and whose mother, Big Sister, created the conspiracy?
Before there were malls, there was no such thing as Christmas.
Yes, there was a down-home Norman rock.
It's a wonderful life type of Christmas.
It was a kite-flying Coca-Cola drinking Christmas,
not a crack-smoking, rubber-snapping Christmas.
Now, it was a...
When your little brother fell through a hole in the ice sled,
and you went and saved him, you didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.
It was a wonderful...

It was a wonderful life back then.
...and we pulled some eggs, little jokes about him waking up,
and then we'd put candles, like most people have for Christmas.
He would have that smile on his face and a big red nose.
But today, Christmas is lost its meaning.
He'd have beaten the crap out of Santa Claus.
Scott, you made your choice.
When you rejected my word, you rejected me.
And to your eternal soul,
you have found that I only...
Could you afford to give to God that which was his?
But you could not afford to do otherwise.
The Senate still stands.
In the outer darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth...
Sir, please give me just one more chance, sir!
I don't want to go to hell, sir!
Sir, no!

all over the world. The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth and a baby is born
with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp. Dare I ask it? Yes. Was the infant Jesus neither
man nor God, but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?
The answer? Yes, definitely. Take that and shove it up the tube, mark certainty,
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.
Pieces of Cupid and Comet, and he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage,
and he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage. He got dancer and prancer with an old

and a barbecue blitzer, and he took a big bite and said it tastes just like chicken.
The Night Santa went

The Night Santa went crazy, the night is cringy when the Santa can hardly walk around the North Pole
without stepping in reindeer guts. There's a National Guard and the FBI.
There's a van from the Iowa News and helicopters circling around in the sky,
and the bullets are flying.
And the bodyguards rising, and everyone's dying to know who Santa was.
My, my, my, my, my, my, you used to be such a jolly guy.
He knows when you're asleep. He knows when you're awake.
He knows when you're bound for good.

But now...
Who gave the Lord the claptrap?
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind?
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season.
The time of the Lord, of the fact that...
How many before you reach your limit?
How many do you get?
Jesuses?
Yeah, how many can you bag?
How many Messiahs can you bag?
Jesuses.
If you're doing it in season...
If you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit.
Oh, you never do that.
And you can only take one.
You never bag the Lord in C.
You bag the Lord in B-flat so you get that kind of rough sound.
But when they're in season, it's every God for himself.
This is the season for the...
For the fighting Jesus.
Obviously.
We are between a rock and a hard place.
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea in the old age
and he got a very, very hard foot?
And he got elephantages of the rectum.
You know, it's not something well known by many Christian scholars.
That can be messy, messy, messy disease.
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was...

We thank you for all the nice things that you've done for us this Thanksgiving.

We appreciate all that.
And we're just trying to insult your fan club.
That's all.
That's why we do this blasphemy stuff.

Right.

The greatest scary Christmas song ever, friends, from his new album, Don't Trust Whitey,
James Kozalka, Superstar.
You know, see, a subgenius has so much faith
that he not only can accept somebody making fun of Bob,
stomping on a picture,
Bob, he'll do it himself. He has so much trust and faith in Bob. Bob is such a good friend that
he can insult Bob. Now, we subgeni, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of
entertaining tapes, but we subgeni may be bad, but our way of bad is holy, is holy compared to the
evil of so, not all, by any means, but so many American fundamentalists, charismatics, evangelicals,
et cetera, in general, of course, they and their corresponding types in Iran, Russia, Libya, South
Africa, et cetera, if you ask me, are actually the ace up the devil's sleeve. Wolves in sheep's
clothing, friends, just like Jesus warned about. Jesus and Bob, like we say, our old drinking
buddies, got nothing against Jesus. It's just his fan club. And now, we aren't saying that Bob is
the ace up God's sleeve. He's more like the smear.
They're on God's handkerchief, just like you or me. But the uptight rival cults, they don't think
God has a handkerchief. Uh-uh, no, because God's perfect. He doesn't even sneeze. We're made in
his image, except that we have all these nasty parts attached to us, and we have to go in the
secret room, the bathroom, to do awful things. But God, oh, he's clean and pure, according to them.
Oh, and he's male, but he doesn't excrete juices and sweat.
And smelly stuff out of him like we do, because we sin. Oh, yeah, we all sin. We're bad. We're worthless.
We're no good to God, unless we sign a contract with his agent.
