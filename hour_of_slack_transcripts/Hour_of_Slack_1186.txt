Come on, quiet down, quiet down now.
Dr. Howell means no harm.
I was only attempting to do my duty, son.
Someday you'll understand and do otherwise.
Nurses, nurses, doctors, please!
There's too much laughing and...
This is very embarrassing.
Sorry, Dr. Howell.
The auditorium isn't cleared right now.
Dr. Howell will have to take the entire hospital out
for breakfast this morning.
Or kill me.
You're on the air.
Oh, hi, Dr. Sinister.
Hello, Reverend Stang.
How are you?
Thanks for babysitting the show earlier.
Oh, that's what I do.
That's part of my job description.
You'll sit on the right-hand side of Bob for that, I'm sure.
And together you two can start World War III.
Yep.
Yep.
We're going to bomb Bernie's place first.
Not really, no.
I didn't really say that.
Now, I found out what it's like to be Jewish recently.
I was informed by a person
who's been postmorteming
on alt-slack
that I'm a satanic Masonic Jew.
Wow, that's...
It's very hard to pull off.
All three of those.
That's the trifecta, you know.
No, actually, it's not.
I mean, according to this guy,
pretty much they all go hand in hand.
And he had quoted
the lineup of Starwood workshop titles
as evidence of my satanic nature
because I, you know,
hunt and hunt.
I hang out with those neo-pagans.
Well, we all know that
anything other than the one true god of Abraham
is Satan.
Well, this guy accused me
and really, in a way,
the whole Church of the Subgenius
of only making fun of one religion.
Huh.
Which offended me.
Yeah, really.
I found that really offensive.
I actually got so tired
of making fun of Christians.
I mean, that's why everybody does that.
Yeah.
So, I mean, you know,
that's sitcom stuff now.
So, I picked on New Agers
as much as I could for a long time
because they were the other group
that were in my face.
You know, we try to be
equal opportunity offenders.
Yeah.
And I, you know, it's true,
we haven't made that much fun of Islam
because they weren't really in our faces.
I guess if you're in the military,
they are now.
I don't know.
But they're not.
They're not.



You know, it's just a matter of time

And I think that's the problem.
And people misunderstand
the Church of the Subgenius sometimes.
They think it's a satire takeoff on kooks and so forth.
No, we're really kooks.
And it's like, oh, they think, well,
it's a takeoff on the conspiracy.
In fact, as I was up there running registration,
we were, somebody had kept calling, whining,
not to Hayes, but to Brushwood
about how they were a hardship case.
So, they should get in.
Yeah.
Cheap or free, because they were a hardship case,
because they spent their money on cigarettes or something.
And Princess Wee said, you know,
I think down there on the field,
we have 700 hardship cases.
And I said, yeah, man, money first.
Bulls can talk, but bills can walk.
And our friend, Bruce Flores, said, Stan,
you really are conspiracy, aren't you?
And I went, well, duh.
Yeah.
Yeah.


But the conspiracy we're talking about is,
it may not be the one that you think we're talking about.
I wasn't, like Groucho Marx,
Briggs pointed out, there's some Groucho Marx movie
where first he's weedling and guilt tripping people
into giving him a big meal.
And then when he's finished with a meal,
they ask him for his help in return.
And he says, I feel differently now that I've eaten.
And it's, I think, it's a, I don't know, I don't know.
Funny how, you know, once, you're against,
you think that inheritance tax thing is all just terrible
until you are up for an inheritance.
It's funny how that works.
And, but really the point, our point about the conspiracy
is that we call the conspiracy them,
but it's worse incarnation as to us.
Because every time we say us, we're part of the conspiracy.
Conspiracy is what divides everybody up.
Every time you say something nasty and if it's uncalled for,
then you're part of the conspiracy.
Every time you're jealous,
there's the conspiracy inside you coming out.
But not every time you lie.
Sometimes it's okay to lie.
I have to confess, I've lied to a Jehovah's Witness.
They came to my door,
not too long ago, two very polite Jehovah's Witnesses.
And my policy is to be,
I know what it's like to be a religious nut.
Especially if you're in a cult
that expects the world to end all the time,
and it never does.
So I have a special place in my,
plus the illustrations are great.
And a lot of the subgenius graphics seen here
are stolen and tripped up from Jehovah's Witness books.
But,
these two nice Jehovah's Witnesses came to the door.
And I was polite to them and told them
I really admired their publishing empire.
That I was very familiar with their history.
And we were into Jehovah too.
And I basically was going, look, I'm busy.
I'm already saved.
I think they probably figured I was Jewish or something.
But I said,
as they were about to leave, I said,
hey, look, I'm for any religion that doesn't, you know,
doesn't want to kill everybody.
And they actually high-fived me at that.
But friends, that was a lie.
Because I'm actually part of one of the very few religions
that really does want to kill just about everybody.
It's worked into Bob's prophecy on X-Day, July 5th, 1998.
Whenever that day finally truly comes.
And the calendars can be reset properly.
The aliens from Planet X,
will come and destroy everyone
except the dues-paying subgenius ministers.
In fact, I'll let the subgeniuses fly spaceships around
and destroy everybody they didn't like.
Which is what we mean by the conspiracy.
But, you know, so it's true.
I did lie to a Jehovah's Witness.
But the bright side of that is,
every time you lie to a Jehovah's Witness,
Bob has a little orgasm.
It's an orgasm.
Isn't that sweet?
Let's take another collar for Ollie's work.
Another one that'll be nice.
Do you guys by any chance know what a G-O-L-E-M is or was?
A Golem.
A Golem.
A Golem.
Does anybody there happen to know?
It's a stone or wood or some kind of statue.
It's actually kind of like a fetish of sorts.
It's supposedly reanimated or animated by infusing it
with a soul in some kind of Kabbalistic ritual?
Yeah, you have to write the name of God on a little piece of paper
and put it in its head along with its instructions.
If you look up Golem on Google,
on the second page there's a movie you can see.
This thing was released in 1921,
and it's actually almost two hours long.
So this was an epic novel at that time.
Yeah, The Golem, it's a classic silent film.
Charles Laughton played the role.
If I wasn't so tired, I could tell you who directed it and started it.
It was a snow golem.
Wasn't Charles Laughton in it?
What really gets me is they called him Joseph.
I mean, gosh.
No, a golem is specifically from Jewish folklore,
except that there really are such things.
They always hide it under funny fairy tale stories.
Yeah, Joseph was real.
I agree.
He's God of Abraham, you know.
He was real.
By the way, Abraham...
What?
What?
What?








He believes in God.
He believes in Jehovah One.
Jehovah One.
That stuff's all made up.
That's a fairy story for dumbasses, man.
It's an excellent movie.
It's got some definitely...
The movie was good.
I'm almost ready to believe it was the Israelis that made this movie
because the way it's brought across.
Because even though it shows two separate rabbis,
there actually was a rabbi by the name of Ryan Lyon.
Ryan.
Are you to low?
Now, you're starting to sound like Bernie.
You're starting to drift,
and you're pasting things together randomly.
I watched the movie.
That was one of the funniest looking monsters I've ever seen.
He had a Moe Howard haircut.
It's not animated.
If you had your own golem, man, what would you make it do?
What would you get it to do for you if you had a golem?
It's worth watching.
If you had a golem, man.
They have two separate rabbis in there,
but when I started doing a background check on the movie,
and the people in it and the names in it,
come to find out there was a rabbi, John, I mean, Udalo.
If Dr. Howell was in the room, he'd be able to tell us who directed it, who starred in it.
In English, it means lion, lion.
And what kind of clay they used to cover the actor.
What means lion, lion?
Udalo.
It's Udalo.
Because, yeah, I mean, you know, the power of Alpha is multiple.
It depends on what part of the country you live in.
It depends on how you pronounce Elf.
Löwenbrot, that's lion's brew.
And you guys might find that movie extremely interesting.
I know I did.
I've seen it.
That's what I keep trying to tell you.
God, it's funny.
They just don't.
They have something to say, but they can't.
Bang always complains about his hearing,
and yet I've just listened to three people in a row who had no hearing whatsoever in their ears.
It's more important to get the message across than that they.
And speaking of messages.
They just need to get across.
I've seen it.
That's what I keep trying to tell you.
It's funny.
They just don't.
They have something to say, but they can't.
Bang always complains about his hearing,
and yet I've just listened to three people in a row who had no hearing whatsoever in their ears.
So is this one of those turn your radio down things?
No, I think we were hearing some sort of alternate timeline.
Well, yeah.
I mean, that's one of the magical things about the radio and the delay is it allows you to peer into,
you know, other points in the time stream as if they were happening right now.
If only we had a sort of a reverse delay so we could hear what we were going to say.
We'd probably be a lot funnier.
You mean not to say it?
You're not hearing that?
Go to the headphone thing to change the channel, dude.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
That's the blue switch on the bottom.
How far ahead is it?
Like seven seconds?
Yeah.
Which is actually one second longer than the normal delay.
Well, it seems like it would be distracting, though,
to hear what you're going to say in seven seconds and trying to keep up with it and say it at the same time.
Well, you know, as we like to say about WCSB here.
This is not mono.
This is not stereo.
This is for folks with more than two ears.
Who directed and starred in...
In the 1921 Gollum movie.
That was Paul Wegener.
Paul Wegener.
That's right.
It was on the tip of my tongue.
Paul Wegener.
Rabbi Lowe had anything to do with Lowe's hardware stores or with Nick Lowe.
Of course, the connections are obvious.
The conspiracy hides its top secrets right out in the open where everybody can see them.
And Frosty the Snowman's real name was Frosty Finkelstein.
Frosty the Snowman?





Snowman is a code for cocaine.
Frosty the Doop Man.
Are you going to run the pre-lay again so we can hear what we're going to say?
The drug user likes to refer to his drug by a cute name like snow or for cocaine or grass.
How many times do you need to get hung up on before you get the message you ask?
It's just terminology, man.
Dr. Sinister got an award for hanging up on that guy.
That's...
I don't know.
Just, uh...
Thank you.
Because he's done it so many times.
I'd like to thank all the crazy callers.
Yeah, Dr. Sinister...
All the little people without whom I couldn't have done it.
No kidding.
I'd like to thank the academy.
I understand you have caller ID there.
Uh, well...
All I told you, Mark, is that I have...
I know everything.
That's all I can tell you.
So, why don't we...
Why don't we call this guy back and make his life interesting?
That sucks.
Well, not every number that people call from actually appears on the caller ID.
Now, sometimes on the Puzzling Evidence Show, they've been known to call the callers rather than wait for callers.
Well, yeah, if we were...
I used to get awakened at six in the morning by the Puzzling Evidence Show.
Yeah, if I were going to have, like, a very specific appointment, a very special guest on the program,
certainly I'd probably arrange to call out to them or something.
But, uh, let's take one more caller here.
I love preaching to the unsaved, but I'm not going to try to give you...
It's Subgenius 101.
I'll just kind of spread that in context.
Bob is, of course, the guy with the pipe.
I'm not Bob.
It's not...
He's not the alter ego of any subgenius preacher.
It's just that every time he tries to get up in public, somebody tries to kill him.
As he instructed us to, he told us to hate him and free ourselves from his hypnotic trance power over us.
And we do to flee every year.
We burn his...
image right here at Brushwood, just like he told us to.
We hate him and rebel against him on a yearly basis, just like he said.
So, we're like any other religion in that respect.
A lot of subgeniuses get into the inside jokes before they really have picked up on the outer joke,
which is them, actually.
You know, if you were thinking you knew the outside joke,
that it was a takeoff on...
silly religious beliefs or something.
No, it's a takeoff on you!
And me, and all of us bipedal, upright tool users.
But, nonetheless, despite any possible flaw of J.R. Bob Dobbs,
such as the fact that he is, after all, a mind-controlled death cult leader who'll take all your money,
he...
Bob is, like, replaces the drug.
And that's because if you really meditate on that face,
and just looking at the dots on his face,
if you're doing it right, it eats up as many brain cells as...
that it might as well be, just like using the drugs.
So, he can free you from that, friends.
At the same time,
let's face it, the Church of the Subgenius is like the Chinese finger trap of the mind.
We get people to get stuck in it, and...
some of them actually go insane from it.
And there are several examples of that.
Then, we charge them for the cure.
Yeah!
The insanity's pretty cheap.
You can become a minister for only 30 bucks.
I think Al-Qaeda's 35.
What are you doing?
Hello, you're on the air.
Hey, Doc, how you doing? Buddha here.
Welcome to the program, Buddha.
And, you know, we will be wrapping up the talk portion here in a few minutes, so...
Oh, okay, I'll make it short. Just...
Talk is cheap.
I was listening to you guys talking, and you mentioned the Golo movie.
And I remember seeing one movie, and it's a classic, and I forget the name right now.
Basically, it was about a woman who wanted to free, like, the...
what do we call them, the proles?
A woman who wanted to free the proles.
I believe you may be thinking of Metropolis.
Metropolis, yeah.
Yeah, that's an obscure little thing.
That's Metropolis.
Yeah, it's one of the only tiny movies.
I thought it was, like, a...
Fritz Lang directed that.
Dude, that's, like, one of the most influential films of all time. That's...
It's about the city of the future.
When I first heard about it, I was kind of like, eh, okay, I saw it. My God, that is an intense movie.
Yeah, that's pretty good.
It is. I just watched it, like...
Sure it is.
I just sat there after I watched it, and went like, whoa!
Yeah.
I got to watch old Fritz Lang talk about that movie one time.
You did?
Yes, I did. I'm that old.
What did he have to say? What did he say about it?
Uh...
He...
The same thing this guy just said. He was trying to remember the name of it, and it was about some woman trying to free the proles.
Yes, yes.
But she wasn't really a woman. She was a cleverly designed robot.
Well, not exactly. She was a woman, but they built a cleverly designed robot to replace the famous Maria.
And that was the false Maria.
That was one hot robot.
Yeah, she does a dance showing her robot to the tuxedo-wearing aristocrats, and they really get...
They get out of control there.
Did you ever interview Lenny Weifelstahl?
I thought you did.
We ripped off quite a bit of footage from that thing for our Arise movie.
Hey, Buddha, by the way, I'm glad to hear you're not...
Oh, if you'd like to make a call...
He was having a slight problem over the last few weeks. We finally got him the zombie vaccine.
He was turning into a zombie.
Fritz Lang also made Fury. Ever seen that one? With the horrible lynch mob and the worst, most evil person in the world?
No, no, no.
With the worst, most evil person in it being Bruce Cabot, the hero of King Kong?
You want to know how good I am? Watch me hang up on the nappy collar before you even get some word out.
That's a good one. They try to roast Spencer Tracy alive.
I just did it.
Then also, there's also Hangmen Also Die, which is about the Nazis. And it's a really cool Fritz Lang film.
Yeah, his movie, sure. They're all good. I like them. Ever see M?
Dial M for Murder?
No, no. M with Peter Lorre about the...
Dial M for Murder? You need to repeat that?
Oh, that's a pathetic little child molester, child killer. They want to kill me, so I have to kill them first.
That's very angry.
Maybe it was the hand. The hand did it. It was the hand.
Well, there is a movie with Peter Lorre looking Popeye as a severed hand dances around and plays an arrangement for the left hand on the piano keys.
One of many of the strangest subgenre of movies of the severed hand genre.
Oliver Stone got his start with those.
With Michael Caine's,
My Bloody Hand!
But then before that there was The Hands of Orlac, The Beast with Five Fingers.
That was the Peter Lorre one.
Yeah, that's the one where a hand, a crawling hand, torments Peter Lorre.
And there was that hand that climbed through the dust to inject teenagers with alcohol in the 1950s.
In Invasion of the Saucermen.
The hydrocephalonic Martians had hands with eyeballs conveniently located in the back of the wrist
that would climb through the brush, slit the tires on their hot rods, and inject teenagers with alcohol.
But my favorite part of the social activity of the church is the news group on the internet called Alt.slap.
Which used to be sort of more like a news group.

It was more secret, but now you can get to it with Google groups.
And as Princess We Are Dope, Queen of All the UFOs said,
Alt.slap is the most anti-social social activity I can think of.
And every news group has horrible flame wars now and then.
That's all alt.slap is.
And we have some, oh god, there are some really good writers on there.
And at the same time, we have some really good writers on there.
And at the same time, and it's flypaper for very good humorous type writers and for kooks.
It's the great kook flypaper.
In fact, I think that the feds, whichever one you are, hi, who follow us, they know all.
I should have known.
They don't, I think they don't worry so much about us because we're not trying to, we're waiting for the aliens to kill everybody for us.
Right? We make a big deal out of that.
Don't kill somebody just because you think they're pink conspiracy people.
They may be subgeniuses in disguise.
Only Bob and the aliens can tell that.
But, at the same time, we can certainly attract, how shall I say it, the differently sang.
Far be it from us to call somebody else crazy.
You know, so we have these other terms that are,
one person said, the church is to crazy people making asses of themselves what bug zappers are to bugs.
What matadors are to bulls.
What Lucy Van Pelt with her football is to Charlie Brown.
And we attract such kooks.
Oh, man.
There, I have been accused so many times of,
of,
of being, how do they put it,
of,
satanic, masonic, Jewish.
Normally those don't all run together, although my next door neighbor said,
hey, I'm a masonic,
satanic,
Jew.
And that's the other thing he's throwing in.
And he was gay too.
But,
I've learned from studying kooks that everything,
proves that everything is a satanic, masonic Jew.
That's what they ultimately, most of those crackpots come down to.
And I do not know what their hang up is.
I'll never figure that out.
But we do know this.
Their hot button is our trampoline.
We like to find the hot button of,
if somebody's got a bee in their bonnet about something,
I don't care if it's unions being good or unions being bad.
Or who killed JFK.
Or whether they moved the flying saucer from Roswell to Area 51 or what.
You know.
Uh,
they're, we, if they have,
we're able to figure out their hot button.
We'll jump up and down on it until they either go away,
or like me, build a really thick shell.
Uh,
it's, although even I can get,
uh,
upset.
Some of these people, Princess Wee said,
you have to put on the kid gloves for these people.
With kid gloves!
They're that far gone.
And, uh,
You know, speaking of obscenity,
it was the one year anniversary of the Magdalene Court decision.
I guess, by the way, we have some news, uh, about Magdalene for the first time.
And I'll make this real short.
The whole family is together again in a town in Georgia I shall not name.
The, the young boy, Conrad,
John Boe, is, uh, happy to be, quote,
back to normal, unquote.
We learned that the biological, uh, insane criminal father
only served one month of time.
But the bottom line is,
there is a joint custody,
but residential custody is in the hands of Magdalene.
And she can let the dad see the kid whenever she wants to,
which won't be anytime soon.
So, uh,
and,
. . .
I think you kind of just mentioned something you said you weren't going to mention.
Uh, well, I just came back from Ex Day.
And they took more than just a few joints of, uh, my toe joint,
my big toe joint was taken, ruptured,
and, uh, several more brain cells.
That happens every time.
Nothing to brag about.
No, I'm not bragging.
I think I hit the dump button in time.
The dump button?
Yes.
The dump button.
Yeah, see, I'm up here.
Oh, oh, my.
I didn't want to make it too easy for you, but, uh,
I don't know.
I mean, if you have to do a little bit of homework,
the kooks aren't going to, that baffles them.
Why aren't you . . .
If you just flat out lay it out in front of them,
sure, they'll do their stalking.
Well, I heard something, Mark.
You heard something, too, right?
But if they have to read the instructions, they're not going to, uh,
they're not going to be, they'll just drop the ball.
Insert tab A into slot B.
If they even had one to be in there.

That's a little bit too much.
That's a little pornographic thing to do.





If they're that kind of language, I'm sorry.
And we may . . .
You still say in different languages . . .
But then again, what we error by definition is not obscenity.
Those are the kind of instructions that people don't really . . .
That's a little bit too much, too much verbiage for people to go with.
Products are sold to be used by trial and error.
Anything to avoid reading the instructions.
I have, that's one of my pet peeves.
I have a thing about that.
To read . . .
You got pet peeves?
. . .
You have to tune the plate to remove settings.
Place aside.
I just talk of inserting tabs.
My goodness, can't you just clean this right up?
See, they're thinking, there's something dirty about reading instructions.
You have to be shown how to do things by somebody else.
Lift protective plate and set aside to dry.
Reading the instructions, that's cheating.
Right.
Now, unscrew the detonator cap slowly and carefully without touching the edges.
Reading the instructions is for people who don't have a computer.









You should now be looking at the impacted mass of the plastic explosive.
Once you have a college degree, that means you should already know everything and you
really don't need to, you know.
The wire leading away from you is the lead wire.
The yellow wire leading out of the tube is the ground wire.
Oh my God, I can't remember.
Is it supposed to be the ground wire?




















The green wire or the black wire?
Take it easy, Sarge.
We'll get it figured out.
Hey, look.
You're packing.
You're protected.
There's nothing unless it's got more than three kilotons.
We're fine.
Just keep poking around until you find it.
Yeah, yeah.
One more poke.
No, stop moving your hips that way.
You're making me nervous.
No, they're looking at us now.
All right, call this off.
We got to get out of here.
Stang was trying to hump the bomb.
I am unscrewing the butt plate.
Why?
Oh, water.
Someone set us up the bomb.
Why?
Oh, water.
I'm trying to get out of here.

I have a question.
Why did the husband get out of jail so quickly?
And why was he in jail to begin with?
Not the husband, the sperm donor.
He was in jail for drunk driving on a school day and injuring people and fleeing the scene
and wrecking property and lying to the judges.
Not being a good citizen.
Right.
But he was out after a month probably because...
Yeah.
Well, he's a good old boy.
Right.
He was a good old boy.
He was a good Christian boy.
He said a lot many, many times over and over again.
Christianity is the last refuge of the scoundrel.
Cultists are going to tell them what to do.
I've learned that the biological husband had been sending rants, written rants that
he composed to the judge informing him that myself and Bevilacqua were part of the mass





of the Jewish community.

I've learned that the Jewish community is a Masonic, Satanic Jewish conspiracy.
As you know, we have good old solid Jewish names.
Bevilacqua and Smith.
That's my slave name.
Agent Smith.
Yeah, it's funny.
Wait, people who were named Smith are really Jewish?
My God, the conspiracy goes farther than I thought.
No, people were named Smith or Agent from the Matrix.
We're going to take the name X.
What we have learned from studying crackpotism, especially on alt.slack is that the name







X is a Masonic, Satanic Jewish conspiracy, including Communist China.
Yes.
That's an entirely Masonic plot.
Communism was invented by Jews.
A Jewish fellow came up with the idea and wrote it out.
Named Mao Tse-Tung-Ski.
Right, right, yeah.
But where did it leave Jack P. Chick?
He said that the K-12 was the only way to get out of communism.









The Catholics have a secret file on the Protestants.
Well, it's true.
The Catholics...
Well, the Catholic Church is a Jewish plot.
Yeah, you know, St. Peter, man, he was...
Everything.
I'm telling you, everything proves that everything is a Jewish plot if you're of that ilk of
scientists that studies history on the Internet.
Study.
Do your homework.
My God, I just realized something.
It all makes sense now.
Jesus was Jewish.
Christianity is a Jewish...
Right!
Duh!
Oh, yeah.
That's what they tell you right after Mass when they're delivering the sermon.
They say, don't forget Jesus' family.
But they never mention him personally because apparently he's one of those guys who didn't
have a family.
He was a rambling man.
That ain't true.
My favorite recent Jewish conspiracy theory is that Hinduism is in fact a Jewish plot.
Yes.
And I'm not...
By the way, I'm not making a funny joke.
This cow's not kosher.
We can't kill it.
No, we can't kill any cows.
No.
No, that doesn't make sense.
Hold on just a minute.
Something's happened.
Good morning.
I don't know.
We can't find out.
Good morning.
We just got here.
We haven't woken up yet.
This is terrible.
I wish we could just go back to the way it was only a minute ago.
Can we just be placing the carpet in there?
Oh, if only I hadn't voted for the president.
If only I had voted for some other president.
This might have happened a minute later instead of a minute before.
Or to some other generation.
Yeah, well, not us.
Not me.
Not me.
Not you.
Not you.








Not you, Jane.
Not me.
No, it wasn't my fault, they all said, as they fell in the middle of the...
Not you, Jane.
Not you.
...to Adam.
...to Adam.
...to Adam.
Stop it.
I can only tell you...

...the sound of the next one.
Oh, right.
Okay.
Just give me another cup of rubber cement and I'll get started here on the 18th floor.
This time you promised, you promised I could have...
A check.
...a chapter.
Oh, a chapter.
Right.
I'm sorry.
A chapter.
Not a check.
A chapter.
Yeah.
Thank you.
Now, if you don't have any money, it makes the church stop.
Hi, this is the sperms.
Don't worry about us, there are billions and billions of us and we'll bury you.
Those were the subgenius sperms.
Those are the happy little ones that stay alive even though they're in the sea.
They're doing their little rifle exercises.
These guys are motivated.
All those were spurious sperms.
You could call them spermatozoon fatuus or fatuus.
You could, but it takes too long to say that.
It's really hard to say that.






When we have to call up the sperm reserves, we have to get them out there right away.
We can't have long names and long-winded stuffed shirt titles.
Okay, okay.
Our first song tonight is called Poster of Dobbs.
It's a song we wrote when we were on vacation in Jamaica.
And Paul's going to sing this one for you.
I am not.
Well, okay, that's all.
I want time and a half.
It's the middle of the night, in case you haven't noticed.
Time and a half.
And travel time.
No, for anti-musicians, it's only like 10.30 in the morning.
Well, I'm trying to emerge from a cocoon of nearing social morgues.
Ah, yes, yes.
Aren't we all?
Well, that's good.
But I wanted to come and talk about it with you.
Because you're doctors.
Well, just sit down right here and open up your very soul and every other barrier.
I didn't realize that I had a problem with the first step to solving it.
And then someone told me about you, and so here I am.
I'm going to climb down inside the show here.
But wait, I...
What are you going to do?
Hey, wait.
How?
Hey, Gary.
But you're a doctor, too.
I think I see a checkup in here.
Okay, well, just try to...
Take these forceps and see if you can pull them out of the body.
Here we go.
Watch these.
Watch these guys.
Okay.
Disgusting.
Wait, there's no signature on this check.
We just killed another innocent...
I wonder about where medical science is leading to.
And you're about to ask these guys for advice.
Let him go now.
Drop it.
Drop it on the floor now.
Drop the weapon.
Sorry?
What do you want?
I just want my phone call.
What?
What?
What's happening?
Guys, the way you guys go on...
I don't know what to think.
What has made us...
Radio?
...but still fly.
What do you mean?
You didn't turn yours on, I think.
In fact, ask your nearest doctor.
Turned on?
Today.
No, I...
Individually.
This shows...
This shows, like, what they...
You know, it's the opposite of a turn-on.
Oh, that's why you're listening.
Hello?
Hello?
We're not being heard.
We're holding this position until dawn.
That's one of the most obscene and consorted...
I mean, contorted positions I've ever seen, Jerry, but...
Hey!
Hey.
...at least yesterday, we're looking for an ambulance.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
Let's try again.
What do you have?
If you hang up on me again, your body will self-perpetuate in shopping malls forever and ever.
We are isolated from your curses.
Yeah, that's right.
Look at her.
She's crawling around inside the show.
But they've done a wonderful job.
It looks like...
Drag it over here.
It looks like it's dead.
But the blood in his eyes is colliding in here.
Push the face with a sort of a smile.
Put some headphones on it.
I've heard enough.
Yes.
Surge is an alert.
Oh, and we start the war over again.
Okay, we'd like to go slow motion over these frames.
Look at those beautiful explosions.
They cover immediately.
As we talk about once again, the slow motion reap reaction.
Now, what we'd like to see...
Don't look at the slow motion flash or you'll go blind in slow motion.
...of origin of projectile somewhere in Central Bolivia, South America.
This is not...
The St. Jesus Church recommends that you always wear an eye patch so that just in case,
you're going to die.

You are looking in the direction of the flash.
Only one eye.
Where will I go?
Only one eye.
One eye.
Say one eye.
Oh, come on.
Stop all this.
Stop the doctors.
Yes, and too many doctors.
Constantly here.
At this hour.
As we stand up and hear it.
Watch the last of the so genius troops fighting against the puzzling evidence forces in the desert.
And back there you can see puzzling evidence.
I'm John here.
Command center.
Puzzling evidence forces are about a mile from your house.
Might as well just give up.
Let's see what Sandy tried to get through.
It's a sniper.
Who's that sniper?
Is that Hagen?
No.
It's Buck.
I'm just going to have to insert into the record here that in 1980, the tomb of the Jesus family was unearthed.
The DNA of Jesus, Magdalene, his father Joseph, and the son of Jesus and Magdalene, who isn't in the Bible, named Judah, were all found in their family tomb.
Although it was sealed recently by the state of Israel.
Although it was kind of a hoax.
No, it was not a hoax.
No, it was not.
It was a hoax.
It was a hoax.
It was a hoax.









It was turning out that they were not in the material world.
They were going to be buried in osmanthus �ardia.
That's
somehow

.
I was
.
That's
oldest Christian writings
were the epistles,
which were written shortly after
the events supposedly occurred. But in the case
of the Gospels, you're talking about 50 to 100
years between the times the events
supposedly happened and the times that they were actually written.
Well, I'm talking about the archaeological
excavation in the year 1980 that
you should really look into.
A free inquiry and the
Center for Science in the Public
Interest signed off on this, and it's apparently
archaeologically genuine.
Genuine. A lot of people
want to believe it's genuine, but...
They are humanists and atheists.
Well, that's right,
because it kind of shoots down the whole...
Jesus is responsible
for killing the dinosaurs, because
it was the meat-eaters,
like the Tyrannosaurus Rex, that were
going to threaten the humans.
So Jesus came down, and he
rode them like
when he wore a cowboy hat.
And he was saying,
Giddy-up, Mohandas! And the T-Rex was like,
Grrr!
Grrr! I can see it now.
Jurassic Park.
A young world.
You know, I've actually heard that the last of the dinosaurs
were hunted to extinction by cowboys.
Early in the morning of time.
Imagine a giant dinosaur
with a crown of thorns.
Well, if you want to believe the evidence
in Beast of Hollow Mountain or
the Valley of Gwangi, you've got your
cowboys chasing your...
Now, did you know that Hollywood
someone in Hollywood just recently announced
they're producing a movie called
Cowboys vs. Aliens.
And yet, if you've read your
Bobliographon, you'll find that
J.R. Bob Dobbs produced a movie
in the 50s called
Cowboys and Indians vs. Aliens.
The whole plot is
described in the sub-G's book
which was released three or four years ago.
Now...
Wait, what?
I heard that that was already a plot that's coming out
and Johnny Depp's going to be in that movie.
It's...
Duck and cover! Duck and cover!
Put your head...
Oh no!
Out of the blue of the western sky,
Sky King.
And his lovely confidant,
Penny, wearing very little,
if anything at all.
Imagine it in the sky.
Creatures that sit
and wait.
And man.
Superior to the creatures
only in his cunning.
There are not many men yet.
Just a few tribes
scattered across
the face of the wilderness.
But one of them has
Raquel Welch in it.
This is Jack Hobah,
leader of the Rock and Roll
tribe.
His home was a cave
in the mountains.
Knowing only
a crude staff which responded
to brute force.
Life walked
hand in hand with death.
Then there was a movie
that had...
The guy's name was Tumek,
the Tumescent or something like that.
Tumid, we called him.
Oh, that feels great.
Ah.
That feels wonderful.
There's a small plane
flying around my head.
He blacked me a jam, man.
He blacked me a jam, man.
He ain't got no jam, jam, man.
He ain't got no jam, jam, man.
He blacked me a jam, man.
He blacked me a jam, man.
Yes, that's very nice.
We'll let you know.
I hate you.
I'm sorry.
You have a story.
A small plane flying around your head
counterclockwise.
You're not like Elaine.
I hate you.
Yeah, I hate you.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Yeah.
I don't know.
We're out here
on the city street, folks.
Oh, excuse me.
That gentleman looks like you.
Sir, can I just talk to you
for just a minute?
Sir?
I guess he was in a hurry.
Did you say excuse me?
Oh, excuse me.
I'm sorry.
I've seen your email before
and I'm enjoying your post.
I'm always allowing to choose
Don't you remember me?
I've met my life.
I have.
Yeah.
So you canbok yo
on my side,
like this.
And honestly,
And with the news, oh my god
She was of overtime, sometimes it's working to
Get, get, and we date
And they're
News
The world of science
Well, that was all good fun, and we all had a jolly good laugh
Now, for the software
It's an utterly familiar feeling
To look back on the way one was behaving
A year, a month, or an hour ago
And to be amazed
One's personality is always changing
And one is always
Learning new things and forgetting old ones
There's also the
Extreme example of
Brainwashing
We are inclined to say that a person's essential
Actions
Identity is unchanged
Even if he has been given a completely
False set of memories
The curious thing is that
You must express your individual consciousness
In the same words that I use
I am
I am me
I exist
The philosopher Hegel
Was very struck by this fact
And deemed it an instance
Of the divine nature
Of language
What a conclusion
Might one draw from
The fact that your essential consciousness
And my essential consciousness
Are expressed in the same words
We can go far from this
The essence of consciousness
Is really nothing more than simple existence
I am
Why should the possession of this sort of consciousness
Be denied to anything that does exist?
Aquinas has said that God is pure existence
Unmodified
Is it not evidence that there is a
Certain single something
Call it God or the...
You are not
Alright, let's take this point
Let's back up
Aquinas has said, Governor
That God is pure existence
Unmodified
No, no, no, no, no
Pure existence
I don't know what that means
Is pure existence
That doesn't mean anything
That's pepperoni
That's saying pepperoni
Is not sausage
Well, to exist is to have consciousness
The other things one might feel
Are necessary for consciousness
No pattern can be conscious
Until it exists
Until it is brought into reality
No, no, no, what does that mean?
Existence is primal
Only
Well, existence primally
Is the only thing
That will be required for consciousness
A rock is conscious
A piece of paper is conscious
And a horse is a robot
Before, both, after
And after his behavior
Evolved to our mind
What does that mean?
A robot's going to be able to think
The way we think
It ain't never going to be able to think
Mankind will never be able to produce
Anything equivalent to mankind itself
The cellular structure alone, man
There's no way we could ever
Recreate any of that, Jack
Now we can...
We can imitate
We can imitate, right?
We can imitate with little machines
And so forth
I am truly amazed
I don't know how to do this
I don't know how to do this
Buttocks
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no , novi
No...
Feli...

Can you Stat Auburn here?
Ah...

And that piece was called
I Exist, and is by the
great Reverend Phineas Narcissus,
co of National Cynical
Radio, available at
nationalcynical.com
Phineas
puts out amazing
podcasts, which
any Hour of Slack pod
cats and kitties would dig, baby.
And this Hour of Slack
number 1186
is the first
one to have only one
credits break. Everything you've heard so far
was from pretty much only three
sources. One is
Radio Synesthesia, Dr. Sinister's
show on WCSB Cleveland,
and his guests that July 6th
were Dr. Howell, Lonesome Cowboy
Dave, Governor Rocknar, No Money
Mark, and yours truly, Reverend Stang.
Another source was the old
Puzzling Evidence show, I mean
really old, from like
1982 or 1983
on KPFA Berkeley, when the
show hosts were Puzzling Evidence
Dr. Howell, Gary Dubrogfrand, and
Palmer Vreedies.
They were all baby
kids, you know,
and they were all
just like, you know,

And the other source was the
Subgenius Devival sermon at the
2008 Starwood Festival.
The scenic amino acids
will be here tomorrow night!
And we're in the background
for these credits. Fernanda Nanny
Leigh Murd did the titles and the
last two cuts that you'll hear
at the end of the show.
This overweening
show itself is the Hour
of Slack from the Church of the
Subgenius, headquartered here at
Subgenius Foundation.
Here at
the Slacker Mansion
in Cleveland, which also
produces books and videos and so on.
All of our shows and related
shows are archived and
can be accessed through

And now this.
Little doctors were spoiling around the room
using pounds of irradiated air.
You'll be dead in only twenty seconds.
Don't let it upset you, little doctor.
But the ear is really,
just really messed up still.
Yeah, can't you do something?
It doesn't look a bit like it did when it was alive.
I told you to use the size 5.
If you'd used the size 5,
it would all be fine right now.
Jerry was stupid enough to drink coffee
and now he's off on his own show.
Not paying attention to the cues.
You were a subgenius.
You two would have to get up at 4.30
and go to some other radio station
and stop this show by being on that show.
When they show that movie,
I'm just gonna go down on my shoulder.
Yeah, good idea.
Because the TV bombers will be over us
in less than ten minutes.
And the TV missiles will start taking off
from the inside of everybody's couches
and the little TV missiles will start
flying out of the refrigerator.
There'll be little TV missiles landing everywhere.
No, no, no.
This is a tape.
Oh, my God.
YouTube caller on the midnight flight.
It's a saving the subgenius forces
out in the desert.
Yeah, I'm not on the show anymore.
I'm home asleep.
This is wonderful.
I hate being on the radio.
I'm asleep right now in my bed.
I'm warm and everything's nice.
And I won't have to get up for another
18 and a half hours.
Oh, look out. My bed's on fire.
That's all right. There he goes.
We'll take that Doug away and put in the new Doug here.
Press the Doug button and start him up.
I don't know.
Look at his face.
I've seen that. I've seen that face
somewhere before.
It was on some horrible radio show
in the 1980s.
Wow, can you feel that?
It feels like they're shooting little things right through you.
Somehow or the other I feel my forehead.
There's a hole in my forehead.
You're on the air.
You're on the air.
And you know your Bible correctly.
Jesus was Samaritan, now he was
Samaritan Israel.
Israeli.
Samaritan Israel.
The world can be brought down into two groups
of people.
Those who divide the world into two kinds of people
and those who find such activities fun.
Jesus was Samaritan, Israelite.
Actually, there are ten kinds of people
in the world. Those who understand binary numbers
and those who don't.
And if you know your New Testament,
it also says that Pete's salvation
comes from the Jewish theology.
Okay, so...
And this is his brother,
Sarcana.
Lord Gitchenwell,
Lady Bathrobe,
and other esteemed members
of this colonial panel,
we've noticed
over the last few four years
that there are
numerous of these
bob heads
in the caves
and we're hoping to make friends
with at least an alliance
with the Pumitos tribe
to make sure that we can
get our goodies and screw
them in the good old British way.
Somebody open
a window.
I'm sorry, I'm fledgling this afternoon.
The Oolongs
are off and so am I.
I'm off. Goodbye.
There is no
love lost between them
and that is our
story.
I thought you were kind of a sweet
British babe.
Yeah, I just want to comment that
during the Pax Romana,
Jesus is mentioned more times
than Julius David and the
Roman Empire. When were those things written?
27 B.C. to 180 A.D.
The Pax Romana,
that book there? No, Pax Romana
is a term for the time
when the Roman Empire was at its
peak there and then things seemed like they were all right.
When they imposed what they called
a Roman peace. Right, a Roman peace.
They made a desert and called it peace.
Now what is the context in which
those things were mentioned? Where did
those writings come from? First in the
Annals of Tacitus and then in the
writings of Flavius Josephus.
Did Tacitus, where did he get his
information from? He was a
chronicler of Roman history. Did he say,
oh, I was here and saw this guy here? Or did he say,
oh, people are talking about this guy? He talked about a
disagreeable group known as the Christians
who were followed, the followers
of a man allegedly named Jesus
who was crucified in the reign of
Tiberius. The Romans crucified a lot of people.
They sure did.
Just look at the Servile War. They
crucified him for miles. In fact, there were a lot of people
around that time walking around claiming to be
a messianic figure because
it was a very distressing time
for the
people of Judea there,
having been recently colonized by these
pagans. I'm just saying he had a lot of followers
and a lot of people and he caused a lot of
What about Spartacus?
But there are no contemporary
writings of
people actually saying like,
oh yeah, there's this guy and he's doing this.
He's a poor bozo, a carpenter,
he's not going to get writings written about him.
I tend
to lean in the direction that
there was no actual individual person
who
did any of the things that were, you know,
I mean, it's pretty well documented
that there were
a lot of people back then who made similar
claims, who were
preaching similar ideas, but I mean, the fact that you
don't have a single... They don't have a single... That's what they said then.
They don't have a single... The fact that they don't have a single
contemporary account. You know, there are
contemporary accounts of Julius Caesar.
I mean, Julius Caesar wrote a book himself
for the conquest of
Gaul there, you know?
Well, much in the life of Jesus
is very suspect. For example, there was no
order by...
King Herod
did not order the firstborn
all to be slain, then there should
certainly be a record of that.
Something so overwhelming.
But at any rate, it does make a good
story, doesn't it? That's the important thing.
That's really all that counts.
It's a blend of many oriental
tales. That's another great question. Does it even
really matter if such a person
actually existed? I mean, if
you say then, yes, it's absolutely a very important
thing, then that's clearly
a religious position.
Think of what... And what does this
mean about J.R. Bob Dogg? It doesn't actually...
Whether or not such a person actually did exist,
I mean, it wouldn't go... It's a
cobbling of many religious traditions
of the Middle Orient. It wouldn't take us any further in the direction of explaining
historical record. Nothing would make any more sense.
The Mithraic traditions, the Druidic traditions
are even represented, and certainly Greek
Hellenism is represented because, you know,
how could Virgin Mary be a Virgin Mary
if you... Because a bunch of Hellenistic
guys always said so. I'll have a bloody
Mary. How do we know that...
She's not ovulating, so you better not.
I'm gonna have to wait a little while. Then the slaughter
of the innocents actually took
place, and was otherwise called
the subgenius hour of
slap.
Next week,
The Hill of Foreskins.
Yeah, actually, there are...
I have heard about it. I have heard about non-surgical
techniques for foreskin restoration.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I've recently
heard about this. People feel
cheated sometimes. They hang little
lead-whites and fishhooks off. You're gonna believe
everything you read. Trying to stretch
it out there.
Ah, charnelation. And so the
Lord tried to stretch it out. He knew
he was not born of
the flesh, but still he was
kind of hoping for something more than
what his dad gave him.
And so he tied a little
brick to the end of it, and decided to
walk around the Judean hillside,
errantly taking on snapshots
in his mind of the sheep's breeding. Well, the bottom line is,
Jesus has a nice nightclub now in
some little town in Georgia, and so
good luck. That's the Republic
of Georgia and the former Soviet Union. And what a
brick he was.
Yeah, yeah. It's in the
suburb of Tbilisi.
Sorry, you could have done more than listen to me.
But I'm gonna go to the radio, but now it's too late.
Now you only have a minute left.
It will seem like hours, but it lasts forever.
The lull show will flash before your ears.
The lull show will flash before your ears.
There is so-
Don't listen too closely
or you'll go deaf.
Jerry of the circus.
Well, I...
Well, I...
Oh, Jerry.
Gee whiz.
Here he comes now.
I'll say.
Oh.
Oh, Jerry.
Now for Jerry of the circus.
Jumping Jupiter. Does that mean
they'll have to shoot him? They usually do,
just that. Yeah?
It'll do them good.
Seems to me they should have shot him anyhow.
Seems to me they should have shot him anyhow.
You bet.
Now the prosecutor lifts his hand again

so Dory can see the object he's holding.

And...
Dorothy, do you know what this is I'm holding up to you?
Yes. You aren't looking closely enough.
No. Yes, Dorothy.
Uh-huh. Yes, Mr. Abt. No.
Objection.
The state contends that this subject is
layman-kid-ar-istic-ism-an. And I'm
healthy. For two reasons.
One, the
is there. What's he saying?
Two, Mrs. Grant was
whom she told my husband part of
that love was slipping away
from her. Slipping away from her too.
That's right. I'm going to tell the jury
what the truth is.
Miss Avery, she was
afraid of her. That's all about it.
Oh. Oh. That's right.
for a head of a candidate.
You didn't understand a lot of what I just
said. Amazing is
isn't it? Yes. Oh, yes.
Amazing.
He said it. Goodbye.
