1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Uh, well, we're still at the X-Day Drill.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:09,020
We decided not to leave.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,900
Your brother's proposal states

4
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:20,140
I'm coming with advanced knowledge

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,260
to help human race!

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,760
Bob will save all true believers, though, in 1998, right?

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,200
Actually, Bob, you better hope that Bob does some wheeling and dealing

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,900
for your soul come 1998.

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,020
He is the salesman of the universe here to make sure that Earth

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,940
and your soul does not get sold to the robot mutilators.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,300
At least for not too low a price.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,440
So you better read that book with all three eyes

13
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:58,240
or however many you have left.

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,940
And, uh...

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,820
Leave the driving to Bob.

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,820
That's right. You do the walking, let Bob do the talking.

17
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:07,580
Who are these men from Planet X, children?

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,620
What is waiting there for me?

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,080
Bob.

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,600
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,020
Hour of Slack

22
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:29,800
sponsored by

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,560
the Church of the Subgenius.

24
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:33,480
I love you.

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,560
I love you.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:34,560


27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,420
Friend, the Elder Gods have been sleeping,

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,320
but they're waking up.

29
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,560
And you gotta find that word of Bob before it's too late.

30
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,520
Before 1998, July 5th, the end of the world,

31
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,260
the end of time as we know it.

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:48,280
When the very, the very...

33
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,220
The score is racked up.

34
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,480
The score is racked up, and it's the time of the halftime.

35
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,080
Yes, sir.

36
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,700
We just won't have a chance.

37
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,400
They'll be able to have their ways with us.

38
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,980
You've heard about the smallpox blankets in the Indianapolis?

39
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


40
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


41
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


42
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:01,460
The Indians, you know, well, this is gonna be

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,500
technological viral infectational of an entire planet

44
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,260
with means of doing things, and means of destruction,

45
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,260
means of alteration of genetic patterns,

46
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,380
means of controlling people's minds that we don't even,

47
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,420
to us it's magic.

48
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,860
Any significantly advanced form of science becomes magic.

49
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,240
If that smoke comes out of Bob's pipe no more,

50
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,560
then we shall be reduced to that can of warm beer

51
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:29,960
under the bed of a hungover elder god at 1130 on a Sunday morning.

52
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


53
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


54
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


55
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


56
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:29,960


57
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:34,180
Bob is here to make sure that instead of it being the end of the world,

58
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,600
it's the end of their world, and the new...

59
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:37,960
Oh, yeah.

60
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:39,020
New Jerusalem.

61
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,460
New Jerusalem where slack begins.

62
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,580
Yes, the streets will be paved with slack.

63
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:48,300
Slack will drop gently from the sky.

64
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,000
Slack will ooze out of the pores of the faithful.

65
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,500
The tribulation money will fall from the flying saucers.

66
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:58,760
Yes, we'll all be floating around with those little green rays coming out of our feet.

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,560
That's why we...

68
00:02:59,560 --> 00:02:59,840
We...

69
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:00,580
We have slack.

70
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,220
That's why we tell the public to throw their money away.

71
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,100
It's no good.

72
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,060
It's going to be...

73
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,800
Currency is just going to be flying down from flying saucers in a few years anyway.

74
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,300
Or give it to Bob.

75
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,700
Or give it to Bob.

76
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,260
You give it to Bob while it's still good.

77
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,040
You cash in that money while it's still good.

78
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,780
Because they're going to be...

79
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,420
See, people are just going to be bringing all their money to Bob

80
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,400
when the end of the world is upon us.

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,240
It's going to be too late because money won't be worth anything.

82
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,960
When those tribulation times come down, that subgenius pamphlet,

83
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,200
especially if you've got a white copy.

84
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,080
Now, if you've got a white copy and a brown copy, it's a little bit of difference,

85
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,640
but they're both worth more

86
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,100
than a bundle of thousand dollar treasury bills a foot high.

87
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,940
There will be people trading paragraphs of that pamphlet

88
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:39,520
for boxcars full of food.

89
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,280
You think it will replace currency.

90
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,420
Bob will replace drugs, religion, rock music, and everything

91
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:54,060
in a great paradise of unrestrained sales, unrestrained slack and sex.

92
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:56,180
And if you have any drug users in your audience,

93
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,620
we should note that the book of the subgenius we found in a book

94
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:00,300
that was conducted in Austin recently,

95
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,360
that if adulterated street drugs are thrown on top of the cover,

96
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,880
all of the non-narcotic qualities are completely erased

97
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,560
and indicated as negative and destroyed.

98
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:16,980
All impurities are removed, giving you that 1% of pure that you paid for

99
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,980
out of whatever it was that you...

100
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,780
By the way...

101
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,180
That's better than pyramid power.

102
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,800
Yes, much better than pyramid power.

103
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,580
I'd like to say those...

104
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:25,420
Because it's in a plane rather than going to a point.

105
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,060
Book of the subgenius. That's it.

106
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,260
Book of the subgenius.

107
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,840
Book of the subgenius...

108
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,640
The man becomes a fellow everyone knows.

109
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:34,720
Bob.

110
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:35,480
Bob!

111
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:37,040
Bob.

112
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,240
Yes, Bob?

113
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,760
Say, man, that is one strange dude.

114
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,220
That's Bob.

115
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,460
One strange dude.

116
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,820
I think Bob is just the guy with the pipe.

117
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,260
Oh, that's crazy talk.

118
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:55,440
But friends, you know our critics have some people worrying now and then

119
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,500
that the church might become corrupt.

120
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,920
The Church of the Subgenius might become corrupted by the conspiracy,

121
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,840
and there'd have to be a replacement for it.

122
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:12,460
Friends, I tell you, we don't have to worry about that.

123
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:17,540
Because the true Church, the true Church of the Subgenius is going to be up in the saucers.

124
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:25,140
The pinks won't have to worry about even seeing the subgeniuses again.

125
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:29,280
There'll be all kinds of cheap cults and spin-offs left behind,

126
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:35,980
just like the cargo cults among the last mutated remnants of humanity.

127
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,220
And also there'll be subgeniuses left behind,

128
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:46,740
the subgeniuses who didn't think they really needed that $20 membership card.

129
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,320
Did we just have a power failure?

130
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,220
I believe we did.

131
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,440
Yeah, those who...

132
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,920
Yeah.

133
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,120
Yeah, those who, as I was saying,

134
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:03,740
excuse me, friends, we're having serious, strange poltergeist effects in here as the lights flicker on and off.

135
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,440
Yeah, anyway, there'll be some subgeniuses left behind,

136
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,020
the ones who didn't think they needed that $20 membership card,

137
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,720
the ones who tattooed Bob's face all over their whole bodies,

138
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,900
the ones who put, they might have put Bob on national TV,

139
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,100
or they might have donated their whole estate to us, but they never sent.

140
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,220
They never sent their $20.

141
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:33,560
Now, it might be confusing a bit to those left behind after the rupture,

142
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,420
because the rupture happens for different people in different ways.

143
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,460
A lot of subgeniuses, when they undergo the rupture,

144
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,920
watch, the people standing around and back on Earth,

145
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,360
it looks like a burning monk or spontaneous combustion.

146
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,940
They just burst into flames and scream and scream.

147
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:54,020
It's the most horrible.

148
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,560
It's the most horrible, painful-looking thing in the world.

149
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,540
But of course, that, friends, that's just the image.

150
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:02,820
That's just sort of the hologram, the body being left behind, just the shell.

151
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,400
Because on next day, when you are ruptured, no matter how it looks, you know,

152
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:16,160
your youthful, perfect body is being recreated on the vessels of the sex goddesses,

153
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,300
and a thousand clones of kitten on TV dot are gonna...

154
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:21,840
Well, I...

155
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,080
Friends, when you're ruptured, you're not going to be able to see the world.

156
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:24,140
There's no way you're going to see the world.

157
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:24,140


158
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,560
And you're going to see the world when you get on that escape vessel.

159
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:35,320
Every person you ever had a crush on since elementary school is going to be there ready to have sex with you.

160
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,660
Either that or else, simulacra of those people.

161
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:44,900
It might as well be the same, because the sex goddesses you see can change their form completely and totally.

162
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,100
First, you'll...

163
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,720
They'll be the...

164
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:52,320
Say, the girl you had a crush on in first grade,

165
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,080
well, now she's at a point, you know, she's at a point, you know, she's at a point of death,

166
00:07:54,080 --> 00:08:00,160
perfect she's perfect and healthy at age 25 of course you know and but and when when she leaves

167
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:06,280
why in walks the girl you had a crush on in second grade or um or here's that that boy you had a

168
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:13,000
crush on when you were 13 and he almost kissed you but now he's gonna do it and he's still wearing

169
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:19,120
the same clothes that he did at the prom or that milkman or babysitter that you lusted after they'll

170
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:26,040
all be there the sex goddesses tap your mind it's not really people it's part of the the womb

171
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:35,860
system the a biomorphic toy that conforms to the fleshly configurations to satisfy any kind of lust

172
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:41,360
you might have and they can pre-guess what you're about to think friends they can sense a desire

173
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,180
percolating up in your mind and just for instance just a few seconds before you you think of it

174
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,600
that zap

175
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,320
comic that you always wanted to read a second time what just happens to be over there in the pile

176
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:02,060
and you and you look back and you think man this is this is great if only i had a frock stick

177
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:08,460
well here's a frock stick because mom and the biomorphs and the sex goddesses can anticipate

178
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:15,960
your every wish they can whiff a desire coming on and you'll think now if i could just um meet up

179
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:19,100
with that that haughty librarian at that one college and i could just meet up with that

180
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,800
haughty librarian at that one college i went to while i'm reading this comic and sure enough

181
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:27,880
and she comes through the door well if only she'd dance you think oh if only she had a small whip

182
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:34,280
and it happens as you think about it there's no limit no limit at all and the old if only she'd

183
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:41,220
give me a ham sandwich first oh yes now i'm and you'll sit there and think to yourself

184
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:48,300
you know i can't believe there was a time when i wondered if it was worth the 20 bucks

185
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:54,500
you're sitting there eating the hell out of that ham sandwich getting a scarf job from that

186
00:09:54,500 --> 00:10:02,360
biomorph watching widescreen color tv elvis movies and thinking how could i ever have wondered how

187
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,780

189
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:19,080

191
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:33,760

192
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,300
church well the tv on the escape vessel in front of you lights up and there's this shot of bubba

193
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:47,260
down there eating a rotten rat and hiding from the death machines that the rogue pinks made from

194
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,840
the stolen womb of

195
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:55,040
hearts and he'll bub bubble be down there muttering to himself how could i do it i was so stupid i

00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,580

i'd give him 40 dollars i'd give you everything i own bob please

201
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:32,200
well friends that just shows how much they trusted bob they did they didn't trust bob

202
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:40,500
dobbs didn't trust him 20 dollars worth okay fine fine no skin off our teeth pay lip service wear

203
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:48,460
that bob t-shirt be real hip but when those saucers come well you're either on the bus or

204
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,080
you're off the bus you're on the bus you're on the bus you're on the bus you're on the bus you're

205
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:56,080
off the bus you're up the bus as those great proto sub geni used to say and the dumbest nerd could

206
00:11:56,080 --> 00:12:00,900
get on the bus for 20 bucks well actually those 20 dollars don't count their souls go into the

207
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:06,900
cylinders that we trade for but they should be proud that their souls such as they are at least

208
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:13,040
made it possible for their betters to ride the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

209
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:19,000
and there'll be an orientation film that they'll show you when you're ruptured up you

210
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:22,320
because otherwise it might be kind of confusing.

211
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:26,600
This orientation film is kind of projected into your head.

212
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:30,420
It's introduced by Princess We Are Doe,

213
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,700
queen of all the UFOs,

214
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,000
who's sort of this half-naked Flash Gordon

215
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,580
slash Viking Brunhilde

216
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:40,800
with metal pointed breastplates

217
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,720
and a horned helmet

218
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,600
and all this UFO insignia or anything.

219
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:48,060
And she is the mistress of the path of least resistance.

220
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,480
And she narrates this film.

221
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:50,100
And it's like,

222
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,080
you will hear and obey.

223
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,200
Take off your clothes.

224
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:59,920
And you can either watch the orientation film

225
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,780
or you can watch the live broadcast of X-Day.

226
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:11,180
Or you can just go back to having your fun

227
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,040
with the different simulacra

228
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,220
and sex goddesses and so forth.

229
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,000
And actually,

230
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:18,420
now, of course,

231
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,360
your sweetheart's going to be doing the same thing too.

232
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,800
But because it's on those spaceships

233
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,900
inside the escape vessels,

234
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:31,800
there's no time and no sense of jealousy.

235
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,240
You'll always...

236
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:38,440
It's like there's no sense of possessiveness

237
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:43,240
because in that no zone of the saucers,

238
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,960
time ceases to exist,

239
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,220
or at least it feels that way.

240
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:47,980
And you don't need to be grasped.

241
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,500
You don't need to be gripping anymore like you did on Earth.

242
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:54,140
The overwhelming feeling that you get on the escape vessels is like,

243
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:58,540
wow, the best part is it lasts as long as I want it to.

244
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,000
And I can take forever.

245
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,740
I'm immortal for now.

246
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,380
And I don't have the urge to grab this and keep it

247
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,000
so I can run somewhere else to grab some other thing.

248
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,240
I don't have to kill or defeat another monkey man

249
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,540
to hang on to these big round soft things.

250
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,580
I'll have plenty of time to get...

251
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,240
to those other big soft round things.

252
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,040
More than I could ever use.

253
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,760
My pipe overfloweth.

254
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,780
And the big round soft things

255
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:31,180
shall follow me through the land of Dobbs

256
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,160
and I will dwell in the cliff in between forever.

257
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,860
It's like, oh, how were your multiple partners today, dear?

258
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,440
Oh, big and round and soft.

259
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:46,040
Ah, yes.

260
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:46,920
And there's...

261
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,020
People ask so many questions.

262
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:49,600
I say, well,

263
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:54,260
well, Reverend Stang, is there just one giant saucer

264
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,000
or is it a bunch of regional saucers, you know,

265
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,200
like an East Coast saucer and a West Coast saucer?

266
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,940
No, there's a million kinds of saucers, friends,

267
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,640
but it's like virtual reality.

268
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,200
Once you're inside one of them, you might as well be in all of them.

269
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,620
You might as well be on Planet X.

270
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,300
You're not in normal space.

271
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,540
You can sort of phase to the other saucers

272
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,280
or find your friends telepathically.

273
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:21,000
You can go, oh, I think I'll go to the Chinese saucer today

274
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,760
or I'll go to the gay and lesbian saucer.

275
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,280
Gee, I always wanted to try being a lesbian female.

276
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:29,980
But meanwhile, those who are left behind,

277
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,620
which is 99% of the population

278
00:15:32,620 --> 00:15:35,560
and probably 90% of the subgeniuses,

279
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:39,900
all those who didn't sin, they're $20.

280
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,660
They'll miss out on next day.

281
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,560
You know, come to think of it, I never sinned.

282
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,920
Technically, I mean, I've spent a lot of my own money on the church,

283
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,340
sent my $20 in for a membership.

284
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,760
Dr. Drummond never did.

285
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,220
Palmer Vredes never did.

286
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,780
Puzzling Evidence never did.

287
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,980
Sterno never did.

288
00:15:57,200 --> 00:16:00,500
And, you know, friends, it won't matter what you did for Bob.

289
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:06,680
What will matter is whether you sent that for that membership card.

290
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,140
I guess I'm going to have to get around to that.

291
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,680
Well, I've got plenty of time, plenty of time until next day.

292
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,880
Oh, hell, that's 1998.

293
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,520
We've got all the time in the world.

294
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:17,280
There will be one big escape.

295
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:17,900
There will be one big escape.

296
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:17,900


297
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,600
Just for the doctors, for the hierarchy.

298
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,880
And I can just see Byron and Gordon and some of those other people up there going,

299
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,620
Hey, you know, we ought to go down and save Ivan and Philo

300
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,060
and all those who never got around to sending the $20.

301
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,420
And then they'll go, well, we'll get around to it.

302
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:46,320
We're not sure where the escape vessels of the sex goddesses go, dear friends.

303
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,560
We're not sure.

304
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,640
As far as I can tell, they probably just fly around.

305
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:50,480
But I'm going to go.

306
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,940
I'm going to get off of this for right now.

307
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,780
We'll go to an old hymn.

308
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,580
This is a lovely old subject.

309
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,740
And I do mean old.

310
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,720
This is like from 1981.

311
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:02,780
Old subgenius hymn by someone we only know as Doug number four.

312
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,340
Oh, yes.

313
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:07,780
Oh, yes.

314
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,040
Oh, yes.

315
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:13,220
Oh, yes.

316
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,300
Oh, yes.

317
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,180
Oh, yes.

318
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,460
Oh, yes.

319
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:17,520


320
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:17,520


321
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:17,520


322
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:17,520


323
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:17,520


324
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:17,520


325
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:24,100
We won't die in a hole we hold and drown the bank boys and the normals

326
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:31,140
If we have to, if we have to, fucking make them die

327
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:39,140
And we'll all come back old women, we'll all come back old women

328
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:47,020
And we'll all come back old women, all of the reason why

329
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,140
Where's my royalties?

330
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,140
Where's my royalties?

331
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:39,120
Where's my royalties?

332
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:39,620
Where's my royalties?

333
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,020
214 is what I'll be telling you

334
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:17,220
But, ah, X-Day, you know on X-Day, for those down below on Earth

335
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:22,200
You know, it'll be a little different than it would be up in the escape vessels of the sex goddesses

336
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,820
They'll look up, trying to put, while they're trying to put their clothes out

337
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:34,060
There'll be this huge eyeball in the sky, this giant pyramid-shaped light form

338
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,820
With a big eye that just covers the whole sky

339
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,480
And it's filming for the escape vessel screens

340
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,980
Ah yes, when we can watch what's going on down there

341
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,860
We can watch any part of it we want

342
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:50,280
And we can also leave messages

343
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:55,860
Because the big eye projects sort of billboards, holographic billboards

344
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:59,060
From horizon to horizon that say things like

345
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,640
Smile, you know, welcome to your stupid life

346
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:07,800
You're being seen live on the escape vessels of the sex goddess screens

347
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,120
And it's filming for the escape vessel screens

348
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:12,740
Where the subgeniuses are now partying, you dumb idiots

349
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,680
I mean, a big billboard stretching all across the planet

350
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:21,860
In all languages saying, fools, we're having a great time

351
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:26,000
And the subgeniuses can take turns broadcasting personal statements

352
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:32,100
So, you know, this horrible pink evil person will be down there

353
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:34,280
Fighting the Robeast

354
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:37,880
And suddenly this voice will ring out

355
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,420
Hey, Mrs. Darden, I was in your 1959 fifth grade class

356
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:46,500
Remember me? Steve Wilcox, ha ha, I'm up here, you're down there

357
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:51,100
Or, uh, like, Pain Radio, coming to you, Mr. Shaughnessy, the principal

358
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,760
Remember when you expelled me? How do you like the pain, huh?

359
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,540
And, uh, you know, you get back at anybody

360
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:00,440
Oh, you laughed at me in junior high, Max

361
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,040
You put me upside down into a trash can

362
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:07,760
You and your jock friends, you aren't laughing quite so hard now, are you?

363
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:13,640
And there'll be little holographic ghost-like things

364
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,120
Green slime-type ghost sort of things

365
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:20,880
Millions of little 3D Jane-ers flying around, taunting

366
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,280
And saying, you should've spent your twenty dollars

367
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,640
Should've spent your twenty dollars, oh, friends

368
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:29,700
Friends, oh, praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob

369
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,600
It's gonna be so, but you know, and so we find

370
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,480
That the world isn't really to be destroyed

371
00:22:36,520 --> 00:22:37,740
It's that the human race is to be destroyed

372
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,200
And the humans, it, what happens is

373
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,560
The humans are given all this alien technology

374
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:43,560
And they screw everything up

375
00:22:44,380 --> 00:22:47,160
They've got a miracle machine there, this WOM thing

376
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,480
That could do anything they want

377
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,520
But nobody pays any attention to it at first

378
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,860
Because, uh, they don't know what its capabilities are

379
00:22:54,860 --> 00:22:58,000
And it's real cautious about revealing itself too fast

380
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:02,960
And they don't know that this fungus that's growing around them

381
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,260
Could fulfill their wildest desires

382
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,360
Because they don't believe it can

383
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,760
Because they don't have any wild desires

384
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:13,580
Because they didn't think to ask

385
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,200
And people will be down there in the ruins

386
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,620
Begging us with their last potato

387
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:22,840
To preach and deliver unto them the word of Dobbs

388
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,840
Because it's the only thing that'll save them

389
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:30,160
Subgenius artifacts, like old copies of the book of the subgenius

390
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:33,700
Or illegal bootleg tapes of this radio show

391
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,880
Original pamphlet number ones

392
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,220
Even an old Dobbs head!

393
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:40,600
It'll be worth a boxcar full of canned peaches, friends

394
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,020
Because the luck shell

395
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:46,680
The luck shell that we've always claimed was around our various products

396
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,340
That you thought we were only kidding about

397
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,040
And that's real

398
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,360
And it will become visible on X day

399
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,740
A glow that's visible even in daylight

400
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:59,360
Any given page of the printed word of Bob

401
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,220
Will be not only of practical use as lamps in the dark

402
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,840
But more importantly, they'll be unthinkably valuable

403
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,840
Religious treasures, dear friends

404
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:11,760
The most valuable things on the whole planet

405
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,600
Because you're safer if you have that

406
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,480
If you've got a copy of this show with you

407
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,160
It tips your luck playing

408
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:21,000
It helps a whole lot against radiation

409
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:24,380
And landslides and brain worms

410
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,400
And noise demons and nerve runners and all that

411
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,700
It isn't nearly like having a membership card

412
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,380
But it's a lot better than having nothing

413
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,780
Because friends, your faith

414
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,160
Your faith in Bob will be all you have left on that day

415
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,280
And he'll know whether you believed in him

416
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:43,780
Wotan will know

417
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:45,860
And he will come

418
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:48,980
He will come to judge

419
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:54,340
Gentlemen, the situation at this time is so serious

420
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,260
That it's the worst in human history

421
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:58,800
The fate of the entire Earth is in our hands

422
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:00,320
Every hour we are getting news

423
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,280
That our factories and our refineries and schools

424
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,660
Are being attacked with rays of an unknown origin

425
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,800
They haven't been analyzed so far

426
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:10,360
Thousands of people are dead

427
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,820
The attacks are not coming from outer space

428
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:13,640
Our scientists say

429
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:14,980
And certain monsters have been seen

430
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,560
That appear to come from before the ice age

431
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:17,820
Long before the history of mankind

432
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,780
They have to be stopped

433
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,540
Professor, I know you've been in this book line study

434
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,480
For many years

435
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:24,780
You know more about them than we do

436
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:26,540
Tell us, what should we do?

437
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:30,500
Hmm, don't go up there at night

438
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:32,620
Stay in the sunlight

439
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:35,720
Keep yourself safe

440
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,440
And secure

441
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,580
And in the daylight

442
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,560
We'll draw you out of there

443
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,740
You've got to use all your power

444
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,220
To knock them out

445
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,560
All your power, believe me

446
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:46,800
Laser guns?

447
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,120
Laser guns

448
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,800
Not only laser guns

449
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,620
But your crew

450
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,620
Get them up there and knock them out

451
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:55,720
And when you knock them out

452
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,900
We're going to have trouble with the launch pad

453
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,900
Well, the launch will be alright

454
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,460
As soon as I can get there

455
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:04,780
We know

456
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,800
We've been behind it for years

457
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,760
It's been my research staff

458
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,260
That came up with the initial evidence

459
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,740
Dr. Moore

460
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,700
Can your staff come up with a weapon

461
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,420
To stop the Nazi hell creatures in time?

462
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,000
I can't say for sure

463
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:23,940
But with luck

464
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,940
The zoological

465
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:30,000
Provide us with the answers

466
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:31,280
A man

467
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,080
Is he a captain?

468
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,800
What is he?

469
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,520
And

470
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,460
He's

471
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,020
Looking at me

472
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,420
And I say

473
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:44,740
No

474
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:47,060
I have to shake my head

475
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:49,200
This isn't true

476
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,280
This can't be true

477
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:51,320
And

478
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:53,380
Still there

479
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,500
And

480
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:56,320
I look up and down the road

481
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,640
And I think

482
00:26:57,640 --> 00:26:59,740
Can't somebody come along

483
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:01,160
And tell me that

484
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,800
This isn't there

485
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,660
But it's there

486
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,700
And I think

487
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:05,700


488
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:05,700


489
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:07,860
I don't know

490
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:07,860


491
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:09,280
Why

492
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,500
What do they want?

493
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:11,800
What do they want?

494
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,720
Is the UFO mystery

495
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,300
Truly a scientific watergate?

496
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,540
An incredible and dangerous coverup?

497
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,500
Understanding of the UFO

498
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,720
May be beyond our science

499
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:27,200
And political system

500
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,040
Twisted them to fit the Nazi ideology

501
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,020
Thank you

502
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,040
And Bob, by the way

503
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:34,380
Is running for big brother

504
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:36,380
Or universal overlord

505
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:37,980
Or county clerk

506
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,360
In 1984

507
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,620
Yeah, that's right

508
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,300
He knows he's not gonna win

509
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,200
Big brother

510
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,780
It's just to plant the seeds

511
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,240
In the minds of the people

512
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:47,860
Bob either wants to be

513
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:50,300
A county clerk

514
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,320
Or a

515
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,640
Over god of all reality

516
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,380
In 1984

517
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,060
As Alistair Crowley once said

518
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,200
If I can't be god

519
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,140
I'm not gonna play

520
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:04,020
This ain't no video game church

521
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:04,360
This ain't no video game church

522
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:05,400
This ain't no church of bingo

523
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,740
It's a church of Bob

524
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,520
It's a Bob Rogers church

525
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,700
I don't see what the hell's going on here

526
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,460
What the hell

527
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,600
Did you know that heaven

528
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,980
Christian heaven is hotter than the Christian hell?

529
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:15,580
Yes

530
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,200
The Christian heaven is hotter

531
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,100
That's because

532
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:18,460
There are seven suns

533
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:18,460


534
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:19,880
And the subgenius hell is fine

535
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,400
Oh yeah

536
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,920
All your friends will be down there

537
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,460
Mr. Chairman

538
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,440
Gentlemen

539
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,580
I must admit

540
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:29,160
I know very little at this time

541
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,800
The princess is a creature

542
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,360
Of antiquity

543
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,340
Ten million years old

544
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,340


545
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,340


546
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,340


547
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,340


548
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,340


549
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,340


550
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:34,340


551
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:36,980
And the monsters

552
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:38,460
Are mutants of creatures

553
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,220
That roamed the earth

554
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,280
Before the ice age

555
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,460
It is likely that a super race of humans

556
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:44,160
Existed sometime in the past also

557
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,680
And somehow all of them

558
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,560
Humans and creatures

559
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,680
Went into hibernation far underground

560
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,900
Where they survived

561
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:51,860
They are intelligent

562
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,540
They are smarter than the most up to date

563
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,140
Super computers

564
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,480
We cannot underestimate them

565
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,120
They're not emotional

566
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,740
Angels don't have any emotion

567
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:02,020
These sinister euphonauts

568
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,320
They're not human

569
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,320


570
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,320


571
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,320


572
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:04,720
They're all creatures

573
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,640
From the unholy reaches of the universe

574
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:10,520
And traversing this great cosmos around us

575
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,400
Made a stop one day

576
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,920
On this planet of ours

577
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,500
Thousands upon thousands of years ago

578
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:25,200
Made a stop to allow their

579
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:28,460
Their house pets

580
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:32,020
The leisure of relieving themselves

581
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:33,700
Outside of the spacecraft

582
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:40,020
Certainly a few of these animals of amusement

583
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:44,280
Managed to break away from their masters

584
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:47,900
And somehow managed to survive on this planet

585
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,020
If this is so

586
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,680
Evidence of them must exist somewhere

587
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,900
I believe that evidence

588
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,780
Has already been uncovered

589
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:02,300
And widely publicized of these animals

590
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:04,300
The animals we see

591
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:04,300


592
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,260
Were probably the Yeti

593
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:09,100
The Yeti's crossbred with human beings

594
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,160
And the human beings as a result of that

595
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,060
Are

596
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,000
Basically the subgenius

597
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,020
Has the biological heritage

598
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,360
Of the Yatinsin

599
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,120
Or the Yeti

600
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,720
Basically out of the mountains of China

601
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:22,600
Although there's a few

602
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,260
That live in the mountains of California

603
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,000
They seem to be a mountain

604
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,400
Mountain forest people

605
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
That are

606
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,660
Well they're hairy only in their

607
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:32,600
Most pure state

608
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,300
But in sort of a

609
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,360
Mongrelized Yatinsin such as myself

610
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:39,580
Only certain parts sprout hair

611
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:41,700
However I have hair in unusual patches

612
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,280
Of my body

613
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:43,840
Which is why I wear overalls

614
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:44,660
Well

615
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:48,620
Know thee that thy little lands

616
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:50,840
Are hollow and empty inside

617
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,220
And inside dwell demons

618
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:55,500
Who move faster than thy light

619
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,160
And speak faster than thy air carries sound

620
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:01,140
And which wield the secret tools

621
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,940
And angles of the sciences

622
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,280
Which I have foreseen

623
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:04,960
And which have forbidden thee

624
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,040
And these demons come among thy leaders

625
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,720
All swathed in black and tempt them

626
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:13,720
If the right people aren't there to meet

627
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:16,160
The men from planet X

628
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,840
The X's we call them men

629
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,020
Sure they look like men

630
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,020
They can look like rocks

631
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:22,100
They can look like eight tentacled

632
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,700
Thirty foot tall monsters

633
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:26,880
Whatever is the requirement of the human

634
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:31,300
That they're possessing or talking to

635
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,780
1998's gonna get here

636
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:33,720
We'll all wake up

637
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,260
July 4th 7 o'clock in the morning

638
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,660
Or July 5th pardon me

639
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,020
July 5th 7 o'clock in the morning

640
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:41,200
Hangovers from the 4th of July

641
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,400
And uh

642
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,820
Nothing will ever be the same again

643
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:49,260
The planet will no longer belong

644
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,700
To the humans or the subgeniuses

645
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:54,520
And that is why it is so crucial

646
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,060
That the subgeniuses be in those positions of power

647
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:58,480
Be at the coordinates

648
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,360
The landing strips

649
00:31:59,360 --> 00:31:59,980
When those

650
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:02,780
That angelic host does descend

651
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,140
When the second third and fourth comings occur

652
00:32:06,140 --> 00:32:07,000
During this period

653
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:07,500
We

654
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:07,980
I

655
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,060
I

656
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:12,400
I

657
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:13,740
I

658
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,120
I

659
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,120


660
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,120


661
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,060
I know

662
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,440
That you

663
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,280
Understand

664
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:22,460
I know that you understand

665
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:26,280
And I know that you'll be with us on that day

666
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,420
That fateful day

667
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,360
X day

668
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,000
1998

669
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,180
Bob will be on television

670
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,220
He'll talk to us

671
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:32,760
He'll give us some information

672
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:32,760


673
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:32,760


674
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:32,760


675
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:32,760


676
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:32,760


677
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:32,760


678
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:32,760


679
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,020
He'll give us some speech

680
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,340
That will move billions

681
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,000
Not millions

682
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,320
But billions to tears

683
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,140
And it'll work out okay

684
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,420
The world will end just right

685
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,840
And keep going

686
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,880
In the new way

687
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,060
The way of Bob

688
00:32:44,060 --> 00:32:45,780
Everyone will be subgeniuses

689
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,420
Except us

690
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:49,540
You mentioned that uh

691
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:50,200
Uh

692
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,020
The uh

693
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:56,820
Advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures

694
00:32:56,820 --> 00:32:59,000
From inside the hollow earth

695
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,660
Are conspiring to take over the whole planet

696
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,220
That's right

697
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:03,980
We read about that in a pamphlet

698
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:05,080
That was handed to us

699
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:05,260
Do a lot of people really

700
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:05,740
Oh you did

701
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,380
Uh huh

702
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:07,920
And Bob confirmed it

703
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,700
And there's only

704
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,660
There's only one

705
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,200
Uh

706
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:14,780
Only one organization that could possibly stop them

707
00:33:14,780 --> 00:33:16,500
They're the men from Planet X

708
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,080
And they'll be arriving in 1998

709
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,200
And after

710
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,840
After the tribulation money starts to fall

711
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:22,680
From the chariots

712
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,020
And the

713
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,560
The angels in the sky

714
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:24,940
And

715
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,540
And coming up out of the ground

716
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:28,100
And spewing out of the back of

717
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,180
Them car exhaust pipes

718
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,440
And just magic everywhere

719
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,200
And then

720
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,660
And then tribulation times will be

721
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:34,660
Tearing those

722
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:35,120
Those

723
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:38,520
Those bad evil demonic people up

724
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:38,940
And they'll be

725
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,900
The sub

726
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,200
Subgenius people

727
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,260
Will be

728
00:33:42,260 --> 00:33:43,920
I think we should bring up

729
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,560
That is Hitler's Gem

730
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,380
Waiting for the UFO

731
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,540
Uh huh

732
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,180
Waiting for the UFO

733
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,500
Uh huh

734
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:56,120
Waiting for the UFO

735
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:59,640
Waiting for the UFO

736
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:00,040
Waiting for the UFO

737
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,200
Waiting for the UFO

738
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:02,160
Waiting for the UFO

739
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,820
Waiting for the UFO

740
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,720
Waiting for the UFO

741
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:04,720


742
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:07,940
Will the

743
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:08,720
Will the

744
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,420
Will the

745
00:34:10,420 --> 00:34:11,440
Will the

746
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,360
Will the

747
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:24,220
Will the

748
00:34:24,220 --> 00:34:32,180
Another movie that's swept America is one entitled The Encounters of the Third Degree.

749
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,360
May I tell you this?

750
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,060
I'm not so sure what UFOs are.

751
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,260
I don't know if I believe them or not.

752
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:47,320
The New Zealand Air Force was on alert recently because of the UFOs appearing over that nation.

753
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,740
Someone said, do you believe in flying saucers?

754
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,440
I said, of course.

755
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,140
I'm a married man.

756
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,760
If you don't get that now, you may in the morning over the breakfast table.

757
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,200
You say, what about UFOs?

758
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:04,540
I don't want to delve into that, but I want to give you something that blesses my heart.

759
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:07,840
I know there is life in the universe.

760
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,360
Why?

761
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:14,620
Because evil spirits, demonic spirits, fill the universe.

762
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,620
The cult is full of superstition and mysticism.

763
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,340
We're scientists.

764
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:23,940
Laser beams shaped like vampires with glow-in-the-dark brains.

765
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,860
I've seen a vision, ma'am.

766
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,640
So play your cards right.

767
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,120
Yes, all you deaf ears down there.

768
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,100
Heads up.

769
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,900
Look out below.

770
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:48,180
There will be plenty of distractions to take their minds off the real problem as the time of P draws to its violent close.

771
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,740
For instance, beware.

772
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:53,020
The fake God Jr., the anti-Bob, will come before long.

773
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,200
Bullets cannot stop.

774
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:59,920
He's one of the deceptively human-looking advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures from beneath the hollow earth.

775
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,460
Parasites of the elder gods.

776
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,500
But most people will think he's the second coming.

777
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:11,040
And his alien hiney will be kissed all the way to world dictatorship and beyond.

778
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:20,520
And if the true Messiah were to show up at that time, everyone would just know with the bottom of their core programming that he's the Antichrist.

779
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,580
Because he'll curse and spit.

780
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,640
And take the Lord's name in vain.

781
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:28,520
And hang out with whores and bull-digers and dope addicts and cops.

782
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,060
Another down-home sort.

783
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,000
This is a warning.

784
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
Danger, danger, you poor devils.

785
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:35,740
Things are more mixed up than you ever dreamed.

786
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,820
What was up is down.

787
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,240
The priorities are all screwy.

788
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:47,020
You're fretting if your hair looks okay while some new kind of bladder cancer is bursting out the front of your designer jeans.

789
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:48,840
Yes, this is bad talk.

790
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,000
Nobody will listen to anything else.

791
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:55,520
You won't look at TV unless body parts or cars are jiggling or crashing on it.

792
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,480
You won't taste your food unless it has some nerve drug in it.

793
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:02,600
You haven't used your other senses since you were five.

794
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:12,960
And you sure as hell won't stop what you're doing until someone much bigger, much stronger, and much, much more self-assured makes you stop.

795
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,040
And you'll thank him for it.

796
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:19,280
And then just before you fry in a flash of radioactive hindsight,

797
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,980
you'll realize that he's the Antichrist.

798
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,320
He stopped you from doing the wrong thing.

799
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:29,420
Good God, what in the name of sweet screaming Jesus is this world coming to?

800
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:31,960
People bitch, people gripe.

801
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,780
This is a sign of the end times.

802
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,460
That's a sign of the end times.

803
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,180
When you should all be hollering, it's all a sign of the end times.

804
00:37:40,660 --> 00:37:47,540
What, brothers and sisters, will happen to this heretic on July 5th, 1998?

805
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,980
Would anyone like to take a guess what's going to happen?

806
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,660
What's going to happen to this heretic when the saucers come?

807
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:59,560
He will be on the escape vessels on July 5th, 1998.

808
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:07,860
He will be on those saucers with the sex goddesses because he paid his $30 subgenius membership fee.

809
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,740
He had his membership card in the church.

810
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,120
And even if you were to go out today and turn your back on Bob's Gets,

811
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,100
have you ever heard any of this?

812
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,300
Even if you were to go out tomorrow and get a job,

813
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,860
maybe even as president of the United States or a cop somewhere ripping apart people's cars searching for dope,

814
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:31,180
you would still be able to get on the pleasure saucers as long as you had that subgenius membership card,

815
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,900
as long as you paid for that subgenius membership card.

816
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:38,220
Can you say the same?

817
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:42,140
Can you say that you're going to be on those escape vessels on July 5th?

818
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:45,740
Do you think you're going to squeak by just because you're cool?

819
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:50,560
Do you think coolness is going to get you on to those space vessels?

820
00:38:51,080 --> 00:39:01,460
Well, what are you going to do on X day when suddenly all your paid in full subgenius buddies disappear?

821
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:09,940
Many people would say, well, I'm not going to join up with the church of the subgenius.

822
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:14,640
The church of the subgenius is an organization of non-joiners.

823
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,720
So I'm not going to join up with them.

824
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:18,440
Well, I've got a surprise for you folks.

825
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,520
You're not going to be joining us on X day either.

826
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:26,500
And X day, you have no idea what's awaiting you all on X day.

827
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:39,460
True slack is like better than getting gang sucked by a horde of horny, buxom, Nordic Valkyries

828
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:44,280
while eating a big juicy T-bone steak.

829
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,900
On your birthday.

830
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:55,760
But X day, X day makes slack seem like you're wearing a helmet with a padlocked chin strap.

831
00:39:58,100 --> 00:39:58,760
That's right.

832
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:04,160
By comparison, X day is going to make any slack you have seem like nothing.

833
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,280
Now, you might think, well, I'm not going to spend any money on this church of the subgenius.

834
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,040
I'm not going to spend any money on this.

835
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:15,600
I've got better things to do with my $30.

836
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:20,380
I can go out and buy a Hootie and the Blowfish CD or something with that money.

837
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:28,480
And I can sit at home and I can listen to my Hootie and the Blowfish CD over and over and over again.

838
00:40:29,620 --> 00:40:36,060
And I can sit back and just jam and have me a good time listening to my CD player.

839
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,520
Because you like music so much.

840
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,540
Well, on X day,

841
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,420
that CD player is going to melt into a pile of slag.

842
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,220
That's right.

843
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:56,440
All your cheap pink entertainment devices are going to be destroyed in the fires of the X-est invasion.

844
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,500
There will be no music then.

845
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:07,340
The only music there will be, will be the screams of the dying.

846
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,520
You may not like the sound of this type of music.

847
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:18,760
But we subgeniuses will damn well be dancing to the tune.

848
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,180
So what can you do?

849
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,800
You can join up with the church of the subgenius.

850
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,620
Or you'll be singing in the choir.

851
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,940
That's right brothers and sisters.

852
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,620
You'll be singing along with all that screaming and pain.

853
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,900
And all that horrible moaning and wailing.

854
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,500
And praying.

855
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,700
You know, when I was in Chicago last night,

856
00:41:47,740 --> 00:41:51,900
I was down in the dressing room getting ready to go up here and preach to the folks out there.

857
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,180
And a cockroach was crawling across the table.

858
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:59,420
And I took out my ink pen and I was kind of poking it along.

859
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:04,320
And it'd run and go across the table and I'd reach over and poke it the other way.

860
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,180
And I'd watch it run.

861
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,920
And I'd sit there and watch the little things that got so frustrated.

862
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,560
And then I took out my cigarette lighter.

863
00:42:13,180 --> 00:42:15,740
And I started singeing around his antennas.

864
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:21,340
And then I reached around behind him and started burning off his wings.

865
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,480
And he flipped over and his little legs were kicking and screaming.

866
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,360
And flying around in the air.

867
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,860
On next day, if you don't have a membership card,

868
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,920
you're gonna pray.

869
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,600
You're gonna wish.

870
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,920
You're gonna wish that you were that cockroach.

871
00:42:39,300 --> 00:42:39,900
That's what I'm saying.

872
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:39,960
That's right.

873
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:42,140
You'll wish you were that cockroach on next day.

874
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:45,380
You'll wish that you could just be tortured for a little while.

875
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:52,000
And then put out of your misery in a burst of flame by some sadistic subgenius preacher.

876
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:54,640
But we're not gonna make it that easy on you.

877
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:56,680
No.

878
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:01,760
Brothers and sisters, the river is rising.

879
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:03,880
And you're gonna drown.

880
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:08,240
Tonight, I am offering you

881
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,460
a personal flotation device

882
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,320
to keep your head above this rising river.

883
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:17,700
I'm offering you a personal flotation device

884
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:21,240
in the form of this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

885
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,940
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

886
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:31,100
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

887
00:43:31,220 --> 00:43:34,620
It is no accident that you are all here.

888
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,720
You all have been

889
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:38,980
chosen

890
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,220
to receive this message.

891
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,960
You have been chosen

892
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,300
because the water's rising up

893
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,900
and it's just about to rise over your heads.

894
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,580
And we're gonna throw you this flotation device

895
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:53,260
and you can either grab onto it and live

896
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:55,520
or you can pass it on by

897
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,040
and you're gonna go down

898
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,260
like yesterday's sh**

899
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,820
swirling down the toilet.

900
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:04,960
It's no accident.

901
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,220
You must join the Church of the Savior.

902
00:44:08,220 --> 00:44:09,180
You can either be a subgenius or die.

903
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:11,780
You'll be damn glad

904
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,780
that you joined.

905
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,680
You will be damn glad

906
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,780
that you spent that pitiful $30.

907
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:21,540
I really don't want to see all of you die.

908
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,920
Some of you I do.

909
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:27,520
But I don't want to see all of you die.

910
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,320
We are here to help you.

911
00:44:31,780 --> 00:44:33,360
We are your friends.

912
00:44:35,780 --> 00:44:37,440
You must know,

913
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:38,740
can't you feel

914
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:40,540
by looking at this man Bob

915
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:43,280
how much he loves you?

916
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:46,620
Don't you realize how much Bob loves you?

917
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:48,420
He loves you so much

918
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,440
that he's willing to offer you

919
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:54,220
a chance to have your every perverse desire

920
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,300
be brought to life.

921
00:44:56,740 --> 00:45:00,320
Your every sick sexual fantasy

922
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:03,200
shall be made flesh before you.

923
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,140
Trust us.

924
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:09,440
Trust Bob.

925
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,420
Amen.

926
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:17,080
Maybe some of you still aren't willing to accept Bob into your lives.

927
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,460
Perhaps you need some proof.

928
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:20,360
Perhaps,

929
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:22,840
perhaps Bob,

930
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:27,200
perhaps my main man, J.R. Bob Dobbs here

931
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,600
will give me the power,

932
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,180
the power to heal some lucky man.

933
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:36,720
Is there anybody here

934
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,840
that needs to be healed

935
00:45:38,840 --> 00:45:41,020
of some horrible sickness?

936
00:45:42,720 --> 00:45:45,580
Oh, wait, we have a man here waving his hands.

937
00:45:45,840 --> 00:45:47,140
Come on up here, brother.

938
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:47,980
Come on up here.

939
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,580
Come on up here, brother.

940
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:53,420
Let me help you.

941
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,540
Good evening, brother.

942
00:45:55,860 --> 00:45:56,580
What's your name?

943
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,820
My name is Aaron.

944
00:45:58,260 --> 00:45:58,700
Aaron.

945
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:00,840
And, and,

946
00:46:02,420 --> 00:46:03,160
what brother do you want to be?

947
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:03,160


948
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:03,240
I want to be a man.

949
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,200
What brought you here tonight, Eric?

950
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,880
What brought you here tonight?

951
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:08,080
My crippled right leg.

952
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:10,820
Your crippled right leg brought you here tonight.

953
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:12,820
Well, Bob,

954
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:14,900
Bob's going to give me the power

955
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,740
to heal you of your maladies.

956
00:46:17,220 --> 00:46:20,700
Bob's telling me that you have a problem in your leg.

957
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,840
Bob's telling me you have a tumor in your leg

958
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,080
that you need healed.

959
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:26,640
Is this true?

960
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,640
And, and, and Bob told me that

961
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:32,220
you had a terrible heart condition, brother.

962
00:46:33,160 --> 00:46:33,180
Is this true?

963
00:46:34,820 --> 00:46:35,560
It's true?

964
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:40,480
And, and Bob tells me that you have bursitis in your shoulder.

965
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,140
Is, am I right?

966
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,220
Have you got bursitis in your shoulder?

967
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:47,680
He has bursitis in his shoulder.

968
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,040
He has many maladies.

969
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,940
But Bob is also telling me that you've been having problems with your liver.

970
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:53,540
Is that true?

971
00:46:54,540 --> 00:46:57,640
And that you've been having a problem with sexual dysfunction.

972
00:46:57,980 --> 00:46:58,720
Is that true?

973
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,360
Yes.

974
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:02,800
It's true.

975
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,020
And that you've been suffering from an obstruction.

976
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,260
Is it true that you're having some problem with your bowels?

977
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,460
Yes. Yes.

978
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,340
And Bob also told me that you have a problem with really bad acne on your ass.

979
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,280
Is it true?

980
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:21,200
It's all over. It's, it's sad.

981
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:24,660
And, and, and that all the, all the women call you Pizza Butt.

982
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,480
Is that true?

983
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:27,180
What women?

984
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:29,920
That's so sad.

985
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,420
A man with sexual dysfunction

986
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,900
and a Pizza Butt who can't get a woman.

987
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:38,760
Bob is saying that you need to be healed of these maladies.

988
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:41,840
Bob is saying that you've had a problem with your throat too.

989
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,340
And your ears.

990
00:47:44,100 --> 00:47:47,080
And, and, and the glands in your armpits.

991
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,520
And, and, and your left index finger.

992
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:52,160
And, and, and your right middle finger.

993
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,940
The one that keeps getting stiff every time a police car goes by.

994
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:55,940
Is this true brother?

995
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,260
This is the truth.

996
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,120
Well brother, tonight we're gonna heal you.

997
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,440
We're gonna heal you brother.

998
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,780
Oh yes.

999
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:08,360
Brother Bevilacqua is gonna come up here to help me out.

1000
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,100
And with his healing.

1001
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,120
Sometimes the power gets in me and it's so strong.

1002
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,040
That I burn out the wires and actually accidentally kill the person I'm trying to heal.

1003
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,960
But brother, we're gonna heal you or kill you.

1004
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,880
We're gonna take care of your leg.

1005
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,400
We're gonna take care of your arm.

1006
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:25,240
We're gonna take care of your brain tumor.

1007
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:30,020
We're gonna take care of your, your sorry little limp and your packed up butt hole.

1008
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,100
We're gonna take care of your arm.

1009
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:32,780
We're gonna take care of your angina pectoris.

1010
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,700
We're gonna take care of your swollen glands.

1011
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,560
We're gonna take care of that middle finger that sticks up on your right hand whenever a policeman comes by.

1012
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,520
And make it so the middle finger on your left hand gets stiff when policemen go by too.

1013
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:47,480
Brother, I'm gonna lay my hands on you and heal you.

1014
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:49,920
Beheal!

1015
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,840
Oh my god!

1016
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:52,600
Woo!

1017
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:57,880
Woo brothers, he isn't gonna be needing this anymore.

1018
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,040
Yee-haw!

1019
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,660
Come on up brother, come on up.

1020
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,000
How are you feeling now?

1021
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,360
How are you feeling now?

1022
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,100
I'm feeling amazing.

1023
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:15,440
Now go on out and find yourself a woman in this crowd and see if you can make your, your dysfunctional organs work.

1024
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,300
But I've got total faith that Bob is gonna do this for you.

1025
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:23,740
I've got total faith that Bob is gonna do this for you.

1026
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:25,640
Yes brothers and sisters.

1027
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,900
You can, you've seen the miracle.

1028
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:29,380
You've seen the miracles tonight.

1029
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:33,000
You've seen the healings and the inflictions of pain.

1030
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:37,660
I see my brother here is actually over here carousing with a woman now.

1031
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,080
Who's not looking at him as if he were a disgusting squid.

1032
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:44,080
Oh look at that, he's getting some action.

1033
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:50,060
And Bob promises all of you all the action you'll ever need.

1034
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,540
All the action you'll ever want.

1035
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,080
And more.

1036
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,260
Two and a half feet long.

1037
00:49:58,260 --> 00:49:59,420
Solid aluminum.

1038
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,260
The orifices are gonna be stretching.

1039
00:50:07,360 --> 00:50:09,560
The heads are gonna be collapsing.

1040
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,040
And brothers and sisters.

1041
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,020
I'm not gonna use any lubricant.

1042
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:19,680
Oh yes.

1043
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:25,020
I have but one thing left to say to you all.

1044
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:28,240
The supermarket is closed.

1045
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,100
The market has run out of food.

1046
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:33,420
The highway out of town is jammed up.

1047
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:34,500
Gridlock.

1048
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:36,820
The doctor's dead.

1049
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,100
There's a meteor heading for your town.

1050
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:48,540
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is sitting at the wheel of the last train out of town.

1051
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,900
Brothers, sisters.

1052
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,160
You gotta get on that train.

1053
00:50:55,160 --> 00:50:58,160
Because when you come right down to it.

1054
00:50:58,720 --> 00:51:01,500
You either gotta ride that train.

1055
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:05,920
Or you're gonna get tied to the tracks.

1056
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:07,580
Remember.

1057
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,600
It is far better to be a speeding car.

1058
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:18,460
Than it is to be a blind man crossing against the light.

1059
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,140
Amen brothers.

1060
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:25,760
Brothers and sisters.

1061
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:26,520
Can I get an amen?

1062
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:27,400
Amen.

1063
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,400
Can I get a hallelujah?

1064
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:30,340
Hallelujah.

1065
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,940
What do you all want tonight brothers and sisters?

1066
00:51:34,340 --> 00:51:34,740
Fire.

1067
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:36,880
What do you want?

1068
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:37,840
Fire.

1069
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:39,500
Brothers and sisters.

1070
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,760
I need you to say it again.

1071
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,200
But I need you to say it loud enough.

1072
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,080
That the exes that are on their way here.

1073
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:46,500
Will hear you.

1074
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:49,000
And they're gonna crank up the radio.

1075
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,680
And roll down the windows on their spaceship.

1076
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,140
And they're gonna light up a big fat-frop station.

1077
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:55,780
And they're gonna stick and smile.

1078
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:57,980
And they're gonna be coming down.

1079
00:51:58,540 --> 00:52:00,880
And you gotta let them know that you're all waiting for them.

1080
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:03,400
So what is it that you want brothers and sisters?

1081
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:08,000
Yes brothers and sisters.

1082
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:08,500
Slack.

1083
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,700
Oh yes.

1084
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:12,120
And who is gonna give you this slack?

1085
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,920
Brothers and sisters.

1086
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,820
The train's leaving.

1087
00:52:18,060 --> 00:52:21,540
And a lot of you guys are on the right track.

1088
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,820
Praise Bob.

1089
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,060
Praise Bob.

1090
00:52:25,140 --> 00:52:25,960
Praise Bob.

1091
00:52:26,180 --> 00:52:27,600
Thank you very much.

1092
00:52:37,100 --> 00:52:41,280
You're listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack.

1093
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:45,520
For free information on Bob Dobbs and the church of the subgenius.

1094
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,080
Send a self addressed stamped envelope to.

1095
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,280
Got your pencil ready?

1096
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,160
Bob post office box one four O.

1097
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,060
Sky Sawyer, Dallas, Texas, seven five.

1098
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1099
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1100
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1101
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1102
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1103
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1104
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1105
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1106
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1107
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1108
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1109
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1110
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1111
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1112
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1113
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1114
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1115
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1116
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1117
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1118
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,120


1119
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:03,300
That's Bob, P.O. Box 140, Sky Sawyer, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1120
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,300
Stay tuned and praise Bob.

1121
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:15,040
You hand them that pamphlet, oh, friends, the scales fall from their eyes.

1122
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,140
But you know, when those pink boys discover Bob, it's either truth or death.

1123
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,140
For the love of Bob can kill normals, friends, yes?

1124
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:25,220
Yes, but Bob's men are moving on this planet.

1125
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:35,120
Oh, that planetary alignment that came up, the Jupiter effect, oh, I'm now sure that may have caused earthquakes and volcanoes and the Earth to tilt on its axis.

1126
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:41,080
And men will, in the end times to come, men will gnash their brains and think backwards.

1127
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:46,960
Dead Christians will come up from their graves shambling and rotting like not of the living dead.

1128
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:51,520
But through it all, helping to profit from it all is that one mighty link.

1129
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,280
Between heaven and earth, that Bob.

1130
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:54,440
Oh, yeah, I can see it now.

1131
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:56,480
The miracle of the Bob world is unfolding.

1132
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,840
They're wading up to their knees in blood, dear friends.

1133
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:04,860
But it's the blood of the baptism of a mighty fist face of Bob.

1134
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:14,900
That face that can pile through eight-foot-thick titanium steel conspiracy fork-knock stores with that mighty pipe.

1135
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:16,960
Oh, he ain't from another planet.

1136
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:19,940
He ain't something we have to bow down and kiss to.

1137
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:20,640
He's a man.

1138
00:54:20,640 --> 00:54:25,020
Oh, you can pull Bob's leg and he'll laugh right along with you.

1139
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,900
Because Bob, he's been a fool just like you or me.

1140
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,340
Bob's been a pathetic fool.

1141
00:54:29,420 --> 00:54:33,540
And I tell you what, that J.R. Bob Dobbs will be a fool again.

1142
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,020
He's a fool today.

1143
00:54:35,180 --> 00:54:36,540
He's a fool tomorrow.

1144
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,400
Because he's the same Bob.

1145
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,760
He's always the same Bob.

1146
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,540
And he's working for you and me.

1147
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:46,260
But it's that foolishness that has kept man from being satisfied with his lot.

1148
00:54:46,420 --> 00:54:50,380
That has kept man building his great gas-powered automobile engines.

1149
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,000
His nuclear reactors.

1150
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:57,120
That made him want to master the Earth no matter how nice it might have been before.

1151
00:54:57,200 --> 00:55:00,140
And it gives us, friends, it gives us that mighty hate.

1152
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,540
The hate that makes us want to smite our brothers.

1153
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:08,820
The hate that makes us get up in the morning and, friends, without that foolishness and that mighty hate,

1154
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,080
why, we'd be no different from those normals.

1155
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,020
Because we'd have nothing to gripe about.

1156
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:17,760
And it's the mighty gripe power and the hate that gives us something for nothing.

1157
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:20,320
Oh, in the long run, we may be poor.

1158
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:20,880
We may be broke.

1159
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:22,480
We may be drunk and neurotic.

1160
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,720
But we've got Bob and they hate.

1161
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,720
And for that, we can hate them.

1162
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:27,860
Hate them.

1163
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:28,700
Hate them.

1164
00:55:28,780 --> 00:55:30,600
And that's the power that we have.

1165
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,360
And they don't have.

1166
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:34,980
Oh, they got plenty of that diddly kind of hate.

1167
00:55:35,140 --> 00:55:36,620
Oh, I hate President Reagan.

1168
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:38,540
Oh, I hate my job.

1169
00:55:38,760 --> 00:55:39,900
I hate myself.

1170
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:42,380
That's the sick hate, friends.

1171
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:43,780
That ain't no kind of hate at all.

1172
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:46,100
We've got that all-inclusive kind of hate.

1173
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:47,000
That hate essence.

1174
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,620
And it's the love of the hate that allows us to hate.

1175
00:55:50,640 --> 00:55:52,000
And it allows us to put up with just about anything.

1176
00:55:52,100 --> 00:55:53,540
So we can do something about it.

1177
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:57,200
Because the Bob hate is indistinguishable from the Bob love.

1178
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,580
It's what keeps him on his toes.

1179
00:55:58,760 --> 00:55:59,920
Bob is the aware man.

1180
00:56:00,120 --> 00:56:01,120
The natural man.

1181
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,700
He can be walking along humming to himself, playing pocket pool.

1182
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,460
But the inner Bob is aware.

1183
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:09,180
He can hear a fly sniff on a mountain far away.

1184
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,040
And he can go up to that fly and look that fly in the eye and say,

1185
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:17,660
Son, I'd like to sell you a big old mound of waste byproducts from physical organisms.

1186
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,420
And that fly will give his wings to Bob.

1187
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:21,440
Bob is aware.

1188
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:24,020
And that's how he can sell to these inferior creatures.

1189
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,040
And that fly, he's going to be a better fly for it.

1190
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:30,360
All those other flies, they're flitting from pile to pile.

1191
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:34,540
They see him just sitting there without any wings on that big old mound of Bob.

1192
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,000
And they may laugh now.

1193
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:37,000
But winter goes by.

1194
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:37,860
Summer goes by.

1195
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:39,440
All those other flies starve.

1196
00:56:39,540 --> 00:56:42,640
But that little Bob fly, he's still sitting there on that pile.

1197
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:44,320
A munching away and a munching away.

1198
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:49,260
And that pile does not change because Bob, my friend, does not change.

1199
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,440
Oh, he changes his mind.

1200
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,420
He might suddenly change all the doctrine in the whole church right in the middle of a ritual

1201
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,440
to teach us all an important lesson.

1202
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,260
But, oh, my friend, Bob Dobbs does not change.

1203
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,980
Hold that name on the tip of your tongue.

1204
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:01,420
Bob.

1205
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:02,800
There's a B on either side.

1206
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:03,500
Opposite poles.

1207
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,620
That's the lesson right there.

1208
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,120
Flip it over on your tongue.

1209
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:07,200
Say it front way.

1210
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:07,900
Say it backwards.

1211
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:08,860
Say it upside down.

1212
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,620
And what does it say?

1213
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:10,880
It says Bob.

1214
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:13,020
Because Bob does not change.

1215
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,680
His promise rings true.

1216
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,620
But if you ain't been sprinkled in the blood of the head, if you ain't been washed in the waste byproducts,

1217
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,900
of Bob, how are you going to get saved?

1218
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:27,360
You can go to that party Saturday night, but you got to be wearing Bob's shadow.

1219
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:28,560
You can drink beer.

1220
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,600
You just got to get Bob drunk, too.

1221
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:31,900
And what about Wanda?

1222
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:35,040
Oh, you just going to have to give Wanda over to Bob.

1223
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:39,860
That shouldn't be any problem because Wanda, she found out from Bob how to get to heaven.

1224
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:40,760
Sit down, boy.

1225
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:45,020
Because, friends, if you're wondering, Bob can love.

1226
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,580
Bob can love.

1227
00:57:53,140 --> 00:57:53,480
Bob love.

1228
00:57:58,320 --> 00:57:58,760
Bob love love.

1229
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:14,020
And one thing I want to say is, Bob loves me.

1230
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:14,800
He can do anything he wants with his own heart.

1231
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:20,620
He can do anything he wants with his own heart.

1232
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:20,620


1233
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:28,160
And it was just about then that the Kenneth Arnold sighting of the so-called flying saucers hit the headlines.

1234
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,460
And it caused a lot of conversation.

1235
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:36,000
I notice you keep looking out the window.

1236
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,860
You wouldn't be looking for these flying saucers, would you?

1237
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,600
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.

1238
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,560
You don't think it's just some kind of a publicity stunt then, huh?

1239
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,220
No.

1240
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:50,160
It's reasonable to suppose that there's life on other planets.

1241
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:53,800
Maybe I ought to start looking for flying saucers, too.

1242
00:58:54,780 --> 00:58:57,540
If they do come from another planet, how will we know?

1243
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:01,720
Listen, when the occupants condescend to tell us, that's when.

1244
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:16,720
God! God! God! God! God! God! God!

1245
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:20,620
Now, Bob, you're getting to be a pretty good guy.

1246
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,080
Pretty big fella.

1247
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:24,260
Yes, sir. Maybe this is a good idea.

1248
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:25,820
A chance for us to have a little talk.

1249
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:27,120
Why, sure, Dad. What's cooking?

1250
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:34,200
Remember the last time we talked about this old body of ours, Bob?

1251
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:36,140
Yeah. Yeah, I remember, Dad.

1252
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:36,540
No.

1253
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,540
Oh, here's a match. Your pipe's gone out again.

1254
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:40,380
Well, thanks.

1255
00:59:41,080 --> 00:59:43,520
But when a doctor speaks of the male organ, he...

1256
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,920
Well, he calls it a...

1257
00:59:48,280 --> 00:59:50,160
When a man and a woman are married, Bob,

1258
00:59:50,860 --> 00:59:52,700
they love each other very much.

1259
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:56,520
And in showing their love,

1260
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:59,600
their instinct is to embrace each other as if...

1261
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:04,380
Well, as if to try to become the one person God intended them to be.

1262
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,780
They're the sperm, as the doctors call it.

1263
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,420
Is that the seed that helps make a new baby?

1264
01:00:10,820 --> 01:00:11,700
No, no, Bob.

1265
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:16,860
Well, what I'm talking about now is the fluid that contains the sperm.

1266
01:00:16,980 --> 01:00:19,180
Formed in two little sacks beneath the...

1267
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:20,000
And now...

1268
01:00:20,640 --> 01:00:21,380
I'm gonna throw my predictions.

1269
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:22,600
Listen.

1270
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:24,380
Listen carefully.

1271
01:00:25,640 --> 01:00:29,220
Join me in knowing the headlines of tomorrow today.

1272
01:00:31,640 --> 01:00:33,220
I'm not gonna judge you.

1273
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:36,780
I'll see you do that, and I'm judging you.

1274
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:41,420
I predict public executions will be shown on television

1275
01:00:41,420 --> 01:00:44,540
sponsored by your local gas company.

1276
01:00:45,780 --> 01:00:50,400
Securing the faith that the future is filled with good things for you and yours.

1277
01:00:50,460 --> 01:00:50,620
Securing the faith that the future is filled with good things for you and yours.

1278
01:00:50,620 --> 01:00:55,200
I predict that LSD, marijuana, and speed can change your sex.

1279
01:00:56,020 --> 01:01:00,700
Listen now to the headlines you will be reading in the coming prediction period.

1280
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,880
School built on sweet potato pie.

1281
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:08,120
Gee, that's a headline!

1282
01:01:08,980 --> 01:01:16,200
If it were possible to spray small doses of LSD from an helicopter into the air,

1283
01:01:16,460 --> 01:01:20,580
people would soon quieten and not be hurt.

1284
01:01:20,580 --> 01:01:22,800
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

1285
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,680
She is a cutie, isn't she? What a gal!

1286
01:01:25,940 --> 01:01:28,060
Right on campus as part of getting high.

1287
01:01:28,220 --> 01:01:30,340
I mean, uh, getting a higher education.

1288
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:33,160
Which is just wonderful in any language.

1289
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,140
Here's Bobby.

1290
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:37,760
LSD is running its mad course,

1291
01:01:38,580 --> 01:01:41,300
with babies now being born hideously deformed

1292
01:01:41,300 --> 01:01:45,400
from women whose chromosomes are permanently damaged by this drug

1293
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:50,560
which was invented originally by the chemical warfare branch of the United States Army.

1294
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:54,220
As a vicious weapon to be used against an enemy.

1295
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,280
Here you see the heroic robots, the Levees,

1296
01:01:57,340 --> 01:02:00,220
who defended San Francisco against the daftly attacks.

1297
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,120
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1298
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:05,200
All right, I've seen enough.

1299
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:08,160
Well, you know, who knows what could happen here.

1300
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:11,300
Bob got to Reagan in time and saved him,

1301
01:02:11,420 --> 01:02:15,060
and President Bush is, uh, we think he's gonna be getting better soon.

1302
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:19,600
1983 will be seen in the first televised executions.

1303
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,160
Don't you mean the clone of President Bush?

1304
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:25,400
Well, that goes without saying.

1305
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,600
I don't expect him to believe that.

1306
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:30,540
We can't ask, we can't ask Tony.

1307
01:02:30,560 --> 01:02:32,960
They have entire clone farms there in Argentina.

1308
01:02:33,600 --> 01:02:39,480
Basically all our world leaders and politicians are only clones of their original selves,

1309
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:45,680
their original brains taken out and replaced by robotic,

1310
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:49,260
excess green energy demon brains.

1311
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,820
Like the ones that work at convenience stores.

1312
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,740
It's right over my right.

1313
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:03,400
What is it?

1314
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,560
I gotta get out of here.

1315
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:09,560
It's wrong trouble. Go on.

1316
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:11,380
You're remembering everything now.

1317
01:03:11,920 --> 01:03:15,520
And I try to maintain control,

1318
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:18,660
so Betty cannot tell that I am scared.

1319
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,760
Why are you so scared?

1320
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:23,900
Go on. This won't hurt you. Experience it.

1321
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,020
It won't harm you now.

1322
01:03:28,020 --> 01:03:29,420
I gotta get my gun!

1323
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:30,920
I gotta get my gun!

1324
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,420
I gotta get out of here! I gotta get my gun!

1325
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:35,380
I gotta get my gun!

1326
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,480
I gotta get my gun!

1327
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:39,160
I gotta get my gun!

1328
01:03:39,800 --> 01:03:42,480
They're not emotional. Angels don't have any emotions.

1329
01:03:43,640 --> 01:03:46,860
The princess is a creature of antiquity.

1330
01:03:46,860 --> 01:03:48,680
Ten million years at least in age.

1331
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:17,780
Praise Bob.
