00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,640
I am seeking information about Bob. Let us see what is on the radio.

2
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,920
You're listening to PR News.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,960
No, I don't think I can accept that program.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,000
Nor that one.

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,960
The Self Genius Power Rolls!

6
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:27,960
The Self Genius Power Rolls!

7
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,780
guitar solo

8
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,120
guitar solo

9
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,920
He must go the way he's expected to go.

10
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,800
Look, I've got a blade.

11
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,220
I could open up a lung.

12
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,860
If you look in the back there, you see I don't have a rug on the floor.

13
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,040
I've got linoleum.

14
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:15,620
That's for puking from people like you.

15
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,900
God damn it, who's going to clean up this mess?

16
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,360
guitar solo

17
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,500
guitar solo

18
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:30,420
linoleum

19
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:30,420


20
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:30,480
linoleum

21
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:32,640
linoleum

22
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:32,960
linoleum

23
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:34,040
linoleum

24
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,420
Lend an ear, voodoo child.

25
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,300
Who counts birdshot in a dead man's chest?

26
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,700
You don't want to hear about napalm, you just want to rock.

27
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:49,980
Circus Magazine says that you're writing a song that you're going to dedicate to the Panthers.

28
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,000
Wake up before the whole fucking world goes into the atomic sewer.

29
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,940
But you two have a very...

30
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,560
abstract thing going here.

31
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,780
I'll flash my cock if you'll burn your draft card.

32
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,320
Worn out, harsh, wrung out.

33
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,980
Hands reaching in the air, grabbing at everything.

34
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,720
A lot of guys with boners.

35
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,200
A lot of girls in heat.

36
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:12,140
Everybody angry, crying, hard up.

37
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,400
Boners against blue jeans.

38
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,540
I look for rainbows and all I see is pink blue.

39
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,840
Look for flowers.

40
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:21,060
I see crap all over the oval room rug.

41
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:25,540
I look for father figures and I get Richard Milhouse, Nixon, and Spiro.

42
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,240
All the half-back new.

43
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,200
I look for love and all I get is napalm.

44
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,020
The lady is a poet.

45
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,760
The mystics could tell us.

46
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,660
The gurus.

47
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,820
The medicine men.

48
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,740
They feel we're in the 15th round, the ninth inning.

49
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:43,720
In the capitals of the world, men who can no longer get their peckers up have found a new

50
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,960
way to get turned on.

51
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,400
They're the butchers of the world with their 18 pound sledgehammers.

52
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:54,180
The bacon for tomorrow's breakfast will have the peculiar color of ash.

53
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,940
I could stuff even my own ass.

54
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:55,940


55
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:01,060
with the pillow? No, he must go the way he's expected to go. Look, I've got a blade. I

56
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,020
could open up a lock. That's right, he's got a choke on it.

57
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,960
All right.

58
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:59,160
All right.

59
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,320
All right.

60
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,000
All right.

61
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,720
All right.

62
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,660
All right.

63
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:31,420
All right.

64
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:32,860
All right.

65
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:38,260
All right.

66
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,800
Thank you.

67
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:35,600
Thank you.

68
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,040
Thank you.

69
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,840
Thank you.

70
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,360
Thank you.

71
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,900
Thank you.

72
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:41,120
Thank you.

73
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:56,240
Thank you.

74
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:03,300
Yes, yes.

75
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:06,500
One pill makes you larger and one pill makes you small.

76
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,000
That song.

77
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:07,880
Oh.

78
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,280
But Dave can't hear it.

79
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,760
But it's okay because it's a...

80
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:14,780
From what we said, I can capisco it.

81
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,380
It's a counterpoint to the serious subject of sexual harassment,

82
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,380
which is all you hear about in the news this particular week.

83
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:32,740
Of course, by the time the listeners hear this pre-recorded canned live show, it won't be in the news anymore.

84
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,780
It'll just be back to being, you know, normal.

85
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,980
Not in the news or in their memories.

86
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:38,820
Right.

87
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,360
Yep.

88
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:43,640
I got pictures of Al Franken on the back of Mr. Moore's horse.

89
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,880
What's his name?

90
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,600
Rudy Moore, the judge from...

91
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:47,460
Uh-huh.

92
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,620
Yeah, and Trump was telling them they weren't doing it right.

93
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,260
Yeah, that's not where you grab them.

94
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,600
You gotta grab them right here by the...

95
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:07,680
It's so sick just to see his smug face when he reviews these cases and then tweets something on his Twitter line.

96
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:12,140
He thinks everybody's a pervert more than him, and he's the most perverted of them all.

97
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,540
Who's him?

98
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,160
I'm sorry.

99
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,020
Mr. You-Know-Who.

100
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:17,740
Oh.

101
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:21,560
The President of the United States, Mr. Otis POTUS.

102
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,060
Mr. POTUS.

103
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,780
The President of the United States.

104
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:24,400
The Boogeyman.

105
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,160
Oh, it is from The Boogeyman.

106
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:26,860
Yeah.

107
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,020
Otis Boogeyman.

108
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,940
That's the head.

109
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,760
Yeah, man.

110
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:33,080
Everybody's seeing Trumps under their beds.

111
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,820
They're afraid there's a Trump under...

112
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,020
Kids are afraid there's a Trump in the closet.

113
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:43,480
There's always a Trump trying to break into your apartment and do a home invasion.

114
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,060
Yep.

115
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,260
It's real.

116
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:50,100
It's real fake news, yeah.

117
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,780
Mommy, there's a Trump under my bed.

118
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,940
We can't go to bed now.

119
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:54,960


120
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,720
I mean, there's no such thing as a Trump.

121
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,500
There's a...

122
00:12:58,280 --> 00:12:59,800
Oh, God, I wish.

123
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,900
Oh, God, I wish.

124
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:02,480
Oh, God, I wish.

125
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:02,880
If only.

126
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,360
No, it's a planet of the Trumps, man.

127
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,200
War for the planet of the Trumps.

128
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:17,400
Or he could just be, what's his name, the King of the Orangutans, because isn't he better

129
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,760
known as the avocado perpetrator?

130
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,260
No, as the...

131
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,240
Oh, yeah.

132
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:23,240


133
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:25,160
You know, the orange...

134
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,180
the tangerine dream?

135
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:27,680
...the tangerine smoothie?

136
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,800
Yeah, the tangerine smoothie.

137
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,420
Tangerine nightmare?

138
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:31,740
Yeah.

139
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,180
That was that other band .

140
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,880
It was really bad, Tangerine...

141
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,240
You remember that band?

142
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:40,880
Dream was pretty good, yeah, but Tangerine Nightmare was, God, they were awful.

143
00:13:40,960 --> 00:13:42,340
Do you remember Tangerine Dream?

144
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:48,840
Um, yes, I remember Tangerine Dream.

145
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:52,640
Boy, you are mighty facile with your memory lobes.

146
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:53,220
Oh, you say that, yeah.

147
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,860
I used to play them on the hour of slack all the time.

148
00:13:56,280 --> 00:14:03,780
The first time I ever heard that band, however, was the soundtrack of Sorcerer.

149
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,140
It was the first time I, or for that matter, the director, William Friedkin,

150
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:16,860
had ever heard that kind of synthesized music that was driving and weird and spooky, but really pretty.

151
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:19,340
Intriguing.

152
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,200
Yeah.

153
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,680
Cut to Sorcerer theme.

154
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,300
No, not really.

155
00:14:25,460 --> 00:14:26,580
But I could.

156
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,660
Yes, you could.

157
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:28,120
Yeah.

158
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,900
In post.

159
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:33,200
Well, Dave, how's the weather in Cleveland, Ohio?

160
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,580
Because we're not there.

161
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,040
Or Ashtabula.

162
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,980
I guess tomorrow it will be in the 50s.

163
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:46,180
And sometime not too far away, perhaps maybe too soon to be far away,

164
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,120
it's going to go all the way up to 60.

165
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:49,440
People are just going crazy.

166
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:53,180
Dave's only going to be 50 years old.

167
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,960
We're going to be 70.

168
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,480
We'll be in our 70s.

169
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,380
Yeah.

170
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,940
And then won't that be a sad thing when the little kids come with the sprinkle pedals,

171
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:07,280
flower petals on your grave or on the water in this case,

172
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:11,420
because it's been such a huge, you know, since the dam broke in the year.

173
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,940
Hey, did you have a dam?

174
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:13,540
Yeah, sure.

175
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,580
Went and broke.

176
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,320
And it wasn't even, I mean, they were trying to fix it.

177
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,980
We saw them trying to fix the dam.

178
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,140
But first, before we realized that was why there was a truck in the river,

179
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:34,260
we saw a truck in the river just trundling down the river.

180
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,800
The river obviously wasn't very deep nor muddy.

181
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:42,600
And when we turned to wave at him, he beeped his horn at us.

182
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,040
Well, we were filming.

183
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:44,280
We did?

184
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:44,920
Yes.

185
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,920
Well, and then there was another truck.

186
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:49,900
It was like a whole, there were trucks passing each other in the riverbed.

187
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,900
And it turned out they were carrying in and out.

188
00:15:52,900 --> 00:16:04,060
Loads of dredged silt and filth and crud and grud and scrum from the bottom of the Paluxy

189
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:07,040
and dinosaur bones from the bottom of the Paluxy River.

190
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,320
Paluxy River sludge.

191
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,700
If they use a really...

192
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,720
In the Mississippi and Paluxy, Mississippi, we talk about near Pascagoula.

193
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:20,700
No, Paluxy River in Texas, north central Texas.

194
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:21,620
You know, Pal.

195
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:22,620
Yeah.

196
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:23,040
Pal.

197
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,260
Wise up, Pal.

198
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:25,220
It's luxurious.

199
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:26,760
The Paluxy.

200
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:27,860
It's...

201
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,140
And our creek empties right into it.

202
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,200
Here goes some more.

203
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,580
Right into the Paluxy.

204
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,900
You better make sure their mascots are all teethed up because you can't find the right number.

205
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,900
Some of them like to just...

206
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,200
That's the first thing they'll do once you get them hypocritic.

207
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,540
They'll just pull that thing right off their chest and throw it under a chair.

208
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,060
It's a hell of a...

209
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,420
I don't know.

210
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:51,860
I don't know.

211
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:52,500
I don't know.

212
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:52,960
I don't know.

213
00:16:53,140 --> 00:16:53,280
I don't know.

214
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:53,440
I don't know.

215
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:59,500
And then they'll be asked by the mentor or perhaps the Parma Heights, one of those gentlemen

216
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:04,900
with the long, hairy beard, you know, where the fur on their faces grows upwards towards

217
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,640
their eyes.

218
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:08,900
Those are werewolves, guys.

219
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:09,800
Yeah.

220
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:16,460
The Paluxy River in north Texas is actually where Noah's Ark sank.

221
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,520
The river was much wider then and covered what is now part of our property.

222
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:30,580
So basically, we have the wreck of Noah's Ark on our land.

223
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:34,700
The Bible historians haven't gotten wind of it.

224
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:40,960
In fact, the Creation Evidence Museum guys keep going to Turkey looking at some collapsed

225
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:48,760
old log cabin that they think was Noah's Ark packed with dinosaurs and subgeniuses.

226
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,500
Meanwhile, it's right here in their own backyard.

227
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:51,500


228
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:51,500


229
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:51,500


230
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,500
Yeah.

231
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:53,980
Yeah.

232
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:56,780
And then you had to pick two subgeniuses of every kind.

233
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:59,680
So they packed a merkle.

234
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:00,700
And there aren't any.

235
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,540
There's no such thing.

236
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:02,640
That was the problem.

237
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,340
There were no two subgeniuses of every kind.

238
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:10,400
Any similar ones had been put to death, according to Bob's Law.

239
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,060
If any two are alive, one must die.

240
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,600
Or was that Princess Wee's Law?

241
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:18,840
No, that wasn't mine.

242
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:18,920
That wasn't mine.

243
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:19,200
Jack.

244
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:24,060
But yeah, we're mostly moved in.

245
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,200
We've set the museum up, the Destruction Evidence Museum.

246
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,820
Actually, it's not ready for the public yet, but we're getting there.

247
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:32,700
It's a process.

248
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:33,380
Yeah.

249
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:37,700
We're going to have the insulation man is going to come and spray insulation everywhere

250
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:44,840
so that the skeletons won't get too cold during the winter and nor too hot in the summer.

251
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,820
Yeah, you got to blow the summer.

252
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:48,820


253
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,400
You got to keep the foam on them.

254
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:50,600
Well, no.

255
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:51,300
Keep them intact.

256
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,680
You know, that is an idea, though, I suppose, is to foam down some of the skeletons so they

257
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:00,300
don't roll around so much.

258
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:04,040
We haven't mounted them quite as well as people do in museums.

259
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,360
The bones are just laying there on a slab.

260
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:14,180
The prehistoric devil skeleton, the cave subgeniuses that we call Adam and Eve, even though they're

261
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:14,760
both male.

262
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:18,400
Adam and Steve was their original names.

263
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:23,440
And they both have like dinosaurs that they ride around in cars like Barney Rubble and

264
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:23,660
stuff.

265
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,420
I didn't mention you, Princess Wee.

266
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:32,200
The other day when I was in the post office, the small town post office, I couldn't get

267
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:37,900
over to the recycling bin and recycle all the junk mail because the creationist guy,

268
00:19:38,180 --> 00:19:46,340
the creation museum guy, was standing there in the post office yakking on his phone in

269
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:47,760
this forced lurch.

270
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:47,860
I don't know if you've seen that.

271
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:53,800
He had a very fast, learned voice that was kind of wrecked by his Texas accent, kind

272
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:54,240
of like me.

273
00:19:54,380 --> 00:20:01,060
And just bombastically reminded me of that bad filmmaker, Palmer Rocky, who used to do

274
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:03,180
the same thing in the Dallas post office.

275
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:08,060
Standing there, he'd talk real loudly to somebody on his phone, and then he'd look at people

276
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:10,580
walking by and say things like, I'm talking to Hollywood.

277
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,000
I'm talking to Hollywood producers.

278
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:17,740
And the creation evidence guy was standing there just taking up space.

279
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:17,740


280
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,140
Taking up air.

281
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:20,280
Taking up noise.

282
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:24,240
And blathering away so everybody would notice him.

283
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:29,180
Good thing he didn't try that in the East Cleveland post office up in Northeastern Ohio.

284
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:33,800
Boy, they'll kick you out on your butt if you even touch your cell phone inside the

285
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,380
post office.

286
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:37,640
Yeah, they give you the prattles instead of the rattles.

287
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,440
I touch my, I fondle my cell phone.

288
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,240
It's, you know, you wouldn't have to have a Bible then.

289
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:45,000
I don't make phone calls on it.

290
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:45,940
I just fondle it.

291
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,060
I'm not talking.

292
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,720
I'm not wandering.

293
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:47,720


294
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:47,720


295
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:47,720


296
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:47,720


297
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:47,720


298
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:47,720


299
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:47,720


300
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:47,720


301
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:47,720


302
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,080
I don't want to look like a crazy person.

303
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,720
Like everybody else on the street walking around talking to themselves through their

304
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:54,240
earbuds.

305
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,440
Gesturing madly.

306
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,920
Yeah, gesturing madly just like a street schizophrenic.

307
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:04,400
Those are what make the streets so much fun, Stan.

308
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,660
Just being able to drive in any direction for less than five minutes and see somebody

309
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:12,040
with gargantuan hips and purple teeth.

310
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,800
An R. Crumb character, we call him.

311
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:15,520
Like white with horns and stuff.

312
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:20,120
Especially in Cleveland and also in Glen Rose.

313
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:23,320
You see R. Crumb characters everywhere.

314
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:24,300
All kinds.

315
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:24,780
We do.

316
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:27,460
Fat ones, skinny ones, rich ones, poor ones.

317
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:30,660
But they all look like they were drawn by Robert Crumb.

318
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:31,600
Yes.

319
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,060
The celebrated underground cartoonist.

320
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,780
How so?

321
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,980
In the fat stretches or the sweeps of the lines?

322
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:40,740
They just, they look like human cartoons.

323
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:44,100
They just look like Crumb characters.

324
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,500
The reason for that is Crumb is a cartoonist.

325
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:45,500


326
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:52,320
Crumb draws people that, they're cartoons but they're real people that you've seen,

327
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:52,820
you know?

328
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:54,780
Yeah, of course.

329
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,180
You know.

330
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:55,980
I mean, that's...

331
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,340
Persons, persons.

332
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,500
I mean, types.

333
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,560
People whose features are naturally exaggerated.

334
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,020
He just draws them accurately.

335
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,920
Yeah, people that look like...

336
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:05,560
You still have to do a lot of cross hatching.

337
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,320
There's, there's, yeah.

338
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,980
Well, the ones that are actually have the cross hatching on them, they've really looked,

339
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:12,220
drawn.

340
00:22:12,220 --> 00:22:15,300
The two dimensional ones that are just flapping in the wind.

341
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:16,100
Uh huh.

342
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,460
But you don't see many of those.

343
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,620
Most of them are real people that just happen to look sort of funny.

344
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,380
Look a bit cartoon.

345
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:24,440
Yeah, look a little, not like me.

346
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,340
Yeah, that's your rough life out there, ain't it?

347
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:29,780
This is funky.

348
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:31,300
This is music to sexually harass.

349
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,080
But Dave, are you, am I going to have to kick you off the show because some girl's going

350
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:39,220
to come forward, well, some old woman is going to come forward and say...

351
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,620
He grabbed my booty.

352
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:42,140
When?

353
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,140
When we were just talking.

354
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,060
Yes, I'm afraid, Stan, I'll have to admit that I'm one of the, one of the Barneys and

355
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,960
Dino Flexes riding on that dinosaur.

356
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:58,920
I think she said she was 12 years old, which as you know is the signal of consent in the

357
00:22:58,920 --> 00:22:59,540
state of Ohio.

358
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,340
And I tried to tell her, I tried to talk her out of it.

359
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,960
I said, look, baby, you know, there's plenty of 13 year olders who've died on the avenue

360
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:08,780
and so forth.

361
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,420
And then she just looked at me.

362
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,840
Then she started tackling.

363
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:16,060
Then she suddenly, she looked like she was about 85 years old.

364
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,760
And a big green...

365
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,900
Yeah, go on, Senator.

366
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:23,840
Go on, Senator.

367
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,120
I know you're getting choked up, but the committee needs to hear this whole sordid story.

368
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:30,500
So proceed.

369
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:34,160
What did you do to the illegal 85 year old, 12 year old?

370
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:38,000
I personally, I don't recall doing anything.

371
00:23:38,060 --> 00:23:40,900
I do recommend that, I highly recommend that.

372
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,500
We have this photograph here.

373
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:44,540
Now, no one can fake a photograph.

374
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,120
Well, wait, that's somebody else.

375
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,120
That's the fake one.

376
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:48,600
Hold on.

377
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,820
Let me get the one with your head pasted on there.

378
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:51,200
Okay.

379
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:58,280
Now, is this not you groping and fondling an immature Billy goat kid?

380
00:23:59,560 --> 00:23:59,960
Boy.

381
00:24:00,060 --> 00:24:02,140
Well, that's not you fondling a Billy goat.

382
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,480
I don't think so.

383
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:04,940
Sure, I don't recognize him.

384
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,100
That's not me there.

385
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:07,000
Oh, I'm sorry.

386
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,260
That's a Billy Clinton goat.

387
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:10,600
Okay.

388
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:10,880
Well, that's not you.

389
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,920
You've got about three more to go.

390
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:13,800
Yeah.

391
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,560
There, that's the one.

392
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:16,020
That's me.

393
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,340
And I'm proud of it, damn you.

394
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:24,660
I feel that one of my young wild oats were sown have certainly fornicated a different

395
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:28,040
dimension in my logic and my superstition.

396
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,160
And for that reason, I refuse to comment any further on my Fifth Amendment rights in the

397
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:34,600
way you tend to intimidate me.

398
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:40,860
Well, I got to admit, when this sexual harassment explosion happened, I was in a very bad mood.

399
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:40,860


400
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:47,720
Listen, I was in a state of this sort where even the head of the company that I knew did

401
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:59,640
not just breastfeed theiran 29 year old and I loved his role, but I was also making Buz grain

402
00:24:59,640 --> 00:24:59,640


403
00:24:59,640 --> 00:24:59,640


404
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:05,120
Unfortunately a number of givers from 100I still believe I am.

405
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,560
Could some of those people have really turned a blind eye to bi character favorites?

406
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:09,980
Could they have committed a crime for which they did not take into account that they soy

407
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:09,980


408
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:09,980


409
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:10,620
No, go ahead.

410
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:14,700
tenderloin. Who'd want to live in a district where prostitution is so readily

411
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:17,640
available? None of the senators on this committee

412
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,460
in any way are irresponsible or

413
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,620
refuse to neglect the unavoidable circumstances

414
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,240
involving this committee.

415
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:33,080
I say, Senator,

416
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,060
you're not wearing any pants.

417
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:40,980
I'm not wearing any panties either, sir.

418
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,540
Please stay seated. Please stay seated.

419
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:49,840
Bring some kind of jail clothes in here for the senator.

420
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,600
What do you think about that? Check it out.

421
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,160
That's horrible. That's disgusting.

422
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,620
It is horrible. It's offensive.

423
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:03,060
It's horrible. It's disgusting. Let's run him for president.

424
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:06,720
He's the only one of us who can beat Trump.

425
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:12,540
He's even uglier, fatter, lazier, bigger mouth braggart.

426
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,580
More ignorant. Didn't know it was possible.

427
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:20,060
But, yeah. Go, Senator Moore.

428
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,620
President Moore. President Roy Moore.

429
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:27,460
Moore, Moore, Moore. That's what we say here at Moore Science High.

430
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,180
Yeah.

431
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:29,780
Yeah.

432
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,280
That's right, Senator. Moore Science High.

433
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:36,660
The tiny,

434
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:37,480
the few,

435
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,640
the few I refuse to get.

436
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,560
That's my message to everybody.

437
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,600
As long as you're going to keep on having these sexual fabrication

438
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,240
between different types of women

439
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,780
and different age men than the average men's room.

440
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,440
We have a spurious and a jocular problem on our hands here in beautiful America.

441
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,980
I think everybody should stand up and sit down a few times to go to their window

442
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:05,240
and very carefully part their hair before saying, I'm as mad as hell

443
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:07,040
and I need some peace.

444
00:27:07,060 --> 00:27:07,580
That's right.

445
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,780
And I'm going to pass out.

446
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:17,040
I think everybody in America should listen to this rather sobering song by the Rainmakers

447
00:27:17,040 --> 00:27:22,900
that I dug out from a pretty old album from the 90s called Skin.

448
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:30,880
Strangely enough, even though this is 20 years old, the first two songs deal directly with today's news headlines.

449
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:01,020
The Rainmakers

450
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,020


451
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,020


452
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:01,680
I

453
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:01,700
I

454
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:01,720
I

455
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:01,740
I

456
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:01,760
I

457
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:01,780
I

458
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:01,800
I

459
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:01,820
I

460
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:01,840
I

461
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:01,860
I

462
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:01,880
I

463
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:01,900
I

464
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:01,920
I

465
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:01,940
I

466
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:01,960
I

467
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:01,980
I

468
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,000
I

469
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:02,020
I

470
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:02,040
I

471
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:02,060
I

472
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,080
I

473
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:09,280
Take a look at what you talk

474
00:28:16,780 --> 00:28:19,080
Granddaddy at the minstrel show

475
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:22,440
Watch the darkest greatly old banjo

476
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,780
Grandson at the strip club

477
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:29,280
A little racism with a different rub

478
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:32,700
It's the same difference with a different rub

479
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:36,040
It's the same difference with a different rub

480
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,520
It's the same difference with a different rub

481
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:49,980
Granddaddy never owned no slaves

482
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,580
Grandson never committed rages

483
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:56,880
Quiet men in their own time

484
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:00,260
Keeping quiet is its own kind of crime

485
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,480
It's the same difference with a different rub

486
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,020
It's the same difference with a different rub

487
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:10,520
It's the same difference with a different rub

488
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:25,260
It's the same difference with a different rub

489
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:42,560
And

490
00:29:53,040 --> 00:29:54,440
It's

491
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,100
This ain't about no books that need burning

492
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,320
Less about blame and more about light

493
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:16,760
The freedom of one at the cost of another

494
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,340
This ain't about sin, it's about civil rights

495
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,540
That ain't what a woman is

496
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:33,020
That ain't what a woman is

497
00:30:33,020 --> 00:30:36,580
That ain't what a woman is

498
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:16,500
Down through our histories

499
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:20,520
We have been told

500
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,560
That women hold mysteries men cannot know

501
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:32,020
But boys learn true secrecy

502
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:36,140
How to hide lies

503
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:41,800
And cracks in their souls and behind shaded eyes

504
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:48,900
That filter all light through the sins of their fathers

505
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:52,920
Shining on down on good sons and daughters

506
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:59,080
We were true believers

507
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,840
Yeah, that this song would go

508
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:07,100
Oh, it was a high holy fever

509
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,180
That purified the soul

510
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,380
But bass turned to piss off

511
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:18,000
All equality of laugh

512
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,000
As girls danced the go-go to our golden calf

513
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,420
We borrowed the tune from the hymns of our fathers

514
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,000
We are not wrong, we are not wrong

515
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,460
Rebels, just good sons and daughters

516
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:39,500
Good sons, good sons and daughters

517
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:43,000
Good sons, good sons, yeah

518
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,480
The revolution came

519
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:49,480
Oh, the revolution went

520
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:55,460
And I'd never, oh, just that 50%

521
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,540
Oh, the truth that comes from penis

522
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,700
From porno to rape

523
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,780
And bought into Hollywood

524
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:11,020
Heftless like hate

525
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:17,780
Millions of Maryland's who died for their lovers

526
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:21,920
Seducing the culture of good sons and daughters

527
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,700
Good sons, good sons and daughters

528
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:49,180
Who travelled to the General Assembly

529
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,180


530
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,320
To school with their guys

531
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,320


532
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,320


533
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,320


534
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,320


535
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:49,740
Post th'olutionary

536
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:49,820
Post they and their sake

537
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:49,820


538
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:53,060
We have no proof to say

539
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:55,720
Like they never were

540
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:59,300
Yeah, us, you've been repeating the same thing

541
00:33:59,300 --> 00:34:03,000
Until daybreak

542
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,640
I was reading through the paper

543
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:11,080
And I happened to see

544
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:14,360
A police officer

545
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:17,080
That looked a whole lot like me

546
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,160
And so I started dodging questions

547
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:26,280
And lying on top of lies

548
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,000
And I thought what I thought

549
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,620
Was a good alibi

550
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:37,120
I never knew your mother

551
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:39,100
Your sister or daughter

552
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,160
I ain't no killer

553
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:31,600
I ain't no killer

554
00:35:40,080 --> 00:36:00,560
I ain't no killer

555
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:31,600
I ain't no killer

556
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:39,940
I ain't no killer

557
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:29,220
I ain't no killer

558
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:32,580
I ain't no killer

559
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:31,160
I ain't no killer

560
00:38:41,940 --> 00:39:01,600
I ain't no killer

561
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:03,400
I ain't no killer

562
00:39:40,260 --> 00:40:01,600
I ain't no killer

563
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,600
I ain't no killer

564
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:34,340
I ain't no killer

565
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:31,600
I ain't no killer

566
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:34,920
I ain't no killer

567
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:02,060
I ain't no killer

568
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,960
I ain't no killer

569
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,460
I ain't no killer

570
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,240
I ain't no killer

571
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,500
Hmm

572
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:24,180
Yeah this guy's old enough

573
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:25,780
That was my community founder father person

574
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,320
I'm the head of the local Boy Scout troop

575
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:31,540
And here took place

576
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:31,600
A service mission

577
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:31,600


578
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:36,040
178A dash slash comma slash five dash D.

579
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:38,880
Never mind.

580
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,780
I don't need to break up the time.

581
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,780
Well, we're going to weather it.

582
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:54,720
We're going to weather this whole world war and ecological disaster and zombie apocalypse

583
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,080
and the concentration camps.

584
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,980
I'm sorry, not the concentration camps.

585
00:42:59,000 --> 00:42:59,660
This whole sicko story.

586
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,460
They don't let you concentrate in there.

587
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,020
You can't.

588
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,660
You have to play video games all day long.

589
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,640
Yeah, Patriot camps.

590
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:13,480
It's just call of duty, but you're the victim the whole time.

591
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,500
And you can't never take the knee either.

592
00:43:17,460 --> 00:43:23,100
Well, and when you get killed in that game, you don't come back and do the round again.

593
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,900
Well, what don't you want for something better than that?

594
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:28,860
I mean, that's what life is about.

595
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:36,080
It's a slice of life is just a series of vile tasks.

596
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,560
I'll swear it.

597
00:43:39,980 --> 00:43:40,660
Huh?

598
00:43:42,900 --> 00:43:47,240
I thought you sounded briefly and nasally like William Burroughs there.

599
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:52,060
Jack Kerouac was a crazy kind of guy.

600
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:58,200
He drank more than most men can usually drink without falling asleep or falling down the steps.

601
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:00,400
I'm not sure if you can get that from him.

602
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:00,400


603
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:01,160
But William Burroughs?

604
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:04,440
Yeah, I love that famous line he does.

605
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:08,560
Repent, quit your job, slack off.

606
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:10,360
Slack off.

607
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:15,400
The world ends tomorrow and you may die.

608
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:26,480
It's the most mucilaginous, slick, slimy end of the world you can imagine.

609
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:28,380
Here.

610
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:28,840
Let me see.

611
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:28,840


612
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:28,840


613
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:28,840


614
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:30,980
Let me set this apple on top of you.

615
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:31,800
Yes.

616
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:34,240
I'm William Tell.

617
00:44:36,740 --> 00:44:39,240
Now, where's my cross-eyed crossbow?

618
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:46,060
Now, it's probably unfair to bring up the guy accidentally shooting his wife in the head.

619
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,420
But he's dead.

620
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,460
Who cares?

621
00:44:50,620 --> 00:44:53,520
And hey, Dick Cheney shot a guy in the face.

622
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:56,840
Nobody said anything about Dick Cheney shooting a guy in the face.

623
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:57,980
It's because he was a lawyer.

624
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:01,580
It was another lawyer that got shot in the face and nobody gave up.

625
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:05,060
He was able to expunge it from everyone's memory just magically.

626
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:09,920
Well, I'm sure he paid the lawyer a lot of money to go, oh, it's okay.

627
00:45:10,020 --> 00:45:10,320
Yeah.

628
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:13,500
I don't mind looking like Phantom of the Opera, Mr. Vice President.

629
00:45:14,040 --> 00:45:19,980
Anybody can get completely plastered and shoot the guy next to him thinking he's shooting at a goddamn dove.

630
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:26,800
Yeah, you ever see how they hang them upside down and keep them in a place and then when it's time to hunt,

631
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:28,760
they bring them right out in front of them.

632
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:34,840
Oh, and now that's not fair, though.

633
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:36,320
I mean, not all hunters do that.

634
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,220
Real hunters don't go to those places.

635
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:47,940
Real hunters lease Stang Ranch and go out there and shoot them animals fair and square.

636
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,180
All four of them.

637
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:51,640
Actually, there's a...

638
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:51,800
Yeah, I've heard that coming.

639
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:58,760
Especially when you rode to the defense of hunting adulterators before you even got to the scene.

640
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,140
I'm a good part of it.

641
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:01,800
You just...

642
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:04,000
You moralized your objective.

643
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:06,160
Furniture is very funny.

644
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:10,180
It's not like they had to go looking too far.

645
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,180
I don't know what he's talking about.

646
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:18,780
All I know is, you know, it's kind of sad to go deer hunting in Texas because, strangely enough,

647
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:21,100
the deer in Texas are tiny.

648
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,660
They're like chihuahuas.

649
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:24,180
They're little bitty deer.

650
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:27,260
They're not big springing things.

651
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,840
They're little tiny springings.

652
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:30,740
They can still spring over a fence.

653
00:46:31,260 --> 00:46:34,520
But they're sadly small.

654
00:46:35,220 --> 00:46:37,040
And they are herbivores.

655
00:46:37,220 --> 00:46:39,040
And they are completely defenseless.

656
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:46,040
And they are tricked into walking up to these deer feeding machines every afternoon as the sun is going down.

657
00:46:46,500 --> 00:46:47,980
Or when it's coming up.

658
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:50,960
Because the deer feeding machines suddenly go...

659
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,060
And a whole bunch of corn falls out.

660
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:58,580
And the deer go to eat the corn and the men go to shoot the deer.

661
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:00,400
And the deer go to shoot the deer.

662
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,640
But it actually, it's not that easy.

663
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,020
You've got to know what you're doing.

664
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:10,040
And then you've got to clean up the horrible mess of the dead carcass.

665
00:47:10,440 --> 00:47:11,560
And eat it.

666
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:15,180
My problem is, I never did like venison.

667
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:16,380
Or blood.

668
00:47:17,660 --> 00:47:21,620
If it's treated with the right wines and vinegar...

669
00:47:21,620 --> 00:47:22,300
Oh, sure, of course.

670
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:23,480
But I'm a hypocrite.

671
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,200
I want to buy my dead animals.

672
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:28,700
Killed by...

673
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,360
Somebody else.

674
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,060
And wrapped in cellophane.

675
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:33,320
All the blood squeezed out.

676
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,140
Ready to throw on the griddle.

677
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,220
You know, I'm a hypocrite.

678
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,380
I don't want to look at the naked lunch at the end of my fork.

679
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,580
Who does?

680
00:47:43,740 --> 00:47:46,740
You don't want to think about lines and lines of chickens being...

681
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:48,440
With their heads turned upside down.

682
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,080
Scribbling and scrabbling and trying to get away from having their necks...

683
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,920
Their necks croaked.

684
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:55,540
It's terrible.

685
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:57,840
I had a friend who went to work...

686
00:47:57,840 --> 00:47:58,840
For a...

687
00:47:58,860 --> 00:47:59,580
Kosher...

688
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:00,740
Chicken farm.

689
00:48:00,940 --> 00:48:03,700
Which he thought, well, it's got to be more humane.

690
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:05,580
And it didn't make any difference.

691
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,560
Less machines, more people doing the dirty work.

692
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:10,820
Right.

693
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:12,320
Well, somebody's got...

694
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,400
They do their killing by hand and they pray first.

695
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:15,320
Right.

696
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,040
That makes a big difference.

697
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:18,800
But somebody's got to do it.

698
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,400
If you're going to eat chicken...

699
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:23,900
Oh, chicken, I'm so sorry.

700
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:26,020
Dave, it's okay.

701
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,000
If you study paleontology,

702
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:30,320
you'd know that the age of dinosaurs

703
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:33,840
was followed not by the age of mammals,

704
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:35,360
but the age of giant birds

705
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:38,580
who kept the mammals tiny for a long time

706
00:48:38,580 --> 00:48:41,360
because for millions and millions of years,

707
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:42,860
chickens ate us.

708
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:45,040
Very big chickens,

709
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:48,100
and they were very weak, little versions of...

710
00:48:48,100 --> 00:48:50,360
Well, primates of some kind.

711
00:48:51,100 --> 00:48:53,140
But they were our ancestors, nonetheless,

712
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:55,020
and chickens ate us for so long

713
00:48:55,020 --> 00:48:57,120
that that means it's okay for us to eat chickens now.

714
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,840
For another four and a half...

715
00:48:58,840 --> 00:48:59,180
Four and a half years.

716
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,860
After four and a half years,

717
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:03,300
we will have eaten so many billions of chickens

718
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:05,400
that the karma will have come around

719
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:09,280
and something else will start eating us again,

720
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,580
probably aliens or viruses.

721
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,320
I think it'll just be a bigger chicken than the first time.

722
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:17,400
I think the big chickens are growing.

723
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:19,600
The small chickens are lessening

724
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:21,360
or getting smaller in our own minds

725
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,980
because that's the transversal areas

726
00:49:23,980 --> 00:49:25,740
that we use in our matriculations.

727
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,120
When we get to one point or another,

728
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:28,820
the next thing you know, we're going to die.

729
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:28,820


730
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:28,820


731
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:31,220
Well, we got some other point,

732
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:33,100
but I forgot what it was.

733
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:33,940
I thought so.

734
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,160
I thought so.

735
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:38,820
I knew where that one was going.

736
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:39,960
Nowhere.

737
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:41,660
Right down a big black hole.

738
00:49:42,580 --> 00:49:44,660
The hole in Dave's mind.

739
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,380
And mind.

740
00:49:46,580 --> 00:49:47,680
I thought it had a cramp.

741
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:48,340
And the listeners.

742
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,500
Dave's sentences go right down the black hole

743
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,620
and all of those minds involved.

744
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:57,720
All the show hosts and the listeners.

745
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,680
He was going,

746
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:01,040
some way he just got sidetracked.

747
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,540
At least it's going somewhere.

748
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:04,460
But it's...

749
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:04,760
Yeah.

750
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,040
But it can never, ever go home.

751
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:09,360
Something derailed his thought.

752
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,320
Yeah, the punchline never came.

753
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,460
The train never left the...

754
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:15,820
Well, the train left the station,

755
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,760
but it never arrived.

756
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:18,940
It got derailed along the way.

757
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,720
Yeah, but that's only if...

758
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:21,660
If you're an over-fuehrer,

759
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:23,040
von Gruppenmeister,

760
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:23,840
von over-fuehrer,

761
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:26,400
von, you know,

762
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,140
non-liminal sightings,

763
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:30,580
synthetic leakage.

764
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,500
It was in...

765
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,640
The Twilight Zone.

766
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:37,060
It was?

767
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:38,060
Yeah.

768
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:40,060
That's where your sentence went.

769
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:41,900
A whole bunch of them.

770
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:43,340
Oh, yeah.

771
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:44,320
I see what you mean.

772
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:46,480
My sentence that I just uttered,

773
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:47,660
the tail end of it,

774
00:50:47,680 --> 00:50:48,300
made no sense,

775
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:50,420
so it kind of just trailed off into idiocracy.

776
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:53,420
Not the movie, but...

777
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,160
Well, like everything.

778
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,520
Everything kind of trails off into idiocracy nowadays.

779
00:50:58,140 --> 00:50:58,240
Yeah.

780
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,340
We were ahead of our time

781
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:02,340
with the Church of the Subgenius.

782
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,520
You'd think we'd be richer and famouser

783
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,660
and more presidential by now.

784
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,880
Oh, we didn't do enough harassing.

785
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:11,300
Not...

786
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,560
Although there's lots of people

787
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,500
who'd argue otherwise.

788
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:15,460
But, uh...

789
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:18,520
I didn't...

790
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:22,340
I've only had to kick out

791
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:23,840
about 10 or 15 people

792
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,380
out of Church of the Subgenius

793
00:51:25,380 --> 00:51:26,880
for being sexual predators.

794
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:27,980
But I actually,

795
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:28,180
I actually have.

796
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:29,440
I have...

797
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,960
But here's the thing.

798
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:32,700
I did it real quietly.

799
00:51:33,900 --> 00:51:35,020
Is that a crime?

800
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,180
I didn't make a big, big deal out of it.

801
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:38,760
I just said,

802
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,120
don't come back.

803
00:51:41,500 --> 00:51:43,400
Don't call yourself Pope anymore.

804
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:46,680
That's a discreet and to the point,

805
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:47,680
and you're telling them,

806
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:48,980
you know, you're not saying,

807
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,020
or I'm going to punch you right in the eye

808
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:52,100
or anything like that.

809
00:51:52,160 --> 00:51:53,760
If they don't get it,

810
00:51:54,340 --> 00:51:55,340
then, you know,

811
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,980
they're the ones who are hopped up.

812
00:51:57,020 --> 00:51:57,940
Well, the ones who don't,

813
00:51:57,980 --> 00:51:58,220
get it,

814
00:51:58,260 --> 00:51:59,320
the ones who don't know

815
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:00,320
about all the times

816
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:02,320
that I have policed all that stuff.

817
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:05,380
And they see a girl in a bikini

818
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:06,760
with a funny meme statement

819
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:08,800
on a Facebook page

820
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,020
and get mad at me

821
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:13,760
because I allowed dumb jocks

822
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:16,060
to post dumb pictures

823
00:52:16,060 --> 00:52:17,060
on the internet.

824
00:52:17,960 --> 00:52:19,300
And I didn't,

825
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:21,740
I didn't immediately do something

826
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:23,220
about each and every one

827
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:24,060
of those examples.

828
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:26,820
No, I waited until

829
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:27,960
one of the other people

830
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:29,520
or administrators noticed it

831
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:30,660
and went, oh, that's stupid.

832
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,520
Let's just cut that.

833
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,580
If that guy does it again,

834
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,240
I'll ban him.

835
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:38,720
But, you know, if you...

836
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:43,840
I've been harassed

837
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,540
and then fairly treated.

838
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,260
Yep, I can tell.

839
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:46,980
But people who feel

840
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:48,040
they've been harassed

841
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:49,080
and then fairly treated.

842
00:52:51,260 --> 00:52:53,060
My snowflakes are all melting.

843
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,280
Yeah, you're melting.

844
00:52:56,380 --> 00:52:57,820
The victim church of the...

845
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:58,460
The kid glove.

846
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:00,520
That was it.

847
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:02,880
Yeah, they splintered off.

848
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:05,000
Like iron fist in the velvet glove.

849
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,620
I'm sure they're enjoying

850
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:08,640
their great sense of humor

851
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:09,400
all together.

852
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:11,220
Not.

853
00:53:11,460 --> 00:53:13,080
Yeah, they've got that

854
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:14,980
blacksmith commune going now.

855
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:16,140
Hey, watch it, buddy.

856
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,180
Hey, watch your language.

857
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:20,880
Hey, nobody needs their dog buddy

858
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:22,400
and expects you to get away with it

859
00:53:22,400 --> 00:53:23,260
for longer than...

860
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:24,620
Hey, man, I'm a Smith, okay?

861
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,400
We prefer to be called

862
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:27,780
Stan.

863
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:28,220
Stan, okay?

864
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:29,360
It's just more polite.

865
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:30,480
Oh, wait.

866
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:32,120
No, I'm the only one who does that.

867
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,560
Well, I've been having to grapple

868
00:53:36,560 --> 00:53:38,500
with my two names lately, Dave.

869
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,560
You know, I had a human street name.

870
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,540
It's pretty ordinary.

871
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:45,380
Except in the circumstances

872
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,420
under the...

873
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:47,680
In the context of

874
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:48,700
Church of the Subgenius,

875
00:53:48,740 --> 00:53:51,220
the name that my parents gave me

876
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:52,680
sounds fake as hell.

877
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:54,480
Douglas St. Clair Smith.

878
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:56,880
It's even got a religious thing in it.

879
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:57,800
St. Clair.

880
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:58,000
St. Clair.

881
00:53:58,320 --> 00:54:01,440
And the family wasn't even Catholics.

882
00:54:01,560 --> 00:54:03,080
They don't even believe in saints.

883
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:05,840
It sounds so stately in Irish.

884
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:06,620
It sounds like

885
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:08,760
Mrs. and Claire Smith.

886
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,120
Right, but I needed a name that's...

887
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:11,900
The Catholic in Dublin

888
00:54:11,900 --> 00:54:14,120
claims that the werewolves

889
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:15,480
are not real werewolves.

890
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:16,020
After all,

891
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,900
the stigmas of the toad...

892
00:54:17,900 --> 00:54:18,620
No, no.

893
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:20,120
That person wouldn't be named Smith.

894
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:22,500
He'd be named Budlington or something.

895
00:54:22,980 --> 00:54:23,480
But...

896
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:24,280
Budlington.

897
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:24,620
Yeah.

898
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,140
But, uh...

899
00:54:26,820 --> 00:54:27,740
Yeah, there's...

900
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:28,080
There...

901
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:30,120
I was about to say

902
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,920
there aren't many Professor Smiths,

903
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:32,580
but we did...

904
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,260
We did work with a...

905
00:54:34,260 --> 00:54:36,440
We all worked with a Professor Smith

906
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:37,660
for years, didn't we?

907
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:38,200
Yes.

908
00:54:39,500 --> 00:54:40,380
Professor Chess.

909
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:40,800
I was about to say

910
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:41,920
there would not be anything

911
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:44,120
as even a barbecue dentist

912
00:54:45,100 --> 00:54:46,580
or a fallopian tube...

913
00:54:46,580 --> 00:54:47,200
Well, there's never been

914
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:48,420
a king named Smith,

915
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:49,220
but there will be

916
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,620
a king named Stang.

917
00:54:51,440 --> 00:54:51,880
King...

918
00:54:51,880 --> 00:54:52,180
Oh, wait.

919
00:54:52,200 --> 00:54:53,520
There's already a King Drummond.

920
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,320
It's going to have to be

921
00:54:55,320 --> 00:54:56,080
like two kings.

922
00:54:56,580 --> 00:54:57,020
Like,

923
00:54:57,080 --> 00:54:57,780
when tonight...

924
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:58,620
When Ignatius D. did that.

925
00:54:58,680 --> 00:54:58,760
Yes.

926
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:00,060
That worked out great, didn't it?

927
00:55:00,120 --> 00:55:00,540
Oh, wait.

928
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:01,840
No, they poisoned each other

929
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,720
simultaneously.

930
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:04,020
Dang.

931
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:04,840
Man.

932
00:55:05,220 --> 00:55:07,220
See, at City Hall,

933
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:08,620
everybody's just

934
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:09,740
rockin' sockin' robots.

935
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:11,360
That's all there is to it.

936
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:11,860
See what they do?

937
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:12,940
Everybody is

938
00:55:12,940 --> 00:55:14,380
rockin' sockin' robots.

939
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:15,080
Yep.

940
00:55:16,860 --> 00:55:17,560
Just think,

941
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,740
that's a horrible future

942
00:55:18,740 --> 00:55:19,960
for us to visage,

943
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:20,680
don't you think?

944
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:21,920
To what?

945
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,180
It's a horrible future

946
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:25,520
for us to visage.

947
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,360
To visage.

948
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:26,660
All of us,

949
00:55:26,700 --> 00:55:27,400
you, me,

950
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:27,700
and...

951
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:28,620
He and we

952
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,720
and everybody

953
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:30,680
don't you see?

954
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:32,140
To imagine ourselves

955
00:55:32,140 --> 00:55:33,700
as a rockin'

956
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:34,740
rockin' robot.

957
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,540
Well...

958
00:55:36,540 --> 00:55:37,320
It really sucks, man.

959
00:55:37,380 --> 00:55:38,020
Just think of it

960
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:38,960
because it's kind of true.

961
00:55:39,080 --> 00:55:39,620
You know what I mean?

962
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,780
Well, that was

963
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,080
Tenacious D.'s point

964
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,480
when they said that line

965
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:44,460
in that famous,

966
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:45,300
famous song

967
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,520
that you probably

968
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:47,080
don't know.

969
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:49,940
I obviously don't know.

970
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,180
I wouldn't have tried

971
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:51,400
to start...

972
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:51,920
Are you familiar

973
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:52,540
with the band

974
00:55:52,540 --> 00:55:53,940
called Tenacious D.?

975
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:55,160
Of course.

976
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:55,820
Okay.

977
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:57,100
Well, I never know.

978
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:57,780
You're kind of

979
00:55:57,780 --> 00:55:58,620
old, you know.

980
00:55:58,640 --> 00:55:59,740
I didn't know about them

981
00:55:59,740 --> 00:56:00,460
until they'd already

982
00:56:00,460 --> 00:56:01,300
broken up

983
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:02,180
and been, you know,

984
00:56:02,180 --> 00:56:03,380
old for ten years.

985
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,040
older than even you.

986
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:05,320
Princess,

987
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:06,120
we can sing

988
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:07,180
every one of their songs

989
00:56:07,180 --> 00:56:07,840
by heart,

990
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,700
but we didn't learn them

991
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:09,580
until after they were

992
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:10,880
already old and broke up.

993
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:12,620
Figures,

994
00:56:12,620 --> 00:56:13,560
like everything else,

995
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:13,880
you know.

996
00:56:13,920 --> 00:56:14,560
We get on to

997
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,480
the new cool thing

998
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,460
long after everybody else

999
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,900
dropped it.

1000
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,080
Oh, that's because

1001
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:21,840
we already did

1002
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:22,620
the new cool thing

1003
00:56:22,620 --> 00:56:23,840
ten years before them.

1004
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:24,400
Yeah.

1005
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:25,660
Twenty years before.

1006
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:26,100
Yeah.

1007
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:28,040
Yeah, we were

1008
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,800
Tenacious D.

1009
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:30,220
before Tenacious D. was.

1010
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:30,900
Wait a minute.

1011
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:31,600
What am I talking about?

1012
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:31,920
That's right.

1013
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:33,880
Yeah, and we were

1014
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:34,740
South Park, too.

1015
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:35,680
We just weren't

1016
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:36,460
quite as good.

1017
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:40,580
Or in California

1018
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,480
or something.

1019
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:43,980
None of us were

1020
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:45,120
as in California.

1021
00:56:46,220 --> 00:56:47,020
Well, now you're

1022
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:47,660
taking me to

1023
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:47,980
the blessed

1024
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:49,340
oblivion again

1025
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,940
when I can't

1026
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:52,060
come out right out

1027
00:56:52,060 --> 00:56:52,420
and say,

1028
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:53,720
I don't know

1029
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:54,080
what the hell

1030
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:54,920
you're talking about.

1031
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:55,560
Right on.

1032
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:56,740
And friends,

1033
00:56:56,840 --> 00:56:57,680
that's why you're

1034
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:58,200
listening to

1035
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,060
The Hour of Slack

1036
00:56:59,060 --> 00:56:59,940
from the Church

1037
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,220
of the Subgenius.

1038
00:57:01,300 --> 00:57:02,060
And we've got

1039
00:57:02,060 --> 00:57:03,180
a new address, folks.

1040
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:04,860
Got that pencil ready?

1041
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,900
We'll be back

1042
00:57:06,900 --> 00:57:07,740
to Cleveland Heights,

1043
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:10,460
but we're mostly

1044
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,800
at Post Office Box 807

1045
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:19,920
Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1046
00:57:21,380 --> 00:57:22,120
And we tried to get

1047
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,220
Box 808

1048
00:57:24,220 --> 00:57:25,420
for reasons

1049
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:26,040
that you,

1050
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:27,020
you would understand

1051
00:57:27,020 --> 00:57:27,980
if you wrote down

1052
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:28,600
those numbers

1053
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,400
and then put quotes

1054
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:30,100
on either side

1055
00:57:30,100 --> 00:57:30,600
of the eight.

1056
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:33,020
But it was taken.

1057
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:35,380
And that means

1058
00:57:35,380 --> 00:57:36,160
I have to find out

1059
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:36,640
the name of

1060
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:37,920
whoever owns 808

1061
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,600
and arrange

1062
00:57:40,600 --> 00:57:43,680
a little vacation.

1063
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:46,340
Perhaps he may

1064
00:57:46,340 --> 00:57:48,220
be convinced

1065
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:49,500
to disappear.

1066
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:50,600
You might just want

1067
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,980
to make him an offer

1068
00:57:51,980 --> 00:57:52,860
he can't refuse.

1069
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,660
Well, that would be hard

1070
00:57:55,660 --> 00:57:56,080
because we're not

1071
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:56,320
going to be able

1072
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:56,320


1073
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,300
The offers I'd make

1074
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:58,120
that I could afford

1075
00:57:58,120 --> 00:57:58,500
to make

1076
00:57:58,500 --> 00:58:00,040
are easily refused.

1077
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:02,240
Yep.

1078
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,000
That's it for 23 years.

1079
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:07,040
And friends,

1080
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:08,680
this has been

1081
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:09,220
Hour of Slack

1082
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:11,580
number 1,650.

1083
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:14,300
1,650 shows.

1084
00:58:15,020 --> 00:58:17,080
Almost a fresh one

1085
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:18,300
almost every single week

1086
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:20,100
for 37 years

1087
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,780
or some such craziness.

1088
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:23,220
Oh, God.

1089
00:58:23,720 --> 00:58:24,340
Every...

1090
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:25,560
And it's in 9 o'clock

1091
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,080
at 9 o'clock.

1092
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:27,720
9 o'clock on Sundays

1093
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:29,020
in most...

1094
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:30,400
in a lot of the stations.

1095
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:31,140
Yeah.

1096
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:33,040
And two of the stations

1097
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:34,660
are 89.3 FM.

1098
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:36,340
Strangely enough.

1099
00:58:36,420 --> 00:58:36,680
Almost...

1100
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,940
In completely different cities.

1101
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:38,460
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1102
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,180
Yep.

1103
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:41,540
Yep, friends.

1104
00:58:41,600 --> 00:58:42,560
We're back in Texas

1105
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:43,900
but we're not in Dallas.

1106
00:58:44,020 --> 00:58:44,540
So,

1107
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:46,880
everything's cool, baby.

1108
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:47,220
Cool.

1109
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:49,520
Cool.

1110
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:51,720
Funky.

1111
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,320
Yeah.

1112
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:56,360
Yeah.

1113
00:58:56,360 --> 00:58:57,340
We didn't get down.

1114
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,320
Boy, that hurt my jaw.

1115
00:59:10,060 --> 00:59:10,760
Hey, hey.

1116
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:11,500
I know what offer

1117
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:12,320
we can make.

1118
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:14,900
NeighborWorld.

1119
00:59:15,540 --> 00:59:16,960
NeighborWorld is still in print.

1120
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:18,060
Woo-hoo!

1121
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,500
Yeah, I've got 20 copies

1122
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:20,520
in a box up there.

1123
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:20,980
All right.

1124
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:22,200
Well, 18 copies

1125
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,440
because I sent...

1126
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,200
I think I sent one

1127
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,080
to the...

1128
00:59:26,620 --> 00:59:26,840
to...

1129
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:30,280
Canada today.

1130
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:30,960
Ah.

1131
00:59:31,240 --> 00:59:31,840
Yeah, it was Canada.

1132
00:59:32,440 --> 00:59:33,620
They cost about...

1133
00:59:33,620 --> 00:59:35,200
They cost like 11 bucks

1134
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,440
to send them to Canada.

1135
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,940
And they pay...

1136
00:59:37,940 --> 00:59:38,900
They have to pay extra.

1137
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:41,000
But yeah, Dave.

1138
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:41,440
Friends,

1139
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,500
NeighborWorld is out.

1140
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,520
It's Dave's book.

1141
00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:45,280
It's great.

1142
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:46,520
It's amazing.

1143
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:47,540
And I know how many

1144
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:48,560
of you have bought it.

1145
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,080
Only about 35 or so.

1146
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:52,220
That's ridiculous.

1147
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,500
Come on.

1148
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,280
It really is...

1149
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:55,660
I think I've given out

1150
00:59:55,660 --> 00:59:56,080
that many copies.

1151
00:59:56,080 --> 00:59:56,320
I've given out

1152
00:59:56,320 --> 00:59:57,380
to my friends

1153
00:59:57,380 --> 00:59:58,700
who aren't my friends

1154
00:59:58,700 --> 00:59:59,760
but decided they can get

1155
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:00,220
something free

1156
01:00:00,220 --> 01:00:00,880
because I'm like,

1157
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:01,640
I'm so, you know.

1158
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:02,360
Right.

1159
01:00:02,420 --> 01:00:04,200
Well, I also know

1160
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,000
how many you got.

1161
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,580
Not that many.

1162
01:00:07,080 --> 01:00:08,100
So, so...

1163
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:09,780
Yeah, just

1164
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,460
subgenius.com

1165
01:00:12,340 --> 01:00:12,860
You'll...

1166
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:14,540
Currently, right now

1167
01:00:14,540 --> 01:00:15,620
on subgenius.com

1168
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:16,900
I still have a...

1169
01:00:17,620 --> 01:00:18,660
a promo

1170
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,180
for the Subgenius movie

1171
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,440
even though they raised

1172
01:00:21,440 --> 01:00:22,960
their 200,000 bucks.

1173
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:24,100
Can you believe that?

1174
01:00:24,480 --> 01:00:25,180
I can't believe it.

1175
01:00:25,180 --> 01:00:25,800
And thanks, everybody.

1176
01:00:25,800 --> 01:00:25,960
Thank you, buddy,

1177
01:00:26,060 --> 01:00:27,420
who contributed to that.

1178
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:28,720
But yeah, they raised

1179
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:29,320
the 200,000.

1180
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:29,980
But I've left

1181
01:00:29,980 --> 01:00:32,240
one of the fundraiser

1182
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,240
videos of me

1183
01:00:33,980 --> 01:00:35,360
and mighty celebrity

1184
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:36,500
Matt Groening.

1185
01:00:37,080 --> 01:00:38,020
So whenever any

1186
01:00:38,020 --> 01:00:38,760
of my enemies

1187
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:39,600
goes to

1188
01:00:40,420 --> 01:00:41,240
subgenius.com

1189
01:00:41,240 --> 01:00:41,840
let me show you.

1190
01:00:41,880 --> 01:00:42,640
It's always the same.

1191
01:00:42,780 --> 01:00:43,320
It hadn't changed

1192
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,440
in 25 years.

1193
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:45,180
Just look at this.

1194
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:47,200
And nobody cares

1195
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,120
about subgenius.

1196
01:00:48,140 --> 01:00:48,940
And there's me

1197
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:50,380
and the creator

1198
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,420
of The Simpsons

1199
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:52,460
saying,

1200
01:00:52,540 --> 01:00:52,900
come on,

1201
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:53,420
give your money

1202
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,020
to subgeniuses now.

1203
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:55,240
Now,

1204
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,260
hawk it up.

1205
01:00:57,020 --> 01:00:57,840
Hack it up.

1206
01:00:57,840 --> 01:00:58,400
Hawk it up.

1207
01:00:59,640 --> 01:01:00,820
Hawk it up this way.

1208
01:01:00,900 --> 01:01:01,220
Yeah, man.

1209
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:02,260
And there was...

1210
01:01:02,260 --> 01:01:03,340
And they saw you, too.

1211
01:01:03,380 --> 01:01:04,180
The people who followed

1212
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:04,920
the fundraiser

1213
01:01:04,920 --> 01:01:06,300
saw Lonesome Cowboy Dave

1214
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:08,060
sitting there

1215
01:01:08,060 --> 01:01:08,720
telling him to

1216
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:10,280
kickstart this program

1217
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:11,640
with your left foot.

1218
01:01:12,780 --> 01:01:13,760
That was real funny.

1219
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:14,420
Is that the foot I use?

1220
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:14,960
Yeah.

1221
01:01:15,000 --> 01:01:15,940
Everybody loved...

1222
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:17,000
Everybody loved everything

1223
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:17,540
and they all...

1224
01:01:17,540 --> 01:01:18,200
And they spent...

1225
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,220
And they got the 200,000 bucks.

1226
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:20,680
Yep.

1227
01:01:21,640 --> 01:01:22,080
Wow.

1228
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:22,640
Amazing.

1229
01:01:22,640 --> 01:01:23,220
That was the goal?

1230
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:24,720
Yeah.

1231
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:25,340
Yeah.

1232
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:26,940
They had to have that much...

1233
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:27,940
They had to raise that much

1234
01:01:27,940 --> 01:01:29,760
or they wouldn't get any of it.

1235
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:31,720
Now, it could be that...

1236
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:32,380
Right.

1237
01:01:32,580 --> 01:01:33,500
That they knew

1238
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,320
they could top off

1239
01:01:35,320 --> 01:01:37,040
whatever was left

1240
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,080
if they had to.

1241
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,700
Or somebody would.

1242
01:01:39,840 --> 01:01:40,440
Bob would.

1243
01:01:40,600 --> 01:01:41,800
If nobody else did,

1244
01:01:41,860 --> 01:01:43,500
Bob would have topped it off.

1245
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:45,100
But they actually made it

1246
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:45,740
fair and square.

1247
01:01:46,820 --> 01:01:47,860
And I had to...

1248
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:48,720
In fact, I just...

1249
01:01:48,720 --> 01:01:50,440
I had to sign

1250
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:52,780
all these rare subgenius things

1251
01:01:52,780 --> 01:01:54,240
that we were mailing

1252
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:55,000
to the control room.

1253
01:01:55,020 --> 01:01:55,320
And I had to write

1254
01:01:55,320 --> 01:01:56,040
to the contributors as rewards.

1255
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:58,400
Like 50 first edition

1256
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,180
subgenius pamphlet number one.

1257
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,180
Signed

1258
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,580
by Reverend Stang.

1259
01:02:03,780 --> 01:02:05,400
Even though the copyright inside

1260
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:06,940
says Douglas St. Clair Smith.

1261
01:02:07,080 --> 01:02:07,840
That's how you know

1262
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:08,700
it's a first edition.

1263
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,280
So, there you go.

1264
01:02:11,780 --> 01:02:12,820
Subgenius.com.

1265
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:13,820
Neighborworld.

1266
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,160
Subgenius Movie.

1267
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:16,560
Book of the Subgenius.

1268
01:02:16,620 --> 01:02:17,400
They're all out there.

1269
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,280
And this is the part of the show

1270
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,260
that won't be on the public radio...

1271
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:22,400
On the radio broadcast.

1272
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:24,080
Because we can't

1273
01:02:24,080 --> 01:02:26,380
try to raise money there.

1274
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:27,640
But we can do it on the internet.

1275
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,120
Yes.

1276
01:02:29,180 --> 01:02:30,260
What delights

1277
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:31,980
the weight of the listener

1278
01:02:31,980 --> 01:02:32,520
and reader

1279
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:34,500
of all such tomes

1280
01:02:34,500 --> 01:02:35,120
and so forth.

1281
01:02:35,340 --> 01:02:35,660
Right.

1282
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:37,500
What delicious delight

1283
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:38,160
awaits them

1284
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:39,300
is they sit down

1285
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:40,740
in that plunky, fatty old chair

1286
01:02:40,740 --> 01:02:42,500
and lift their legs up real high

1287
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,000
and crank out a Weezer sound

1288
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:46,680
and just start reading

1289
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:48,040
different bibliotechs.

1290
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:48,920
That's what you do.

1291
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:50,840
Start reading them bibliotechs

1292
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,480
and texts

1293
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:53,080
and textees.

1294
01:02:54,080 --> 01:02:56,040
And you'll grow hair on your chest

1295
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,340
and other spots.

1296
01:02:57,460 --> 01:02:58,620
You'll squeak out Weezer sounds.

1297
01:02:58,860 --> 01:02:59,280
Huh?

1298
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:00,900
You'll squeak out Weezer sounds.

1299
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:01,520
Right.

1300
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:03,020
With joy.

1301
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:05,340
You'll be squeaking Weezer sound in joy.

1302
01:03:05,620 --> 01:03:07,940
When you spend that $35

1303
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,040
and procure your

1304
01:03:11,060 --> 01:03:12,520
Subgenius ordainment kit,

1305
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:14,260
which makes you a minister

1306
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:16,280
and you can perform weddings

1307
01:03:16,280 --> 01:03:18,380
and you can also read

1308
01:03:18,380 --> 01:03:19,960
the 25 or 30 things

1309
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:21,080
that come with the kit

1310
01:03:21,080 --> 01:03:22,840
that are pretty good.

1311
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:23,720
And...

1312
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:24,060
I've got...

1313
01:03:24,060 --> 01:03:24,060


1314
01:03:24,080 --> 01:03:25,160
I've got to change the address

1315
01:03:25,160 --> 01:03:27,100
on every single one

1316
01:03:27,100 --> 01:03:28,360
of those sheets of paper.

1317
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:31,800
That's what I said.

1318
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:36,360
So, Dave,

1319
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:37,320
it's the end of the show.

1320
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:38,300
Again.

1321
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:41,020
We have to end it,

1322
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,320
although we'll come back...

1323
01:03:43,800 --> 01:03:44,460
What's he...

1324
01:03:44,940 --> 01:03:46,960
He's on about something again.

1325
01:03:47,360 --> 01:03:48,220
Well, he's not talking

1326
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:48,860
into his phone.

1327
01:03:49,460 --> 01:03:50,620
Dave, what are you on about?

1328
01:03:50,740 --> 01:03:52,340
I was talking to a utensil

1329
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,200
and you couldn't hear me,

1330
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:53,580
could you?

1331
01:03:53,580 --> 01:03:53,940
No.

1332
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:54,620
No.

1333
01:03:55,200 --> 01:03:56,260
Oh, that's too bad.

1334
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:57,120
I thought it was going to make

1335
01:03:57,120 --> 01:03:58,140
a real exciting sound.

1336
01:03:58,460 --> 01:04:00,060
No, Reverend Stang was telling you

1337
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:01,560
that the show had come around

1338
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,460
to the end unbelievably again.

1339
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,440
Yeah, but we're going to

1340
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:08,440
cut back to it afterwards.
