1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,120
Svuhuhuhuhuhuhh

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,140
Svuhuhuhuhuhuhuhh

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,060
Svuhuhuhuhuhh

4
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:06,480
It sounds confusing.

5
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:11,420
And that can be helpful when trying to find out quickly who might be up to

6
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:15,980
The subgenius power of Svuhuhuhuhuhh

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,500
It really jumps out

8
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,620
Huuuhhuhuhuhuhh

9
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,840
Heel to Bob

10
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,460
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob

11
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:47,080
Bob is a rock and Bob is a tree. Bob is a bear and Bob is a bee. Bob is truth and Bob is lies. Bob is cakes and fruits and pies. Bob's my hassle, Bob's my watch. Bob's my sandwich, Bob's my crotch.

12
00:00:47,080 --> 00:01:00,080
Bob's my toothpick, Bob's my brain. Bob's an ugly yellow stain. Bob's a cactus, Bob's an itch. Bob is take off every stitch.

13
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:13,220
Bob's my master, Bob's my slave. Bob will rob me, Bob will save. Bob's my toaster, Bob's my fridge. Bob's my little sister Mitch.

14
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,580
Bob will cost you, Bob is free.

15
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:26,340
Bob's a lock and Bob's a key. In short, Bob Dobbs is the man who used your leg as a frying pan.

16
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:33,280
If your mind is a jar, you can pour down a sink. And the subgenius church is the missing link.

17
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:38,340
And thank you, Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

18
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:46,520
And now, something from the Book of the Subgenius Release Party at the Danceteria in New York City from 1983.

19
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:56,760
Back when I, your prayer partner, Reverend Stang, had to borrow from Reverend Jimmy Swagger because I was just a beginning preacher.

20
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:00,600
And I wasn't sure yet how Reverend Stang was supposed to sound.

21
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:13,440
But you see, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter how sinful you are. It don't matter how much you've had to kiss ass on some ignorant lout who happens to make more money than you.

22
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:16,820
You can still find slack.

23
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,320
Now, unfortunately, unfortunately, that doesn't set well with many.

24
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,940
No siree.

25
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:34,940
Most of you, most of you, most of you believe that you already have slack.

26
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,520
That ain't what Jesus said.

27
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,020
Broad is the way that leadeth to destruction.

28
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,060
Narrow is the way that leadeth to life.

29
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,520
And few there be that find it.

30
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,600
Few, he said.

31
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,060
So, you must ask yourself.

32
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:51,100
Why do you think you're a subgenius?

33
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,780
How do you know you have slack?

34
00:02:54,700 --> 00:03:00,760
As the prophet Hyperclete said, many hear the call, but few have correct change for the pay toilet.

35
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,020
Now, this is harsh.

36
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,040
This is harsh. It's blunt, but it's true.

37
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:15,520
Most of the churches in this country and Canada and around the world, they go by the name of subgenius or Christian or Hindu or Muslim.

38
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,640
Most of these.

39
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:22,380
Most of these churches do not teach a full gospel of slack and are by and large useless.

40
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:31,880
Most of the preachers, hundreds upon hundreds of thousands of preachers do not preach a full gospel of slack.

41
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,260
Most of them preach no slack at all.

42
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,740
But some do.

43
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:37,800
Some do.

44
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,600
Some do.

45
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,300
Thank God for the good churches.

46
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,780
And there are some, but they're precious few.

47
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,900
Most of the people.

48
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:47,060
Millions of people.

49
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:55,200
Millions upon millions of people all over the world do not know Bob, do not have slack, have never been re-killed in Bob's mighty fire.

50
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:59,180
And unless they get slack, they will die without Bob and be lost forever.

51
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:13,040
And here's another rant from Reverend Dr. Onan Kanabite written in October of the year the conspiracy calls 2018.

52
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,820
And it goes like this.

53
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:22,380
I am a subgenius.

54
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,740
I have invested no small amount of time and effort into being the subgenius I am.

55
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,760
I did it all for myself.

56
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,620
I'm not the subgenius I am for the approval of the conspiracy.

57
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:43,020
What I didn't predict, however, was how much the conspiracy didn't want or need me.

58
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:47,580
I'm the subgenius I am for the approval of the conspiracy and the need or approve or allow of the subgenius I have become.

59
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:55,480
It is the royal road to disappointment to expect a mean subgenius to be nice.

60
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,980
It is likewise so to expect a foolish subgenius to be wise instead of just funny.

61
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:05,100
An approach to reproach.

62
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:12,200
Attractive subgeni, such as myself, can never be expected to be hideous.

63
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,000
Not even typically.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,000


65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:19,200
even crawling out of my tent shortly before 7 a.m. on July 5th 1998 was I'd

66
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:27,100
less than immaculate expect Bob to make the sale and you rest easy but expect to

67
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:32,100
know how or when he'll make the sale and you'll get revenge on yourself for

68
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:38,940
things you haven't even done yet sound familiar the conspiracy is the

69
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:45,000
conspiracy it knows no other way to be or thing to do than just as you see it

70
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,840
here today what did you expect did you expect that you would be the subgenius

71
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,540
that you are and the conspiracy would say oh now that you've put it that way I

72
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:02,900
guess we should close up shop no sir and no ma'am the conspiracy is the grand

73
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:08,920
pecking order and you're here to get pecked not get your expectations slashed

74
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:08,920


75
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:17,000
the seven billion grinding gears of every subgenius on Mars and the one

76
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,080
harmonious well lubricated gear of the conspiracy all form a system all that

77
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:31,020
you see is a great impersonal machine that generates suffering which is the

78
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:37,880
food of the elder gods let the evidence puzzle itself out you cannot hope to

79
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,540
drop out

80
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:45,100
nor to elevate above this cosmic abattoir until such time as the angelic

81
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:53,520
intervention of the men from Planet X is manifest but this constant expectation

82
00:06:53,520 --> 00:07:01,540
this gnawing gnostic knowing you can drop like yesterday's beef the conspiracy

83
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:08,420
is going to keep doing what it does will you if you give up on yourself who is the

84
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:16,720
who is the cave it's a laser-backed fire hose of tears followed with all

85
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:22,880
gravity by your dissipation and death the subgenius I have become however

86
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:29,080
we'll get some yucks and grins on the way down I can stop being surprised by

87
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:37,420
anything that stifling surprise that immobilizing innovation just let it go

88
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:45,280
the world is more strange and terrible than any of us can know it's also funnier

89
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,840
and kinder and most of all you're not the world you're not the elder gods you're

90
00:07:52,840 --> 00:08:01,880
not the conspiracy and you're not J.R. Bob Dobbs you are yourself a free agent

91
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,560
able to send one dollar you are complete within yourself

92
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:19,200
efficient and whole you are a superior mutant this is your church

93
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:31,020
thank you Reverend Dr uncle onan cannabite for that fabulous rant and thank you cyber

94
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:35,820
chump for the music in the background from their moment of perfect happiness

95
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,960
wow that was great that was wonderful I hope it was self-explanatory

96
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:55,340
um and and we'll be hearing from him her or them again soon hey Dave I'm speaking of Dave

97
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:02,780
get this I was I was reading this um little weekly news magazine that that we get called The Week

98
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,920
and there is a review of Tom petty's latest album and of course he's been doozy and you're you're will be gods but I'm not minded and disheartened by the

99
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:16,060
dead for a while. It's his first post-humorous release. It's no greatest hits compilation.

100
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:23,420
It's lovingly compiled by his friends and doesn't have mega hits like Free Falling.

101
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:31,440
Instead, it has deep cuts, alternative takes, and 10 previously unreleased recordings. Get this,

102
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:42,480
one unreleased track, quote, Lonesome Dave, unquote, sounds like, quote, the purest slice

103
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,800
of classic rock and roll that Petty ever recorded.

104
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,200
Lonesome Dave. And I thought, well, you know, it's not the most creative, inventive name in the

105
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:11,240
world because cowboys used to call themselves Lonesome whatever it is, Lonesome Frankie,

106
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:18,180
Lonesome Guitar Slam, you know. And I think they knew a lot more people than they said they did,

107
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:23,200
especially if they worked in these burgers packs, which is just like a fart longer paradise.

108
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:24,940
It's horrible.

109
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,560
Well, Frank Zappa had his own pet Lonesome Cowboy, Bert.

110
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,420
Bert.

111
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,560
Bert.

112
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:40,960
Yeah. But that's no relation to you, right? Because there was Lonesome Cowboy Bill before,

113
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,660
wasn't there? And Lonesome Cowboy Fred?

114
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:49,100
There was a Lonesome Cowboy Dave song by the band Para Ubu. It had been 1980-something,

115
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,960
six years or seven years before.

116
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:52,720
Oh, I see.

117
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:59,080
And his name is also Dave, and they were jokingly calling him Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

118
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,220
Para Ubu.

119
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,380
Para Ubu.

120
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,440
Yeah.

121
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,200
An Ohio band.

122
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:08,280
Kind of like DeVore and some of those other Ohio bands.

123
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:14,120
Well, anyway, his Tom Petty song about you, Lonesome Dave, is on an album called

124
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,360
An American Treasure. So I guess they must consider you an American treasure.

125
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:25,460
I think you'd have to be pretty opulent and a speedmaster and a sidekick and a half-cracked

126
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:30,200
person to begin with everything, anything like that. That's the most ridiculous thing.

127
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:38,720
I didn't really understand what he said, but I can freely and uncontestably and uncontestably

128
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:45,880
that what you said was not a falsehood.

129
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:54,040
Right. And now to prove that we're not old and keep the show jazzy and peppy and exciting,

130
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,660
let's listen to this.

131
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,020
The conspiracy has been trying to squelch.

132
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:06,120
It's been trying to squelch abnormality since time began, practically. It goes so far back

133
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:10,140
and it's so ingrained in our culture that it's gotten to where the conspiracy leaders

134
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:16,020
don't have to do anything because it's an endless cycle of normalcy. It's the exact

135
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:18,260
opposite of what would be natural.

136
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:23,940
I am now learning to apply creative and corrective procedures and to bring back to normalcy and

137
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:29,440
a state of perfection any abnormality or imperfection found within any given manifestation

138
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,100
of matter.

139
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:32,400
Any given plane, any given depth.

140
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:40,460
I can easily do anything that I want to do. I can. I can. I'm a winner.

141
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,780
Pursuant to section 28A, article 4B, paragraph 2 of the internal security regulations, I

142
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:49,060
now hand over to you rejected applicate number 578293B021.

143
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,880
I saw light on his face.

144
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:54,800
Hey, when am I going to get paid?

145
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,600
Yeah, life sucks.

146
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:57,540
Yeah, life sucks.

147
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,340
I've had it up to here.

148
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,640
I hate myself.

149
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,180
I hate myself.

150
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,980
I hate everyone else.

151
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,500
I'm not going anywhere.

152
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:03,720
Can you hear me?

153
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,720
What the heck is going on out here anyway?

154
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,840
I need to talk to Bob.

155
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:07,420
Bob.

156
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:07,820
Bob.

157
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:08,200
Bob.

158
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:09,100
Bob.

159
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:09,540
Bob.

160
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:09,900
Bob.

161
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,180
Bob.

162
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:10,460
Bob.

163
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:10,600
Bob.

164
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:10,740
Bob.

165
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:10,820
Bob.

166
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:10,840
Bob.

167
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:10,840


168
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:10,980
Bob.

169
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,260
Bob.

170
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:11,320
Bob.

171
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,320


172
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,320


173
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:11,340
Bob.

174
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:11,340


175
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:11,340


176
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:12,460
Bob.

177
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:12,960


178
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:15,440
Bob.

179
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Bob.

180
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,300
Bob.

181
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:23,640
Bob.

182
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:24,860
Bob.

183
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:24,860


184
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:24,860


185
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:24,860


186
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,340
Crap.

187
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,340
But like I said, he's a bad guy.

188
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:28,340


189
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:28,660
Yes, he's too strong.

190
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:28,660


191
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:28,660


192
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:28,660


193
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:28,660


194
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:28,660


195
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:28,660


196
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:28,660


197
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:28,660


198
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:28,660


199
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,000
That's I mean you could mess with the stage when she sounded the跳.

200
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,280
Yeah.

201
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:35,500
I think it still seems like it's appropriate now.

202
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,440
I don't think that it's going to do so.

203
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,100
To any.

204
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,220
It seems like a great position.

205
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:51,180
show set in around 1920s and 30s very much a period piece as it were it's

206
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:59,840
really well written kind of reminds me of Deadwood and Breaking Bad it's kind

207
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:09,520
of excruciating and the reason I mention it is and it would not have any anything

208
00:14:09,520 --> 00:14:14,600
to do with Church of the subgenius except for the fact that several of us

209
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:20,240
really really like this show the name Peaky Blinders refers to a British

210
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:26,080
street street gang that really did exist although these stories are fictionalized

211
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:32,060
they were called the Peaky Blinders because they were they were very dapper

212
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:37,540
as violent gang members might go and they wore

213
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:39,020
peaked

214
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,500
canes

215
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:47,660
caps into which they sewed razor blades which they could then whip out and blind

216
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:52,500
people they were fighting with maybe just by slicing their forehead so their

217
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:58,980
blood ran into their eyes or if they were really mad they could blind somebody so

218
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,200
they've been glorified of course the family in this show are the good guys to

219
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:09,480
we the viewers because they're a little less bad than the other bad guys

220
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,940
that they're dealing with and yeah it's full of really quotable quotes and cool

221
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:16,260
lines but like this

222
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:25,020
how's your mother she says that when she's inside the noose she saw spirits

223
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:33,140
she's running sciences but people just come into the house to steal things told

224
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,760
me it's bad

225
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:35,280
not smart

226
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,780
not smart

227
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:39,100
you know it's remarkable

228
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,460
you know it's remarkable

229
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,200
This, but as she sees

230
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:42,880
Are real

231
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,680
Believe they're real

232
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,800
Believe it with her

233
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,140
And eventually

234
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,140
You can take the remembered noose

235
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,760
From around her neck

236
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:55,620
Like a horse

237
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,440
That's been choked off

238
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,820
I need you back, Polly

239
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:03,180
Paying whores for sex

240
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,440
Paying killers to kill

241
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,820
Yeah, nothing for nothing

242
00:16:06,820 --> 00:16:07,720
Poor Thomas

243
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:10,820
You know, our mother went this way

244
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,580
Spirits and ghosts

245
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:14,940
Tablets, fucking, fucking seances

246
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,400
Scaring us kids halfway to fucking death

247
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,160
Yeah, well

248
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,160
I'm not going that way

249
00:16:22,120 --> 00:16:23,120
Because in the smoke

250
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,240
I realised something

251
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,780
I'm just like you now

252
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,860
You and Arthur

253
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,200
I was dead in that noose

254
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,060
And then I was saved

255
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:37,700
And then I was saved

256
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,540
So everything from now on is extra

257
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,200
But what I didn't understand until today

258
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:44,820
Is when you're dead already

259
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,660
You're free

260
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,120
Um, yeah, Peaky Blinders

261
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:57,420
But the other reason

262
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:58,960
The reason that it's really

263
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:04,140
Well, this is my excuse for dragging it into the show

264
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:05,480
The theme song

265
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,340
Red Right Hand

266
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:10,900
By Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds

267
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,940
Is

268
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,420
Well, if you listen to the lyrics

269
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:18,240
It might as well be about

270
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,260
B-B-B-Bob

271
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:33,700
Take a little walk to the edge of town

272
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,800
And go across the track

273
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:40,280
Where the viaduct looms

274
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,120
Like a bird of doom

275
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,540
As it shifts

276
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:45,220
And cracks

277
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,320
Where secrets lie

278
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:50,380
In the border fires

279
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,480
In the humming wires

280
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,520
Hey man, you know you're never coming back

281
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,880
Across the square

282
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,940
Across the bridge

283
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:59,200
Across the mills

284
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:00,320
Across the stacks

285
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,980
On a gathering storm

286
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,240
Comes a tall handsome man

287
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:07,700
And he's a man of his word

288
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:07,700


289
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:07,700


290
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:07,700


291
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:07,700


292
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,160
In a dusty black coat

293
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:11,580
With a red right hand

294
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:22,640
He'll wrap you in his arms

295
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,620
Tell you that you've been a good boy

296
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:30,960
He'll rekindle all the dreams

297
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,820
That took you a lifetime to destroy

298
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,680
He'll reach the sky

299
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,180
Deep into the hole

300
00:18:39,180 --> 00:18:41,160
Heal your shrinking soul

301
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,020
But there won't be a single thing

302
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,320
That you can do

303
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:46,680
He's a god

304
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,680
He's a man

305
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,720
He's a ghost

306
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:49,760
He's a guru

307
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,860
They're whispering his name

308
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:57,000
Through this disappearing land

309
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,100
But hidden in his coat

310
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,140
Is a red right hand

311
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,080
guitar solo

312
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:05,440
guitar solo

313
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,360
guitar solo

314
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:07,440
guitar solo

315
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:07,680
guitar solo

316
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:07,680


317
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:08,860
guitar solo

318
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,500
You don't owe no money

319
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,200
Will get you some

320
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,720
You don't have no car

321
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,620
Will get you one

322
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,880
You don't have no self respect

323
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,200
You feel like an insect

324
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,480
Well don't you worry buddy

325
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,220
Cause here he comes

326
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,820
Through the ghettos

327
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:37,600
And the bars

328
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:37,660
Through the ghettos

329
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:40,240
Wander Barry and the Sloan

330
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:47,040
His shadow is cast wherever he stands

331
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:51,260
Stacks of green paper in his red right hand

332
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,760
vas friend

333
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:16,760


334
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:16,760


335
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:16,760


336
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:16,760


337
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:16,760


338
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:16,760


339
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:16,760


340
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,920
Whoa now

341
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,400
He's the one

342
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,460
who eat to plants

343
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:22,460


344
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:22,460


345
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,220
no

346
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:37,420
нять

347
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,560
guitar solo

348
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
guitar solo

349
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:08,420
You'll see him in your nightmares

350
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,740
You'll see him in your dreams

351
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:17,000
He'll appear out of nowhere

352
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,540
He'll appear out of nowhere

353
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,940
But he ain't what he seems

354
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:24,960
You'll see him in your head

355
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,920
On the TV screen

356
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,980
Hey, buddy, I'm warning you to turn it off

357
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,500
He's a goat, he's a god

358
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,600
He's a man, he's a guru

359
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:40,800
You're one microscopic cog

360
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,780
In his catastrophic plan

361
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:46,800
Designed and directed by his red right hand

362
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,560
guitar solo

363
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:54,960
guitar solo

364
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,720
guitar solo

365
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,180
guitar solo

366
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:03,660
guitar solo

367
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,240
guitar solo

368
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,920
guitar solo

369
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:07,960
guitar solo

370
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,300
guitar solo

371
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:08,920
guitar solo

372
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:09,040
guitar solo

373
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:12,600
Red Right Hand by Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds

374
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,360
The theme music that's used in the show Peaky Blinders

375
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,500
is a song by the famous band The Red Riding Hood.

376
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,420
Friends and neighbors of planet Earth,

377
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,100
I come to you from a long, long ways off.

378
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:30,280
I come from a planet that is similar to yours.

379
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:35,060
Your many fears, tensions, and frustrations are no longer ours.

380
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,240
I hate them with all my heart.

381
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:39,800
They are inhuman and to be destroyed.

382
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,000
What is your objective?

383
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,960
You are not ready, but we will still save you.

384
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,720
I'll be right here.

385
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:00,000
I was first contacted by a being from the planet Mars.

386
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:08,020
Now, this man was invisible to me, except that he did cast a shadow in the moonlight.

387
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:16,960
By 1998, every normal, mediocritan, pink boy, admin, Trekkie, and hippie

388
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,840
is going to be trying to get on board with the good ship dogs.

389
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:21,120
The great ship dogs.

390
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:21,840
The good ship dogs.

391
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:26,280
Or they're going to fry along with everybody else when those aliens get here.

392
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:30,720
Of course, such a prophecy immediately arises our cynicism.

393
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:36,000
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?

394
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,000
Perhaps.

395
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:43,700
Or is it just another of those prognostications which have haunted man through the ages?

396
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,320
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom could generally be dismissed out of hand,

397
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,420
but for the fact that many of Nostradamus's other prophecies have already been fulfilled.

398
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:57,820
But the old ones are coming back.

399
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,160
I'm going to let them through.

400
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,840
And Sam's old and birdies and bombs.

401
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:07,440
Good.

402
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:13,680
The tools of conquest do not necessarily come with bombs and explosions and force.

403
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:13,860
They're just a bunch of things that we can talk about.

404
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:20,700
They didn't take us off to space last X-Day, but the song, Take Me Off to Space,

405
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:27,840
originally done by the great Nenslow, seems to be one of the catchiest...

406
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,580
Well, we've used a lot on Hour of Slack, and it's on several of our music CDs,

407
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,000
because it's a great song.

408
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:41,280
And I wasn't there to record everything this last X-Day,

409
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,200
but Princess Wee and some other people at least got a partial recording of this wonderful moment

410
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,220
when the crowd suddenly spun...

411
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:53,500
They were in the process of burning the Bob dummy, which we do every year,

412
00:24:53,620 --> 00:25:01,520
and it turned into a group chorus of Take Me Off to Space, singing around the bonfire.

413
00:25:03,980 --> 00:25:10,700
There is a bomb, a smoke bomb in his heart, and one at the pipe.

414
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:11,260
All right.

415
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,600
He's got a smoke bomb in his heart.

416
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:18,160
What does he have in his arms? Sparklers? Roman candles?

417
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:19,560
He has us in his arms.

418
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,780
That's what I represent. Us.

419
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,820
Let the burning begin.

420
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,180
Burn, baby, burn!

421
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,440
Burn, Bobby, burn!

422
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,880
Burn, Bobby, burn!

423
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,920
Burn that Bob!

424
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,580
Burn that Bob!

425
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,100
I think that'll do it, Jase!

426
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,360
That was awesome!

427
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:49,260
Yo!

428
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,420
Woo!

429
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:51,220
Look at the sparklers.

430
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,400
Quiet.

431
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,780
He's sparkly.

432
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:56,320
Both drizzling with pixie dust.

433
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,880
Now maybe the sparklers will see it.

434
00:25:59,120 --> 00:25:59,180
Yeah.

435
00:25:59,600 --> 00:25:59,920
We'll see.

436
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:02,180
Deep step with word in your mouth.

437
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:02,640
Yeah!

438
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,000
There it goes.

439
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:12,000
The Bob sign has fallen.

440
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,420
Bob is ash.

441
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,200
Yeah.

442
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,140
What an asshole.

443
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,400
Bob is now ash.

444
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,780
Ashes to ashes.

445
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,220
Dust to dust.

446
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,900
Bob to space.

447
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:29,420
Hey, cattle mutilators, won't you let me join your crew?

448
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,960
Give me a knife, you bet your life I'll cut up cows for you.

449
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:37,980
I don't care if you're some kind of dog.

450
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,340
Now I guess they've been without a face.

451
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:45,780
So, come on down you saucerman and take me off to space.

452
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:46,480
Woo!

453
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,740
Take me off to space.

454
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:51,100
Take me off to space.

455
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:56,600
Come on down you saucerman and take me off to space.

456
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:59,420
Take me off to space.

457
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,060
Take me off to space.

458
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:07,480
Come on down you saucerman and take me off to space.

459
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:07,960
No!

460
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,760
Come on, you tiny robots with your little nipper paws.

461
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:17,780
You cross-eyed, got-tied aliens with nine and twenty paws.

462
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:23,520
Life is just a sucker's dream, and death is a disgrace.

463
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:29,160
So come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

464
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:32,060
Take me off to space.

465
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,400
Take me off to space.

466
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:39,400
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

467
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,780
Take me off to space.

468
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,080
Take me off to space.

469
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,400
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

470
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,080
That was awful.

471
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,300
That was awesome.

472
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,860
Who said it was awful?

473
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,080
Nope, it was awesome.

474
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:09,900
Awesome.

475
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:10,380
Awesome.

476
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,400
Who said it was awful?

477
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,600
Get that chewing gum out of your ears.

478
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,540
It was awfully nice.

479
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,420
Awesome.

480
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,320
It was awfully awesome.

481
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,800
It was awfully awesome.

482
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,060
It was awfully awesome.

483
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:21,920
It was awfully awesome.

484
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:22,040
It was awfully awesome.

485
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,040


486
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:22,800
We were awful.

487
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,580
Tremendously awfully awesome.

488
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:25,240
Yes.

489
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,580
We should have brought up that.

490
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:30,240
Will you change the guarantees of eternal salvation or triple your money back?

491
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,400
Okay, well we're back.

492
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:34,380
I'm back.

493
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:34,900
That was different.

494
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,040
Is this one supposed to be different or electrocutional?

495
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:40,340
We're back and electrocutional.

496
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:41,620
Okay.

497
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:42,540
Ready to go.

498
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:47,300
And when we go, that's when we say, thanks for listening.

499
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:51,100
This has been our Slack number 1700.

500
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:57,080
And for more information, check out subgenius.com.

501
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:04,380
It might tell you what kind of money you could spend to get some things, but we don't.

502
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:11,780
We can't on account of the kinds of stations, actual broadcast stations.

503
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,540
They're do-gooder stations, not commercial stations.

504
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:21,180
They're there for the public good, which means they can't do us any financial good.

505
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:21,440
Right.

506
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,580
Pantswitters, we call them sometimes.

507
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:25,940
Bedwetters.

508
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:26,440
Yeah.

509
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:33,580
I need to jump in here and say, no, this is actually show number 1700.

510
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,380
I'm sorry.

511
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:34,380


512
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:35,100
It's number 1701.

513
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,880
And because the holidays are upon us, that means it's time for Slack Friday again at

514
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:48,680
the subgenius.com distribution center from now until X-istlessness-mas.

515
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:52,000
The key word here is twofer.

516
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:59,400
If you were wondering about a really special gift for that as yet unordained subgenius

517
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:02,540
you know, and maybe even the one in the mirror.

518
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,360
Well, you might want to try this.

519
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:04,800
Check it out.

520
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,200
And that's all I'm allowed to say on this public version of the show.

521
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,000
So friends, you know what to do.

522
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,380
Yeah.

523
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,120
As usual, bend over.

524
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:19,460
You know where to stick it, don't you?

525
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,220
Take this show and stick it in your ear.

526
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,660
Both ears.

527
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,100
That's hysterical.

528
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:28,440
LaVora's treatment every time gets them.

529
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,660
Because it's got Bob in it.

530
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,660
It's got Bob in the sounds.

531
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,700
Well, I haven't had a whole lot of Bob this time.

532
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:35,600
Or has it?

533
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:36,280
Bob in the sacks.

534
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,280
I don't even know yet.

535
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,560
I don't think I've written very many mentions to Bob in the sack.

536
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:47,640
Oh, actually, you know, it depends on how much of the old media barrage stuff I use,

537
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:52,400
which I'm planning to retroactively, you see.

538
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:53,760
Yeah.

539
00:30:54,020 --> 00:31:01,700
We actually do the, in this time, this two weeks, we've been doing the credits before

540
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:06,940
we know what else we're going to play, besides playing ourselves in a movie.

541
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:09,500
Hey, who would play you in the Hollywood movie, Dave?

542
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:11,520
Stretch Wilbur.

543
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:14,500
Herman Goring.

544
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:16,560
No, think about it.

545
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,420
Who would play you?

546
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:22,540
Of course, I would be played by Johnny Depp, because we're practically like, well, the

547
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:24,780
younger Johnny Depp, we're like twins almost.

548
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:31,520
People keep, these jokers keep going, oh no, you'd be played by Tommy Chong or Willie Nelson.

549
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,320
Yeah.

550
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,360
What?

551
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,680
They're old.

552
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:41,300
You know, no, the young Stank and the old Stank could be played by Johnny Depp.

553
00:31:41,380 --> 00:31:43,980
We know he does weirdo characters, great.

554
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:54,540
But you know, Mel Gibson, of all people, played you in a movie called Conspiracy Theory in

555
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,380
the 90s.

556
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:59,860
He did in a, he played a taxi driver who babbled.

557
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,500
And he, he was a taxi driver.

558
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,940
He even wore a hat like you were wearing back then.

559
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:10,380
And he was doing an American, you know, Easter coaster kind of accent.

560
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:13,780
And it was like his mannerisms and everything.

561
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:18,560
Princess Wee and I both saw that movie and went, how the hell did he know about, he must

562
00:32:18,560 --> 00:32:23,160
have been listening to ESO, WCSB and Hour of Slack for years.

563
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,420
How could he be so anti-Semitic if he's going to do that?

564
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,420
Oh no, no, no.

565
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:28,880
You know?

566
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:31,480
No, no, no.

567
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,880
I mean, I think he's a schtick, but I'm afraid not.

568
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:38,260
So, so we can't have Mel Gibson play you anymore besides he's too old now.

569
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,160
So who would do it now?

570
00:32:41,180 --> 00:32:41,980
Woody Harrelson.

571
00:32:42,940 --> 00:32:44,520
No, he's too old now too.

572
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:45,900
Woody Harrelson.

573
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,320
Well, he's, he doesn't have a lot of hair on top, so that would be good.

574
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:53,880
Well, who could get any fat bald bastard?

575
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,800
Bill, how about Bill Murray?

576
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:00,860
Bill Murray, he was born on my birthday, so astrologically it would be incorrect.

577
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,460
It would be great if he was born on my birthday.

578
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:01,460


579
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:01,460


580
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:01,460


581
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:01,460


582
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:01,460


583
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:01,460


584
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:01,460


585
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:01,460


586
00:33:01,460 --> 00:33:02,080
Oh, really?

587
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:03,260
Yeah.

588
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:03,820
Huh.

589
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,820
So, so I got that going for me.

590
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:07,420
Yeah.

591
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,420
Yeah.

592
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,360
Uh, okay.

593
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,720
Well, Bill Murray as Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

594
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:20,620
Who, who is, uh, I'm trying to complete this logline.

595
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,800
I don't hear it.

596
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:23,820
I don't hear it.

597
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,680
Oh man, a two sentence logline.

598
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:28,380
You can't get too much bigger than two sentences.

599
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:29,800
One is ideal.

600
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:30,400
What?

601
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:30,440
Huh?

602
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,440
What?

603
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,440


604
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,440


605
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,440


606
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,440


607
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,440


608
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,440


609
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,440


610
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,440


611
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,440


612
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,440


613
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:31,440


614
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:33,200
What are you talking about?

615
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:34,440
What are you mumbling about now?

616
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,380
Loglines for scripts, you know, like when you're trying to get somebody interested in

617
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,540
buying a script, you write a logline.

618
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:44,500
Jim goes to Paris and meets up with more than he expects to hope to.

619
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,500
Oh, high concept.

620
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:47,640
Yeah.

621
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:48,160
Yeah.

622
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:52,860
If you can't explain the plot in one sentence, they're going to kick you out of the office.

623
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:54,360
Yeah.

624
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:54,900
Right.

625
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:58,200
You won't be allowed to participate in any of the activities afterwards.

626
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:00,360
You, you know what that means.

627
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:01,120
I don't know.

628
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:01,440
Well, I guess you're right.

629
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,440


630
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,440


631
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,440


632
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,440


633
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,440


634
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,440


635
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:01,440


636
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:06,560
I guess, yeah, so like with my, my subgenius movie screenplay, the logline would be

637
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:09,740
something like, what would it be?

638
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:12,520
Crazy guru destroys the world.

639
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:13,720
That's it.

640
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:22,500
I mean, if you want to be a little, and it's a comedy, but, but it's a comedy man.

641
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:25,900
And who would play Bob?

642
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:30,740
Well, Bob would have to either play himself or you do it with CG.

643
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:33,440
We can't, he can't play himself because he can't be photographed.

644
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,520
He overexposes the film and he glitches video.

645
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,100
But he could do it as ESPF or an ISNN.

646
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,120
CGI.

647
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,620
It would be performance capture.

648
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:49,500
I guess he could wear performance capture suit and play himself.

649
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:57,820
And then they could, then he, and he would look realer if he was CGI than he looks in

650
00:34:57,820 --> 00:35:00,040
real life because he already looks CGI.

651
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:00,720
Yeah.

652
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,940
And he could snapshot himself while he's being dead in the meantime.

653
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,240
I mean, it's creepy to look at, I've only seen Bob in person a few times, but it's,

654
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,080
you feel like it's the uncanny valley.

655
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:16,700
There's something not quite all real about him.

656
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:20,100
And so CGI would be perfect.

657
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,500
That would get my vote too, but I had my voting restricted.

658
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,240
I had, they changed the roles, the cinnamon rolls to the vagabonds.

659
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,700
Or Andy Serkis.

660
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:31,780
That Serkis performer.

661
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,700
He's real good with performance capture.

662
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:42,020
His American accent is not that great, but otherwise he's really, he certainly is.

663
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:47,040
I mean, he played King Kong and Gollum and all kinds of monsters and things.

664
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:54,760
And oh, that villain in that latest Star Wars movie, Murky or whatever his name is.

665
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:55,220
Gump.

666
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:55,940
I forget.

667
00:35:56,380 --> 00:35:56,800
Yeah.

668
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,500
Murky Gump.

669
00:35:57,660 --> 00:35:57,940
Yeah.

670
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:58,060
Yeah.

671
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:02,340
There's, God, boy, those things are lame.

672
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,680
The superhero, the Marvel movies.

673
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:06,620
I like those.

674
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:09,400
Wait, I gotta go unlock the sarcophagus.

675
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:09,940
Oh, what?

676
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:10,640
Oh, Dave's gone.

677
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:13,060
Friends, Dave's gone to unlock the sarcophagus.

678
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:20,660
Now we ended this show, I thought at some point about 10 minutes ago, but that doesn't

679
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:23,360
mean we can't just keep going on and on and on.

680
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:27,200
In fact, this, for all I know, this is the beginning of a third show.

681
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:33,620
Or it could be the beginning of the very first show of three shows, I suppose.

682
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:42,080
I've had to do a lot of reruns lately because the world was too much with me, as it were.

683
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:56,600
And we happy few had to make do with crappy poo, as it were, so to speak, in a way of

684
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,040
speaking.

685
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,660
And the man here.

686
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:03,540
But Dave's back, and now we can start again.

687
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,860
And now this.

688
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:08,840
Wow, the music ended just perfect with that.

689
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:09,940
Almost.

690
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,300
Keep the movie off-kilter.

691
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:18,140
There are second generation subgeniuses.

692
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:21,120
And there are third generation subgeniuses.

693
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:24,360
And yay, even fourth generation subgeniuses.

694
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,720
Men, women, and mutants.

695
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:28,600
Born into the church.

696
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:35,820
Who obtained their membership packet with their very birth certificates.

697
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,720
And yet there are also first generation subgeniuses.

698
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:47,220
Not necessarily those who invested early and got in on the ground floor of a lucrative

699
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:53,800
mail-order mind control cult in the 1980s, but first generation subgeniuses who have

700
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,020
found the church, even today.

701
00:37:56,720 --> 00:37:57,840
Even yourself, perhaps.

702
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:08,900
Those who had, at one time, a human name before they found their subgenius name, or it found

703
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:14,980
them, due to their proclivities, skills, or lack thereof.

704
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:23,700
But did you know that every subgenius has a subgenius that they are becoming?

705
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:25,180
It's true.

706
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:33,780
I, Reverend Dr. Onan Canobite, did not know this until quite a time in my subgenius career.

707
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:42,700
I learned that there is a subgenius who is to me as I am to the name I was born with.

708
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,700
The name you'll see on my driver's license.

709
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,500
The name you'll see on my arrest record.

710
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,160
Yes, there is this subgenius.

711
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:53,840
Far more martian than I am.

712
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:55,160
I am a mere urchin.

713
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:00,320
subgenius, but there is a Martian subgenius that I am becoming. I even know his name,

714
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:10,920
but I dare not speak it in this open system. You, too, may have a subgenius that you are becoming.

715
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:20,660
It is not necessarily a better subgenius, only a different one. It's up to you. You can explore

716
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:27,480
that subgenius, or let them explore you in the privacy of your own home, one would hope,

717
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:35,620
or you can become the best subgenius that you are today. The choice is yours.

718
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:42,860
Just make sure that, if nothing else, you do not think that the subgenius you are becoming is

719
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:50,640
J.R. Bob Dobbs. He is himself, completely, not in the way that you are yourself,

720
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:56,820
but he is himself, completely. Can you hear the difference? Yes, you can.

721
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:06,820
He was born himself. He was born complete, whole, and perfect. A perfect fool, perhaps,

722
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:16,880
but perfect nonetheless. Complete, and whole, and holy, and a whole, into which you may pour

723
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,080
your attention, and devotion, and hatred, and anxieties.

724
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:26,880
He is a perfect recipient of your blame. But he is not you, and you are not him.

725
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:35,060
You may thank your lucky stars that you have not yet, today, met, in person, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

726
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:40,940
You have not smelled the ichor that emanates from his very pipe.

727
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,820
But should you meet Bob, you will know that you are not him. Merely look at any available Dobbshead.

728
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:56,480
Your very active looking indicates that you exist as one who looks at the Dobbshead.

729
00:40:56,620 --> 00:41:01,260
The Dobbshead does look at you, and through you. Through you in the sense of

730
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:11,580
your perception in your daily life continues to be a feed to the Bob with a million eyes.

731
00:41:12,300 --> 00:41:20,640
You cannot stop seeing for Bob once Bob sees you. It merely takes an exposure to the Bob with a million eyes to see you.

732
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,420
You can trust what you see and not eventually what Bob preaches.

733
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,180
But you already know that.

734
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:26,440
Marρχиты seniabitات

735
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:28,700
You have already equipped yourself for the handles beyond understanding.

736
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,940
Preach the words and send them to the God within you.

737
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,580
Review your knowledge of authority and what God Bath did for you.

738
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:35,900
Order your life through the Word of God and when all of my words reflect your Almost Construction111

739
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:50,460
arus Eichmannum you turn into a Patron for it viewers who made the choice to be luego Rockefühl,

740
00:41:50,460 --> 00:41:57,360
Believe me. And should you thwart that subgenius from coming into being, they will know.

741
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:06,000
Fortunately, it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if they know or don't know that you have thwarted their coming into being,

742
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:12,800
because you do exist now. You have heard these words that I am saying to you by way of this transmission.

743
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:17,860
It is a simple fact.

744
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:33,820
Yeah. I like this background music by CyberChump from their moment of perfect happiness.

745
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:41,120
And I have another Eddie Romanoff rant here.

746
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:50,440
I think he's a junior scientist, kind of like me, because I'm not sure how he's going to do it.

747
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:56,620
I don't know how this came up. It may have been apropos of nothing, but I like the way he said it.

748
00:42:58,860 --> 00:42:59,840
And I quote,

749
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:06,580
A Lemurian wombat gigging machine? I haven't seen one of those in ages.

750
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:17,760
Oh, those long summer nights spent gigging for radio psychoactive frogs in the jungles around Dobstown with our little wind-up wombats.

751
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:20,360
We'd catch a few to lick.

752
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:28,360
And then trip balls for days and get some paid time off at the mines, because we'd pee hot.

753
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:34,100
The boss knew what was going on, but as long as we didn't get carried away, he was cool about it.

754
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:38,160
He was just glad we weren't putting heavy water in the water cooler again.

755
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:44,680
You also had to remember to keep shining them right in the eyes until after you licked them.

756
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,640
And always lick with the grain.

757
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:49,920
Otherwise, you'd get a dart in your face.

758
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:53,060
That's when you'd find out why they called them one-step frogs.

759
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:59,000
My brother caught a dart once, and he ended up spending a long night standing there like a jackass,

760
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:06,640
getting poured on by a typhoon until Dad could come out and pull up the sod he was standing on to get him to the hospital.

761
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:15,340
Fun fact, gigging-related deaths is how the Lemurian wombat went extinct in the first place,

762
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:18,180
making them the only species of animal.

763
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,020
To ever go extinct.

764
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,860
From overhunting something else.

765
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:28,140
Thank you, Eddie Romanoff.

766
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:33,660
You know, I often wonder if Eddie Romanoff might not...

767
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:38,180
I mean, as far as I know, he or she is a stranger.

768
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:43,700
But because I don't know, and this is Church of the Subgenius,

769
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:50,080
that means Eddie Romanoff could really be puzzling evidence.

770
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,960
Hanging out on the Scrub Genius Forum, using a different name, just to mess with me.

771
00:44:57,120 --> 00:45:00,520
Or one of my old high school buddies,

772
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:05,240
who's not even that big of a subgenius fan or anything,

773
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:09,140
but he might be screwing with me just to...

774
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:11,380
I mean, he could write stuff like this.

775
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,920
Could it be Friday Jones returned from in hiding?

776
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,420
Pretending to be Eddie Romanoff?

777
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:21,040
Eddie Romanoff.

778
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,680
In the Church of the Subgenius,

779
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:32,480
the truth is slippery and facts are multi-tentacled.

780
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,440
And now this.

781
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:39,880
From PR News in Washington,

782
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:43,880
I'm sexually assaulted by a secret atomic humpback whale

783
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,860
at a secret warehouse just outside the capital of the USA.

784
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:49,640
That won't happen.

785
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,580
On Wall Street, 54% and 39 Twitter happy states.

786
00:45:53,740 --> 00:45:56,180
At the height of 39% and 54 states,

787
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:59,980
fresh Chesapeake blue crab says effective October 1st.

788
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:01,400
This is PR News in Washington.

789
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:04,200
Thank you, Lemur.

790
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:10,480
And we've gotten some submissions of music from a musician

791
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,660
by the name of Morgan Gutentag.

792
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:22,020
Yeah, he has sent in once a year or so.

793
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:27,240
He'll whip out something that somehow cries out for an hour of slack.

794
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,420
This particular one, I have been making promises,

795
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,740
quote, to spiders, unquote.

796
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,060
This is the most earwormy thing.

797
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:40,760
Tell me if you disagree.

798
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:42,640
Is this an earworm or what?

799
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:47,060
I've been making promises by Morgan Gutentag.

800
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:55,380
I have been making promises

801
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:59,760
round here, round here.

802
00:47:00,340 --> 00:47:04,560
But I have been breaking promises

803
00:47:04,560 --> 00:47:08,860
all year, all year.

804
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:13,620
I have been making promises

805
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:18,000
round here, round here.

806
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:22,820
But I have been breaking promises

807
00:47:22,820 --> 00:47:27,160
all year, all year.

808
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:31,980
I have been making promises

809
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,240
round here, round here.

810
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,200
But I have been breaking promises

811
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:43,640
all year, all year.

812
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:45,440
all year.

813
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:50,260
I have been making promises

814
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:54,720
round here, round here.

815
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:54,920


816
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:59,360
But I have been breaking promises

817
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:03,700
All year, all year.

818
00:48:05,620 --> 00:48:08,400
Dog 5 little spiders, keep your eyeballs,

819
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:11,680
or you stay awake too long.

820
00:48:11,940 --> 00:48:13,600
Nibble, nibble.

821
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:18,520
You were very scary and can't really help me God

822
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:26,840
All year I have been making promises

823
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:31,280
Round here and round here

824
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,960
But I have been breaking promises

825
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,420
All year, all year

826
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:45,120
I have been making promises

827
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:49,560
Round here and round here

828
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:54,260
But I have been breaking promises

829
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:58,580
All year, all year

830
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:06,500
Well Dave, I'm starting to get hungry

831
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,320
Well I'm already hungry, I'm going to go lay down now

832
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:10,400
Let's go

833
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:10,900
I'm going to lay down like a dog

834
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:13,460
I'm actually going to sit here

835
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:16,220
Now that I've got my rig set up

836
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:19,640
I'm going to sit here and read stuff

837
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:25,720
To intersperse with other shows to come

838
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:28,760
Because I've been so behind Dave

839
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:31,480
I've been behind, I've been sick in my mind

840
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:32,960
And fretting

841
00:49:32,960 --> 00:49:36,140
You know Ken Kesey, the great Ken Kesey

842
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:39,400
Reverend Hardly Visible in Church of the Subgenius said

843
00:49:41,580 --> 00:49:43,520
Fretting is the only sin

844
00:49:44,860 --> 00:49:49,320
And I've been a real sinner for the last four months

845
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,300
Me too

846
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,200
Some of my fretting is at an end

847
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:57,740
Or at least it's postponed for a while

848
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,820
But I'm sure something else will come along

849
00:50:01,820 --> 00:50:03,360
There's always something to fret about

850
00:50:03,360 --> 00:50:05,200
Even though it doesn't do you any good

851
00:50:06,340 --> 00:50:08,480
I mean preparing for the worst

852
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,760
That makes common sense

853
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:12,640
Ew

854
00:50:14,140 --> 00:50:15,180
But fretting

855
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,280
That's

856
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:20,000
Is it going to make things worse

857
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,460
Or is it going to make things better

858
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,680
Well it's a moot point

859
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,880
Because you're probably just going to fret anyway

860
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,760
I couldn't stop fretting

861
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:33,200
I got to where I'd wake up in the morning

862
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:34,180
And go look at myself

863
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:36,980
You know be forced to look at myself in the mirror

864
00:50:36,980 --> 00:50:37,280
And go

865
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:39,680
Damn I look worried

866
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,140
I didn't know I was worried

867
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:43,680
But I look worried

868
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,320
Yes I've had people say

869
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,440
Are you alright

870
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,420
Have you been okay

871
00:50:49,420 --> 00:50:50,760
And I say what do you mean

872
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:52,300
Well last time I saw you

873
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,560
You looked like you were worried about something

874
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:56,880
Were you just in pain or

875
00:50:57,540 --> 00:50:58,820
That's all it was just the

876
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:03,180
Just the unending discomfort of life

877
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,620
And pain

878
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,600
And uh

879
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:08,860
All our friends that are

880
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,500
In the hospital

881
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,140
Life can be very discomfortable

882
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,020
Yeah

883
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:16,640
Well it kind of goes with the territory

884
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:18,960
It's tough being a large mammal

885
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:20,380
There I said it again

886
00:51:20,380 --> 00:51:21,900
Another week

887
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,240
I say that every week

888
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:25,760
For one reason or another

889
00:51:26,820 --> 00:51:27,800
Here's another one

890
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:29,740
I think I've said this three weeks in a row now

891
00:51:29,740 --> 00:51:30,440
Fair

892
00:51:30,440 --> 00:51:32,680
Fair is where you take your pig

893
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:33,840
And hope to win a prize

894
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:35,640
Mm-hmm

895
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:40,120
Yes my sister was the one who taught me that one

896
00:51:41,780 --> 00:51:42,560
It's deep

897
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:44,780
It's a it's deep

898
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:48,060
Here's another one that's that's both deep and kind of round

899
00:51:49,120 --> 00:51:53,000
She's so bow-legged she couldn't hem up a hog in a ditch

900
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,680
That's just pretty replicant

901
00:51:58,680 --> 00:52:00,340
I mean I just like

902
00:52:00,340 --> 00:52:02,500
You know nice words coming together

903
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:04,460
That don't make a lick of sense at all

904
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,580
No

905
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:08,920
Well I love those country witticisms you know

906
00:52:09,740 --> 00:52:10,920
We could just say

907
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:11,440
Quaint

908
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:13,960
Yeah you could just eat the pig

909
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:15,200
Putting a horseshoe on a

910
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,920
On a fried chicken or something

911
00:52:16,920 --> 00:52:17,540
Yeah

912
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:20,840
It's like well don't that put a horseshoe on a fried chicken

913
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:24,040
See there you go that's another one

914
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,700
Now if we said it on the radio that means there's gonna be

915
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:29,260
Half the people in Tennessee are gonna be saying that

916
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:31,620
There'll be a country western song with that for a title

917
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,920
And will we get any royalties?

918
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:34,320
Nay

919
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:34,600
Nay

920
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:36,240
Nay said the horse

921
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,720
Nay said Mr. Ed

922
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,980
Not a damn cent

923
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:42,880
Yep

924
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:50,100
Well okay Dave let's cut to something else like Betty by Time or this

925
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,580
Hey Dr. Brujaha come here

926
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:55,360
Oh uh Animal

927
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:57,940
The esteemed reverend

928
00:52:57,940 --> 00:53:00,500
Hey look check it out check it out

929
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,660
I am arguing with this dude on the internet

930
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:05,520
What let me see

931
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:05,940
Yeah

932
00:53:05,940 --> 00:53:06,920
On social media

933
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:09,500
Yeah on social media like I totally post up

934
00:53:09,500 --> 00:53:12,660
And they're gonna get really really really really mad about it right

935
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:15,700
Cause I was like oh I wonder who's gonna be all pissed off about this

936
00:53:15,700 --> 00:53:16,660
You know and so like

937
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:19,180
And like this guy's just flipping his lid

938
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:21,860
What was it about?

939
00:53:22,120 --> 00:53:25,640
Oh I think it's like about like uh which donut's best for with sprinkles or something

940
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,000
But he's losing his mind

941
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,900
He is absolutely losing his mind right

942
00:53:28,900 --> 00:53:31,720
And so I just like I don't know how to respond to this

943
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:32,740
He says he's gonna like

944
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:33,640
I don't know

945
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,420
He's all like about ready to rage quit or something

946
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,980
But I wanna kinda push him over the edge

947
00:53:38,980 --> 00:53:43,060
Right but I don't want him like to like you know take it out

948
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:46,860
And like when I cause next week he's supposed to buy me coffee

949
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,560
So you know but

950
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:54,360
My favorite thing to do is you write stuff that they get angry about

951
00:53:54,360 --> 00:53:57,060
You know and respond to and go on these tirades

952
00:53:57,060 --> 00:53:59,020
And then you delete your comments

953
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:00,860
Egging them on

954
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:03,620
And then so it just looks like they're completely

955
00:54:03,620 --> 00:54:04,480
Insane

956
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,400
Going on some tirade

957
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,320
About something that probably doesn't even have to do with the original post either

958
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:10,320
That's always the best

959
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,060
That is great

960
00:54:11,060 --> 00:54:11,980
That is excellent

961
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:12,540
I uh

962
00:54:12,540 --> 00:54:14,200
It's troll level 800

963
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,900
I have to try that sometime

964
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,120
That is just amazing

965
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:18,180
I just uh

966
00:54:18,180 --> 00:54:18,980
Extra troll

967
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:21,260
I just wanted to like you know just

968
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:26,340
Cause this is as lovely as this is camping here in the woods

969
00:54:26,340 --> 00:54:29,680
I just wanted to ruin somebody's day

970
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:30,100
Right

971
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:30,760
On the internet

972
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:31,820
By talking about

973
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:32,840
Yeah

974
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:33,140
But yeah

975
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,200
But you know cause

976
00:54:34,200 --> 00:54:35,800
Cause it's so important

977
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,120
Everything I talk about on the internet is so important

978
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,980
It's always key to troll random strangers

979
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:42,200
This isn't random

980
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:42,680
That's like

981
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,460
But this is the people that I've known for years

982
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:44,720
Oh somebody

983
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:45,920
Yeah it's like somebody that I've known for years

984
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:46,440
It's like it's

985
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:47,080
So it's targeted

986
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:48,920
Well yeah it's always good to troll people

987
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:49,200
It's a little more fun

988
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:50,180
It's like pranking

989
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:50,920
Yeah

990
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:51,660
But on the internet

991
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:52,700
If I can't rip my friends

992
00:54:52,700 --> 00:54:53,380
With social media

993
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,100
Then what's the point

994
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:54,860
Yeah

995
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:56,620
Maybe they'll uh

996
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:57,880
You know hopefully they'll

997
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,300
Forget about how stupid you made them look

998
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,500
On social media

999
00:55:01,500 --> 00:55:03,120
Then maybe they'll be proud of how stupid you made them look on social media

1000
00:55:03,120 --> 00:55:04,260
And they'll be proud of how stupid they got to look

1001
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,800
Because I know I would be

1002
00:55:05,800 --> 00:55:09,400
Yeah you helped me make an absolute fool of myself

1003
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,420
I was so dumb

1004
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:11,340
That was great

1005
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,240
Oh look what a

1006
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,880
What a great subgenius I am

1007
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:15,000
I'm an idiot

1008
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,040
I'm an idiot

1009
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,040
Oh it's fantastic

1010
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:17,620
Yeah

1011
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:18,120
That's what we do

1012
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:18,440
Yeah

1013
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:21,080
But not in a weird way

1014
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,080
I mean I'm a little obsessive about it

1015
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:24,480
Maybe

1016
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,200
Yeah okay

1017
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:25,880
Yeah

1018
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:27,560
Definitely obsessive about it

1019
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:30,420
I'll get on there and just start telling people that you know

1020
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:33,100
Maybe this is a gift from me

1021
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:33,100


1022
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:33,100


1023
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:33,100


1024
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:33,100


1025
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:33,100


1026
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:33,100


1027
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:33,100


1028
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:33,100


1029
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:33,100


1030
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:33,300
Absolutely

1031
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:43,600
And this is the last time I'm beginning to Hye

1032
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,020
What's the interestingly

1033
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:44,020


1034
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:44,020


1035
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:45,280
Oh I want to think about it

1036
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:45,280


1037
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:45,280


1038
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:45,640
What to do

1039
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:45,640


1040
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:46,380
Yeah

1041
00:55:47,980 --> 00:55:48,700
Man

1042
00:55:50,780 --> 00:55:52,160
Would you want to try

1043
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:52,160


1044
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:52,260
I mean you probably have some

1045
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:52,420
You've got a bugñ

1046
00:56:01,980 --> 00:56:02,960
M cut

1047
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:02,960


1048
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:02,960


1049
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:02,960


1050
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:02,960


1051
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:03,100
Foi

1052
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:03,560
High five.

1053
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,600
All right.

1054
00:56:07,820 --> 00:56:13,560
That was a tribute to the late Ethan who liked to argue on the internet with strangers.

1055
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,800
Rest in peace, Ethan.

1056
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:22,060
Thank you, Reverend Anna Mall and Dr. Brouhaha.

1057
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:28,340
By the way, Brouhaha is spelled in the Spanish way, so it's like brouhaha.

1058
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,960
See, it's a double meaning there.

1059
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:35,520
Brouhaha meaning brouhaha, but brouhaha meaning witch.

1060
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:37,460
So there you go.

1061
00:56:37,620 --> 00:56:39,280
Oh, and speaking of witches.

1062
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,680
No, let's not speak of witches.

1063
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:48,260
Let's just let Leemur handle this.

1064
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:06,700
Yeah, what we're about to play is dated.

1065
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:12,660
All the numbers and names only applied in 1983.

1066
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:15,540
So don't go shopping based on this information.

1067
00:57:15,860 --> 00:57:23,740
But it's got some killer spouting by the Pope of all New York, David N. Meyer on NPR, of all things.

1068
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:30,360
Dr. G. Gordon Gordon and others, including, I think, Poonflang Dameron and the baby.

1069
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:31,180
Me.

1070
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:38,320
And now McGraw-Hill has printed 15,000 copies of the collected teachings of Bob.

1071
00:57:38,620 --> 00:57:39,460
Through the mail.

1072
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:43,760
Many times have I said that, yes, you may spend $20 to join the Church of Bob,

1073
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,540
and you may be staggered at the enormity of this sum,

1074
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,920
or you might spend $9.95 for the book about the book of the subgenius of McGraw-Hill and better books for everywhere,

1075
00:57:50,080 --> 00:57:53,340
but the $9.95 you spend for that book,

1076
00:57:53,880 --> 00:58:00,440
you'll get so much more for your money than you would get if you spent $9.95 in any other pink conspiracy meaningless book

1077
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:00,940
right now.

1078
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:00,940


1079
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:00,940


1080
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:00,940


1081
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:00,940


1082
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,940
You will be ashamed of yourself.

1083
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,160
Why, children, you go out and put that $4.95 down for a copy of Hollywood Wives,

1084
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:10,540
you read it and you are ashamed of yourself for being that sick pink conspiracy juicing.

1085
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:16,340
But you put $9.95 down for the book of the subgenius, and I defy you, children, to finish that book.

1086
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:19,340
I defy you to read every word and absorb every illustration of that book.

1087
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:22,560
I've had my copy for nigh on ten months, and I haven't done it yet.

1088
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:25,880
It sold 50,000 copies on publication day.

1089
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:29,840
Over a century later, it became the phenomenon of the London and New York states.

1090
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:32,640
We ought to clear up something about the book.

1091
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:37,940
You might find it in the humor section, and this is just completely wrong.

1092
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,080
It's the conspiracy in action.

1093
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:41,840
It should be in the religion section.

1094
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:45,700
I found my copy in the religion section of Walden Books downtown.

1095
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,780
It should be in the cooking section.

1096
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:49,800
It should be in the home building section.

1097
00:58:49,980 --> 00:58:50,740
It should be in the pet section.

1098
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:52,300
I mean, there's nothing funny about that book.

1099
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:56,920
I would encourage people to go to their local bookstore and find it and move it in the different sections.

1100
00:58:57,020 --> 00:58:57,920
It's all funny, right?

1101
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,620
Pick up all of the many copies there, or a few.

1102
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:01,220
I don't believe it.

1103
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,160
And move them to the real house.

1104
00:59:03,160 --> 00:59:04,520
It's supposed to be on big display out front with its own stamp and everything.

1105
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:08,680
It might just save your brain and your soul and your mental life for the next ten million years.

1106
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,380
It might even lose your left hemisphere to your right hemisphere.

1107
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,020
Yeah, right. It might just make you aware of the fact that you're a human being instead of a little meat machine.

1108
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:14,720
Because by count of gloves, we're speaking.

1109
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,100
We don't even want to talk about that, right?

1110
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,460
We don't want to talk about expanding your imagination.

1111
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:19,700
You're thinking for yourself.

1112
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:20,840
God forbid.

1113
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,040
Yeah, you're not asleep. You're perfectly awake.

1114
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,400
No, you haven't been programmed.

1115
00:59:24,740 --> 00:59:25,000
No.

1116
00:59:25,220 --> 00:59:27,400
This whole stuff isn't confusing to you at all.

1117
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:28,060
Right.

1118
00:59:29,120 --> 00:59:30,140
No, that's the way it goes.

1119
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:31,600
It's just a big toy.

1120
00:59:34,760 --> 00:59:47,580
That book, reprinted in 1986 by Simon & Schuster, is still around in print and in e-book, but it's not really in many stores anymore.

1121
00:59:47,940 --> 00:59:56,600
It is in my store at subgenius.com, as is Lonesome Cowboy Dave's sci-fi novel, Neighbor World.

1122
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,820
And they're both on amazon.com, for instance.

1123
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:07,600
And it's now $20.95 instead of $9.95 like it was in 1983.

1124
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:13,240
But as I said earlier, Slack Friday has started, man!

1125
01:00:13,620 --> 01:00:21,800
And, whoa, man, I can now explain to you on the internet that this is our big annual blowout.

1126
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:28,400
When you get two Church of the Subgenius ordainment kits for the price of one.

1127
01:00:29,820 --> 01:00:30,940
Maybe you're already a fan.

1128
01:00:30,940 --> 01:00:31,680
Maybe you're already ordained.

1129
01:00:31,760 --> 01:00:40,000
But don't you want your old ma and pa to be on the escape vessels too when next day comes and the world ends?

1130
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:43,600
And what about that cool niece and nephew?

1131
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:50,140
And what about Spot, Rover, Old Hollerer, and Little Tabby?

1132
01:00:50,940 --> 01:00:57,820
Are you gonna deliberately leave them behind to be tortured as pinks by all your fellow subgeniuses?

1133
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,920
And besides Eternal Sins?

1134
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,500
And what about Salvation or Triple Your Money Back?

1135
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:12,940
For that mere $35, you get a lot of actual stuff inside that sizable black folder with pockets.

1136
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:23,980
You get your membership pin, your shiny, coated minister's card, two fine, bedobs-headed, vinyl bumper stickers,

1137
01:01:24,920 --> 01:01:27,200
the Doctorate of the Forbidden Sciences,

1138
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:32,220
and the all-purpose divine excuse document signed by Bob.

1139
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:34,720
Oh, that felt good.

1140
01:01:34,820 --> 01:01:38,300
Both poster-sized and dying to be framed.

1141
01:01:39,260 --> 01:01:45,900
You get 32 pages of densely illustrated and floridly written tracts.

1142
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,480
That is, pamphlets number one and two.

1143
01:01:48,620 --> 01:01:56,000
You get a cardboard 8.5x11 portrait of Bob only two generations from the original clip art itself.

1144
01:01:59,220 --> 01:02:06,220
The Pledge of the Subgenius, the Brag of the Subgenius, a leaflet about Connie Dobbs,

1145
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:14,680
an anti-subgenius fake flyer, the amazing Tree of Life poster by Mavridis and Stang,

1146
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:21,700
the Salvation or Destruction poster by Hellswami Satellite Weavers that Devo adapted for a poster,

1147
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,500
and much, much more.

1148
01:02:23,620 --> 01:02:25,980
All kinds of stuff that you can read.

1149
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:29,640
Photocopy and leave in laundromats and at the State Fair.

1150
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:39,020
It's a 27-piece kit altogether, and I personally signed the three-page welcome and instructions letter myself

1151
01:02:39,980 --> 01:02:41,920
in sparkly green ink.

1152
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:53,020
And best of all, you become an ordained minister with the power to lawfully wed couples or anything else.

1153
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,960
Two kits like this for $35.00.

1154
01:02:55,980 --> 01:03:03,460
But act fast, because this incredible offer ends December 23rd, if the world doesn't first.

1155
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,760
That's subgenius.com.

1156
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:12,340
And the link for Slack Friday ordainment is right at the top.

1157
01:03:12,500 --> 01:03:16,080
We take credit cards, checks, PayPal, you name it.

1158
01:03:16,140 --> 01:03:23,120
And if you don't need this so-called false progress like the internet, you can mail us at...

1159
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:25,640
Got that pencil or phone ready?

1160
01:03:27,080 --> 01:03:37,220
Subgenius at P.O. Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1161
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:46,140
Shortest address we've ever had, and I'm pretty sure this one's permanent because we're now on an actual cult compound in rural Texas.

1162
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:53,580
Not all that far from where the United States government mass-murdered the Branch Davidians near fabled Waco.

1163
01:03:54,180 --> 01:03:59,680
That's Box 807, Glen Rose, Texas 76043.

1164
01:04:00,580 --> 01:04:02,940
Or subgenius.com.

1165
01:04:03,060 --> 01:04:03,840
Praise Bob!

1166
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,120
Oh, and by the way...

1167
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:14,940
We really are hurting for money due to the delays in selling the old address.

1168
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:22,700
So this wouldn't be a bad time for just a plain flat-out donation, which we make very easy...

1169
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:29,520
By way of paypal.me slash ivanstang.

1170
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,440
I-V-A-N-S-T-A-N-G.

1171
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:39,660
Or the button on the homepage of subgenius.com.

1172
01:04:40,340 --> 01:04:41,620
Praise Bob!

1173
01:04:41,700 --> 01:04:42,520
Again!

1174
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:43,480
Again!
