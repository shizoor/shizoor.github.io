Have.
Suppose it's true after all.
If so, all you vindictive, moralistic pseudo-Christians who make Jesus look so petty.
All you right-wing ideologues who lie, cheat, and steal in the name of the Lord to grab people's hearts, minds, and money.
All you self-righteous moralists who think that you know what God Almighty wants us to see, hear, think, and do.
Are in big trouble.
Don't let your mind go to hell.
Save it.
Listen to the subgenius.
Powerhouse.
What?
Another pop sham.
For that little amount that you can...
Donate dollars.
$10.
$10.

$10.

Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

Cool.
Did he get it?
Did he?
We rule the world.
Give a...

...please do...
Bob.
I'm coming in here.
I'm after you now.
Poor Bob.
I almost felt sorry for him.
Almost.
And these days, Bob has grown accustomed to a very different lifestyle.
I'm sorry, Bob.
I'm sorry, Bob.
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.
I'm sorry, Bob.


I can't do it anymore.
I can't do it anymore.

I can't do it.
I can't do it.
Oh yes, dear friends
And welcome back to the Hour of Slack
This is a special, special broadcast tonight
I have a lot of feeling in my heart
Because this is our five year anniversary
Five years, dear friends
This show, Hour of Slack number 257
Marks the fifth year of the word of Bob
Reaching out across the airwaves
Reaching out for those subgeniuses
And those slackless ones who need
The slack that Bob can give
So we've tried to put together a special show
One that will bless your heart
And bring you closer to the dogma
And the doctrine of Bob's church
The church of the subgenius
I hope it'll help you to understand Bob better
To understand your fellow members
And yourself
Praise Bob
She kept saying over and over and over again
It's wonderful, wonderful
And she said as fast as she could
Wonderful, this is wonderful, this is wonderful
Everything that happens to you
Every second of every minute
Of every hour of every day
Remember silently to name it
Wonderful, this is wonderful
And whatever you name anything in your life
You've won it become for you
Are we ready for our time travel experiment?
Then set the chronons for Nexus 3
Okay, the code is I love pretty words
I love pretty words
I love pretty words
I love pretty words
I love pretty words
Now as you can see off in the distance
Leaving space for you
Boing, oing, oing, oing
And so history was made
Or rather unmade
As they went back in time
Past the fighting minute man
Past the armored knight
Past the Roman warrior
To this prehistoric site
But we overshot our mark
And we went zillions of years into the past
Into the area of nothingness and chaos
That existed before the universe
The primordial vacuum cleaner
The dust balls of space
Millions of miles across
Gigantic hairballs
And lint filled the cosmos
Boing, oing, oing, oing, oing
And so history was made
Remember silently to name it

Remember silently to name it
And so history was made

Remember silently to name it
People bring tears
And they raise their voices
Sanctification
And they lower up
Moss
Dirt
And then eventually

There doers
Seellem
Homily, holy, Lord God of hosts, Hosanna in the highest, in your super van.
Praise God.
Good God.

Christ of mercy.
Christ.
He gonna come back.
One more time.
I invite you to get under my roof.
So give it up.
I turn it.
Give it up.
Lamb of God, take away the sins of the world.
Have mercy.
Lamb of God, take away the sins of the world.
Grant us peace.
He's super van.
Good God.
He's super van.
Super, super, super van.
Oh my God, I'm caught in the silence.
I'm having an offensive beat.
And I'm in here.
All my sins are faded.
Leave not yet.
If you funky down there.
What's even worse than thrashing!
Shame's so un grades.

When Bob Dog takes my cash from me.
When Bob Dog takes my cash from me.
I said no.
Wonderful dear friends.
What that may not be for you.
Ah yes.
This is one of those good old times of genius gospel show.
I'm sure just brimming over with the spirit.
I don't even care if you are.
That's how in the spirit I am.
I don't even care.
But we do it because of love dear friends.
Oh praise Bobby.
Bobby.
Hi.
Thanks for calling.
The voice line.
You know with this country on the verge of war.
It's getting pretty hard to take my line of work.
Doing voices for radio commercials.
All that seriously.
In fact.
It's getting so that more and more.
Every time I'm in the studio for a session.
I feel just a little bit more hypocritical.
And guilty.
It's like I'm part of this massive conspiracy.
To lure unsuspecting people into spending all their money on image enhancing products.
That in reality they little need.
Nor ill can afford.
The strange thing is.
The more guilty I feel about this situation.
The better my work is.
My delivery improved tenfold since the Iraqi crisis.
I work four or five times a week.
I've even upped my rates.
Just think what would happen in the event of an all out war.
Thinking about it.
Almost makes it worth thinking about.
But as good as I get at my work.
I'll still be only a mouthpiece.
A conduit for someone else's concepts.
A faceless spokesman for companies who want you to believe they're not worth it.
They're advertising campaigns only a little bit more than they want to believe in themselves.
Now what do you think?
Am I cutting my own throat here?
Biting the hands that feed me by verbalizing these thoughts on a demo line?
An audio billboard for the commodity that I have become?
I don't know.
I can't answer that.
But I do know this.
This country.
Has a long and proud tradition of lying to its own people to serve its own best interests.
And advertising is only one small part of that conspiracy.
Regardless of what I may have told you over the radio.
Nothing you can buy will make you a better person.
A happier person.
A more spiritually connected person.
Can provide you with the things in life that are truly important to the soul.
There are things that can never be turned into commodities.
And not be sold.
And marketed.
And these things must be searched for within each of us.
Individually.
Our future as a country is built upon lies and deception.
And if you don't think that you're only three paychecks away from that disgusting bum you just passed on the street.
Then you too are part of that deception.
No matter how much money you have.
The sad fact remains that regardless of what color Porsche or BMW or Lamborghini you have.
You will never be.
One of George Bush's rich friends.
George Bush does not want you to be his friend.
George Bush does not care enough about you to even dislike you.
You cannot afford to buy your way into his country club.
It does not matter if you're a slave in the fields.
Or a slave in the office.
Or a slave in the big house on the hill.
You're still a slave.
And at best a middle management slave.
Prodding and whipping and abusing those beneath you in a desperate fervor.
Praying that you will suddenly find yourself a part of that inner circle.
Believe me.
You will be dead long before you get close to that inner circle.
And you will be replaced the very next day.
By yet another well groomed.
Well oiled.
Eager.
Well meaning.
Brown nosing.
Slave.
This year's model.
Recently we observed the imploding of communism in Eastern Europe.
Now what do you think brought all that about?
Was it because the communist system was flawed and doomed to collapse from its very inception?
No.
I don't think so.
I think it was because of the ineffective, greedy, myopic and insensitive bureaucrats.
Who were charged with the responsibility of keeping the machine running.
Interesting parallel don't you think?
They're not all that different from the ineffective, greedy, myopic and insensitive bureaucrats.
Charged with the responsibility of keeping our machine running.
But rather than choose to evict them.
As was the case in Russia.
All too often.
We choose to emulate them.
To ape their postures.
Their uniforms.
Their speech patterns.
Their words and phraseology.
But remember what I said.
George Bush and his rich friends do not need you in their country club.
Stop acting like you're next on the docket.
Because you aren't.
Stop acting like everything is alright.
Because it isn't.
Nothing is alright.
And if you can look around you at the state of this country.
And not secretly admit to yourself that our system is just as vulnerable as theirs.
And that their dominoes just happen to fall first in the system.
Then either you're truly one of George Bush's rich friends.
Or else you're truly ignorant.
And all I know is that George Bush's rich friends probably would not be calling this number to hear my demo line.
It's the top 3% who really call the shots in this corporate fiefdom we lovingly sing to in all of those patriotic songs.
If you're fortunate enough to be working right now.
Remember.
You're working at least three of those days to pay off your accrued interest charges.
And to help fund a government that can't even help you feel safe as you stand in line to cash what's left of your paycheck.
That 3% at the top.
The real inner circle.
Is bleeding you dry.
It's bleeding this country dry.
Not to mention what's left of this planet.
And as we trip over each other in our ruts.

In our rush to emulate our leaders.
We wallow like pigs in the waste of our abundance.
Oblivious to our inevitable slaughter.
And why do we continue to do this?
Why do we continue to remain on this treadmill to oblivion?
Why can't we learn from our collective histories?
And how can I give so freely of my talents and my art to the continued perpetration of this hoax?
How can we be part of a nation that is so free?
I don't know.
I can't answer that.
Freedom without structure is anarchy.
Structure without freedom is fascism.
What are you?
An anarchist?
Or a fascist?
You cannot afford the initiation fee to George Bush's country club.
You cannot afford the initiation fee to George Bush's country club.
Remember, capitalism is not democracy.
Convenience is not freedom.
And the government is not your friend.
Thank you for calling the voice line.
Yeah, that was Joe Paulino, dear friends.
Reverend Joe Paulino.
Isn't this a funny show?
We don't know where it came from.
We can't imagine where it goes.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Yeah, so that's why we're on the air.
That's right.
We've got to be on the air because within about seven or eight, well, I'd say maybe
ten years, most of the human race is going to be dead anyway of AIDS because it's geometrically
increasing.
Look, we sincerely hope that once you see what the gods have in store for you.
By the way of retribution, tribulation, plague, punishment, and flight, you'll realize just
how badly you need powerful friends and benign protectors like us.
You may scoff and ridicule this show right now, but the day will come when the stockpile
calamities will all be unleashed on you.
Hey, this is prophecy.
Stand by.
Miniature big feet that run around slashing your ankles with poison razor blades, the
frozen nitric acid hail, volcanoes that belch nerve gas, and hallucinogenic dust clouds
that will engulf us.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.
Don't.







Shut up.
Shut up.
Shut up.
shatters and covers the ground with carcinogenic dreadful smelling grit okay nothing okay
don't don't suffer we've got audio of immune deficiency syndrome here yeah we'll just clean
off the microphone and start all over again there's a possibility that there are numerous
bacteriological and viral strains that are being tried on the human race by the mother earth the
the human race i mean see you're talking about things that don't really seem to matter i think
these are these are minor matters in the scope of things i mean dobbs prophecies laid out what's
going to happen in health industrial bad things like that see we've got the cases here and when
you talk about this many people have a disease or that many people working on in the in the
geological spectrums that are needed to uh actually a critical point will be reached sometime around
1988 or so when all the the available uh yes all available things
soldiers will be fighting for dogs population aids patients will have been exhausted if the
train yeah but by that by that date every single subgenius will have his own radio show
including you and i mean so we'll all be broadcasting this news at that time and
understanding it okay what year is the mutant revolution headed off when charles manson
discovers the secret death valley entrance to hollow earth and leads all the exiled
misfit nazi hell creatures against the mutant strongholds here they come now
ye have heard that it was said by them
shall
for thine, and to a virtue.
But I say unto you that he resists not even,
but whosoever shall spite thee on thy right cheek,
turn to him the other also.
Ye have heard that it hath been said,
Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemies.
But I say unto you, love your enemies less than they pursue.
Do good to them that hate you,
and pray for them which despite thee use you in person.
Well, of course, this is absolutely biological.
This is biological.
Suicide's absolutely madness.
No, it's just ridiculous.
Love your enemy.
It isn't easy to love an enemy.
It's just ridiculous.
And since it goes against your most basic survival instinct,
but it can be done and turned to an advantage.
Let the love squirt out of you like a fire hose of molasses.
Give him the kiss of life.
Stick your tongue down his throat.
Taste what he's been eating and bless his digestion.
Booze down into his intestines and help him along with his...
Life in all its rich variety.
Do not falter.
Let your love enter in unto him and penetrate him with a divine lubricant.
Makes KY and Leland feel like sandpaper.
It's the most mucilaginous, the slimiest, ooziest lubricant there ever was or shall be.
Amen.
Bop.

He is the one true innocent.
He's so dumb that he doesn't know good from evil.
To him, he might walk a little old lady across the street and then might turn around and
do sex tortures on her for three weeks, keeping her clinging to life and then make a sandwich
out of her face.
To him, it's all the same.
And if we were to be as truly innocent as Bob, we could do that too.
Isn't that sick?
Isn't that scary?
That is not giving your sister some more life.
Let's make you shameful, bitch!




Because you don't get two Filterglasses, you were one and all you got two.
The不是андwellansje durdone zwandawandwological people pussy!
Ain't this teeth, dude?




Three bars!
Good flesh, Thingumazever.
You just light it up like you do a chest of ale
You inhale a sweet smell of spit
You exhale it out of your mouth
That's all there is to it
It's just like an atomic bomb
That's all there is to it
Things are more messed up than you ever dreamed
What was it all is now
The priorities are all screwy
You're afraid if your hair looks okay
While some new kind of bladder cancer
Is bursting out the front of your desire jeans
Yes, this is bad talk
Nobody will listen to anything else
You won't look at TV unless body parts are cars
Or chickens are crashing on it
You won't taste your food unless it has some nerve drug in it
You haven't used your other senses since you were five
And you sure as hell won't stop once you know you know someone
Much bigger, much stronger, and much, much more selfish
Makes you stop
And you'll never stop
And you'll thank him for it
And then just before you fry in a flash of radioactive hindsight
You'll realize that he stopped you from doing the wrong thing
Good God!
What in the name of sweet screaming
Jesus is this world coming to?
People bitch, people cry
This is a sign of the end times
That's a sign of the end times
When you should all be hollering
It's all a sign of the end times
Millions are gonna be going
And they're gonna leave this earth
And they're gonna leave their own love, love, love
Lost loved ones behind
What does that say?
Did you hear what he was saying?
Did you hear what he was saying?
Is it possible that the end of the world will come in July 1999?
Perhaps in the form of an atomic holocaust
Such a forewarning of ultimate doom would generally be dismissed by the party
Sin, bloodshed, and racism
Who had the upper hand on the collaborate of millions
Sort of one with 떠gu
Thoughts cannot be
Served in such a terrible0
BASED ON lives situations
We've got to tape this. We'll play it back real slow.
And we'll get his whole tape.
Okay, it says meet at the Texas Theater.
November 22nd.
Yeah, that's right.
Bring the curtain rods.
Well, just another subgenie caller.
Just another phone bomb.
Just another subgenius.
What can I say? Bob is fill in the blank.
You can count on that.
Well.
Or kill me.
Or more.
Or less.
And who's going to do that?
The passion of this garbage is delicious.
What was that?
The church of subgeniuses.
But I don't know.
But how many of you are really genuinely intelligent?
Bang.
Are you blaming God for atom bombs?
Oh, God.
God for atom bombs?
Atomic warheads?
All over the country.
Every morning.
Past.
Blotted out.
Yeah.
In the future.
For sure.
Yeah, that's what I want.
Ah, yeah.
Yes.
30 years ago, I warned of it.
20 years ago, I warned of it.
You listen in amazement.
Here today.
As we take this.
One joke.
And keep blowing it up.
Bigger and bigger.
And the only reason we're.
We're pumping so much behind this one joke.
Is that we want to see how big it gets before it explodes.
Bang.
Bang.
Bang.
Bang.
Bang.
Bang.
Bang.
Bang.
Bang.
It was at this point that the hypnotist made the decision to take his subject over the hump.
This is cars and trains and trash.
Wires and husbands and babies.
What's the fear?
Of course your government and all governments, they'll be trying to fish tail out of it.
They'll give you all kinds of excuses.
They'll hide the reality under UFOs or extraterrestrial invasion.
Or astral projection or God only knows what.
But they won't try to put it under the rug.
But I'm warning you, you've missed.
It was Bob all along, dear friend.
They tricked you, didn't they?
They'll trick you every time they creep up on you.
The little pinky winky stew in the old kitchen.
So we're all going to watch out, aren't we?
Yes.
This is your prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.
We're going to continue with a little bit of what we have been playing
and a little bit of new.
What we have been playing have been William Burroughs,
and that's the old guy talking,
and the KPFA subgenius show tapes,
by puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, Gary Gaborg, Fran, Mr. Exotic,
and in this case, lies.
Lies!
Apocalypse.
Apocalypse.
Mariner sailing close to the shores of Tuscany,
heard the sound of a boat, and he said,
I heard a voice cry out from the hills, the trees, and the sky.
The great God Pan is dead.
Pan got a panic.
The sudden awareness that everything is alive and significant.
The date was December 25, 1 A.D.
But Pan lives on in the realm of imagination,
in writing, painting, and music.
Look at Van Gogh's sunflowers writhing with pretentious life.
Listen to the pipes of Pan in Taduka.
Now Pan is neutralized, framed in museums, entombed in books,
relegated to folklore.
But art is spilling out of its frames, in the midst of the world.


Will it stop there?
Consider an apocalyptic statement.
Nothing is true, everything is permitted.
Hassan Isaba, The Old Man on the Mountain.
Not to be interpreted as an invitation to all manner of unrestrained and destructed
behavior, that would be a minor episode, which would run its course.
Everything is permitted because nothing is true.
It is all make-believe, illusion, dream, art.
Well, art leaves the frame and the written word leaves the page.
Not merely the physical frame and page, but the frames and pages of assigned categories.
A basic disruption of reality itself occurs.
The literal realization of art.
Success will write apocalypse across the sky.
The artist aims for a miracle.
The painter wills his pictures to move off the canvas with a separate light.
Movement outside of the picture.
The artist wills his pictures to move off the canvas with a separate light.
And one rent in the fabric is all it takes for pandemonium to sluice through.
Last act. The end.
This is where we all came in.
The final apocalypse is when every man sees what he sees,
feels what he feels, hears what he hears.
The creatures of all your dreams,
your dreams and nightmares are right here, right now, solid as they ever were or ever will be.
Electric vitality of careening subways.
Faster, faster, faster.
Stations flash by in a blur.
Pan-God of panic whips screaming crowds as millions of faces look up at the torn sky.
Off the track, off the track.
The planet is pulling loose from its moorings, careening into space.
Spilling cities and mountains and seas into the void.
Spinning faster and faster, days and nights flash by like subway stations.
Tunnels crunch down teeth of concrete and steel.
Flattening cars like beer cans.
Graffiti through glass and steel.
Steel like acid races across the sky in tornadoes of flaming colors.
Cherry pickers with satin brushes pick as a door inch through Wall Street,
leaving a vast souvenir postcard of the Grand Canyon.
Water trucks slosh out paint.
Outlaw painters armed with paint pistols paint every corner of the world.
Everything and everyone in reach.
Survival artists paint cans strapped to their backs.
Grenades at their belts paint anything and anybody within range.
Sky riders dog fight collide and explode.
Telephone poles dance electric jigs in swirling, crackling wires.
Neon explosions and tornadoes splash through ruined cities.
Volcanoes spew molten colors as the earth's crust buckles and splinters into jigsaw pieces.
Household appliances revolt.
Washing machines snatch clothes from the guests.
Gallowing hoovers suck off makeup and wigs and false teeth.
Electric toothbrushes leap into screaming mouths.
So clothes dryers turn gardens into dust bowls.
Garden jewels whiz through long parties impaling the guests
who are hacked to fertilizer by industrious Japanese hatchets.
Loaves of misshapen bulbous plants spring from their bones.
Covering golf courses, swimming pools, country clubs, and tasteful dwellings.
At my back, faster and faster, I always hear,
Hurry up, energy ground down into, please it's time closing.
Sidewalks and streets by billions of feet and tires erupt from manholes and tunnels.
Break out with volcanic force.
Let it come down careening subways.
Faster and faster, stations blur by.
Hand whips screaming crowds with flaming fights.
Millions of faces look up at the torn sky.
Off the track, off the track.
Planet is pulling loose from its moorings.
Careening off into space.
Scilling cities and mountains and seas into the void.
Faster and faster.
Skyscrapers scrape rents of blue and white paint from the sky.
The rivers swirl with color.
Nitrous ochres and reds leap through the bridges falling into the rivers.
Splashing colors across warehouses and piers and roads and buildings.
Amok art rugs in organic mold.
Stirring passions of metal and glass.
Steel girders rising in metal.
Aspersed from their concrete covers.
Walls of glass melt and burn with madness and a billion.
And then crazed eyes.
Bridges buck cars and trucks into the rivers.
The sidewalks run ahead.
Faster and faster.
Energy ground down into sidewalks and streets by billions of feet and tires.
Erupts from manholes and tunnels and breaks out with volcanic force.
Let it come down.
Caught in New York beneath the animals of the village.
The piper pulled down into the sky.
We're escalating our programming here.
We are no longer going to just have the pseudo-express talk.
Tonight we're going to probe around.
We are no longer going to just have the pseudo-express talk.
Tonight we're going to probe around.
Next one.
We're escalating our programming here.
We are no longer going to be the pseudo-express talk.
Don't call it ironic.
The kindest performer ain't in the show.


Destiny has landed.
The thunder, taking control of the world.
The station stands within.
Beneath, freedom is over.
Oh, we don't know what they came for.
What they came for.
Unconducible.
We don't know what they came for.
But what they aim for is impossible.
The
only those ideas which are accepted
are those which are in the hands of the status quo,
which reaches the wider audience, which makes people brain dead.
And you either have to

submit or you have to join the spectacle, you know, the...
The invasion of body statues, that kind of thing.
Yeah, and so we can agree that under that situation,
it's a planet of the dead.
And the alternative is not to offer other ideas,
because they'll be quickly consumed and recycled and played out.
So the real alternative is a kind of new yoga,
an environmental yoga, not a private spiritual or Eastern yoga.
The new yoga is to deal with the environments we've created and we all share.
You know what I mean, Mike?
And so that's why we have to deal with the conspiracy.
It goes back to that caller, that if I was able to take control,
and I do have control, but if I was able to present it in the pink world,
then I could bring in this real alternative.
And the way to have an alternative is to change the environments.
One of the ways would be to turn off the electric environment.
Can you imagine doing that?
Right.
That'd be one...
It's not an alternative idea, that's an alternative percept.
But the pinks are never going to change.

They're never going to let you do that.
So they will let you have all the celebratory retrievals and replays
and celebrations of ideas and cultures,
because they know the medium is the message, not the content.
The content has no importance.
The control environment is those of the emperor, this is his new clothes,
is that he's just going to keep it on.
He's not going to turn it on.
He has a lot of money to be made.
Yeah.
And he's not even making money. He doesn't even want that.
I knew the UFO of Phoebus was a war, that I recognized it.
And it was laughing.
It was laughing.
The
Uh...
Oh!
Uh-oh!
The
Let them numb the mind with useless consumer goods and luxuries.
Let the cows sate themselves on split-level ranches, wall-to-wall shag, microwaves, jacuzzis, food processors, and remote-controlled VCRs.
They have pulled the wool over their own eyes, blinding themselves with animal comfort, ignoring the signs traced in fire, ice, and blood that I have come and their time is at hand.
The Eastern world, it is exploding, violence flaring, bullets loading, you're old enough to kill, but not for voting.
You don't believe in war, but what's that gun you're toting? And even the Jordan River has bodies floating.
But you tell me over and over and over again.
And my friend, oh, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.
Don't you understand what I'm trying to say? And can't you feel the fears that I'm feeling today?
If the button is pushed, there's no running away. There'll be no one to save with the world in a grave.
Take a look around you, boy. It's bound to scare you, boy.
And you tell me over and over and over again.
And my friend, oh, you don't believe we're on the eve of destruction.
Well, this is Hour of Slack, number 9,183.
May 19th.
May 19th, 21,989 A.D.
In the news, increased controversy over the skeleton and dwelling place or office of a midhistoric man,
recently unearthed by scientists in the deserts of Texas in North Amerenid on Earth Farm 1.
Due to its special qualities, experts are engaged in heated debate over its origins.
Whether it is a man or a woman, it is a question of time.

Whether it is merely an advanced Homo sapiens, a Q-man, that is, or is it one of the earliest Homo correctus,
also known as the subgenius, the last evolutionary step before our own species, Homo excelsior?
Does this fossil represent the missing link between the lesser gravity-bound bipedal primates and the subgenius-descended brain race,
which now conquers the star?
And what of the claims by cultists and dissidents that it is no less than the skull of one of the early apostles of the historical Dobbs man form,
which brought Slack to Earth Farm 1 in the year 0 B.D., or as they measured time, the late 20th century?
Could this be?
Most scientists concurred that the skeleton could well be that of a man who walked the earth at the same time and place,
as the Dobbs itself, during his last physical incarnation,
an unwitting pre-overman fighter in the bitter struggle which raised Homo excelsior from his quagmire of mortality
and physics-bound three-dimensional fixed-leggedness and into the energy-based free-thought-form heights of our civilization.
But is it necessarily?
Let's examine the fossil record.
Evidence which,
while meager on the surface,
yet allows skilled experts to reconstruct and describe in extraordinary detail the life of this mysterious ancient tool-using ape.
Of course,
Earth Farm 1 in his time was a much different place than it is today.
Lavishly gifted with surging plankton-filled oceans and land masses abundant with plants and animals,
the home seed planet then bore the first human species.

But all of its
cracked smears and falling off its arms was a bizarre wykonation forуsch controllers.
They were not under the discipline of human
to work for a way in theonomicienstcellar environment.
Nothing looked afflictly unpenthythmic.

Who knows where the credulous wrapper is located in Homo.
But no處
If we should Fort unboxing theánmina of this fossil land speculation comes within 40 minutes,

of his implements seen here, supplemented by the oral records of our friends the
dolphins, paint a picture of his primeval office. Constructed of simple wood and
metal, yet he possessed crude computers of a sort, fashioned entirely from toxic
plastics and metals, powered by artificial electricity. These early
computers were sad, immobile, paralyzed boxes, armless and legless,
mere heads to be used as little more than flint hatchets. Their users probably
did not even suspect that their computers possessed souls. Certainly they
were never used for the sexual pastimes we enjoy today. Nevertheless, their
presence in this creature's hypothetical office distinguished him as a uniquely
electronic animal, the first of his kind. Indeed, he was far more overhuman than
this apish reconstruction of the human body.
The image on the right of the slide indicates, as seen in slide one, which admittedly
resembles the domesticated Eloi we breed for soul energy. Even more so, the
primitive wild Eloi mocked by our children in zoos. Homo correctus
possesses the familiar uncurved spine. He was robustly built with thick heavy bones.
At this stage of development, he was still better at driving than at
communicating or maintaining peaceful relations.
The skeleton was found next to the corroded parts of a harvesting tool, then called a
lawnmower, proves that he was still incapable of such simple telekinesis as controlling
the growth of plants by mental command. He still had legs, of course, though those hideous
jointed appendages which are only vestigial in our race. As seen here, the socket at which
the femur connects to the pelvis was farther inward.
More so than in Australopithecus, for instance. He was capable of walking fully erect if he
wore shoes, but abrasion on his coccyx shows that most of the time he was spent sitting,
perhaps because, like us, his great weight would otherwise have crushed even his massive
bones.
The skeleton is, at first glance, typical of the Hugh-mans of that time. Note that the
bones are much thicker than ours, suggesting that the musculature and the muscles are similar.


of this creature had broad anchors.
Physically, these creatures were incredibly powerful.
One of them could easily slay 20 of us in combat.
But were his head shielded from telepathic control by Blitanium?
Well, of course, to him, Blitanium was at best a dream.
You know, there hasn't been any real advances in your field.
He a gang's on here.
What the heck do we care?
What the heck do we care?
What, you're a tape recorder?
Yes.
Hey, that machine is alive.
Get this thing off of me!
Help!
Look, it's crawling right up his leg.
You talking to me?
No.
Yeah, we can see.
How do I, how do I kill that?
Uh, you can, here, we'll show you.
You can take this tape here.
You talking to me?
And you grind up.
Yep.
A little bit of buffalo residue.
Yeah, I'm talking to you, little tape.
Get in the trash can.
You gotta talk it down.
Yeah, you're the stupid shell.
You gotta be a man about it and talk it down.
You're the shell we're not gonna use, alright?
Get back in the trash can.
Get back.
You, get back!
Get in the trash can.
Get that razor blade, quick, get that editing tape.
Get that editing tape.
So the razor blade slaps, razor blade beats tape, any time.
Oh yeah?
Yeah.
Get back in the trash can, you stupid.
Get in the trash can.
Oh!
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
What?
The crocodile.
No animal is half so vile as Croccywoc the crocodile.
On Saturdays he likes to crunch six juicy children for his lunch, and he especially
enjoys just three of each, three girls, three boys.
He smears the boys to make them hot with mustard from the mustard pot, but mustard doesn't
go with girls. It tastes all wrong with plaits and curls. With them what goes extremely well
is butterscotch and caramel. It's such a super marvellous treat when boys are hot and girls
are sweet. At least that's Crocky's point of view. He ought to know. He's had a few.
That's all for now. It's time for bed. Lie down and rest your sleepy head. Shh! Listen.
What is that I hear? Galumphing softly up the stair. Go lock the door and fetch my gun.
Go on, child. Hurry. Quickly run. No, stop. Stand back. He's coming in. Oh, look. That
greasy greenish skin. The shining teeth. The greedy smile. It's Crocky Wok the crocodile.
Observe here the remarkably small cranium of Homo correctus.
Only 2,000 cubic centimetres compared to our 50,000. And the characteristic backward sloping
forehead. The brain of this animal was capable only of language, tool making and speech.
It had none of the 40 other characteristics of high thought which we take for granted
today. Altogether, his brain had less cells than do those of our contemporary gorilla
servants. As certain radical upstart free gorilla gorillas never cease to remind us.
Every school child knows our ancestors were able to genetically transfer the brain into
the chest where it was better protected while moving the gonads into the cranium where they
best functioned. But that happened 5,000 years after the last war. Compared to us then, Homo
correctus was truly a monster. Because of his savage, savage appearance, primitive peoples
on the outer planet still use scary tales of these creatures to frighten their children
into behaving. But despite the quaint legends of monsters like Dob Squatch or Middle-sized
Foot, the idea that some pocket of these biological throwbacks might exist are, if romantic, nevertheless
pure myth. Yes, to us, he would look like a mutated, disgusting, violent zoo animal.
But if we could imagine his thoughts, they would probably prove to be remarkably similar
to, say, those of our ancestors. But we can't say for sure that he was a monster. We can't
say for sure that he's a human or that he's a creature. However, we have some
guesses that rhyme with our own connections, and only the species we will ever guess are
certain.
