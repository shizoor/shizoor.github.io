1
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:04,240
Recording. Everything's going fine.

2
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:05,880
No trouble.

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:14,860
And we hear the joyous subgeniuses in the background.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,600
Yes, how we envy them, their simple rituals and childish pleasures,

5
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:23,520
as they trustfully wait for the saucers.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:28,620
They say every gesture here has a meaning all its own.

7
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:31,420
Some traditional, some tribal.

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,560
Others apparently made up on the spot.

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,620
Oh, they're very enthusiastic.

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:45,420
They seem to be wanting someone to get in the big wicker statue,

11
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,300
and they're casting lots, apparently.

12
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:54,280
Whoever the dancer stops in front of will be the lucky person.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,820
I gather that's what's going on.

14
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:58,500
It's not very easy to see from here.

15
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,640
But the subgeniuses are a lively bunch.

16
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:11,120
Well, it is X-Day, and they're gathered here at Wisteria Event Center in southern Ohio.

17
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:13,320
At beautiful Caffeinas.

18
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:20,040
We've got all the subgenius decorations up,

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:24,960
video projections going behind us of the Dobbs and Deleastis DVD.

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,440
And the participants.

21
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:31,800
The participants are continuing to stream into the campground.

22
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,200
The roads are blocked with vehicles.

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,660
But there seems to be no sign of impatience or anger.

24
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:46,020
All are placidly waiting their turn to be directed into the subgenius parking area B

25
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,320
in the newly erected parking structure.

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,120
Oh, they're glowing with faith.

27
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:56,960
And vitality. And youthful health.

28
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,600
Well, it is the beginning of the year.

29
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,220
The festival. The traditional thunderstorm hasn't hit yet.

30
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:07,440
Yes, they may sing out the other side of their mouth by the time this is all over.

31
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:14,020
We grizzled veterans know it's not all the oat cakes and honey, but it appears to be so.

32
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,080
And why deny them their simple pleasures, the joy of arrival?

33
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
Oh, and smell that missionary cooking in that great big cauldron.

34
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:26,860
Oh, that's incredible. Yes, that's the missionary special.

35
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,540
Specially positioned for every subgenius.

36
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:37,520
Which denomination was he this year?

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:46,220
A church of the Latter Day Saints, it says, in the clothes which they are now sportively wearing.

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,640
Somebody was joking about how they taste better than Baptists.

39
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,660
Well, I wouldn't know, being on a salt-free diet.

40
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:04,940
Of course, we have our own ceremony later on in the days, the Baptism at Old Sequaw's Pond,

41
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:11,240
where we shall wash the conspiracy out and true slackfulness in,

42
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:19,900
so long as the participants individually renounce the conspiracy and all its works.

43
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:25,480
I can hear Susie the floozy chanting in the background.

44
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,840
She hasn't lost her voice yet.

45
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,340
Probably be a couple of days.

46
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:36,180
Well, she throws herself so wildly into the proceedings one hates to remonstrate.

47
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:49,820
And later on there's supposed to be a pipe organ concert and many other things coming up.

48
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,960
There'll be all kinds of organs in concert later on.

49
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:56,840
Yes, too many to describe or enumerate.

50
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:04,280
All practice for the moment when the rupture happens.

51
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:12,300
At 7 a.m. July 5th, 1998, we have faith that this happens to be that year, finally.

52
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:19,820
And coincidentally, the movie crew will be here filming the subgenius movie.

53
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,580
We have been wrong 21 times before.

54
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,340
Although the first two times we looked at those as drills.

55
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:38,420
It turned out that the subsequent 19 after those first two drills turned out to have been drills.

56
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,480
Well, we were not right enough.

57
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,320
There's a lot of things different this year.

58
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:50,600
I have a new heart and new ears.

59
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,740
I'm wearing hearing aids at X Day for the first time.

60
00:04:53,740 --> 00:05:00,060
Not to mention the brain and the courage that were passed out before we got started.

61
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,620
What, somebody was passing out brains?

62
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,360
Well...

63
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,180
All I saw was people passing out.

64
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,420
Well, it's a difficult procedure.

65
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,100
It causes a momentary lapse, a relaxation of consciousness.

66
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,460
But when they spring up from the soil as springs the trampled herbage of the field,

67
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,840
they exult in a new bulging exposed brain.

68
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:26,740
They're performing their doctor music.

69
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,060
Yes, this is most interesting.

70
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:34,200
The flashing knives and saws that are hurled back and forth.

71
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:38,640
Of course, if they slip, it's a matter of great merriment.

72
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:40,620
Another dancer is put into the field.

73
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,980
I like that weird little instrument they made from coffee cans and rubber bands.

74
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:51,820
They're nothing if not creative and inventive.

75
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:54,760
And the new world will need such invention,

76
00:05:55,120 --> 00:06:02,080
as we leave all of the discarded and useless, tired, senescent appurtenances of civilization permanently behind.

77
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,420
That's true. I'll be able to just leave this junky old mixing board here.

78
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,420
All of these beat up old mics.

79
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:15,680
We won't need any of that anymore.

80
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,240
Your new mixing board, a board, will be the size of a thumbnail.

81
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,420
In fact, it will be.

82
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:28,140
It will be a thumbnail from one of the many species that populates this quadrant of the galaxy.

83
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:31,300
It'll do all the mixing for you.

84
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:33,900
Yes, you've got to keep an eye on it.

85
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,320
No, you don't. It's all automatic and it's self-editing.

86
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,320
It knows when you'll be bored.

87
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,960
And it automatically erases those recordings.

88
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,480
Well, it will be a race between boredom and satisfaction.

89
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,620
Are those some stickers?

90
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:56,120
Yes, I have two stickers with artwork by Reverend Catfeather.

91
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,240
Oh, how nice.

92
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:59,200
And I wanted to... I love her artwork.

93
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,940
She specializes in monster decal style.

94
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:08,380
That's wonderful stuff. I gather she's not going to make it this year.

95
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,180
Like so many people.

96
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,060
We'll have to go buy... pick her up.

97
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,040
Her evil conspiracy boss would not let her go.

98
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:20,540
And, you know, many people simply quit their jobs because they have faith in the new world.

99
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,000
The world will indeed end and they won't need a job.

100
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:28,800
But the conspiracy is unwilling to let go. Its claws are firmly curled.

101
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,480
It's lucky for us, Dr. Howell, that we're both art bums by trade.

102
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:37,000
There are times when that comes in handy.

103
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:41,240
Not at meal time because we aren't really paid very much.

104
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,460
No, but at least we don't answer to anybody's time clock.

105
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,480
Right.

106
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,220
We sleep when we want to.

107
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,820
Which is most of the time.

108
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:58,580
And occasionally crank out something that somebody calls art or a show.

109
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:04,920
Luckily, our audience is subgeniuses who are the possibly the most easily amused.

110
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,980
And as Candy Strecker dubbed subgeniuses, they're SAPs.

111
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,760
SAPs.

112
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,880
S-A-P-s or self-amusing personalities.

113
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:17,460
Okay, I never heard of that.

114
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:21,220
I never heard the Reverend Candy say that, but it sounds typically clever.

115
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,160
She coined that one millions of years ago.

116
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,440
The self-amusing personality or SAP.

117
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:34,160
And that is a skill that almost defines subgeniuses.

118
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:39,960
Yes, not to be bored and require petty distractions and silly amusements.

119
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:45,840
As I've often said, all a subgenius needs is a handful of dirt to be entertained.

120
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:53,920
But you do have to know how to look at the dirt to truly see that handful of dirt.

121
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:59,940
And the full tactile range as one sifts it through one's feeling fingers.

122
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,760
If you have a little pocket magnifying glass, you can see the monsters in there.

123
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:07,380
That's the wonderful thing about nature.

124
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:08,780
It's full of monsters.

125
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,540
Yes.

126
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:15,820
Now, you've been studying the ancient kind, but you haven't given up your travelogue of micro-lifes.

127
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,520
What's the most interesting thing about your travels?

128
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,900
Well, I sort of have for a couple of years now.

129
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,760
I haven't gone hunting with my microscope slightly.

130
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:28,720
I brought the wrong one to the ranch in Texas.

131
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,460
And that just threw me off.

132
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,580
It threw me off my game.

133
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:38,780
So I've been hunting larger animals using cameras and a hound dog.

134
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,360
You know what's frustrating me?

135
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,080
Those armadillos, Dr. Howell.

136
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,440
I have armadillos in my yard.

137
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:45,800
They play with me.

138
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:50,540
Every night they come out and they dig these ugly triangular divots.

139
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,700
Now, why would they be after doing that?

140
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,180
To eat grub worms that live in my yard.

141
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:59,880
Are the grub worms something you'd rather have there?

142
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,700
No, not especially.

143
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,340
But I also don't want to have the armadillos there.

144
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,040
I did a lot of research into what a homeowner does to get rid of armadillos.

145
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:15,580
And there were a lot of friendly, armadillo-friendly techniques.

146
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,200
Like trapping them and taking them somewhere far away.

147
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,720
I thought if you played Christian rock music they would wander away from the property.

148
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,520
Well, but then that's going to drive us away too.

149
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,640
Well, yes, of course.

150
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,040
Nothing's easy.

151
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,980
But the bottom line is that the most common suggestion was,

152
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,320
well, you sit out there at night until they come out and then you shoot them.

153
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,340
That simple.

154
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:42,220
Yeah, well.

155
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:45,560
I saw videos of a guy grabbing armadillos by the tail.

156
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:48,680
And slinging them over his fence.

157
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:50,080
It didn't seem to do him any harm.

158
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,440
And he said they're just going to come back.

159
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,700
He just liked to catch them and sling them.

160
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,040
It didn't seem to hurt him terribly.

161
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,260
Of course, only a couple of thousand years back,

162
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:06,480
there were the Volkswagen-sized glyptodonts and dodecurids walking around.

163
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,200
And they'll be back, friends.

164
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,640
We're going to bring the glyptodonts back.

165
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,380
All of the giant mammals.

166
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,980
The dodecurus has a spiked tail on the end of a...

167
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,300
A spiked club on the end of the tail.

168
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,760
Unlike the rounded glyptodont.

169
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:31,360
And these spikes seem to be made out of hair like the rhinoceros horn.

170
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:38,380
Well, don't tell any insecure, impotent men about that.

171
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:41,880
They'll be chopping those horns and tails off right and left.

172
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:44,240
Because they're not dudes.

173
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,840
They're not dudes paying subgeniuses,

174
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,960
who automatically get everything they want on X-Day.

175
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:54,580
And because they're primitive believers in sympathetic magic.

176
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:59,380
Not like subgeniuses, advanced believers in unsympathetic magic.

177
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:04,100
Well, we're believers in the magic of the forbidden sciences.

178
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:05,640
Just so.

179
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:12,020
And under the Trump administration, all science is forbidden.

180
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,220
So are scientific purses.

181
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,940
And our view has considerably expanded through all the scientific disciplines.

182
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:21,760
Right.

183
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,980
Well, we can make astronomy and astrology work together.

184
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,560
Of course, we have to change both of them a lot.

185
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,680
But that's the fun part.

186
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,440
You build up your science and then you break it.

187
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,160
You just find some way to tear it to pieces and start all over again.

188
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,160
You modify it.

189
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:47,140
And on the way, it modifies you.

190
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:54,640
A healthy, syncretistic relationship with knowledge of all kinds.

191
00:12:56,280 --> 00:12:59,620
A companion and a companionable form.

192
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,380
When one is alone in the waste places of the earth or of the spirit,

193
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,640
it will accompany you.

194
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,760
Well, this is a laid-back X-Day.

195
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:14,200
Well, this is a laid-back X-Day.

196
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:14,900
Yes, it is.

197
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:21,180
And threatens to lay further back, to become entirely somnolent and snooze-worthy,

198
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:27,460
until it cannot be told from the dream, which usually precedes X-Day.

199
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:32,420
I actually have X-Day nightmares, Dr. Howell.

200
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:36,040
And some of them, I understand, sometimes are realized.

201
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,500
Yeah, they usually are.

202
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,640
At some point during every X-Day, my nightmares come true.

203
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:48,640
And I'm wandering through a big party full of drunken, tittering, giggling, unsympathetic people

204
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:52,860
trying to get some simple, plain chore done, like

205
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,100
Yes.

206
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:57,220
find my car keys, and no one will help.

207
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:00,960
Or find my children. That's another common one.

208
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,760
They've probably got the car keys.

209
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:08,920
Wandering endlessly through semi-familiar landscapes,

210
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:13,120
asking for help and being tittered at.

211
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:16,740
It's interesting. That is a search dream.

212
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,120
And the thing about the search dream is that it's about the search,

213
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:23,720
and you never find what you're searching for.

214
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:29,240
Though you can be distracted and go into different realms and different phases of the dream.

215
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:35,560
And unconcerned, laughing people or people distracting you are a part of that dream.

216
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:38,900
My father used to have a dream back when we lived in the United States.

217
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:40,180
He lived in tornado country.

218
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:44,220
That a tornado was coming and he was out trying to call the kids in.

219
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,960
And they were laughing and not paying attention with him.

220
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,660
And the neighbor kid who was sort of dopey was there and not paying attention.

221
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:53,320
And the tornado was coming closer and closer.

222
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:57,160
But of course the dream simply perpetuates this.

223
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,340
The tornado never actually gets there.

224
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,880
The kids never actually come into the house.

225
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:07,780
Then another common dream is the one where you're

226
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,860
suddenly realize you're nude in a crowd of people.

227
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,060
Often it's at school or something.

228
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,900
And everybody is jeering and mocking you.

229
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:18,960
Well they don't usually.

230
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,860
A common dream that really terrifies many people.

231
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:27,560
For me, it's simply the memory of an ex-day long ago.

232
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,600
The year that we thought was 1998.

233
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,920
The false 1998.

234
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:38,220
When the saucers failed to come, who did they blame but old Reverend Stang?

235
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:40,540
Because Bob was wise enough to stay away.

236
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,000
But it's 8661, right?

237
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,940
Except that if that is so, then how come the rest of the writing on the page was written?

238
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,820
Oh, I think that's all confused.

239
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,960
I think it meant to say 1998.

240
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:54,080
Oh, alright.

241
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,400
I still have faith.

242
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,400
There's no way we can wait 8,000 years or whatever.

243
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,620
6,000.

244
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:07,960
But I did end up naked in front of about 300 people.

245
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,220
Who were jeering and mocking my nakedness.

246
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,960
In the muddy frog pond with leeches and all that.

247
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,560
So I don't have that nightmare anymore.

248
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,380
It's not a nightmare, it's just a memory.

249
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,000
And it wasn't really that bad.

250
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:27,180
Because I managed to remember all the comeback lines I had come up with during the preceding 20 years.

251
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:29,340
No esprit d'escalier there.

252
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:29,880
Just in case.

253
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,780
But yeah, you come to ex-day and you can conquer your dreams and phobias.

254
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,120
By living them.

255
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,240
Well, wait a minute.

256
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,020
It hasn't conquered my ex-day dream nightmares.

257
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,600
I still have those.

258
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,280
But it's sometimes hard to tell the difference.

259
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,540
Am I dreaming or am I really running around ex-day trying to find my car keys?

260
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,840
Why not both?

261
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:56,660
Why not both?

262
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,480
That's what I say.

263
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,760
What about the double dream where you think you have waked but it's still part of the dream.

264
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:03,880
And then you wake from that.

265
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,260
I don't like those.

266
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,820
Because those are the ones where Bob shows up.

267
00:17:09,860 --> 00:17:12,240
Like in American Werewolf in London.

268
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,200
If you remember that.

269
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:16,300
Oh yeah, yeah. Sure.

270
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:20,220
They dream that Nazi werewolves attack and kill everybody.

271
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,920
And then they wake up.

272
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,320
Oh thank God, it was just a dream.

273
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,640
And then Nazi werewolves attack and kill everybody.

274
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,520
Freddy Krueger was really good with those.

275
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,300
The Nightmare on Elm Street movies were wonderful pieces of...

276
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,320
Beginning surrealism for kids.

277
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:43,220
Yes, Freddy Krueger had an animus, an axe to grind.

278
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,180
And was malevolent toward that generation.

279
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,980
But since then he's had a profitable career in the US Senate.

280
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,660
Now we have a number of things to go through.

281
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:04,460
Later on in the festival we'll be having the Bulldada auction.

282
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:14,040
And this Bulldada auction will be greater and deeper and more resonant and resounding than any other Bulldada auction ever before.

283
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:20,580
Because it contains some of the essential part of subgenius households.

284
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:25,280
That simply were too bulky to pack up for the saucers.

285
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:30,820
We've got the Nenslow's collection of old science fiction magazines.

286
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,140
Analog and stuff like that. A whole box of those.

287
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:37,500
Fantasy and science fiction. Unknown and so forth.

288
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:41,100
Some of the covers aren't too bad. I understand you've got the good ones.

289
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:46,120
And Ace double-decker science fiction novels.

290
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,840
One of them containing A.E. van Vogt's...

291
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:56,260
What's the one about? Primitives with a galaxy spanning civilization.

292
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,820
One of the covers I got was illustrated a story titled...

293
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,140
A God Named Smith.

294
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:09,620
And it showed a giant fist clutching a rocket ship.

295
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,260
In space. A big hairy hand. I guess that was Smith's hand.

296
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:18,300
A God Named Smith. I liked the ring of that.

297
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:22,860
Didn't that happen on the old Star Trek? A giant hand once grabbed them.

298
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:26,500
They had to shoot electricity through the hull and like that.

299
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,520
A stark fist of removal, friends. You never know when that thing's gonna come down.

300
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,220
A God Named Smith.

301
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,860
A God Named Smith.

302
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:41,860
Wasn't the God Named Smith who was visiting the world of the future?

303
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:44,820
Well, that was a different God Named Smith.

304
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,860
That was actually my dad, the late Hugh Montgomery Smith, playing God.

305
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,960
I never saw him so nervous.

306
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:57,320
Nor was it the God who is a Smith, Hephaestus or Mulsimer or Vulcan,

307
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,280
who welds and creates for the other gods.

308
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,460
Now, Dr. Howell, speaking of the Bulldot auction,

309
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:11,520
we have eight mystery boxes here that were shipped by a Reverend Sean Garrett.

310
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:15,640
He wrote to me about six months ago and said,

311
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:26,640
like so many people, I've put all of my illegally downloaded MP3s and bootlegs onto hard drives.

312
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,740
Or one hard drive.

313
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:34,220
And so I'm getting rid of, it turned out to be eight boxes of discs

314
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,180
full of this guy's collection of hipster listing material.

315
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,220
I haven't opened a single one.

316
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:49,480
Let's not be too excited because the potential purchasers are also those who have given up discs

317
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:54,940
for the pleasure of MP3s and thumb drives and so forth.

318
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:57,780
So they may turn up their...

319
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,920
well powdered noses at this treasure trove.

320
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:06,500
Not be willing to spin a disc here or there.

321
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:14,240
You know, at Burning Man I record ads for my show, which I have there,

322
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,680
and I take it to the radio station.

323
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,260
Last year when I did that, I took them and they said,

324
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,780
oh, we don't play discs anymore.

325
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,740
Yeah, right, right.

326
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:28,720
My son said to me recently, Dad, I think you're the only person I know who still uses iPads.

327
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,580
Optical media.

328
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,400
I didn't even know what he was talking about.

329
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:37,060
I finally went, he means CDs and DVDs.

330
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,400
I'm so old, I'm still recording things on things.

331
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,780
Nowadays you don't record things on things.

332
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:50,660
Yes, you don't, but you have to fish for them through the cloud or whatever it is

333
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:55,020
while the audience restlessly stirs, wishing instant gratification.

334
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,360
On the other hand, if you just pop in a disc or a nice...

335
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:03,380
cassette or a cart or eight track, it instantly comes out.

336
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,920
Now I see you're eagerly tearing open one of these mystery boxes right now.

337
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,080
Let's see what lies within.

338
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:19,140
This one is labeled, it says, weird electronics, post psychedelic,

339
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:22,980
legendary pink dots, etc.

340
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:26,640
I don't know if I ever got to the post psychedelic phase.

341
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:28,700
The rest of it is...

342
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:29,880
obscured.

343
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:33,740
Be careful as you wield that razor sharp package opener.

344
00:22:34,340 --> 00:22:35,720
And my box cutter.

345
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:38,240
You can get a lot done with a box cutter these days.

346
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,700
Well, just don't cut too far.

347
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,300
Well, here they are, folks.

348
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:46,340
Disc after disc.

349
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,040
In...

350
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,540
jewel boxes, as I believe they once called them.

351
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:56,260
Yeah, they are labeled and they're not MP3s, they are CDs.

352
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,160
CDs?

353
00:22:57,160 --> 00:23:01,900
The caretaker selected memories from the haunted ballroom.

354
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,300
Okay.

355
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,340
Steven Hugo Rosin's Saskatchewan.

356
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,600
Nurse with wound and erinos.

357
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,060
Santorlena bicycle.

358
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:16,820
I suppose...

359
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:18,280
Another, the caretaker.

360
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,940
Scanners album, Warhol's surface.

361
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,960
I've never heard of any of this.

362
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,980
No, I too, unfortunately.

363
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:26,560
The coil.

364
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:27,940
But that's not surprising.

365
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,320
Wakeford and Stapleton.

366
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,060
Amenti Sun Crown.

367
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,220
I've never heard of any of these.

368
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,440
I suppose they don't have Who Threw the Overalls and Mrs. Murphy's Chowder.

369
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,620
Well, that's what I was hoping.

370
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:41,240
Yeah.

371
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:44,620
It was a really old bull dada that I could sort of recognize.

372
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:44,980
Right.

373
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,560
So, this...

374
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,500
These modern productions are all very well,

375
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:53,920
but there's nothing to equal from what I heard.

376
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:54,860
So, I...

377
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:55,020
I...

378
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:59,640
It would take all festival to auction these off one by one.

379
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:02,800
We might have to auction box after box,

380
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:10,300
depending on who has room in the storage compartments in the staterooms on the craft.

381
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,100
But, of course, they have their trick, don't they?

382
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:19,440
The aliens have the trick of miniaturization and phasing out bulk.

383
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,140
So, essentially, you can store anything.

384
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,520
I don't understand how that works, but...

385
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,720
It's like Dr. Lau's circus.

386
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,240
It's much bigger on the inside than it is on the outside.

387
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,260
Yes.

388
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,940
Well, they've managed to figure that out.

389
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,540
There'll be a lot to learn.

390
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,020
We can't rest and be ignoramuses forever in the new world.

391
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:40,280
Yeah, we can.

392
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:41,360
We sure can.

393
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:41,940
We can...

394
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:46,700
We can be stupid, ignorant idiots if we want to be.

395
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,500
But then who's going to operate all the contraptoids?

396
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,720
Who needs to operate anything?

397
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,500
I mean, we can...

398
00:24:54,500 --> 00:25:02,280
If we want to, live like standard, typical sci-fi future people, surrounded by gadgets.

399
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:09,180
Or we could just sit in the woods twiddling our thumbs and playing with ourselves, as it were.

400
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,140
Sign me up.

401
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:11,100
That's all...

402
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,980
I mean, it's all up to us.

403
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:15,880
The hard part is making up your mind, I suppose.

404
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,060
Yes.

405
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:21,920
Now, I hope there's not going to be any giant insect aggression this year.

406
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:28,780
I just saw one of those large black wasps circling near the same kind that stung Baby Bear

407
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,780
and stung me in the face last year.

408
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:35,560
Well, Hal, that's why I bring you to X Day every year, because they love you.

409
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:36,960
They stay off of me.

410
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:42,000
I think it just bumbled into my face and didn't know what it was doing, and so it stung me

411
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,060
just because it was there.

412
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:51,440
I've been surrounded by stinging insects every year while I'm in Texas, and I have yet to

413
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,340
be stung once.

414
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,200
Well, that's good.

415
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:55,820
They recognize you as a fellow Texan.

416
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:05,220
Yeah, we have these giant red mud dauber hornets that actually lived in the house for quite

417
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:05,580
a while.

418
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:06,260
No kidding.

419
00:26:06,560 --> 00:26:09,520
We managed to get rid of those by patching the outside.

420
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,300
You found the nest and relocated it.

421
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:16,780
Yeah, but I have spared more nests than I've destroyed.

422
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:21,420
Well, I'm sure that counts for you in the great silhouette.

423
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:21,420


424
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:21,740
I'm sure that counts for you in the great silhouette.

425
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:21,740


426
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:21,740


427
00:26:21,740 --> 00:26:22,360
You're a celestial ledger.

428
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:28,120
No, when I go to the wasp afterlife, it'll be Wasp Heaven instead of Wasp Hell.

429
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,840
Does his name appear in the Book of Life?

430
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:34,720
The Book of Wasp, Saving or Killing Life?

431
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:38,740
His name does appear, Lord.

432
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:51,420
His name appears, but he has slain many of us.

433
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:52,020
I'm sure he's one of our kind.

434
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,140
3,000 stings.

435
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,660
Next.

436
00:26:57,160 --> 00:27:04,220
I also spared a big nest of red harvester ants.

437
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,920
Oh, as long as they weren't fire ants.

438
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:10,480
Well, that's why I spared them, because they're enemies of the fire ants.

439
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:18,880
They compete with the fire ants, and I want to drive the fire ants away and nourish the

440
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,720
red harvester ants.

441
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,180
because the red harvester ants were the diet of the horned toads.

442
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,960
They belong there, unlike the fire ants.

443
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,460
The fire ants are invasives.

444
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,040
An invasive species.

445
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,740
Build the wall!

446
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,280
That won't stop them fire ants.

447
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,400
No, they can tunnel right under that wall.

448
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:42,360
But yeah, I spared the giant red ants

449
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:47,180
so that they could help me do battle against the tiny, tiny fire ants.

450
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,220
I grew up with those red ants.

451
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,900
They were all over the school playground.

452
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:56,660
They were out in the outfield where I was always stationed.

453
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,400
Do they bite?

454
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,520
Yes, they do.

455
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,180
They will bite and they have a sting.

456
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:07,480
And you know, I can remember being bitten and stung once in my childhood,

457
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,680
and that was it.

458
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,980
I've learned how to live with them.

459
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,080
And the ants are my friend.

460
00:28:17,920 --> 00:28:19,420
I can pick them up.

461
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:19,900
They're...

462
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:20,200
If you...

463
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:20,200


464
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,240
If you know the trick, they're easy to pick up and scare girls with.

465
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,780
I've seen other people pick scorpions up by the tail.

466
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:30,000
No, I wouldn't want to do that.

467
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,860
That's not something I would want to practice with.

468
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,480
No, they might be faster than you think.

469
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,540
Oh, they are always faster than you think.

470
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,360
It's the damn scorpions.

471
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:41,900
They hide in your shoe.

472
00:28:42,620 --> 00:28:43,100
Yes.

473
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,080
That's the worst.

474
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:48,500
But actually, we've so far have had...

475
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,200
made peace with most of them.

476
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:50,780
We've had a lot of peace with most of our varmints.

477
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:53,080
I had to slay a copperhead.

478
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:55,640
Yes, I heard about that incident.

479
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:56,840
That was awful.

480
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:57,500
Yeah.

481
00:28:57,620 --> 00:28:58,080
It was really awful.

482
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,380
I had to use a shovel.

483
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,860
Did you just decapitate him with the shovel?

484
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:05,540
You can imagine how hard it is to decapitate.

485
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,000
Oh, sure.

486
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,160
And this wasn't a big snake.

487
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:07,660
Yeah.

488
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,080
He was about three feet long.

489
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,080
They're well-knit, well put together.

490
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:17,160
I tried to chop him in half with the shovel, and that didn't work.

491
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,380
All I could do was kind of hurt him.

492
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,180
Just get behind him.

493
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,240
Behind the head.

494
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,020
You say that like it's easy.

495
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:32,500
Once I crippled him, I then took up a machete, a brand new sharpened machete I'd never used

496
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,700
for anything else yet, and attempted to chop his fool head off.

497
00:29:36,820 --> 00:29:42,320
But no amount of chopping by me would separate that tough creature's head from its body.

498
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,800
Of course, the whole time I was going, oh, I hate this.

499
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:49,940
But my son-in-law managed to get the head off the thing.

500
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:56,920
By putting the shovel behind his head and jumping up and down on the shovel with his full weight.

501
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,480
He weighs about as much as me.

502
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,000
And we finally got the head loose.

503
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:07,360
And Dr. Howell, would you believe that half an hour later, that head was still trying to bite?

504
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,420
And the body, no doubt, was still coiling.

505
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,920
You know, I just read an interesting book about severed heads.

506
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,440
You would.

507
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,980
I ordered it when I saw it existed.

508
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,420
It's called Severed.

509
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,900
It's written by an English woman.

510
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:28,140
But one chapter deals with the question of how long does the head retain consciousness when severed,

511
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:31,800
with all the accounts of people who went under the guillotine and held them up

512
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,640
and swore they made faces and rolled their eyes.

513
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:37,540
Yeah, I don't like to think about that.

514
00:30:38,220 --> 00:30:43,260
Well, then one doctor suggested, shake the blood out of the severed head,

515
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:48,220
and it will lose consciousness more quickly, with an illustration of how to do it.

516
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:51,560
Was Arnold Palmer on the cover?

517
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:58,200
No, this was mostly about old decapitations, decapitations throughout history.

518
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,120
Also, headhunters.

519
00:31:00,120 --> 00:31:02,120
There was an interesting chapter about that.

520
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,980
Those savage natives who hunt heads.

521
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,240
And they bring shrunken heads home for our museums.

522
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:09,380
Yes, they do.

523
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:14,620
Because we say, hey, you savage natives, go out and get some heads for our museums.

524
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:19,280
It's the honkies who were precipitating the headhunters.

525
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:22,060
Hunting heads, which used to be a rare thing.

526
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,620
But then every museum wanted some severed heads.

527
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:28,580
Then during the 19th century, our author goes on,

528
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:34,120
the science of craniometry became prevalent.

529
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,260
Walking hand in hand with phrenology, the study of the bumps on the head.

530
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:44,980
And in order to facilitate it, they skull farmed hundreds of thousands of heads of all types

531
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:48,900
from all over the world and measured them and took many measurements,

532
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:53,860
all of which are inconclusive and ultimately prove not much.

533
00:31:54,020 --> 00:32:01,300
But many museums have vast collections of leering skulls, which come from this period.

534
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,220
The head has always seemed to be a trophy in wartime and in other times.

535
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:13,800
But according to the book Severed, the latest hope is, as you've probably heard,

536
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:19,240
perfusion, keeping the head and the brain alive for a future time.

537
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:24,320
When it can be plugged in again to harass future generations.

538
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,520
What a nightmare.

539
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:26,660
Yes, I know.

540
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:27,880
It's horrible.

541
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,180
I know, yes.

542
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:29,880
Really terrible.

543
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,020
Don't let that happen to my head.

544
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,620
Well, once you're a head, you can't do anything about it.

545
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,300
You can't even talk until they turn on the air, which goes through your...

546
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,080
Turn me off.

547
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:40,940
Please.

548
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,360
Shut up.

549
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:43,000
Now, now.

550
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,440
Let's just give you a shot.

551
00:32:44,620 --> 00:32:47,240
And then you can tell us more of that funny Bob stuff.

552
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,060
Let me die.

553
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,400
Shut up.

554
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:51,960
Shut up and tell us some more Bob stuff or we'll turn on the current.

555
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,680
No, no, no.

556
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,060
Don't push the red button.

557
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,360
No!

558
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,320
Okay, well, one day Bob was...

559
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:59,280
When he was a little boy, he could fly, you know.

560
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:02,140
And he had magic powers and he robbed a bank.

561
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:05,540
And the police shot at him and everybody got mad at him for shooting at a kid.

562
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:06,820
That's how lucky Bob was.

563
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,660
Okay, can you kill me now?

564
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,800
Please, please kill me.

565
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,640
Or launch me.

566
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,100
Do anything.

567
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,560
Launch my head into space.

568
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:17,260
Anything to stop this bodiless nightmare.

569
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:19,180
Did you ever see that old...

570
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:21,160
Old monster movie called The Head?

571
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,320
Yes, but I don't remember it.

572
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,860
Well, Wellman and I watched it.

573
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,920
Watched it while we were doing my podcast show.

574
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:31,780
And I was quite surprised by it.

575
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:39,600
It was one I'd always wanted to see ever since I saw the picture in Famous Monsters years and years ago during the early 60s.

576
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,940
I thought that looks kind of creepy, kind of cool.

577
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:47,300
Boy, I had no idea this is a most unusual movie.

578
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,160
Not only does it have...

579
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:57,240
It has a lot of multiple severed head storylines, but it also has nudity in it, which you just didn't expect in a movie of that period.

580
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,160
That was in the 50s, wasn't it?

581
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,620
Yes, but it was German, you see.

582
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:11,140
So then they also have that subplot like in The Head Without a Body, whatever that movie is, you know, that they always show.

583
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:12,460
The woman with the severed head.

584
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:13,300
The head that wouldn't die.

585
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,080
The head that wouldn't die, aka the brain that wouldn't die.

586
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:17,280
Um...

587
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,500
But in this movie,

588
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:24,400
they transplant a head onto a stripper's body like that guy intended to, and it's perfectly all right.

589
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:28,040
And the woman goes on with her life, and there's no retribution.

590
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:35,600
The other heads beg to be killed, but in this case, the woman does just fine post-op.

591
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:40,300
Yes, it's a most unusual film, which we recommend.

592
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,220
Wholeheartedly and wholeheadedly.

593
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,140
Well, we're heading for...

594
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,660
We're heading for the final head launchings of X-Day.

595
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,100
That's right.

596
00:34:53,480 --> 00:35:05,740
And it's conceivable that millions, possibly even billions of heads could be launched, none belonging to subgeniuses.

597
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:14,280
But perfused, kept in some form of consciousness as they are launched from the buckling, shifting, flaming crust of the earth?

598
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:18,460
If we wanted to be that cruel, we could keep them alive in jars, like in...

599
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:19,260
Futurama.

600
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:25,120
And they can travel through the cosmos, spreading the message of enlightened peacefulness.

601
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:28,920
Well, they'd be spreading the message of don't mess with the subgeniuses.

602
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,900
Yeah, well, that's the same thing, really.

603
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:39,020
The way to have peace in the cosmos is not to oppose the will of anything any subgenius wants or requests.

604
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:43,520
See, folks, world peace is within our grasp.

605
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:46,960
That's right, but we're not going to leave it to the...

606
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,040
Uh...

607
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,240
Uh...

608
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,020
The others.

609
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,840
It must be imposed.

610
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,660
The test of any such system is how it is enforced.

611
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:02,460
And we of the other planets, they say, have created a race of incorruptible robots.

612
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:06,880
And these act at the first sign of aggression.

613
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:08,880
The peril for...

614
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,060
For attracting their attention is too terrible to mention, so we won't mention it at this time.

615
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:18,100
Dr. Onan Canna.

616
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:18,180
Onan Canna.

617
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:23,720
Canna-bite-a described us as the mind-your-own-business police.

618
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:25,680
That's not bad.

619
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:31,880
You know, mind-your-own-business was once thought of as a possible slogan for U.S. currency

620
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:36,840
and was printed on some Confederate currency before we came up with,

621
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:45,600
in God we trust, or the Novus Ordos Eclorum and all that stuff.

622
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:48,080
And many people thought, this is terrible.

623
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:53,700
terrible, reflects very badly in our country to have these obnoxious, smart-alecky slogans

624
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:58,140
in our money, so they fixed it up with the Masonic slogans that we now have.

625
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:04,360
Well, the Masonic slogans have the benefit of being mysterious.

626
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,320
Most people don't have any idea what they mean, although they come up with lots of explanations.

627
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,380
But there's an easy explanation.

628
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:16,980
If you know anything about Masonry or have read St. J. Kinney's book on the Freemasons,

629
00:37:16,980 --> 00:37:23,780
the idea is that the pyramid is the structure that we build here on Earth,

630
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:29,880
and we essentially create the place for God, or create God ourselves,

631
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:35,260
with those 33 bricks that are laid down.

632
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:42,860
And Novus Ordo Cyclorum is properly translated as a new order of worlds.

633
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,200
And Anuit Coeptis means he.

634
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,500
That is to say the Almighty Spirit favors our beginnings.

635
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,220
Well, what's that eyeball all about?

636
00:37:53,480 --> 00:38:00,200
That is the eye of God, sweeping around, looking at everybody, including you.

637
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,220
He knows when you are sleeping.

638
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,600
He knows when you're awake.

639
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:06,900
He knows when you are good or bad.

640
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,160
That's the idea, at any rate.

641
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,400
Well, you know, the lost continent of Atlantis, that civilization,

642
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,500
used a pyramid.

643
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:20,420
Or a triangle shape with a circle in the top.

644
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,080
Yes.

645
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,260
As their most common...

646
00:38:23,260 --> 00:38:25,080
It was like the logo of their culture.

647
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:29,100
Atlantis was actually an archipelago.

648
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:33,960
It was a continent in primitive times, but it kept submerging.

649
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:39,740
And eventually the capital, or the chief island, which was also named Atlantis,

650
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,900
from which they got their name, although the inhabitants knew it as Poiseidonis,

651
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:46,800
was the last...

652
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,280
The last to go.

653
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,660
And the last mountaintops of Atlantis.

654
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:55,100
The citadel, or Acropolis, was the last to disappear beneath the sea.

655
00:38:55,840 --> 00:39:00,300
Poiseidon, their god, was known by the Hellenes as the god of the sea

656
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:05,160
and the god of earthquakes, an unfortunate combination for the Atlanteans.

657
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:12,020
Well, I may or may not have told you about my research into Atlantis

658
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:14,940
as it relates to Skull Island.

659
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:15,700
Oh?

660
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,360
And...

661
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:22,620
And to the world, the really pre-Atlantean world,

662
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,820
well, actually the post-Atlantean world,

663
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,180
depicted in the video game called Monster Hunter.

664
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:33,760
It took a long time for those islands to submerge,

665
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:42,060
but the final catastrophe was as spectacular as in all the movies and pictures.

666
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:46,780
But up to then it was easy, like global climate change,

667
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,640
it occurred at a sedate rate, not immediately apprehensive...

668
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,500
apprehensible.

669
00:39:53,820 --> 00:39:58,200
Well, you know, we've been finding Atlantean artifacts all over Stang Ranch,

670
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,680
and they're all going into the Destructionist Evidence Museum.

671
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:07,460
The first one we found, we had walked by it a hundred times.

672
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,960
It was hiding in plain sight, a gigantic triangular stone.

673
00:40:13,380 --> 00:40:14,640
You have to know how to look.

674
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:15,440
Right.

675
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:15,960
And...

676
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:16,780
And...

677
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,360
This one, there apparently...

678
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:23,120
Our land must have been where the final battle

679
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,940
between the different Atlantean cultures.

680
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:31,980
There was one culture that had the, let's call it the eye on the big triangle,

681
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:34,640
or pyramid, was open.

682
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,700
They used a round rock.

683
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,080
And then the other Atlanteans had the eye closed,

684
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,120
and they would use a curved rock with the...

685
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:46,520
Mm-hmm.

686
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,400
Eyelashes added.

687
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:51,920
And sometimes they would add a buck tooth in the bottom of the mouth.

688
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:55,340
So those were like the subgeniuses of the Atlanteans.

689
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,300
They worshipped a sleeping elder god with a buck tooth,

690
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,820
to indicate that it was peacefully stupid.

691
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,560
There was a god that they had called Ugabolus, who had one eye,

692
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:13,080
and was once feared all through the Atlantean kingdoms,

693
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,960
and now is submerged, and no one...

694
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,340
cares for him or worships him.

695
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,200
Well, we can change that.

696
00:41:21,560 --> 00:41:23,100
We can bring it all back.

697
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:25,220
On X Day.

698
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,000
It may be.

699
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:26,980
Fabled, glorious...

700
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:31,160
California will sink, Atlantis will rise, and so forth and so on.

701
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:32,860
Yeah, that's a good idea.

702
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
That wasn't that the lyric of...

703
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:34,860
Like a seesaw.

704
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,900
That was some song in the 60s, wasn't it?

705
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,080
That was part of the lyric of some band?

706
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:44,320
They had that, California will sink, Atlantis will rise?

707
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:45,800
Jimmy, actually, Jimi Hendrix.

708
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:50,140
Kind of did that in some of his lyrics.

709
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:57,780
He did several songs assuming Atlantis was going to come back.

710
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:04,620
In below lost Poseidonus, I was the god Ugabolus.

711
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:10,240
My three horns were of similar above my double diadem.

712
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:16,200
My one eye was a moon one gem found in a monstrous meteor.

713
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:16,500
I was the god Ugabolus.

714
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:16,500


715
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:16,500


716
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:16,500


717
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:16,500


718
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:16,500


719
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:16,500


720
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:16,500


721
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:23,820
Incredible far peoples came, called by the thunder of my fame, and fleetly passed my

722
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:31,820
terraced throne, where titan pards and lions stood, as pours an ever-lapsing flood before

723
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:34,320
the wind of winter blown.

724
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:42,460
Before me many a chorister made offering of alien myrrh, and copper-bearded sailors brought

725
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:46,500
from isles of ever-foaming seas enormous lumps of myrrh.

726
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:47,500
Hereweỳ begin.

727
00:42:56,780 --> 00:42:56,860
I will sing it to you, the music's about to finish.

728
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,260
So after you sat onunning, some loud music vanquished, don't know where you lost your

729
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:57,260


730
00:42:57,260 --> 00:43:00,500
Michael Ray King solid sскиеk my bouti last Opły spoken was in from m loosen

731
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,440
Old

732
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:16,480
manas

733
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:15,300
De

734
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:26,160
serpent crawls, and sea worms are my ministers, and wandering fishes pass me now, or press before

735
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:37,300
mine eyeless brow, as once the thronging worshippers. Clark Ashton Smith. Wow, that was great, Dr. Howland.

736
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:43,780
This music from The Incredible Shrinking Man matched the tone just right, I thought. Yes, The Incredible

737
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:56,460
Shrinking Man came to a state of equilibrium with his condition, finally proclaiming, I still exist in the

738
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:04,180
subatomic world, which we see in Ant-Man. Why don't they remake that one? I've been wondering that, The

739
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:12,040
Incredible Shrinking Man. They could do it so well. Right, I bet you that it's one of those things that's been

740
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,540
in kicking.

741
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:19,200
They're not going to be kicking around Hollywood. Well, they have to mess with it, but the actual thing is so well

742
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:28,220
conceived by Richard Matheson, because the guy, bit by bit, loses all the authority of an adult, and then even of a

743
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:34,020
child, you know, becomes more helpless and dependent. There's a terrible scene where he's out when he's about four

744
00:44:34,020 --> 00:44:41,060
feet tall, and he runs into some kids, and they say, hey, it's that shrinking guy, and they beat him up. He has no

745
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:43,600
dignity. You read the book.

746
00:44:43,780 --> 00:44:51,240
No, I never did read the book, although I'd love to. I'm a big fan of Richard. I think Richard Matheson was one of the giants.

747
00:44:51,340 --> 00:45:00,220
Yes, he really wrote that thing well. The fight with the spider is very well described. The whole thing is well described.

748
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:11,780
Yes, sir. The Incredible Shrinking Guy, but then the opposite is the grotesquely expanding guy, getting larger and larger.

749
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:13,740
Kermit?

750
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,160
The Amazing Colossal Man.

751
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:18,600
Who was exposed to an atomic blast.

752
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,040
As we know, that makes things grow giant.

753
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:30,760
It burned off all his epidermis, but they found on the operating table, not only did his skin grow back, but everything was growing at a hyper-accelerated rate.

754
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,540
I want some of whatever he's having.

755
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:41,260
But then you have to live in a Quonset hut and wear a diaper and lose your temper and all of that stuff. Not that much fun.

756
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:43,460
His brain couldn't still function.

757
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:51,720
Well, as they pointed out, his heart didn't keep pace with the rest of his body, so he occasionally clutched his chest and looked pained.

758
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,940
Bummer, man.

759
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,100
Yeah, I'll say.

760
00:45:55,740 --> 00:46:05,600
So, the thing is, all evil comes from disproportion, and he was certainly a little bit too much for what he needed.

761
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,580
But he came back in War of the Colossal Beast.

762
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,780
Yeah, with his face scraped off.

763
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:12,960
Yeah, well, you know.

764
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,620
You can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs.

765
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:26,160
Anyway, not to devolve into talking about movies and comic books, we have to try not to do that this time.

766
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,780
Good luck.

767
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:31,440
They guide us and have guided us many times.

768
00:46:31,820 --> 00:46:34,220
That's why we were ready for Bob's word.

769
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,340
The Gestalt.

770
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:42,280
The constant exposure to science fiction, monster movies, comic books prepared us for the real life that is to come.

771
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:42,820
They are.

772
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:48,840
They are unsullied by the acts ground by authors and others.

773
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:58,260
They simply intend to entertain, and so they unconsciously and fully express the Gestalt, which animates the civilization which produced them.

774
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:58,640
Right.

775
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,180
That's why it's okay for us to talk about old monster movies.

776
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:04,300
Well, it is, as long as we qualify it.

777
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:10,180
But, on the other hand, you can edit these reminiscences and keep in all the snappy bits.

778
00:47:10,180 --> 00:47:11,200
I try not to, though.

779
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:11,740
Oh, really?

780
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:12,600
Dr. Hal, did you know that?

781
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:12,940
No.

782
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:12,940


783
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,440
I try very hard not to have to edit these things.

784
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:16,760
You keep it raw, then.

785
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,320
Raw, raw, raw.

786
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,680
That's what we have here.

787
00:47:20,440 --> 00:47:21,940
What spirit at XD?

788
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:24,820
We're at less science high.

789
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:26,160
Yes.

790
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:34,540
Well, we have more science high here because we are the last holdouts of scientific knowledge.

791
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,240
We are monster high.

792
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:39,140
We are monster high.

793
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:42,940
If I was a teenage girl, I would want to go to Monster High.

794
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:43,200
Monster High.

795
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,280
Well, monsters like to get high.

796
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:51,780
The problem, though, is that apparently they're only allowed to be very skinny.

797
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:55,920
There are no overweight girls at Monster High.

798
00:47:56,160 --> 00:47:57,860
Wait till they get some years on them.

799
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:04,020
Then the high metabolism runs down and they become solid, blocky, and spread out.

800
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,300
Oh, speaking of Monster High, Dr. Hal, and I won't stay on this subject for long.

801
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:10,420
No, you can stay on the subject as long as you like.

802
00:48:10,500 --> 00:48:11,420
It's gone downhill.

803
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:12,580
Oh, no.

804
00:48:12,580 --> 00:48:14,640
They really went downhill.

805
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,960
They decided, I guess, sales were dropping a little bit.

806
00:48:18,120 --> 00:48:18,880
Oh, no.

807
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:21,700
And they thought, okay, it's not broke.

808
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:22,840
Let's fix it.

809
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:27,740
They hire people and then these people have to justify their existences.

810
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:32,040
Meddling and fooling and, oh, it's so maddening.

811
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:33,140
They normalized them.

812
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:35,540
They're more normal now.

813
00:48:36,560 --> 00:48:40,600
And they've changed the, they rebooted the origin story.

814
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:41,640
The conspiracy.

815
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:42,100
The conspiracy.

816
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:42,260
The conspiracy.

817
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:42,560
The conspiracy.

818
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:42,560


819
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:42,560


820
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:42,560


821
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:42,560


822
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:42,560


823
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:42,560


824
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:42,560


825
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:42,560


826
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,280
They did not let a good thing alone.

827
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:46,820
Oh, they wrecked it.

828
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:51,940
It's pointed more for really little girls now instead of tweens.

829
00:48:53,000 --> 00:49:02,240
And the anti-bullying subtext is pretty much gone because they just made all of the subtext.

830
00:49:02,260 --> 00:49:09,780
Oh, God, they added a new, instead of the headmistress, the decapitated woman who was the.

831
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:10,940
The head.

832
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:11,620
The head.

833
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:12,120
The head.

834
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:12,300
The head.

835
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:12,560
The head.

836
00:49:12,580 --> 00:49:12,640
The head.

837
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:12,640


838
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:12,640


839
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:19,480
They've replaced her with Draculaura's dad, Dracula, who is now being portrayed as a bumbling,

840
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:24,300
bespectacled dad, a la Dennis the Menace's dad.

841
00:49:24,580 --> 00:49:25,360
Boy, that's terrible.

842
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:30,240
An earnest pussy or a wuss or whatever one may say.

843
00:49:30,380 --> 00:49:31,660
I probably shouldn't use that.

844
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:32,580
Well.

845
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,140
See, I will have to edit some.

846
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:39,320
It's been made a word used in public discourse and giant demonstrations.

847
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,620
Perhaps you won't have to do it.

848
00:49:41,740 --> 00:49:42,240
Well, now.

849
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:47,520
Now headlines use words that we're not supposed to say on broadcast radio before 10 o'clock

850
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:47,720
at night.

851
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:48,200
That's right.

852
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:54,860
Broadcast radio needs to catch up with the rapidly shifting words of the national demographic.

853
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:55,560
It's funny.

854
00:49:55,600 --> 00:50:03,900
Now that I'm an old man, I kind of no longer like to use curse words.

855
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:10,480
Well, they have to be saved for those special occasions, not casually spent for idle things

856
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:12,220
when you knock your toes.

857
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,480
Oh, against the table leg.

858
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:19,480
And it's good discipline to come up with more imaginative things.

859
00:50:19,740 --> 00:50:23,460
Of course, when you're really hurt and really bad, of course you're going to cuss a blue

860
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:25,580
streak in the corniest way possible.

861
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:27,160
Because it makes it feel better.

862
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:27,580
Yeah.

863
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:27,920
Yeah.

864
00:50:29,140 --> 00:50:33,260
Whining, complaining, screaming, those are powerful painkillers.

865
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,140
On the other hand.

866
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:35,540
Groaning and griping.

867
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:36,780
Those really help.

868
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:41,940
Sometimes it is a poetic language also, which is rare.

869
00:50:42,220 --> 00:50:42,380
It's a rare thing.

870
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:48,140
But my father always told me about how when he was in the army in World War II, there was

871
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:55,140
a Thanksgiving feast where the sergeant made the most obscene speech before everybody ate.

872
00:50:55,260 --> 00:50:56,680
It was like a grace.

873
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:01,440
But I can't repeat any of it because you would have to edit it all out.

874
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:07,220
But it was a remarkable performance that went on and on while everyone was waiting to eat.

875
00:51:07,420 --> 00:51:07,860
That's great.

876
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:08,420
Yeah.

877
00:51:09,380 --> 00:51:12,120
Some astonishing locutions, which he passed along.

878
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:12,200


879
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:12,200


880
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:13,280
Were made there.

881
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:21,900
I came up with a way to say grace that my dog taught me.

882
00:51:22,360 --> 00:51:22,960
Yeah?

883
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:24,300
It goes like this.

884
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:26,100
Dog is great.

885
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,460
Dog is good.

886
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:30,300
But dog cannot have our food.

887
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:34,300
Well, that's a good thing to keep in mind.

888
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,920
But there's always some kid that feeds him under the table.

889
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,800
Or like in that movie Ant-Man.

890
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:43,320
They feed the giant ant that's under the table.

891
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:43,620
Right.

892
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,000
I enjoyed the Ant-Man movie.

893
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:46,700
I loved it.

894
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:51,340
I thought it was their best thing so far because it was just playful enough.

895
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,740
And the ants were great.

896
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:59,080
When he shrunk down to the micro world and hung out with the ants, he got a little too

897
00:51:59,080 --> 00:52:00,840
attached to them, as you may remember.

898
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:02,040
Right.

899
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:07,140
Where he wants to kill humans because they kill the favorite ant of his and so on.

900
00:52:07,140 --> 00:52:10,720
He's empathizing too much with them.

901
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:10,780


902
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:10,780


903
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:12,560
But still, that's a cool one.

904
00:52:12,580 --> 00:52:14,000
And I hope they bring him back.

905
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,400
But not as Giant Man.

906
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,260
He did turn into giant.

907
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:20,880
He is in one of those Avengers movies.

908
00:52:20,980 --> 00:52:25,100
And he does, for the first time, try being giant.

909
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:25,920
And he's clumsy.

910
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:26,420
Oh, hell.

911
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:26,760
Well, naturally.

912
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:27,980
He has a lot of trouble.

913
00:52:28,160 --> 00:52:30,180
But it does get the job done.

914
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:32,260
I forget which villain he's fighting.

915
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:32,600
Yes.

916
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,620
At least, you know, the problem with the giant is after the work is done, then what?

917
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:39,560
But if you can shrink down, then there's no problem.

918
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:39,960
Yeah.

919
00:52:40,340 --> 00:52:40,780
Yeah.

920
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:48,960
I'd like the first time he shrinks, they packed in every shrinking man gag.

921
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:56,840
Especially like when he fell through the floor cracks onto a turntable, spinning a spinning

922
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:57,300
record.

923
00:52:57,540 --> 00:53:00,760
He's actually holding onto the grooves with his tiny little hands.

924
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,100
Yes.

925
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:07,400
Also, the giant climax, the Battle of the Titans, occurs in a miniature scale in a child's

926
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:07,640
room.

927
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,460
So the camera pulls back.

928
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,720
And you see small objects.

929
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,900
And you see the little objects falling over with a little tap.

930
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:18,520
When up close, they're heaving muscles and hefting huge things and smashing each other.

931
00:53:18,620 --> 00:53:22,760
But in our world, you can hardly tell what's going on.

932
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:32,260
I discovered, much to my horror, sort of by accident, that my wife and I have been a little

933
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,120
bit meaner to bugs than we meant to be.

934
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:35,820
Uh-oh.

935
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:40,020
Well, I got this new camera phone that does close-ups.

936
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,460
And slow motion, really well.

937
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,960
And I started filming insects.

938
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:46,820
And you could see them shaking their little fists at you.

939
00:53:47,020 --> 00:53:47,880
Well, kind of, yeah.

940
00:53:48,140 --> 00:53:56,040
When you see everything slowed down so it's more on their scale, well, the thing I'm thinking

941
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:59,780
of, we saw a really interesting but speedy little tiny beetle.

942
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:02,340
And I wanted to get a clear picture of him.

943
00:54:02,380 --> 00:54:06,380
And Princess Wee kept, he would hide under a rock and she would lift the rock up.

944
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:09,060
And I'd film him scuttling over to the next rock.

945
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:10,000
And she'd lift that one up.

946
00:54:10,020 --> 00:54:16,420
Well, when I looked at the footage and slowed it down, we were seriously abusing that little

947
00:54:16,420 --> 00:54:16,720
guy.

948
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:22,080
Every time she touched one of those rocks, it was like a boulder being shifted around,

949
00:54:22,260 --> 00:54:25,980
knocking him over, smushing his legs.

950
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:31,860
He looked scared in slow motion.

951
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,600
It's hard to describe how an insect can look scared.

952
00:54:36,140 --> 00:54:36,440
But they can.

953
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:40,000
But everything, his motion looked more...

954
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,000


955
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,700
He looked more panicked than just reflex.

956
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:47,320
And I put some monster movie music with it by Bernard Herrmann.

957
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:53,320
And it's a lesson in cruelty to animals and how bad we were without even knowing it.

958
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:54,460
The bug survived.

959
00:54:54,900 --> 00:54:56,280
He got away from us.

960
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:58,500
But he was severely traumatized.

961
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:58,960
He was.

962
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:04,880
And I reformed after learning that.

963
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:09,580
I'm going to put all of my cruelty against my own species.

964
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,740
Be a Buddhist.

965
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,540
Starting on July 5th.

966
00:55:14,700 --> 00:55:17,080
Actually, I'm not that full of vengeance anymore.

967
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:21,080
I have one fifth grade teacher I'm going to resurrect and torture.

968
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,060
Let her know what she did wrong.

969
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:25,700
And put her back in the ground again.

970
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:27,220
That spelling bee thing.

971
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:27,720
Yep.

972
00:55:27,740 --> 00:55:28,440
The spelling bee.

973
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:29,140
Mrs. Darden.

974
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:36,880
And we're coming down near the end of this first hour of slack recorded at X Day.

975
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,560
May it be a slackful hour for all of us.

976
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:39,560


977
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:39,560


978
00:55:39,560 --> 00:55:40,940
For all who hear these words.

979
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:45,700
Well, it's probably going to be slow compared to many shows.

980
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,760
I've been enjoying the background music myself.

981
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:49,440
Yes, always.

982
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:59,040
What I said about the pop culture influences also applies for the music composed for these monster movies and other things.

983
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:06,400
It has the greatest likelihood of surviving to other eras if other eras may exist.

984
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:09,140
But those movies are in black and white, Dad.

985
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:09,820
And they're flat.

986
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,380
I want to see a 3D color hologram.

987
00:56:13,500 --> 00:56:14,780
Well, get to work, kid.

988
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:15,460
With feel around.

989
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:19,340
And filling them out and colorizing and dimensionalizing them.

990
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:21,040
Oh, God.

991
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:23,140
I guess that eventually will happen.

992
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:27,980
We'll see things like the colorized 3D version of...

993
00:56:27,980 --> 00:56:29,840
It came...

994
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,200
Well, wait.

995
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,520
That was in 3D.

996
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:32,680
The Harryhausen movies.

997
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:33,020
Yes.

998
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:35,100
The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms.

999
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:36,800
Colorized and in 3D.

1000
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:37,340
Yes.

1001
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:45,380
But you see they will also be feelable and everything else.

1002
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:47,520
You can feel the monster's teeth.

1003
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:52,300
When that dinosaur swallows that cop, you go right down his gullet with him.

1004
00:56:53,000 --> 00:57:01,060
It's so well done considering the cop is just like a little thing made out of paper that was created at the last minute.

1005
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:03,620
The motion of the legs is extraordinary.

1006
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:04,300
Yeah.

1007
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:04,740
It's fabulous.

1008
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:06,600
You can see the point where he loses life.

1009
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:11,460
But then they must have hauled that guy up on a wire or something.

1010
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:16,020
That's not easy to do when you're so low budge.

1011
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,260
And they must have had a crane.

1012
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:20,420
So they did quite well with what they had.

1013
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:30,300
Eugene Laurier, a great art director who had worked with Jean Renoir and who made many interesting films.

1014
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:35,720
There's a great monster swallowing a man scene in King Kong Skull Island.

1015
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:43,480
When John Goodman finally gets swallowed by one of the big skull crawlers, he's got one of those old fashioned flash cameras.

1016
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:47,820
And he's been completely swallowed by this thing.

1017
00:57:48,020 --> 00:57:51,300
But the camera is still flashing like mad.

1018
00:57:51,540 --> 00:57:53,180
And you can see it.

1019
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:59,780
It makes it possible for the other surviving people to see where the monster is in the fog.

1020
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:04,520
Because the camera flash inside its stomach makes it visible.

1021
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:06,400
When it otherwise wouldn't be.

1022
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,700
I thought that was a fun gag.

1023
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:10,980
Yes, it's a mighty gulp when John Goodman is swallowed.

1024
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:16,620
And I forget whether Samuel L. Jackson is also ingested by the monster.

1025
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,300
Is he?

1026
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:19,160
I think he just gets smashed.

1027
00:58:19,540 --> 00:58:20,100
Oh, well.

1028
00:58:20,100 --> 00:58:21,220
I think he just gets squashed.

1029
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,240
Those monsters are way too big.

1030
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:29,480
But of course we're moving from the original scale to the Toho scale.

1031
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:32,480
So we can have the giant monster smack down.

1032
00:58:32,620 --> 00:58:32,820
Right.

1033
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:39,740
But there was no point in having this King Kong climb the Empire State Building since he's already as tall as the Empire State Building.

1034
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:40,500
Yeah.

1035
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:42,380
I went in ready to hate that movie.

1036
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,060
But I really enjoyed it.

1037
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:44,560
Me too.

1038
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:45,720
As a giant monster movie.

1039
00:58:45,880 --> 00:58:48,860
It's been one of the more enjoyable movies I've seen recently.

1040
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,140
I didn't have problems with it as I did with the others.

1041
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,460
But they tried.

1042
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,260
They tried to be original.

1043
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:56,460
And they succeeded.

1044
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:00,440
It's only the name King Kong that is slightly troublesome.

1045
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:01,160
Right.

1046
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,240
Or Skull Island.

1047
00:59:03,640 --> 00:59:06,440
Well, I love the Peter Jackson version myself.

1048
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,360
I don't have any problems with that one.

1049
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:10,100
People say it's too long.

1050
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,320
But I just love it.

1051
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,520
Well, some could have been cut.

1052
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,580
But not any of the monsters.

1053
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:14,980
The plot was cut.

1054
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:17,200
They did cut big monster scenes.

1055
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:17,860
That's the problem.

1056
00:59:17,860 --> 00:59:18,520
They're not in the theatrical.

1057
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:20,400
They shouldn't cut monster scenes.

1058
00:59:20,520 --> 00:59:25,020
They should cut the nonsense about drawing mustaches on the guy's poster and so on.

1059
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,720
That is not necessary.

1060
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:30,520
The whole subplot of the young Billy Elliot guy.

1061
00:59:30,520 --> 00:59:36,140
Who has a crush on the older black sailor could easily be removed.

1062
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:36,980
And should be.

1063
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,040
You don't start that up again when you're in the giant insect pit.

1064
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:44,660
You are trying to defend yourself while you're in the giant insect pit.

1065
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:47,260
The emphasis seems strangely wrong.

1066
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,380
But, I don't know.

1067
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:53,700
I haven't been in that giant insect pit yet.

1068
00:59:53,780 --> 00:59:54,960
So I can't say.

1069
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:59,420
And we're going to go to that insect pit next episode.

1070
00:59:59,420 --> 01:00:01,080
Of the Hour of Slack.

1071
01:00:01,540 --> 01:00:03,700
We've been on for one hour now.

1072
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:05,660
And I'm going to turn off the show.

1073
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,560
We can go up the hill and get lunch.

1074
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:13,260
Or chat with the subgeniuses.

1075
01:00:14,460 --> 01:00:18,380
Whichever is more nourishing to the spirit and the body.

1076
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,180
Friends, you've been listening to the Hour of Slack.

1077
01:00:20,260 --> 01:00:25,640
If you want to know more about the Church of the Subgenius, Ex Day, or Dr. Howell, or myself.

1078
01:00:26,820 --> 01:00:29,400
Or more importantly, JR Bob Brown.

1079
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:29,740
Or Dr. Dobs.

1080
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,380
You can look at subgenius.com.

1081
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:34,600
Ah-hoo-ga!

1082
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:37,920
Praise Bob!

1083
01:00:38,380 --> 01:00:39,540
Over and out.

1084
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:06,120
