1
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,920
The following broadcast is a subgenius production.

2
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:27,800
Gaiety galore, and lots of fun even.

3
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,620
I want to be sure that you find out about Bob.

4
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:33,640
Now, Bob, tell us the truth.

5
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,620
Have I mentioned I'm immense and immortal?

6
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:40,820
Station Bremen and station DXB on the 31 meter band.

7
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,660
You are about to hear our news in English.

8
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:46,740
Now, Bob, tell us the truth.

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,540
All right, you primitive screwheads, listen up.

10
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:50,520
You're a loony.

11
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,100
You're not going crazy.

12
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,540
You're going sane in a crazy world.

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:56,440
Now, Bob, tell us the truth.

14
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,020
This man is no ordinary man.

15
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:01,200
Now, Bob, tell us the truth.

16
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:03,200
There can be only one.

17
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,160
Oh, spooky.

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,760
Yeah, whatever.

19
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:11,940
And now, here with an unlimited supply of misinformation is Bob.

20
00:01:12,140 --> 00:01:13,280
Okay, man, start it up.

21
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,280
The Hour of Slack.

22
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,360
The Hour of Slack.

23
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:53,360
You haven't heard it?

24
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,360
You mean to tell me that you haven't heard it?

25
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:55,880
No.

26
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,420
No, I haven't.

27
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,100
I haven't heard it.

28
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,080
Here, play it.

29
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,940
It's really terrific when you hear it.

30
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,020
Excuse me, ladies.

31
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,360
I have a special request.

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,320
Perversion for profit.

33
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:18,960
Perversion for profit.

34
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:26,300
A blood tide of filth is engulfing our...

35
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:26,400
A blood tide of filth is engulfing our...

36
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,760
a country in the form of newsstand obscenities

37
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:34,000
and is threatening to perverse an entire generation of our American children.

38
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:34,280


39
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,940
A blood tide of filth is engulfing our...

40
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:38,940


41
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:38,940


42
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,460
Do you want your son enticed into the world of homosexuals?

43
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:45,920
Or your daughter lured into lesbianism?

44
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:51,000
Do you want either of them to discover how to get sexual gratification

45
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,060
by inflicting pain on themselves or by torturing other people?

46
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,560
Perversion for profit

47
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,640
Do you want your children stimulated?

48
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:15,320
What is fetishism?

49
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:21,380
The costuming and the significance of the extreme spiked heel and the tight boot

50
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:23,680
The burning cigarettes

51
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:26,500
The lace leather garments

52
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,180
The nakedness

53
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,800
Perversion for profit

54
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,120
Strange flagellation colors

55
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,100
Sexual sadism

56
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:50,580
Abnormal sex practices of every kind are described with intimate physical detail

57
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:52,860
Sexism

58
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,540
The burning cigarettes

59
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,900
The worship of the whip

60
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:58,980
The riding trough

61
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:01,660
Rubber and leather garments

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,320
Perversion for profit

63
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:15,160
The Shepherds in the same country

64
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,800
There were shepherds in the same country, wrapped in strips of cloth, and keeping watch by night over their feeding trough.

65
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,660
Behold, two young pigeons stood by them, and they were in the same place.

66
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:23,660


67
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:26,020
The pigeons said to them,

68
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:28,240
When is a Dobshead not a Dobshead?

69
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,960
Not a Dobshead

70
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,660
Not a Dobshead

71
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,500
Not a Dobshead

72
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:40,980
Friends, and when it's B Dobs hide

73
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:51,440
Thanks to Lee Murr and before that, Perversion for Profit from the Bran Flakes new album Bounce

74
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:58,800
And you can find out more about that from www.thebranflakes.com

75
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:09,800
Opening collages there were by Mark Mothersbaugh, The Bishop, who you can find at the Yahoo Club called Yeti Video

76
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:19,480
And the El Queso All Stars from stationmp3.com slash interbulator

77
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,420
More from the El Queso All Stars from stationmp3.com slash interbulator

78
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:32,640
More than anything,

79
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,380
I would say thank you,

80
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:36,460


81
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:45,540
I did grab some

82
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,420
I even had some

83
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,100
similarity on the luck plane

84
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,920
to slack.

85
00:05:55,220 --> 00:05:57,420
Yes, love and slack

86
00:05:57,420 --> 00:05:59,820
often go hand in hand.

87
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:01,700
Since time

88
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,080
immemorial,

89
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,580
love has been one of the

90
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,800
golden carrots

91
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,240
of the subgenius.

92
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,160
For instance,

93
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,660
what do you think is playing

94
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,000
at the Roxy?

95
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,980
What's playing

96
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,860
at the Roxy? I'll tell you what's

97
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,840
playing at the Roxy. A picture about

98
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,000
a Minnesota man so in love with a Mississippi

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,580
girl that he sacrifices

100
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,580
everything and moves all the way to

101
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:29,900
Biloxi. That's what's

102
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,860
playing at the Roxy.

103
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,160
What's in the daily news?

104
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:35,460
I'll tell you what's in the daily news.

105
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,900
Story about a guy who bought his wife

106
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,860
a small ruby with what otherwise

107
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,360
would have been his union dues.

108
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:43,740
That's what's in the daily

109
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,780
news. What's happening

110
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,700
all over? I'll tell you what's

111
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:49,440
happening all over. Guy sitting

112
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,620
at home by a television set who used to be

113
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,600
something of a rover.

114
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:55,820
That's what's happening all over.

115
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,180
Love

116
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,640
is a thing that has licked him

117
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:01,480
and it looks like

118
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,320
Nathan's just another victim.

119
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,340
Yes, sir, when you see

120
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,680
a guy reach for stars

121
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,460
in the sky, you can

122
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,600
bet that he's doing it for

123
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,360
some doll.

124
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,620
When you spot a John

125
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,480
waiting out in the rain,

126
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,540
chances are he's insane

127
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:21,640
as only a John can be for a

128
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,700
Jane. When you meet

129
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,260
a gent paying

130
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:27,600
all kinds of rent for

131
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,460
a flat that could flatten

132
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:30,700
a Taj Mahal.

133
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,660
Call it sad, call it

134
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,420
funny, but it's better than

135
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,840
even money that the guy's

136
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:39,460
only doing it for some

137
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:41,420
doll. When

138
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,960
you see a Joe

139
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,280
saving half of his dough,

140
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,460
you can bet there'll be

141
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,320
making it for some doll.

142
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,260
When a bum

143
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,480
buys wine like a bum

144
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,440
can't afford, it's

145
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,680
a cinch that the bum is under the thumb

146
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:58,760
of some little broad.

147
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,500
When you meet a mug

148
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,740
lately out of the jug

149
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,220
and he's still

150
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:07,220
lifting platinum faulty

151
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,540
roll. Call it

152
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,000
hell, call it heaven,

153
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,360
it's a probable twelve to seven

154
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,120
that the guy's only

155
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,800
doing it for some doll.

156
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,040
When you see

157
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:21,460
a sport and his cash

158
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:23,320
has run short, you can

159
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,300
bet that he's banking it

160
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,320
with some doll.

161
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,900
When a guy wears

162
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,260
tails with the front gleaming white,

163
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,520
who the hell do you think

164
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:35,380
he's tickling pink on Saturday

165
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:37,260
night? When a

166
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,260
lazy slob takes

167
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,760
a good steady job

168
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:43,640
and he smells from Vitalis

169
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,700
and Barbasol.

170
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:46,940
Call it dumb,

171
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,120
call it clever,

172
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,260
but you can get odds forever

173
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,740
that the guy's only doing

174
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,800
it for some doll, some doll,

175
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,900
some doll. The guy's only

176
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
doing it for some doll.

177
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,540
Stubby K, dear friends,

178
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,800
guys and dolls from the

179
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,760
1951 musical

180
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,580
of the same name.

181
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,940
Ah, love, love,

182
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,720
love, part of love,

183
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:19,020
is, of course,

184
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:19,960
sex.

185
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:22,640
And the Bonobo

186
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,000
Yeti buried within each subgenius

187
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,040
must come sproinging

188
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,460
out as displayed

189
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:31,000
by Lemur as he

190
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,760
manipulates the God

191
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:35,320
Shatner into sexing

192
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:36,420
his crew.

193
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,580
Human flesh against human

194
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,800
flesh and blood. No, not

195
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,260
on me. On you, Lieutenant.

196
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,540
That's where our duty lies.

197
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,920
How can I?

198
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,360
Man or woman, it makes no difference.

199
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,260
You know so much of love.

200
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:55,060
And the only thing that's truly yours

201
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,880
is the wonderful bathing suit.

202
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,960
Enterprise to Kirk, Captain.

203
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,440
Enterprise, enter.

204
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,320
Come in, Kirk, Captain.

205
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,400
Kirk, Captain.

206
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:07,940
Not all of us are satisfied

207
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,340
with having them feel too hard.

208
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,380
Captain, we've got to do something.

209
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,700
We were doing something.

210
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,140
Got any more good ideas, Jim?

211
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,900
How can I?

212
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:19,120
Increase my breast size and not gain weight anywhere else.

213
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,740
We can fire our phaser banks.

214
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:21,900
That's how you do it, Lieutenant.

215
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:22,900
What's happened to her?

216
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,880
We better get used to goats.

217
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:26,740
Smaller busts.

218
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,660
You think that mysterious organ could have something to do with the transmission of energy?

219
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,300
What's happened to her?

220
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:35,440
Well?

221
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,420
He wants us to just love it when a man comes up and flirts with you.

222
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,700
He'll give us increasing bust sizes, too.

223
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,180
Then I'd better handle it.

224
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:46,920
Perhaps if I assisted.

225
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:47,760
Captain.

226
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,500
Yes?

227
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:51,440
I would recommend a discreet distance.

228
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:52,440
What?

229
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,300
You all right?

230
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,580
Oh, yes, I'm all right.

231
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,120
I have an all-natural hormone stimulant for you.

232
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,160
And you will supply the clothes.

233
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,000
Captain. Captain. Captain.

234
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:09,940
Yes, I know. I know, Scotty. I know. I know.

235
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,840
Nothing abnormal at all.

236
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,400
I don't believe it.

237
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,700
We're living together.

238
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:18,320
We're rabbits and raccoons.

239
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,660
Birds of a feather.

240
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,640
Existent beasts.

241
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,320
Prolocating freaks.

242
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,820
Sailing with their hooves and their horns on their beaks.

243
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:26,200
When it's morally wrong.

244
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,500
It's morally wrong.

245
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,840
It's deplorably wrong.

246
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,080
Abnormally wrong.

247
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,540
It's morally wrong.

248
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,740
It's morally wrong.

249
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,480
Philosophically at the clip.

250
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,420
Morally wrong.

251
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,200
Or betting on a horse that you knew was going to win.

252
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:40,820
Eating chocolate cake when you're trying to stay thin.

253
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,600
Shooting a bird at the Hollywood pole.

254
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,880
And smoking that logo.

255
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,420
Go wacko, dope the wind

256
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,760
It's morally wrong, it's morally wrong

257
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:51,460
It's traditionally wrong, unconditionally wrong

258
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:54,080
It's morally wrong, it's morally wrong

259
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,800
It's philosophically, ethically, morally wrong

260
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,720
Go, go, go!

261
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,960
Woo!

262
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,260
Woo!

263
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,480
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

264
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:18,840
Woo!

265
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:25,840
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah!

266
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:26,960
Ah, shoo!

267
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:28,760
Excuse me.

268
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,660
I was making more than ten items through the express line

269
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:35,320
Returned my tape, but you didn't rewind

270
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,000
I was stealing parking spaces from the handicapped

271
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,640
Making nice warm mittens from your neighbor's couch

272
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:43,300
Well, it's morally wrong, it's morally wrong

273
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,640
It's abnormally wrong

274
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,960
Paranormally wrong

275
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,660
It's morally wrong, it's morally wrong

276
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,340
It's philosophically, ethically, morally wrong

277
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:54,120
Oh, we're playing the guitar in a rock and roll band

278
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,920
Greeting a friend with an outstretched left hand

279
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,320
It's things we think are done, they're intrinsically wrong

280
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:02,140
Like a murder to see who's by the right to soar

281
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,680
Cause it's morally wrong, it's morally wrong

282
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,360
It's categorically wrong, metaphorically wrong

283
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,980
It's morally wrong, it's morally wrong

284
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,600
It's philosophically, ethically, morally wrong

285
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah, it's morally wrong

286
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:16,700
It's morally wrong, it's traditionally wrong

287
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,000
Unconditionally wrong

288
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,700
It's morally wrong, it's morally wrong

289
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:23,520
It's philosophically, ethically, morally wrong

290
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,580
Yeah

291
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,060
Consortium of Genius, dear friends

292
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:36,500
Available from consortiumofgenius.com

293
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,600
And now, a message from Amy Leamer

294
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,860
Hello everybody

295
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:52,300
My name is Amy, and I have an important message for you

296
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,600
Okay

297
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:54,800
Okay

298
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,220
Okay

299
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,480
Okay

300
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:02,620
Okay

301
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,380
Okay

302
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,520
Okay

303
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:04,680
Okay

304
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,660
Okay

305
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:05,960
Okay

306
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:05,960


307
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,360
Okay

308
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:06,380
Okay

309
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:06,540
Okay

310
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,520
Okay

311
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:09,360
Okay

312
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:09,360


313
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,620
Okay

314
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:14,620


315
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:14,620


316
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:14,620


317
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:14,620


318
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:14,620


319
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:41,460
This has been another fine message from the Anti-Sex League

320
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:44,120
Tell your aegis' mother

321
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,120


322
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:44,160
I'm sitting on her lap

323
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:44,220
Turnin' theㅣ

324
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,220


325
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,220


326
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,220


327
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,620
I'm erfolg

328
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:46,780
And, oh yeah, my name is Amy.

329
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,220
To...

330
00:16:18,420 --> 00:16:19,780
Mark Mothersbaugh.

331
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:22,600
And now, The Rainmakers.

332
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,760
Who am I? I don't know. I have no idea.

333
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,300
When my friends look at me, I wonder who they think they're seeing.

334
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,580
Search me, layer by layer.

335
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:39,420
But inside I'm afraid you'll find thin air.

336
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,780
Yes, yes, again.

337
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:47,620
Again, we might be underneath this skin.

338
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,240
What makes me tick? How should I know?

339
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,940
I've been trained like a monkey.

340
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,660
The bell rings and I start to jones like a junkie.

341
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,500
What turns me on? I wish I knew.

342
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,200
Wish I could tell the real thing.

343
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:08,420
My honest desire from my conditioning.

344
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,380
Touch me now, now touch me again.

345
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:17,020
I wanna feel something real coming through this skin.

346
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:27,360
I've been boxing with my shadow, ended and tagged.

347
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:30,500
I can't punch my way out of a paper bag.

348
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:34,580
It's as thick as you think, thin as the reasoning you bought.

349
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:38,360
I'm a mummy wrapped in a gauze of my own thoughts.

350
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:42,000
And I wanna know who I'd be if I never had been.

351
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,440
In the static, the snow and the radio wave.

352
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:53,240
The flickering image, the pandering thought that's been passed off and on to be the blueprint of God.

353
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,540
Hey, yes, yes, again.

354
00:17:57,500 --> 00:18:01,280
We might be if we could shed this skin.

355
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:01,840


356
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:03,440
Yeah.

357
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:04,780


358
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,100
Yeah.

359
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:06,540


360
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,060
Yeah.

361
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,280
Yeah.

362
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,580
Yeah.

363
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:09,980
Yeah.

364
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:10,260
Yeah.

365
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:10,260


366
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,800
Yeah.

367
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:11,840
Yeah.

368
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:11,840


369
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:11,840


370
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:11,840


371
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:11,880
Yeah.

372
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:11,900
Yeah.

373
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:11,900


374
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:11,900


375
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:11,900


376
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:11,900


377
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:11,900


378
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:11,900


379
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:11,900


380
00:18:11,900 --> 00:18:11,900


381
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,220
Your skin is exposed every day.

382
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,200
Nice to have a pair of them, isn't it?

383
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,680
Yes, it is nice, isn't it?

384
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:18,960
Why don't you take them out?

385
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,100
All right.

386
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:21,360
Close the door.

387
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:22,420
Sure.

388
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,400
There.

389
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,900
I really am all right.

390
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,720
You're Milra D'Almore, woman.

391
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,940
You gotta understand that I really am all right.

392
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:40,180
You can understand how a girl, even if she is nice, can get into a lot of trouble.

393
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:41,680
Ha, ha, ha.

394
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,380
I am nice, aren't I?

395
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,020
Sure.

396
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,780
I'd like to play dolls with you.

397
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:52,920
Hello, honey.

398
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:53,920
Get up.

399
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:56,860
Aren't you going to speak to me, honey?

400
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:57,800
Get up.

401
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,380
Oh, don't look so surprised.

402
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,180
That wasn't you, the felon.

403
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,120
He doesn't like you anymore, Mildred.

404
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,060
We don't like tin horns around here.

405
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:07,720
Oh, yes, he does, don't you, honey?

406
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:08,940
Get up.

407
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:11,720
You're going to kill you, Mildred.

408
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:13,520
Please, please.

409
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,860
Please get me out of here.

410
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:15,440
Take me with you.

411
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,600
We don't like tin horns.

412
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,040
Who?

413
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:19,300
Every time you look at a man, he falls over, doesn't he?

414
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:19,900
Get up.

415
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,100
I got into trouble, but I really am a nice girl.

416
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,600
You can understand how a girl, even if she is nice, can get into a lot of trouble.

417
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:28,580
Sure.

418
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,860
I'd like to play with you.

419
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:36,460
Carlos, you losers can help yourself to what's on the table.

420
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,820
Cut it out, will you?

421
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,540
He'll get me.

422
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:47,940
Shut up.

423
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,640
Get up.

424
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:54,920
Get up.

425
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,540
Those things happen sometimes.

426
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,540
So please, don't let Bob keep you from having nothing.

427
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,460
But it's wonderful.

428
00:20:06,820 --> 00:20:07,240
Shut up.

429
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,780
He'll get me.

430
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:10,720
He'll get me.

431
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:12,020
Shut up.

432
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,900
Bob is what you have been waiting for.

433
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,700
He'll get me.

434
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:15,020
Shut up.

435
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,680
Bob is what you have been waiting for.

436
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,360
He'll get me.

437
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:18,880
Shut up.

438
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,560
The Giant Beaver was no different.

439
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:27,500
Are you like the Giant Beaver, my friend?

440
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,560
Well, Fernanda Nandeli-Murr cut that up.

441
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:37,280
But now, St. Alio, or Stalio, has a message just for you.

442
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:38,920
The Littler.

443
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:39,400
The Littler.

444
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,860
The Littler.

445
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:50,520
The Littler.

446
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,160
The Littler.

447
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:53,760
The Littler.

448
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,000
The Littler.

449
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:58,880
The Littler.

450
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,300
The Littler.

451
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,700
The Littler.

452
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:26,660
now don't be like that it's a gift take your clothes off

453
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,720
With my clothes on

454
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:05,060
Take off your clothes

455
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:10,420
Take off your clothes

456
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:15,580
Take off your clothes

457
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:22,980
And now she takes her clothes off

458
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,580
Why don't you want to take your clothes off?

459
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,980
I'm too sexy for my shirt

460
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:35,860
I'm too sexy to take her clothes off

461
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,440
Your clothes, give them to me

462
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:55,020
We don't have to take our clothes off

463
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,080
I look to the sim

464
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,640
I look to the sim

465
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,680
Put your panties back on

466
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,700
I look to the sim

467
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,360
Put your panties back on

468
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,320
I look to the sim

469
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,960
Put your panties back on

470
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,460
You two can't even take a shower

471
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,600
with a beautiful woman

472
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,800
without wearing your jeans.

473
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,300
He refused to take his clothes off.

474
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:17,440
Let's go to Bob right now.

475
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:17,880
Hi, Bob.

476
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:18,440
Hi.

477
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:23,640
Well, I have a past of homosexuality.

478
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:26,620
However, I don't deal in that area.

479
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:26,880
I don't have any more.

480
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,620
And I have anxiety.

481
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:32,060
And I suffer from depression.

482
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:37,440
However, I love Bob and I live for him.

483
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:38,220
Amen.

484
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:40,980
I wish I was attracted to ladies, Bob,

485
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,860
but the most I can do is be a friend to them.

486
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:47,220
Well, you know, it's never too late, Bob.

487
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,560
That's what I say.

488
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,980
It's never too late.

489
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,180
Never too late.

490
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,900
I tell you what.

491
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,520
You know, we pick up the newspapers all the time.

492
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,500
You had to read about these guys getting married in the 80s and 90s,

493
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,700
so it's never too late.

494
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:03,120
You know, Bob, I want to testify so bad.

495
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,820
I believe in this stuff.

496
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:08,300
It's not exactly easy to listen to with all the screaming,

497
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,800
but it's no condemnation towards that because it's necessary.

498
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:16,820
It made me feel uneasy in my body.

499
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,060
Do you know what I mean?

500
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:19,900
Oh, yeah.

501
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,340
Well, I mean, you're watching a supernatural battle,

502
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,260
devils and angels going at it.

503
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,000
I mean, it's intense.

504
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:26,440
I know.

505
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,000
I know.

506
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:27,740
It's intense.

507
00:24:27,860 --> 00:24:31,240
But isn't it wonderful when these folks get free and they're jumping up and down?

508
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:31,660
Oh, yeah.

509
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,460
Oh, yeah.

510
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,620
They've got a big smile on their face.

511
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:34,580
Benny and Bob.

512
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,460
You can watch this boat.

513
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,500
1 o'clock Central, 2 o'clock Eastern.

514
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,540
Bob, appreciate you.

515
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,360
Bob, bless you.

516
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,400
Thank you so very much.

517
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,040
Thank you.

518
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:16,860
1 o'clock Central, 2 o'clock Eastern.

519
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:17,380
Bob Astley.

520
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:18,660


521
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:18,900
Good to see you.

522
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:19,800
Totally new axis.

523
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:20,800


524
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,320


525
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,320


526
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,320


527
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,320


528
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,320


529
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,320


530
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,320


531
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:21,400
Thank you all.

532
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:21,740
Again, thank you all for watching the second half of the episode.

533
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:21,800
Put in the subscribe button for like and we'll see in the next one and at the end of the episode we'll have a change on our name remember the business ethics and size.

534
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:26,480
We all know you already have one part and I didn't get a single shot at any point.

535
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,540
Ah, I told you it's my mustache.

536
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:36,120
He's been poor with me.

537
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,420
He plays a game with me.

538
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,540
It's called...

539
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,700
I love you.

540
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:10,000
I love you.

541
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,180
I love you.

542
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,960
I love you.

543
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,740
My mustache just giggles.

544
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,300
He knows he's the only hair for me.

545
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:52,800
Ah.

546
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,360
Sometimes.

547
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:12,900
I stare into the mirror on my headboard.

548
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,120
And I just melt away.

549
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:27,160
And when I lick my lips,

550
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,500
it's like a hug

551
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:33,600
from an old friend.

552
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,000
Mustache.

553
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:38,580
Ah.

554
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,060
Mustache in Love

555
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:49,840
from the El Queso All-Stars,

556
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:54,640
also known as Interbulator 009.

557
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,180
And you can get more about them

558
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:59,440
and actually download a lot of their music,

559
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,380
a lot of it,

560
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:06,700
from www.stationmp3.com.

561
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:22,600
And now, a rare recording

562
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,900
procured by Mr. Sister,

563
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,260
stolen friends from Skywalker Sound.

564
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,680
Now, this is a private recording

565
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,260
of, uh, well, sex

566
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,840
between a couple of, uh, stars

567
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,160
of the Star Wars movie.

568
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:38,420
And, uh, you can watch the movie

569
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,640
in the studio.

570
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:38,640


571
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:38,640


572
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:38,640


573
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:38,640


574
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:38,640


575
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,580
whose voices you will recognize

576
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,800
in this steamy, yet romantic,

577
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,420
sex tape.

578
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:44,760


579
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,500
Thank you.

580
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:26,920
Thank you.

581
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,760
Thank you, Lemur.

582
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,500
And now, Consortium of Genius.

583
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:16,700
All you want to do is screw.

584
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:23,420
Let's get down to it, cause I really want to do it.

585
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:26,360
I really want to nail it through.

586
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,800
All I am saying in these words that I'm conveying

587
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:36,100
is all I want to do is you.

588
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,940
All I want to do.

589
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,400
All I want to do.

590
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,640
All I want to do.

591
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,600
Is you.

592
00:30:47,480 --> 00:30:49,500
All I want to do.

593
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,860
All I want to do.

594
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,200
All I want to do is you.

595
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,420
I swear to breathe it.

596
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,740
Say the word and I'll believe it.

597
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:04,860
There's nothing you would rather do.

598
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,260
That special feeling, baby, on your knees you're kneeling.

599
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,340
And only I can give it to you.

600
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,060
And only I can give it to you.

601
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,280
Our bodies pressing.

602
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,820
Pretty soon you'll be undressing.

603
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:24,020
Like an animal right out of the zoo.

604
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:30,220
Mystic connection like a man in an election.

605
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,560
And all I want to do is you.

606
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,640
All I want to do.

607
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,000
All I want to do.

608
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:43,180
All I want to do is you.

609
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:49,420
All I wanna do, all I wanna do

610
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:52,920
All I wanna do is you

611
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,100
Hit it now

612
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:03,280
Alright

613
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,800
I heard it in my heart

614
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:16,000
And I felt it in my soul

615
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
I prayed to the goddess of rock and roll

616
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,500
You're the only one with whom I wanna lose control

617
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,660
It's true

618
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,960
When I'm doing you

619
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,600
And in the morning

620
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:39,100
When you're full you'll be adorning

621
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:42,100
With finest silken robes of blue

622
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:42,780
Ooh

623
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:43,780
Ooh

624
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:43,780


625
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,900
It's your conclusion

626
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,440
It was only an illusion

627
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,120
A memory you'll never remove

628
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:55,900
My letter clutching

629
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,120
It's yourself you will be touching

630
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:01,480
It's the only thing remaining to do

631
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:05,580
Just like I told you

632
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:08,000
There'll be someone else to hold you

633
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,120
When another band rocks into your view

634
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:13,780
And hold you

635
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,000
And you'll be the one to hold me

636
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:17,340
All I wanna do, all I wanna do

637
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,640
All I wanna do is you

638
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,900
All I wanna do, all I wanna do

639
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:34,460
All I wanna do is you

640
00:33:34,460 --> 00:33:36,920
Is you

641
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:53,600
Is you

642
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,700
Is you

643
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:57,720
Is you

644
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:13,640
Is you

645
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:13,680
Is you

646
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:13,720
Is you

647
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:13,760
Is you

648
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,520
to the Bushies.

649
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,240
A lot of that happens out there,

650
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:19,020
only sometimes it's the women folks

651
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:19,940
doing the dragging.

652
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:20,900
Yeah, that's the truth.

653
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,660
They got the great big clubs,

654
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,280
whack the guys over the head,

655
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,020
drag them off by their long ponytails.

656
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:28,500
Yeah, because the guys,

657
00:34:28,520 --> 00:34:30,280
they're just walking down that dirt road

658
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,120
with their drums slung over their shoulder.

659
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,300
They're not paying attention

660
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,900
because the drumbeat's drawing them.

661
00:34:37,220 --> 00:34:39,260
She might be hiding right by that bush,

662
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,980
that wood pile.

663
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,540
Right by Stranger's Camp.

664
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:51,320
And that weird lair of whatever it is.

665
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,720
You don't come to think of it,

666
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,840
Brushwood is the only place

667
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,180
that that ever happened to me.

668
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:00,660
Where they come out and hit you over the head

669
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:05,400
just when you're most susceptible, actually.

670
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:05,880
Yeah.

671
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,280
The next thing you know, you're pregnant

672
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:13,740
with some fierce pagan caveman

673
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,460
and a woman's baby.

674
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:20,500
Some hairy-legged, hippie cavewoman.

675
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:22,800
Scary.

676
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:25,620
But you can't turn it down.

677
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,520
Well, a hard-headed woman,

678
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:29,800
a soft-hearted man,

679
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,080
been in the cause of trouble

680
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,180
ever since the world began.

681
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:32,700
Oh, yeah.

682
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:33,520
Oh, yeah.

683
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,080
Ever since the world began.

684
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:38,460
A hard-headed woman

685
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:40,180
barely started to slide on that.

686
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,420
Adam told Eve,

687
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:43,660
listen,

688
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:44,500
listen, yeah, to me.

689
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,320
Don't you let me catch you messing

690
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,100
around in Apple Street.

691
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:47,600
Oh, yeah.

692
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:48,440
Oh, yeah.

693
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,980
Ever since the world began.

694
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,340
A hard-headed woman

695
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:55,020
barely started to slide on that.

696
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,260
Oh, yeah.

697
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:02,780
Oh, yeah.

698
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:04,500
Ever since the world began.

699
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:07,760
A hard-headed woman

700
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,520
barely started to slide on that.

701
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:12,760
Sounds totally loud.

702
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:13,400
Loud.

703
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:13,660
Loud.

704
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:13,940
Clear.

705
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,680
Keep your cotton-picking fingers

706
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,480
out my curly hair.

707
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:16,900
Oh, yeah.

708
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:17,760
Oh, yeah.

709
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:18,520
Oh, yeah.

710
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:19,360
Ever since the world began.

711
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,700
A hard-headed woman

712
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,340
barely started to slide on that.

713
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:27,540
I heard about a king

714
00:36:27,540 --> 00:36:28,780
who was doing swell.

715
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,100
He really started playing

716
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,140
with that evil Jezebel.

717
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:31,680
Oh, yeah.

718
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,440
Oh, yeah.

719
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,040
Ever since the world began.

720
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:37,380
A hard-headed woman

721
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:39,080
barely started to slide on that.

722
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,280
Hey, you!

723
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:46,700
Hey, you!

724
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,680
Hey, you!

725
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:53,700
Please stop yourself tremor.

726
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:53,700


727
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,160
I don't mean the politics.

728
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,460
I just too have to be おいきゆり

729
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,120

00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,860
to do what I say!

732
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,320
You know why you are?

733
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,120
All the time I am out there.

734
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,260
Tie a tippos bezí aletAm

735
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,320

736
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,080
I know ells

737
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:32,340
Do you like to see dried coffee and things like that around people's necks?

738
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,940
Sure, I like to see that.

739
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,360
Are you making an offer, Dave?

740
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,740
Well, I'm making an offer.

741
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,860
Are you asking him out?

742
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:45,300
I'm asking him up, if you know what I mean.

743
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:46,840
Yeah, man.

744
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,200
Sure.

745
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:47,900
Yeah, yeah.

746
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:50,220
Let's have a serious adult discussion.

747
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,240
Okay, let's rap, man.

748
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,480
Remember in the 70s, you used to say, let's rap and stuff like that?

749
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:57,200
I didn't actually say that.

750
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:58,260
Did you just ever?

751
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,940
I didn't say that until it was sort of camp to say that in the 90s.

752
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,120
Then I oversaid it.

753
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:06,180
Did you ever get one of those rubber mallets and just bang on your wagon until you cried

754
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:08,260
and then maybe take pictures of it and stuff?

755
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,580
Were you ever in a rap?

756
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,820
There should be experiments with hitting themselves like that.

757
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,280
On the cutting edge, the Schwartz Cobra crew.

758
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:15,400
Rubber hammer.

759
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:16,640
It was a rubber hammer.

760
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,480
Oh, of course.

761
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,140
Safe hammer.

762
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:21,640
Because the chisel will slide out of your hand if it's not a rubber hammer.

763
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,180
I wouldn't do that without a rubber.

764
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:23,780
No.

765
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,040
Small talk.

766
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:28,700
Everybody does it.

767
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,120
Small talk.

768
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,740
Nobody gets a kick.

769
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,280
Small talk.

770
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,000
Nature's all straight.

771
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,480
Small talk.

772
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,700
Small talk.

773
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:39,720
Small talk.

774
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:39,720


775
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:39,720


776
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:39,720


777
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:39,720


778
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,660
It's out of range.

779
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,620
It's out of range.

780
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:46,780
It's fucking too heavy on the scale.

781
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:49,060
Eat up all your hate.

782
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,840
Take it slow.

783
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:52,940
Heaven can't blow.

784
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,940
See you around.

785
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,460
If you're not under the ground.

786
00:38:58,020 --> 00:38:59,300
Small talk.

787
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:02,000
Puts me in a trap.

788
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,340
Small talk.

789
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,100
It's nothing but verbal crap.

790
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,420
Small talk.

791
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,160
Must we?

792
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,400
We're open for him.

793
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,580
Small talk.

794
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,260
Is that why we were born?

795
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,660
It's so cold.

796
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,840
You're already old.

797
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,020
It's so hot.

798
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:22,040
What you haven't got?

799
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,200
I should have stayed in bed.

800
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:26,240
You're feeling all dead.

801
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:28,480
I can't wait to go home.

802
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:30,340
Yes, please leave me alone.

803
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,420
Small talk.

804
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,120
We never ask why.

805
00:39:35,260 --> 00:39:36,440
Small talk.

806
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:39,080
Till the very day we die.

807
00:39:39,080 --> 00:39:40,580
Small talk.

808
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,020
Curves up the quiet.

809
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,160
Shadow just one side.

810
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,180
Dare you to try it.

811
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:12,680
I'm feeling like I'm dying.

812
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:38,860
I'm feeling like I'm dying.

813
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,300
I'm feeling like I'm dying.

814
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:46,540
The sun's at sea low.

815
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,160
I'm feeling like I'm dying.

816
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,400
One more move here.

817
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,700
I've got to hold on.

818
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:57,140
Now, it's too late for you.

819
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,320
It's too far away for you.

820
00:41:02,080 --> 00:41:05,360
It's too far away too late for you.

821
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:09,060
Heaven, I feel like I'm dying.

822
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:09,800
I'm dying.

823
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:17,520
Whipping post, friends.

824
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:23,200
That's ESO Einstein's Secret Outlaws at 5X Day.

825
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:31,700
And before that, small talk by Little Theodore from beneath the Uber putts.

826
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:38,820
And you can get more from email, littletheodore at yahoo.com.

827
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:43,960
Theodore is spelled F as in Frank, Y-O-D-O-R.

828
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:56,460
Or 3277 Raleigh Street, Denver, Colorado, 802121707.

829
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:01,080
And before that, ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland.

830
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:05,060
And the king singing Bible stories.

831
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,740
Now, stay tuned for a real treat.

832
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:15,560
Dr. Philo Drummond, the overman, unearthed an excellent recording of the Swinging Love Corpses.

833
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:22,240
His band live at Off-Broadway in St. Louis in May of 1991.

834
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:26,760
What follows then in keeping with this theme of love.

835
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:31,020
The treasured hit oldie by the Swinging Love Corpses.

836
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:33,420
Pick a booger.

837
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:45,820
Pick a booger.

838
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,960
Pick a booger.

839
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,200
Pick a booger.

840
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,000
Pick a booger.

841
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,020
Pick a booger.

842
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,020


843
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,020


844
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,020


845
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,020


846
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,020


847
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,020


848
00:43:01,020 --> 00:43:01,020


849
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:04,320
I don't know how you feel one way or the other

850
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:06,980
It would make you happy to wipe it on your brother

851
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:09,560
I'm in a new bar and I'm looking at your neighbor

852
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:12,280
Find a nugget of his house, he's like a saver in the favor

853
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:14,800
He's pulling, he's tugging, he's aching on this thing

854
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,460
It's a long, strabist thing still connected to the brain

855
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,880
Pick a booger, pick a booger

856
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:28,140
Pick a booger, pick a booger

857
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,640
Everybody's doing it, picking it and chewing it

858
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:37,500
Yeah!

859
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,820
He's got his feet, he's rolling, he's checking in for hair

860
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:54,640
He's quick to get away, still loving it, never giving up

861
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:57,200
He's got some people on his finger, he's connected every day

862
00:43:57,200 --> 00:43:59,760
Pick a booger, booger, it's a new day today

863
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,960
I'm an alcoholic

864
00:44:01,080 --> 00:44:03,800
He's a movie of the deep inside, a sign that sees a slave to the mass

865
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:05,320
But he's rolling on signers

866
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:07,880
Kids all wanna have days of infestations

867
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,320
Cause a pick a booger boogie is the new sensation

868
00:44:13,620 --> 00:44:15,960
Pick a booger, pick a booger

869
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:21,400
Pick a booger, pick a booger

870
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:29,660
Pick a booger, pick a booger

871
00:44:31,080 --> 00:44:34,580
Pick a booger, pick a booger

872
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:30,660
Pick a booger, pick a booger

873
00:45:44,000 --> 00:46:00,700
Pick a booger, pick a booger

874
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:31,060
Pick a booger, pick a booger

875
00:46:44,560 --> 00:47:00,860
Pick a booger, pick a booger

876
00:47:10,300 --> 00:47:21,440
Pick a booger, pick a booger

877
00:47:38,800 --> 00:48:00,660
Pick a booger, pick a booger

878
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:02,380
Pick a booger, pick a booger

879
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:08,140
Pick a booger, pick a booger

880
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:08,520
Yeah!

881
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,400
Yeah!

882
00:48:24,780 --> 00:48:25,020
Yeah!

883
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:25,940
Yeah!

884
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:26,380
Yeah!

885
00:48:26,540 --> 00:48:26,660
Yeah!

886
00:48:26,660 --> 00:48:26,980
Yeah!

887
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:27,420
Yeah!

888
00:48:27,420 --> 00:48:27,940
Yeah!

889
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,380
Yeah!

890
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:29,240


891
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:31,020
Yeah!

892
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,000
You come on in the box, still a fever in your nose

893
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,600
You think a booger has a wife, you're not at all

894
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:40,380
You don't know how you feel one way or another

895
00:48:40,380 --> 00:48:42,160
You need to make sure you're happy in life

896
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,300
You're not a drugger driving in the car

897
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:45,740
And you're looking at the lights

898
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:48,380
I'm working from the start so I can save her in the day

899
00:48:48,380 --> 00:48:51,080
He's pulling, he's tugging, he's aching in the sink

900
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:53,800
It's a long time of screams, look at me, I can feel the brain

901
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:59,280
Pick a booger, pick a booger

902
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:04,620
Pick a booger, pick a booger

903
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:10,340
Everybody do it again, pick it again, show it again

904
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:15,300
Pick it, pick it, pick it

905
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:27,620
If you relax the rubber band quickly while it's between your lips, it's distinctly cool.

906
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,180
I was pretty

907
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:32,680
last night when an angel broke the light

908
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:37,340
He said, I'm gonna have to put you on hold for a time

909
00:49:37,340 --> 00:49:41,940
I said, hold like hell, let me talk to the boss

910
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:46,600
He said, sorry, sinner, it's the boss's day off

911
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:51,140
And I realized then that the wages of sin

912
00:49:51,140 --> 00:49:55,340
Was two bucks an hour and a working weekend

913
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:58,060
I was ignoring the fee

914
00:49:58,060 --> 00:49:58,920
He was

915
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,260
He was

916
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:13,660
He was

917
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:33,980
He was

918
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:15,120
He was

919
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,040
He was

920
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:16,500
He was

921
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:16,560
He was

922
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:16,560


923
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:16,560


924
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:16,560


925
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:16,560


926
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:16,560


927
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:16,560


928
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:16,560


929
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:16,560


930
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:16,560


931
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:16,560


932
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:16,560


933
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:23,220
And I thought that it was going to be fine

934
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,540
I said, well, you know, there's nothing to take from a shingle

935
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:24,540


936
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:24,540


937
00:51:24,540 --> 00:51:25,760
But I don't think it's the same

938
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:25,760


939
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,060
Yeah

940
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:27,120
Yeah

941
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:29,240
It's not like

942
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:31,000
I'm Mary Magdalene.

943
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:32,660
How about a date?

944
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,200
You've been wasting your time staying up so late.

945
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:39,160
Your boyfriend's dead.

946
00:51:40,280 --> 00:51:42,020
The word is you're a whore.

947
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,580
Just about then I heard a knock on the door.

948
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:53,280
And I realized then that the wages of sin was a bad reputation.

949
00:51:53,300 --> 00:51:58,060
And too many friends, the wages of sin.

950
00:52:00,060 --> 00:52:02,700
The wages of sin.

951
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,220
The wages of sin.

952
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:11,880
The wages of sin.

953
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,480
The wages of sin.

954
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,180
The wages of sin.

955
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,560
The wages of sin.

956
00:52:25,560 --> 00:52:25,560


957
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:53,080
The Rainmakers from their album called Tornado.

958
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:56,800
And now, from alt to dot binaries dot slack,

959
00:52:56,800 --> 00:52:58,760
Heart Ignition.

960
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:56,760
Heart Ignition.

961
00:54:23,980 --> 00:54:26,780
Heart Ignition.

962
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,800
Heart Ignition.

963
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:00,420
Heart Ignition.

964
00:55:00,420 --> 00:55:01,780
So I doubled down a little bit,

965
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:02,100
man.

966
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,680
I switched off the Breathe,

967
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:06,580
and I got with the fridge and the freezer.

968
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:09,920
The fridge cold life.

969
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:10,960
It's like so much,

970
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:12,060
so much heat.

971
00:55:12,180 --> 00:55:12,440
Yeah, man.

972
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,720
helping 195 it in the microwave.

973
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:16,420
Yeah, man.

974
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,360
About 30 seconds.

975
00:55:18,520 --> 00:55:19,040
Just about 30 seconds.

976
00:55:19,260 --> 00:55:19,980
Just take out your CD 44.

977
00:55:20,780 --> 00:55:22,360
Yeah, those good Office Connecticut

978
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,120
Yeah, those.

979
00:55:24,820 --> 00:55:25,960
I'm sitting there.

980
00:55:26,020 --> 00:55:26,600
I'm sitting there.

981
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:26,780
I'm sitting there.

982
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:26,780


983
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:26,780


984
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:26,780


985
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,260
Turn on my favorite show.

986
00:55:28,940 --> 00:55:30,020
Watch my show.

987
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:35,960
All of a sudden, I start hearing the sound.

988
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:37,480
Slack off.

989
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:39,000
Slack off.

990
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:40,280
Slack off.

991
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,400
Slack off.

992
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,520
I realize, man, you don't object to the good or the bad.

993
