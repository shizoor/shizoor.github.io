1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
See Bob, was that your daughter on hard copy last night?

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,240
Hey Bob, they ever find your gold card?

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:08,680
Hey Bob, I hear your neighbor's doing it!

4
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:10,780
Bob, your computer crashed.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:13,240
Hi Bob, heard about your root canal. Bummer.

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:15,900
Woo! Looks like you stepped in something, see?

7
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,560
Life gotten a little crazy?

8
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:24,920
The Subgenius Hour of Slot!

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,100
What were those noises?

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,420
Well, here's the recording studio.

11
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:36,380
Let's get out of the traffic.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,900
The session's about to start.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,520
As we enter, we can hear the last minute instructions.

14
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,240
We can hear the voices of artists, musicians, and engineers coming from the different parts of the room.

15
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,280
Now listen.

16
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:52,940
You walked in a crash, rent a car, drove to L.A.

17
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:55,380
Why? What a way to invade the Earth.

18
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,960
How would you feel if tomorrow a flying saucer would drop on a atomic bomb on every...

19
00:00:59,960 --> 00:00:59,960


20
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,360
...key city in the United States?

21
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:05,060
This place is driving me nuts.

22
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,800
You and I are giving out the brain.

23
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,920
That's top secret information. Nobody knows that.

24
00:01:11,060 --> 00:01:11,620
Hello.

25
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,400
I'd like to welcome everybody tonight...

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,320
...to what we call Subgenius 101.

27
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,340
My name is Jesus Christ, and I'm the business manager for the Church of the Subgenius.

28
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:29,400
And I'm thankful for talking to the pagan community tonight.

29
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:34,820
You can imagine how hostile the Christians are when they find out I'm Jesus.

30
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:39,580
Now you'd think that they would be real pleased that I've returned.

31
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,100
They've been waiting for me for a long time, but you'd be really surprised to find out how angry they actually are that I'm back.

32
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,480
Because you know what? I'm not the Jesus that they've planned for.

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:56,240
Maybe my hair is too long, or, you know, you can't be Jesus because you don't have stigmata.

34
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:59,380
Oh, you can't be Jesus because, you know, you're tall.

35
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,640
Or you're the wrong color, or your hair's too long.

36
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:05,180
You know, because what they're believing in is, of course, the false Jesus.

37
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,940
What I call the Paul Bunyan Jesus.

38
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,080
The mythology Jesus.

39
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,580
Well, I'm the real Jesus. The fighting Jesus.

40
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:18,840
And, uh, I guess the pagans like me a lot more because they don't have as much of a stake in it as the Christians do.

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,740
And, well, they don't have much to lose as far as business for my return.

42
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,660
But, yeah, the pagans are always glad to see me.

43
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:28,980
And they usually ask for an autograph or to shake my hand...

44
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,660
Because, well, there's always a chance that I could be Jesus.

45
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:35,520
And, you know, but, of course, Christians don't want to hear it.

46
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,900
But I'm not here to talk about me tonight.

47
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,020
I'm here to talk about Bob and the Church of the Subgenius.

48
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,620
Now, tonight I'm going to give you my version of the subgenius.

49
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,320
But, really, there are no rules.

50
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:58,080
We will probably come back to Jesus' long, boring lecture about the Church of the Subgenius.

51
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,440
Actually, it's pretty good. It's a good one.

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:04,420
And I'm not going to talk this whole show like I did last time.

53
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,320
I did the last show in a big hurry.

54
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,440
And it's easier just to rush through it.

55
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:14,100
But this time we have many, many wonderful tapes stacked up.

56
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,220
Real good music and real bad music and so forth.

57
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:23,160
All your favorites that you've never heard yet.

58
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,160
But there was one little news item.

59
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:27,420
And I do mean little.

60
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,080
That I wanted to share with y'all before we go diving into the tapes.

61
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:39,080
This, what's notable about this news item is that it was, it's so tiny.

62
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,680
It was on page 14 of the Dallas Morning News.

63
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:51,280
And it's one paragraph down near the bottom of a long line of paragraphs about world news.

64
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,200
The other things around it are Turkish leader travels to Libya

65
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,680
despite flak.

66
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,740
New Zealand okays deal on native tribes claim.

67
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,580
Stuff like that.

68
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:04,600
And then here's this one.

69
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:10,100
Ozone damage called advanced in UN report.

70
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,300
Geneva.

71
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:19,360
Destruction of the ozone layer has worsened so much that little remains in the atmospheric zone

72
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:23,940
about 12 miles above Earth, the UN weather agency said Friday.

73
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,880
Ozone gas.

74
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,600
The ozone layer plays a key role in shielding people, animals and plants from dangerous forms of ultraviolet radiation.

75
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:39,600
It's depletion caused in large part by industrial chemicals is believed to increase the incidence of skin cancer and cataracts.

76
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:45,520
A hole in the ozone layer first observed in the Antarctic in the 1980s has reappeared each year since then.

77
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:53,160
The ozone layer destruction has worsened so much that little remains.

78
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,320
It says here in small print on page 14.

79
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:06,860
And I don't know I guess they could put it on the front page and make a big headline that says ozone layer destroyed.

80
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,840
Earth doomed.

81
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,980
But you know what would be the point in that?

82
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:20,380
That would be like running a headline that said the electrical wiring in your house is why we have so much cancer.

83
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,000
You know what are you going to do about it?

84
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,860
I mean you going to turn off your lights?

85
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,240
You going to move to a cabin out in the woods?

86
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,760
No, you're just going to die.

87
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:40,680
So if you have been having pesky problems with cataracts or skin cancer, if you've been going blind, now you know.

88
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:50,860
Luckily I was able to find the reason for that buried here at the back of the newspaper owned by the BELO Corporation.

89
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,780
Thank you.

90
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,620
I think it's disgusting.

91
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:55,540
This is a recording.

92
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,240
Alright now spit out that gum and stand up next to that microphone.

93
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:06,420
What I'd really like to know is why didn't you stop and talk to the puzzling evidence video crew outside the night of slack there when they started to interview you.

94
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:06,940
It was you.

95
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,620
And we were interviewing all of the callers that call all the time.

96
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,240
And we had the cameras pounce upon you immediately after the show.

97
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,820
You were one of the first people out of the theater.

98
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:16,520
But I don't understand why you didn't talk to them.

99
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,020
They would have been able to glean a certain amount of size stench just from that operation alone.

100
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,980
Even puzzling evidence doesn't have any evidence.

101
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,140
I'm not going to give you infinite patience my friend.

102
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,580
The show right now is becoming too predictable and needs new blood.

103
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,000
You're right.

104
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,800
Next caller.

105
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,540
In the name of Bob I demand that you hang up on me right away.

106
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,520
Good morning.

107
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:35,820
Good morning.

108
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,300
Good morning.

109
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,600
Is Bob going to the right of the camera?

110
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,520
Yeah what is he saying?

111
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,100
Yeah what is he saying?

112
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,800
You have to appear calm.

113
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,540
Okay.

114
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:42,820
Okay.

115
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:43,080
Come.

116
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,620
Even though I know it's a lie.

117
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,880
I'm not calm.

118
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,040
Not inside.

119
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,580
I wish the jokes would get here.

120
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,540
I know.

121
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:51,400
Do you have the mic on?

122
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:51,940
Yeah.

123
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,120
We'll just have to hold up the show until the jokes get here.

124
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,420
Well ladies and gentlemen if you're watching on the Subgenius channel or the Puzzling Evidence

125
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,000
channel you'll be seeing the theme world plans being spread out.

126
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,360
Yes it's astonishing.

127
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:05,700
From where I am I can see the entrance to the submarine city and the spacewalk.

128
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,000
I see the floating dollar from here I think.

129
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:08,900
The floating dollar casino.

130
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:09,340
Yeah.

131
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,180
And it's right on the edge of Domino City.

132
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,200
The floating dollar casino.

133
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,140
What wonders might we find there?

134
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,720
Well it's very scary because what happens in Domino City?

135
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,680
I mean if you're a neo-themologist.

136
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,880
You walk into the park not knowing what's going on.

137
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,760
And you walk into Domino City.

138
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:26,600
Oh come on.

139
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:27,700
Oh okay never mind.

140
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:28,640
A strange religion.

141
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,900
Not like us.

142
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:30,420
No.

143
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:31,040
You're pretty.

144
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,300
It's not our worship word.

145
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,080
No.

146
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:34,580
Ugly.

147
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,140
It smells bad.

148
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,260
That's right.

149
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,840
We'll clear those callers later.

150
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:43,000
Remember call in any time day or night if the spirit so moves you.

151
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,700
There will be a Subgenius pastor there.

152
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:45,300
Okay.

153
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,640
Let's look at it etiologically.

154
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,220
It's a bit tough at this hour of the morning but we can Bob.

155
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,460
It's somewhat chewy.

156
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,260
Another famous Bob.

157
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,880
It's a digestible roughage of knowledge.

158
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:54,340
Not to block the esophagus of philosophy.

159
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:54,960
We run through the jungle.

160
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:55,700
Wow.

161
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,500
What about the Ronald McArnall?

162
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:57,720
Yes.

163
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,400
Who's the golfer turned duck.

164
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:00,960
Turned president.

165
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:01,440
Turned Nazi.

166
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,780
The overturned hamburger.

167
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,280
Turned myth.

168
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,600
A little naked.

169
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,800
Ronald McArnall is the theme character.

170
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,500
Yeah we use him to sell the third world burger.

171
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,740
Mine got swastikas in his eyes.

172
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,300
Yes.

173
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,260
He's a bit.

174
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,200
Okay cameras on range finder.

175
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,180
We're looking for this old president.

176
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,560
We are calibrating now.

177
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:21,660
We're looking for this old president.

178
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:21,660


179
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:21,660


180
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:21,660


181
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:21,660


182
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:25,280
We have X-ray delta one lift off on our 103 niner.

183
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,240
Phony baloney cross religion.

184
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:27,900
That's true.

185
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,800
Long before subgenius there was pulsing evidence and there was motion.

186
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,960
There was pulsing evidence in the center of a dark void but then the earth unfolded and

187
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:38,460
new things sprung up like cities and adjustable razors.

188
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:38,700
But we're talking about theme world this morning.

189
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,820
There is a duplicate of a marvelous thing.

190
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:44,020
The primal world where giant dinosaurs roam the earth.

191
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,400
Yes in the primal world huge sluggish shug off from the pre-Cambrian slog through the

192
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:49,680
slime.

193
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:54,100
And further over the Mississippian and Pennsylvanian despite their never ending.

194
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,820
Primal world be sure to see it when you visit theme world.

195
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:05,380
Primal world is where you begin when you arrive at theme world.

196
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,460
You start in primal world.

197
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,300
You have to cut your way with a machete through the dense jungle and fight with giant insects

198
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,740
for space to sit down.

199
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,200
Then you reach history world.

200
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,860
You need not follow any of those procedures my friend.

201
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:18,960
We are intending basically to effect a palinogenesis.

202
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,560
A resurrection.

203
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:21,700
From the ashes of Bob of a new Bob.

204
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,700
Oh yes dear friends just so.

205
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,900
Just so Dr. Howell.

206
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:33,480
And by the same token we are resurrecting a new show from the ashes of the old show.

207
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,320
And that was some of the old show on KPFA at Berkeley.

208
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:44,440
The old subgenius show with Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence and I believe Court Holland

209
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,840
and somebody else there discussing theme world.

210
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:49,660
Oh by the way the little intro.

211
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:54,920
The little introductory collage we heard at the very beginning of show was from our good

212
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:57,380
bad father Joe Mama.

213
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:06,580
And just so we shall resurrect from the ashes of an old Brother Cleve song.

214
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,600
A new Brother Cleve song.

215
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:13,980
You all are certainly familiar with his top 40 hit Bob is my load.

216
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:19,640
Well Brother Cleve has finally committed to tape a new version of Bob.

217
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,680
Is my load.

218
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:26,040
This is called the cocktail mix by slack master Cleve and his lush orchestra.

219
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:30,400
Cleve by the way is the keyboardist for combustible Edison.

220
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,800
The cocktail lounge band.

221
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,980
When they go on tour.

222
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:40,500
He's keyboardist for everybody when they go on tour and we've got a lot of Cleve coming up.

223
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:46,620
So friends this particular hour of slack is an hour of slack.

224
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,400
So let's just lean back.

225
00:10:49,400 --> 00:11:00,880
And take a few sips of our hot buttered rum martinis and enjoy this this relaxing relaxing cocktail him.

226
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:01,940
Thank you all.

227
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,040
There was a man.

228
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,420
The world's greatest salesman.

229
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,040
He had to find.

230
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,760
To keep the shackles from our feet.

231
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,520
But one day up and gone.

232
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:37,120
To the cost.

233
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,920
Bob is my.

234
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,240
He's coming again.

235
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,480
Who knew that the first shot.

236
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,580
Was gonna be the last.

237
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:01,480
But he's got a hard driving pipe.

238
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:06,000
That can smoke all through the night.

239
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,420
Although he may be hurt.

240
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,140
The universe will keep on squirting.

241
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,900
Bob is my.

242
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,220
He's coming again.

243
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,260
He's coming again.

244
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,080
Bob you're in trouble.

245
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,920
You're not gonna find the

246
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:32,920


247
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:33,520
Go on

248
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:33,520


249
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:33,520


250
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,800
Better?

251
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:40,380
Yeah.

252
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:05,980
He can save us from the men in black

253
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:10,560
With one shot from his mighty sack

254
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,160
If only he could stay back

255
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,780
From the land of the dead

256
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:24,380
Oh, it's a happy day

257
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:30,140
We can drink and say

258
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,140
Bob is my lord

259
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,020
He's my lord

260
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,020
He's coming again

261
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:42,080
I know we can't take it

262
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,220
Without him

263
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,780
We can't begin

264
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:50,960
To lose the pieces of our mind

265
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:52,940
To the pink boys

266
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,600
And the wind

267
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:00,340
Until the day that he comes back

268
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:02,680
It'll be over

269
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,000
That's like a dream

270
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,920
Bob is my lord

271
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:12,200
He's coming again

272
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:19,400
Oh, oh

273
00:14:24,900 --> 00:14:28,080
Bob is my lord

274
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,620
And he's coming again

275
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,420
If we don't

276
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:35,260
Walk

277
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:37,740
the一直反 us

278
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:41,000
We can't find

279
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,600
To be on

280
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,900
A spot

281
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,620
I

282
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:47,820
I

283
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,120
I

284
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,180
I

285
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:55,720
All this my lord

286
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,300
He's coming

287
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,000
On

288
00:14:58,520 --> 00:14:59,720
To be on

289
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:00,340
The one

290
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:00,340


291
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:00,340


292
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:00,340


293
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:04,240
Oh, oh

294
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,980
He's coming again

295
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:04,980


296
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:04,980


297
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:04,980


298
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:20,920
Oh dear friends, now is that Space Age bachelor pad music or what?

299
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:28,220
Yes, the good Dr. Cleve, Brother Cleve Duncan from up in Boston there.

300
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:35,140
And by the way, did you know that the term Space Age bachelor pad music,

301
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:43,520
which is now a generic term to describe, oh, that sort of semi-wacky but very laid,

302
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:54,920
generally laid back, sometimes not so laid back type of campy old music from the 50s and early 60s

303
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,940
of which I guess the most famous example would be,

304
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:02,360
Powerhouse, the na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, you know.

305
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:07,860
That term, Space Age bachelor pad music, which I see occasionally used in the press,

306
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,940
was coined by a very early subgenius, Dr. Byron Werner,

307
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:20,720
who has since gone on to, I believe, do some CD compilations of Space Age bachelor pad music.

308
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:24,080
In fact, I think he did a compilation of Esquivel.

309
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,640
And this brings us full circle.

310
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:32,740
Actually, Esquivel, some of you are going, yeah, yeah, Esquivel, man, that guy's great.

311
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,740
Like Spike Jones, sort of.

312
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:41,940
He was kind of a jazz cocktail lounge guy in the 50s and 60s

313
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:44,440
who used a lot of sound effects in his music.

314
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:46,560
It was kind of cartoony sounding.

315
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:49,400
He's got quite a cult following.

316
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,240
And Brother Cleve was a big Esquivel fan.

317
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,700
Now, leave it to a subgenius to not just be a fan,

318
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,900
of the artist,

319
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:05,020
but to track the artist down and collaborate with him.

320
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,180
Esquivel is 78 years old, lives in Mexico City.

321
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,660
He's an old Mexican gentleman.

322
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,580
And Brother Cleve tracked him down and has been recording with him.

323
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:21,300
The guy's bedridden, but Cleve hauls his Macintosh full of sounds

324
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,360
and his keyboard down to Mexico City,

325
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,440
goes to Esquivel's house and prepares,

326
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,180
and that's a great way to do it,

327
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,760
the best for a new material.

328
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:35,280
I've actually held the master tapes of a lot of Esquivel concerts in my hands

329
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,500
while I was at Cleve's house.

330
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,940
Anyway, I got this letter from Cleve in a new tape.

331
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:43,780
I'll try to read this in Cleve's Boston accent.

332
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,720
I've enclosed here the, forget it, I can't do it.

333
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:50,380
I've enclosed here the advance of the new Esquivel Xmas album I produced.

334
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:53,940
I compiled the old recordings and added to new ones,

335
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:55,800
the intro and outro tracks.

336
00:17:55,800 --> 00:18:01,120
in which I created a digital simulation of the Esquivel Orchestra

337
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:06,160
with Miss Lily and the millionaire from Combustible Edison on vocals and guitar.

338
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:13,220
I wrote the script for Esquivel to read, which got recorded on DAT and sent to me.

339
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:17,820
Imagine my horror when I got back two hours of him trying to read it.

340
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:20,880
I had to assemble a word to a short phrase at a time.

341
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:25,400
I'll tell you what, though, my digital editing skills went from zero to a hundred in two days.

342
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,660
And I got paid for it!

343
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,960
I wanted to model the whole thing on the old Playboy After Dark TV show

344
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:35,920
where the elevator doors open and there's Hef and a bunch of half-naked chicks greeting you to the party.

345
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:40,860
All right already, so you get a 78-year-old Mexican gentleman instead, but what the heck.

346
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,180
Welcome to my strange bachelor path.

347
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,700
Thou art going to travel the distance...

348
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:05,700


349
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:05,700


350
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:05,700


351
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,520
So sweet to be one!

352
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,020
Zoot zoot Ah hint point.

353
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:16,060
genes and how

354
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,600
?

355
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:32,440
Zoot, zoot, tweet, zoot, tweet, zoot, zoot, doobie, wah.

356
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:43,860
Buenas, mis amigos. Happy holidays.

357
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,560
I am so glad you could make it.

358
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:50,100
My, you look ravishing tonight.

359
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,120
I love the boots.

360
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,660
And you, you look so dashing.

361
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,560
The cut of that suit is impeccable.

362
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:03,960
Now please, come in and make yourselves at home.

363
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,900
You will find the bar over there.

364
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:10,260
There's a lovely view of Venus tonight.

365
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:18,060
And I am sure your ears will take you to where the band is playing in the back room.

366
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,900
And, oh yes, the mistletoe.

367
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:23,500
It's right over...

368
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:27,900
Ah, it seems to be occupied right now.

369
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:32,960
Well, just relax and have a fabulous time.

370
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,040
Feliz Navidad, baby.

371
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:35,180
Feliz Navidad, baby.

372
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:48,220
Feliz Navidad, baby.

373
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:57,200
Okay, now that was basically Cleave doing Esquiville, I believe.

374
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:03,160
That was, I think, pretty much just Cleave and his keyboard and his Macintosh computer

375
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,040
with...

376
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,160
I guess with guitar and vocals overlaid on it.

377
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:09,300
And the tape of Esquiville.

378
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,940
But here is some original, real Esquiville.

379
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,660
This is for your musical edutainment friends, okay?

380
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:28,060
This classic, insane rendition of Frosty the Snowman from Esquiville.

381
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,860
Merry Christmas from the Space Age Bachelor Pat.

382
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:05,020
Merry Christmas from the Space Age Bachelor Pat.

383
00:22:13,060 --> 00:22:13,660
Thank you.

384
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:17,680
Thank you.

385
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,200
Thank you.

386
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:25,300


387
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:25,500
Thank you.

388
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,060
Thank you.

389
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:26,860
Thank you.

390
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:27,540
Thank you.

391
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:27,540


392
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:27,560
Thank you.

393
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:27,560


394
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:27,560


395
00:22:27,560 --> 00:22:27,700
Thank you.

396
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:27,700


397
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:27,700


398
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:27,700


399
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:28,000
Thank you.

400
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,640
Thank you.

401
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,280
Thank you.

402
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,380
Thank you.

403
00:22:30,460 --> 00:22:32,700
Thank you.

404
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:09,040
Zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo, zoo

405
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,380
Look at Frosty go

406
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,840
Over the hills of snow

407
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,560
Over the hills of snow

408
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:38,260
Over the hills of snow

409
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:45,680
Now some people would say that that song is a back-masked, veiled reference to cocaine,

410
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:47,620
but I don't think so.

411
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,820
Esquivel, friends, the negative land of 1950,

412
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,300
or 59, or whenever the heck that was.

413
00:23:57,620 --> 00:23:59,320
And, uh, yeah.

414
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,600
Some of us are here.

415
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:06,940
More interested in what came before than what some folks said came after.

416
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,920
They can't catch me.

417
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:11,920
Yes, back in the early world of the dawn,

418
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:16,020
you could have seen the armored quadrupedal Jurocretaceous Onyxian tetrapods

419
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:19,760
slouching their sluggish way through the steaming folia.

420
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,980
Yeah, but everybody knows that, Hal, and everybody can see it.

421
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:27,700
They can see, but they may not be haunted by visions of it seared into their sensitive souls.

422
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,560
Ah, ah.

423
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:34,120
Mars is a high and lonely destiny.

424
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,620
Find more pavilions in Theme Park.

425
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:38,960
The far pavilions give way to the farther pavilions.

426
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,560
One thing, one thing.

427
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,180
Four.

428
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,020
One of the most interesting pavilions is the Etruscan pavilion.

429
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,140
Here comes now.

430
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,700
Have you ever seen the Etruscan pavilion?

431
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,300
They call him Bob.

432
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:47,780
It's one of the latest.

433
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:50,720
The most holy weapon of all.

434
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,960
These are not wax dummies, incidentally, ladies and gentlemen.

435
00:24:53,960 --> 00:25:00,700
These are real suffering souls who paid the full price for refusal to understand the true meaning of theme world.

436
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,400
Like a bomb upon your soul.

437
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:02,540
Oh. Like a bomb upon your soul.

438
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,480
This news hits, I'm sure, and sizzles in the frying pan of your brain.

439
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,460
Like oil on troubled waters.

440
00:25:06,660 --> 00:25:08,780
In fact, it was like receiving a spinal tap.

441
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,940
Ow! That hurts!

442
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:14,540
Or like being on the good stand of an operation we call sounding a calculator system by percussion.

443
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,400
And when they woke up, the mud was splattered clear up to their elbows.

444
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,540
But they just cleaned off and went ahead with the future anyway.

445
00:25:21,740 --> 00:25:23,440
You may now open your eyes.

446
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,800
The UFOs are there.

447
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:25,900
This is a recording.

448
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:29,440
All right, now spit out that gum and stand up next to that microphone.

449
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,520
Beyond that, almost everything thought or said about the misadventure is a lie.

450
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:33,520
All right.

451
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:36,400
I can't believe it.

452
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:36,980
Me neither.

453
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:38,500
The hobbling softening.

454
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:38,680


455
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,260
It doesn't make sense.

456
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:42,360
Do people say strange things to you?

457
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,280
Do they come up on the street?

458
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:44,220
Do they tend to bother you?

459
00:25:44,280 --> 00:25:47,700
If they do, these are things that you will simply have to put up with.

460
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,360
Isn't it fascinating how much more interesting things were 150 million years ago?

461
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,780
I heartily concur.

462
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:56,580
Than all of this political stuff that flips by us.

463
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,780
Yeah, that's all this...

464
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,500
Oh, here comes something else.

465
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,980
Well, there goes the Gary Hart motorcade.

466
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:02,500
It's the Gary Hart motorcade.

467
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:02,500


468
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:02,500


469
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:02,500


470
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:02,500


471
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:02,500


472
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,340
It flits by low.

473
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,420
Sorry about that, Gary.

474
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,720
It is like the wing of a gossamer insect.

475
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:06,800
It is here and then gone.

476
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:07,380
We'll have it fixed by July.

477
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:12,660
But the true work of the giant archosaur lord of creation is embedded in the stones of the

478
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:13,140
bones of the world.

479
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,960
Or go see Iceman.

480
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,020
There's a secret message about it in Iceman.

481
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:20,220
Bob was there to watch each dropping of each coprolite from each dinosaur sphincter.

482
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,020
Bob saw.

483
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,660
Bob sees now.

484
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,360
Bob always will see.

485
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:27,340
And, uh, if it is not superfluous to add...

486
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,200
Is it the only fate that promises...

487
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,980
It may sound like we're endorsing the worst kind of conspiracy behavior.

488
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:34,980
No, you only do these terrible things to get what you need.

489
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,100
Each caller here is a different thing.

490
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,640
Well, it's my own idea.

491
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:44,020
Oh, now the caller's turned into a little doll playing the drums.

492
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:44,780
Who is?

493
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,020
Sphincto's dead.

494
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,360
Yes, it's Mimi's show now.

495
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:48,020
That's right.

496
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,180
We're trying to bring him back.

497
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,080
We just don't have enough juice.

498
00:26:50,340 --> 00:26:51,740
Sphincto is dead, but Schmutz is dead.

499
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,680
I better send more money.

500
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,120
Yes.

501
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,540
Dr. Howell, how do we get the money?

502
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,180
They're back to Earth.

503
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:58,820
Well, since we have spilled and got pure neutronium...

504
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,860
And now the neutronium is rolling.

505
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:01,960
And now the neutronium is rolling.

506
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:07,280
We're going down to the street level where the peasants will begin to eat it and then kiss the queen, giving her the power of the neutronium.

507
00:27:07,480 --> 00:27:13,920
Yes, this neutronium, the densest substance known in the physical universe, is going to be the basis of an entire new review of the scale,

508
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:19,200
which all of our foreign dignitaries, as well as the president and his charming wife, will ascend in just 25 short minutes,

509
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,040
as the subgenius floats continue in this parade of parades on the year of surprises.

510
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,160
And here, moving at faster than sound...

511
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,740
What's happening to them?

512
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,400
...the giant transports...

513
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,260
...in a transport of extravagance...

514
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:32,780
Leave him on.

515
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,880
...and they were the progenitors of this show.

516
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:37,860
Because you can't think of any jokes.

517
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,040
Guys, the jokes are here.

518
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,460
Come on, you need more after than you realize.

519
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:42,300
It's embarrassing and very annoying.

520
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,480
I think the jokes have arrived.

521
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,380
The joke is clear in your mind.

522
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:44,380


523
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,340
What, the jokes?

524
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,000
The woman's carrying them.

525
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:46,060
Here, take one.

526
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:46,460
Take one.

527
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:47,120
Okay, yeah.

528
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,000
Here's a good joke.

529
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:48,500
I'm going to try this one on.

530
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,760
The UFO joke.

531
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,600
Quick, quick.

532
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,940
I'll just try this one on.

533
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:52,600
What?

534
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:56,280
Good, good, because theme world is about to be destroyed.

535
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,460
No, no, that's just tiny prophecy.

536
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:58,800
Get those planes away.

537
00:27:58,800 --> 00:27:58,980
There's still a chance.

538
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,720
I want to get into that because then people start paying to buy tickets to get into theme

539
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:05,060
world to be there when it happens or to see the movie of how it happens and to see the

540
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:05,560
TV show.

541
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:05,940
Theme world, a motion picture.

542
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:06,520
Yeah.

543
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:07,720
Theme world, a TV show.

544
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:08,800
Theme world, a novel.

545
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,280
Theme world, the chain of fast food, roadside restaurants.

546
00:28:11,280 --> 00:28:13,060
There's the theme world, the mini series.

547
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,100
Theme world, the underwear.

548
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,320
The theme world, the wrapping paper.

549
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,080
The theme world, the patch dolls that swept away the heart of mother's mother.

550
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,500
Yeah, that's it, the theme patch dolls that people started going...

551
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:24,440
The lettuce leaf dolls and the cabbage foot dolls had a kind of a bash.

552
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:24,600
Thanks, listener.

553
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:25,880
These people come by and leave these things for us.

554
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,300
The theme world, camouflage shoes.

555
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,060
You just have to clean them up.

556
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:28,640
That's the only problem.

557
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,460
The theme world, room humidifier.

558
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,360
Ah, boy, look, it takes the smoke right out.

559
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,760
Packs it up and sends it to my family in Minneapolis.

560
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,620
Remember in 1986, there's going to be some strange changes made in this sorry old...

561
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,060
Is there a foreign area in theme world?

562
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,540
Is there someplace where we can go to relax in another country's theme?

563
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,280
I thought they kept foreigners out of theme world.

564
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:47,180
Now I don't want to go.

565
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,320
Well, what about it, man?

566
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,720
Do you let those foreigners into theme world or do you...

567
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,720
Speak more into the microphone, son.

568
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,480
Exactly.

569
00:28:56,660 --> 00:28:58,180
Yes, keep that microphone close to you.

570
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:58,960
Now what is this?

571
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:00,480
This is poop on the foreign angle.

572
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:04,080
Well, we don't like foreigners coming to theme world.

573
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:04,860
Well, that's a relief.

574
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:08,140
I must say that it's good that someplace these days is keeping up its standards.

575
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:08,700
They scare the locals.

576
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,520
This is a broadcast for all the ships at sea.

577
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,600
There will be no foreigners permitted in theme world.

578
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,080
Not now, not ever.

579
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,180
Turn back here.

580
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,920
The crowds are turned away at the front gates.

581
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,800
Yes, you won't need to ask where the beef is in this marvelous park.

582
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,960
And I think Mr. Mike Believe might have the key to this most peculiar conundrum.

583
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,960
They say that the public has a right to know the truth.

584
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:28,960


585
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,640
Exactly.

586
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,580
But we've got to get him to talk more, see, because the accent costs so much.

587
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:35,000
I've got to be stuck for words, see.

588
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,760
I'm sort of crammed in a corner like, you know.

589
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,660
Yeah, but we paid for the money to change your voice and make you sound like...

590
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:46,240
I tried to do the 16 rounds like we said we were doing in the first place.

591
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,440
Right, right, right.

592
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,760
Okay, look, now it's happening to me too.

593
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,900
Okay, well, it's Mike Believe in the first round, okay?

594
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:53,300
Happy.

595
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,040
Happy.

596
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,180
Happy.

597
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:56,800
Happy.

598
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:57,860
Happy.

599
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:58,180
Happy.

600
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,060
And now for the real straight culture, right?

601
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:00,580
Right.

602
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:01,660
Okay then, here we go.

603
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,620
And now for the real straight culture.

604
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:12,860
And, incidentally, dear friends, this is hour of slack number 549.

605
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:22,740
It won't be too long before we hit the magic number of show 555, and if we can hang in

606
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:27,840
there another couple of years, it would be show number 6, 5, 5, 6, and 5.

607
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,340
666.

608
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,440
But we don't have a couple of years, come to think of it.

609
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:38,080
I believe, if my computer told me correctly today, that it was at this recording time.

610
00:30:38,620 --> 00:30:43,840
We had 631 days to X Day.

611
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:54,860
And since I planned to quit doing this show on X Day, I guess we'll never hit show number 666.

612
00:30:57,980 --> 00:31:00,400
Right, it's a real straight culture, right?

613
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:00,880
Right.

614
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:01,860
Okay, then, here we go.

615
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:06,360
Now, tonight I'm going to give you my version of the subgenius,

616
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:10,780
but really there are no rules in the Church of the Subgenius, except for one.

617
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:18,080
And we can't say that one on the radio, but it has something to do with what we do if they can't take a joke, think you like.

618
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:19,420
That's the only rule you have to follow.

619
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:22,200
And that's it. Once you learn that, you're in.

620
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:26,020
But, you know, we also have other things that we believe in.

621
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:32,840
One of our greatest truths and beliefs is recapturing slack.

622
00:31:33,780 --> 00:31:36,540
Now, I can't tell you what slack is.

623
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,480
And as Reverend Stang says, slack is different things to different people.

624
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,840
To some people, slack is just a good meal.

625
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:52,480
To others, slack is just watching TV or working on their website or whatever it is that they do.

626
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:54,220
That's what slack is to them.

627
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,880
But tonight I'm going to tell you.

628
00:31:56,020 --> 00:32:02,580
I'm going to give you a way to remember what the subgenius is, at least my version of it.

629
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,620
And hopefully this will help you tell others so you can spread the word of Bob.

630
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:14,420
So I broke slack down into its components and put each letter to a different thing to remember

631
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:18,540
so that you can always think slack and know what it means.

632
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,960
So the first letter in slack is S.

633
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:24,400
And this is the most important thing, so remember this.

634
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:25,240
S.

635
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:27,540
Stands for send.

636
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,240
Send your $30 to Bob.

637
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:37,160
Now, this is the most important thing because you can't have salvation without sending your $30 to Bob.

638
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,080
Now, let me back up for a minute.

639
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:44,300
Most religions would put their ploy for money at the end of their speech.

640
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,040
Now, notice we come right up front and tell you what we want.

641
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,800
We want your $30.

642
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,980
And that's really not that bad.

643
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:55,120
When you look at other religions, hell, you get into Christianity or Buddhism or Scientology.

644
00:32:56,620 --> 00:33:00,580
Or any of these other false religions, well, you could be paying the rest of your life.

645
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:06,820
You gotta tithe 10%, you gotta go to church every Sunday, you gotta give to the poor.

646
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,060
All's we want is $30.

647
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:09,540
$30 you're in.

648
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,600
Send your $30 to Bob.

649
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:15,900
So now your next question should be, well, who is Bob?

650
00:33:16,220 --> 00:33:18,180
Well, who is this guy that I'm sending my money to?

651
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,660
Well, you all know what he looks like.

652
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:23,040
You've seen the guy with the pipe, but who is he?

653
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,000
Well, Bob is the living avatar of slack.

654
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:27,900
The holy saint of sales.

655
00:33:28,420 --> 00:33:30,660
He is the greatest salesman that ever lived.

656
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,900
Now, Bob started a religion.

657
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:44,780
Actually, he got some ideas for a religion back in the 50s and jotted down all the ideas on little scraps of paper and pizza crust and toilet paper or whatever he had, whatever he was inspired.

658
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:51,840
And put all these in a big paper bag and in the 80s gave them to Reverend Ivan Stang and Philo Drummond.

659
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,920
They translated them into the first book, which is the book,

660
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:56,920
The Subgenius.

661
00:33:57,020 --> 00:34:03,040
Yes, yes, them were the days, the days of the book.

662
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:04,720
The first book.

663
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:07,420
And there was the second book.

664
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:12,460
The first book only involved about three trash bags full of Bob's notes.

665
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:23,820
The fourth book, Revelation X, involved, I believe, nine trash bags packed with Bob's notes.

666
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:27,340
Anyway, enough lectures, actually.

667
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:33,060
I think that most of you are probably familiar with those basic facts of the Church of the Subgenius.

668
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:40,800
Jesus occasionally fills in for me lecturing it to smaller groups and so forth.

669
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,560
But I think it's time to get back to some music.

670
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:48,780
This is more music by Brother Cleve Duncan and his Lush Orchestra.

671
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:53,800
This is an instrumental piece, which we rarely play on this show without speaking out.

672
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:54,360
We're not over them.

673
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:57,820
We like to mangle the music that we play.

674
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,400
But this time I won't.

675
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:04,380
It's a pretty, well, what we call in the business a fat mix.

676
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:08,940
And I hope you can listen in headphones or in stereo otherwise,

677
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:12,400
because it's a bit psychedelic.

678
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:21,260
Not unlike, in that respect, not unlike the KPFA Subgenius show with its endlessly burbling sound effects.

679
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,800
I love that stuff.

680
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:30,400
Okay, here is March of the Exists by Brother Cleve Donut Duncan.

681
00:35:54,020 --> 00:35:56,340
Say your attention till I turn behind the curtain!

682
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,500
Say your attention!

683
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,240
Pay no attention!

684
00:36:08,680 --> 00:36:09,720
Say your attention till I turn behind the curtain!

685
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,480
Say your attention!

686
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,800
Say your attention till I turn behind the curtain!

714
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:27,180
track tapes. I really think their time has come.

715
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:27,900
Yeah.

716
00:43:33,780 --> 00:43:36,260
Oh, just listen to that.

717
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:41,200
Wow, four tracks. Those were twice as good

718
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,080
as the two tracks.

719
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:53,080
Yes, dear friends, a little glimpse of Sister

720
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:56,820
Susie the Floozy and Dr. Nolan Void. Shortly after they

721
00:43:56,820 --> 00:44:01,100
found out that they were long lost brother and twin sister or something like

722
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:04,340
that. It's a long and horrible story.

723
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:07,740
Probably more horrible than I know yet.

724
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:12,880
We know yet

725
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,760
nothing.

726
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:30,680
Ain't got no car. Ain't got no wife. In fact, I got killed

727
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,600
coming over here tonight. I am a dead man.

728
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:38,560
I'm laying on the floor. I am a dead man.

729
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:42,200
I am deceased and once more I am a dead man.

730
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,900
Yes, I have discontinued living. I have given up on cash,

731
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,620
wine and women. I ain't got no money.

732
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:52,340
I ain't got no shoes.

733
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:56,000
I guess it ain't funny, that is why I have the blues.

734
00:44:56,720 --> 00:44:59,620
I am so dead that I feel like a stiff.

735
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:03,740
If you don't believe it, just take a sniff.

736
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,120
I am a dead man.

737
00:45:06,860 --> 00:45:07,540
Sniff me.

738
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,760
Ain't got no job, cause I won't need it anymore.

739
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,760
Can't hit the time block, cause I can't get up no more.

740
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,520
I'm on a permanent vacation with no pay.

741
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,240
Don't ask me what I think, cause I got nothing to say.

742
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,960
I tell you I am dead, that's why I have the blues.

743
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:55,860
Yes, that's what I said, now I'm telling you the news.

744
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:00,380
I am a dead man, as cold as I can be.

745
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,580
I am a dead man.

746
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:03,560
If you don't believe it, just touch me.

747
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:04,820
I am a dead man.

748
00:46:05,280 --> 00:46:07,260
I have pain, the ultimate price.

749
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:11,380
That's why I'm qualified to give you this advice.

750
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,620
I'm a dead man.

751
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,500
D-E-A-D.

752
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:18,980
I am dead.

753
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:20,860
That's what I said.

754
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:21,840
I am dead.

755
00:46:21,960 --> 00:46:22,000
I am dead.

756
00:46:24,740 --> 00:46:26,940
And that was John Bartles.

757
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:28,600
Live.

758
00:46:29,400 --> 00:46:29,840
Hit.

759
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,800
Even though you haven't paid your 30 bucks, I'm going to give you this free bit of information.

760
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:41,060
And that is that the world is going to end 1998, July 5th, 7am.

761
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,180
That's what we call X-Day.

762
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:44,120
The rupture.

763
00:46:44,260 --> 00:46:48,260
That is when all the subgeniuses, all the dues paying subgeniuses,

764
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,740
will be ruptured up on the space vessels.

765
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:53,280
And that's when all the sex goddesses will be ruptured up.

766
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:56,860
And we'll talk more about the sex goddesses later, maybe right another time.

767
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:59,720
But this is what you get for your 30 dollars.

768
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,100
Now, I can't tell you what Slack is.

769
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,900
But for 30 dollars, I can sell it to you.

770
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,940
So S. Focus now.

771
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:12,740
S. Send your 30 dollars to Bob.

772
00:47:13,700 --> 00:47:15,520
The next letter in Slack is L.

773
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,880
Now, I'm going to talk about something that you may not understand at this moment.

774
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:21,940
And you may just have to think about it.

775
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,100
And ponder on it.

776
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:26,000
Just consider how it affects your life.

777
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,100
It may not make sense now.

778
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:29,180
And it may not make sense next year.

779
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,880
And hell, it may never make sense.

780
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,000
But listen to it anyway.

781
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:35,520
L stands for Launch the Head.

782
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,260
Remember that.

783
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:38,260
Launch the Head.

784
00:47:38,400 --> 00:47:41,100
You need to ask yourself, how am I launching the head?

785
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:43,820
What have I done today to launch the head?

786
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,360
How am I helping others to launch the head?

787
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,720
Because that's what you need to think about.

788
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,540
Because only when you're launching the head can you achieve.

789
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,500
True Slack.

790
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,300
Now think.

791
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:54,960
Have I launched the head today?

792
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,800
How have I helped others to launch the head?

793
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:58,100
L. Launch the Head.

794
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,780
C. C. L. L. L.

795
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:04,400
C. C. L. L. L.

796
00:48:05,940 --> 00:48:08,120
C. C. L. L. L.

797
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:09,260


798
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:11,740
C. C. L. L. L.

799
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:17,760
How can you not see that there's something out there that you cannot see?

800
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,520
How can you not see that there's something in here that you cannot see?

801
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,400
How can you not see that you cannot see what you cannot see?

802
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:27,500
Not see, not see, not see.

803
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,260
C. C. L. L.

804
00:48:29,480 --> 00:48:31,800
You confuse what you see with what you think?

805
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:37,960
If you confuse what you think with what you feel, I mean, doesn't what you think affect what you not see?

806
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:40,680
Do you just see what you want to see?

807
00:48:40,740 --> 00:48:42,860
I mean, do you not see on purpose?

808
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:48,300
I don't know what I don't know and you cannot see what you cannot see.

809
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:49,740
Do you see?

810
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:51,820
Do not see

811
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:52,520
Do

812
00:48:52,520 --> 00:48:53,580
not

813
00:48:53,580 --> 00:48:54,260
see

814
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,440
Do not see

815
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:56,900
Do not see

821
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:21,140
see what you see?

822
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:21,700
Seek health.

823
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:24,200
That the whole society cannot see.

824
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,120
That it cannot see what it cannot see.

825
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:29,060
How can you not see that you cannot see

826
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:30,060
what you cannot see?

827
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:32,300
How can you not see that you cannot see

828
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,300
what you cannot see?

829
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:36,140
Get serious. Open your eyes.

830
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:36,920
Take a look.

831
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:38,440
And see.

832
00:49:38,700 --> 00:49:39,440
Seek health.

833
00:49:39,540 --> 00:49:40,480
Not not.

834
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,260
See.

835
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:44,900
You see?

836
00:49:45,360 --> 00:49:47,280
You see what I mean?

837
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:48,500
You see what I mean?

838
00:49:51,320 --> 00:49:53,480
And that was our old friend

839

841
00:49:58,920 --> 00:49:59,860
I'm going to give you

842
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:01,720
their address in a second here

843
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:03,560
because I don't think their

844
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:05,780
tapes are the kind of things that you're going to be able

845
00:50:05,780 --> 00:50:06,900
to pick up in the store.

846
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:08,040
So,

847
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:11,340
they're only, I think, five bucks each.

848
00:50:11,560 --> 00:50:13,100
A buck for postage.

861
00:50:36,840 --> 00:50:37,440
here

862
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,800
on their tape.

863
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:40,540
Warning.

864
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,420
There are politically correct police units

865
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,800
being formed to seek those who would

866
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:47,540
dare speak politically incorrect

867
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:49,200
beliefs. Warning.

868
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,580
They will come into your home or radio station

869
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:54,000
and pull you out by your beliefs

870
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,660
and make you watch

871
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,640
Leave It to Beaver or Dick Van Dyke

872
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,740
and worst of all, they feed you bland

873
00:50:59,740 --> 00:51:01,540
cereal. Watch out.

874
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,540
It can happen to you.

875
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:05,700
The only

876
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:07,680
possible chance we have for remaining free

877
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:09,840
is to fight back now by thinking

878
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,820
and living creative thoughts and ideas

879
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,840
and by supporting those who are willing

880
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,340
to stand up and express

881
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:16,660
their ignorance.

882
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:19,500

00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:27,560
Well, I really don't know much about them guys,

885
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:30,340
but they do send tapes every year or so

886
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:34,240
and it's a beautiful thing, isn't it?

887
00:51:36,740 --> 00:51:39,640
That's release from Theme World here for immediate release.

888
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:44,380
Acid rainforest erupts. Deviant Halloween wilderness engulfs Post Guard Palace.

889
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:46,400
We'll have to cover that story before the end of the show.

890
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:49,400
We'll have people very, very scared about that.

891
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:50,320
I don't stop!

892
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,680
The humidity, the accursed lushness,

893
00:51:53,740 --> 00:51:55,440
the creeping tenderness of the market.

894
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,500
I need a glass of slack real fast.

895
00:51:57,740 --> 00:51:59,440
And having elephant burgers.

896
00:51:59,980 --> 00:52:02,180
Well, you boys must be so excited

897
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:04,780
seeing everything you do expanding so successfully.

898
00:52:05,060 --> 00:52:08,220
Have you got any plans to expand Theme World itself

899
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:11,380
and add even new attractions to these wonderful attractions

900
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:12,920
you've been describing for us this evening?

901
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:15,580
Well, we are, yes. We're going to have many more.

902
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:20,380
We're going to have maybe another dozen or so rides built by the end of this month.

903
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:20,560
What?

904
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,080
The 50-foot woman.

905
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,380
I presume you are joking.

906
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:27,580
No relation to the famous motion picture of the same name.

907
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,100
Attack of the 50-foot woman.

908
00:52:29,380 --> 00:52:31,620
In the Theme World version, I think earlier this evening

909
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:34,080
we were talking about the attack of the 50-foot third grade teacher.

910
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:37,600
Too many of those knobs tending the antennae and heightening the carapace.

911
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:39,780
That's the problem. Too many organs and not enough cloth.

912
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,720
Too many jiggling, obscene bunches of nerves.

913
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:42,720
It's the mutations, Doug.

914
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:45,060
Well, the first time I went to Theme World,

915
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:47,300
I got completely lost at the Pretentiousness Plaza.

916
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,400
Hey, it's all made of plastic, isn't it?

917
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:53,860
Yeah, if I hadn't been able to see the giant slack generator

918
00:52:53,860 --> 00:52:57,920
at the Tower of Bob towering over me like a giant landmark on the horizon,

919
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,320
I think I would have...

920
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:01,420
This brochure from Theme World is extremely diversified.

921
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,400
Good morning. You're washed in the pee of Bob.

922
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,660
Oh, not again.

923
00:53:07,100 --> 00:53:07,540
Naviators.

924
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,760
How are you feeling?

925
00:53:10,040 --> 00:53:10,920
What happened?

926
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:12,400
I fell out.

927
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:12,660
True.

928
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:15,500
So what's happening with Theme World right there?

929
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,000
It ain't no beach party, that's for certain.

930
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:19,040
Theme World is coming to you.

931
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:21,040
It's the refrigerated cargo commodity.

932
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:21,320
It's coming!

933
00:53:21,780 --> 00:53:22,580
Theme World!

934
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:24,280
It's almost here.

935
00:53:24,460 --> 00:53:25,600
Here's a man there.

936
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:27,360
Who would dare to read that?

937
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:28,340
Who won't believe this fellow?

938
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:30,340
Avedis is never on the show. We make up Avedis.

939
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:31,920
When we need an extra hand,

940
00:53:32,040 --> 00:53:35,240
we slap together some types of Charles L. McKinney under the influence.

941
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:36,900
We make him up. Him.

942
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:38,900
A ghost puppet.

943
00:53:39,320 --> 00:53:41,440
I want an explanation. I want an explanation.

944
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,520
Okay, here. It's at the bottom of this little box of jokes.

945
00:53:44,540 --> 00:53:44,780
All right, somebody start talking.

946
00:53:44,780 --> 00:53:45,620
It comes in before each show.

947
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,040
Shut up!

948
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,860
Oh, okay. Well, you see, this guy gets excited,

949
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:48,880
and they write all the jokes for us,

950
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:49,880
and then we just do the show. That's all.

951
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:51,580
Whose idea was this anyway?

952
00:53:51,860 --> 00:53:52,620
I think it's not really a live show.

953
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,020
Do you think these callers are talking to somebody?

954
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:56,120
This is all composed of random bits of information

955
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,700
selected by electronic computer.

956
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:00,280
No one is here.

957
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,420
No one is here.

958
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:02,800
Promises.

959
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:06,000
Go back to sleep or ask about Theme World.

960
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,460
The top part was discovered,

961
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:10,580
and it led stairway after stairway down into the bowels of the earth.

962
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,100
The mummified form of the original Tower of Bob

963
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,940
that the Theme World attraction is based on.

964
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:20,080
You see, we have to come to grips to think through those things, folks.

965
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:23,520
We just can't sit and let words flow over our minds.

966
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,740
We have to think, what does that mean?

967
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:30,240
You got people saying, well, what you need to do is to fast,

968
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:32,500
and then if you fast for 40 days,

969
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:34,760
why, then you'll really get close to God.

970
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:39,120
You may fast so long that you die and get real close to it.

971
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:40,420
But, uh,

972
00:54:40,580 --> 00:54:42,740
but then you got that type of a thing going on.

973
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:46,380
And all over the world, you got new hobby horses,

974
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,360
new hula hoops coming up,

975
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,640
um, that you can do to draw near to God.

976
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:54,880
And I want to ask you a question.

977
00:54:55,040 --> 00:54:59,600
Do any of those make sense if forgiveness is finished?

978
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,680
Do you have an answer for that question, dear friends?

979
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:04,660
Well, we do.

980
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:06,060
And here it is.

981
00:55:06,180 --> 00:55:09,880
It's an address that I'm about to give, that I always give.

982
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:12,640
As we approach the end of every show.

983
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,300
That address, of course, is the address of the, uh,

984
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,460
Dallas headquarters of the Church of the Subgenius,

985
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:22,740
where you can write for, uh, free information regarding our, uh,

986
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:23,700
services.

987
00:55:25,580 --> 00:55:29,480
And, uh, just, uh, just drop a little line to Bob.

988
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,740
That's right, just write to Bob at

989
00:55:32,740 --> 00:55:37,560
Post Office Box 140306

990
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:39,180
in Dallas, Texas.

991
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,620
And once again,

992
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:41,300
Oh, what?

993
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:48,280
That's Post Office Box 140306

994
00:55:50,020 --> 00:55:51,180
Dallas, Texas

995
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:56,540
75214

996
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,360
Ah, it feels so good to give that po-po-po-po-po-po-po-post!

997
00:56:27,180 --> 00:56:29,860
To tell ya something about working for the national Даже...

998
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:30,360
... Teach me what I can do.

999
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:31,080
The family聲

1000
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:39,000
And uh, you know, all the other greatucts and stars connected to monetization.

1001
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:39,000


1002
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:39,000


1003
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,580
Thank you.

1004
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,240
Thank you.

1005
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:33,240


1006
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:34,240
Huh.

1007
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:35,840
I made that.

1008
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,420
I did that myself a long time ago.

1009
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:38,860
Back when I had old.

1010
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,000
Some old junkie left me his synthesizer.

1011
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:44,020
And my four track deck.

1012
00:57:44,060 --> 00:57:45,720
Used to work back then.

1013
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:46,260
But I think.

1014
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:49,900
I think we'll let Esquivel.

1015
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,160
Take us out.

1016
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:52,560
And take us away.

1017
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,700
Thanks to Brother Cleave here.

1018
00:57:57,820 --> 00:57:58,340
Wow.

1019
00:57:58,620 --> 00:57:59,380
Did you hear that?

1020
00:57:59,400 --> 00:57:59,860
Bats.

1021
00:58:01,340 --> 00:58:03,680
When I lean my head close.

1022
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:06,080
I've got these headphones set.

1023
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:07,520
Kind of back on my head.

1024
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,860
So I can hear the phone ringing.

1025
00:58:09,000 --> 00:58:09,600
In case it does.

1026
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:11,420
When I lean in close.

1027
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:12,580
Hear that?

1028
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:14,800
Hear that?

1029
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,020
It's.

1030
00:58:15,080 --> 00:58:15,380
It.

1031
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:16,020
It.

1032
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:17,700
I've got to back off.

1033
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:18,020
Or it'll.

1034
00:58:18,040 --> 00:58:18,620
It'll come.

1035
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:19,880
Hendrix.

1036
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,200
Hendrix knew how to use feedback.

1037
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:22,180
Man.

1038
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:22,440
Man.

1039
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:23,360
I could be a musician.

1040
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:23,700
I.

1041
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:24,140
Oh.

1042
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,100
Thanks so much for coming.

1043
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:28,680
Muchas gracias.

1044
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:30,980
It's been my pleasure.

1045
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:33,100
To host this holiday happening.

1046
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,480
I hope you have a wonderful time.

1047
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:38,220
Bye.

1048
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:38,300
Bye.

1049
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:38,980
Bye.

1050
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:38,980


1051
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:38,980


1052
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:38,980


1053
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:38,980


1054
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:38,980


1055
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:38,980


1056
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:38,980


1057
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:38,980


1058
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:39,960
Bye.

1059
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:41,860
Bye.

1060
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:41,860


1061
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:41,860


1062
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:41,860


1063
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:41,860


1064
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:41,860


1065
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:41,860


1066
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:41,860


1067
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:41,860


1068
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:41,860


1069
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:41,860


1070
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:41,860


1071
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:41,860


1072
00:58:41,860 --> 00:58:44,580
Well, I must attend to getting a space shuttle

1073
00:58:44,580 --> 00:58:48,580
to get some of our borracho amigos on a safe journey home.

1074
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:53,660
May you have a fabulous and festive holiday season.

1075
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:55,860
Until next time.

1076
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:56,860
Adios.

1077
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:29,060
Thank you, Bob.

1078
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:34,320
Bob mentioned Ed McAteer and the breakfast concerning Israel.

1079
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:38,600
Well, you know, gentlemen, they celebrated, I don't think would be the word,

1080
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:44,480
maybe remembered the 50th anniversary of the liberation of the people from Auschwitz.

1081
00:59:45,120 --> 00:59:49,900
Mary and I went to Dachau in Germany. We saw what these things look like.

1082
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,540
And, you know, this is something that should be remembered,

1083
00:59:55,380 --> 01:00:00,440
because with human nature as it is, another Holocaust is always just around the corner.

1084
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,680
It's just bizarre conspiracy theories.

1085
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,200
What bizarre conspiracy theories? I'm not made up any

1086
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:08,580
conspiracy theories.

1087
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:10,860
I've talked facts here. If you can't deal with facts...

1088
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:11,040
I mean, you can totally say...

1089
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:16,380
Just silly pauses.
