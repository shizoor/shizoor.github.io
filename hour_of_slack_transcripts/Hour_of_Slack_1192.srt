1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,580
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,200
Did you know that Bob spelled backwards and still says Bob?

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,340
Hey, hey.

4
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:17,520
Yes, please.

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:18,380
Operator, hurry.

6
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,220
Anyone in particular?

7
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:19,840
Just hurry.

8
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:23,740
Hello.

9
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:24,320
Hello.

10
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:26,460
Now, what was it you wanted?

11
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:27,460
Listen, you've got to stop him.

12
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,260
What?

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,060
Stop him.

14
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Ryder.

15
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:31,040
You idiot.

16
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:32,300
The worst is going on.

17
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,660
The Soul Genius.

18
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,960
Our own soul.

19
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:40,160
This is the operator.

20
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,220
I'm sorry you've been cut off.

21
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:43,900
I can't seem to get them back.

22
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,820
It doesn't matter, operator.

23
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,140
Nothing matters now.

24
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,060
Feel this way.

25
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:57,180
I never knew I was going to feel this way.

26
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,220
Yeah.

27
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:58,920
Shut your mouth.

28
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,540
Just a second.

29
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,700
It's so calming on the show.

30
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,860
That's what I love about shows.

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,420
It's just like washing in warm radio water.

32
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:06,360
It is calming.

33
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:06,720
Breathing.

34
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,880
So calming that it disturbs and beddiscus meditation.

35
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:13,140
Calm down my radio.

36
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:13,920
That's for meditation.

37
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,860
That's your job, sir.

38
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:21,420
Oh, just enjoy the radio smell.

39
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,520
Yeah, just enjoy the oboes.

40
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,520
This populous village.

41
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,380
You're going to enjoy the tear dryer.

42
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:27,700
Listen.

43
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:28,500
Listen.

44
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:29,100
Hanging with Ron.

45
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,980
With all the numberless goings on of life.

46
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,860
Inaudable as dreams.

47
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,620
Ah.

48
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:38,840
Yeah.

49
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,200
Eat as much toast as you want.

50
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:40,640
Yeah.

51
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,300
And in fact, eat a bit greasy breakfast after you have.

52
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,160
We recommend it.

53
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:49,780
After you have a night of debauchery.

54
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:53,460
And filled with too much of this and too much of that.

55
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,840
I did that a couple nights in a row recently.

56
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,760
Oh, me too.

57
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,700
Man, me too.

58
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,100
We had a couple of nights of debauchery.

59
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:07,240
Also, friends, on Valentine's Day weekend.

60
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:13,960
Only it wasn't at the Puzzling Evidence Show from KPFA Berkeley, which you just heard at

61
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,380
Will Again.

62
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:18,560
From Puzzling Evidence, Dr. Howell and Dr. Philodrum.

63
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,000
Nay.

64
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:27,740
It was a couple of nights of debauchery at the Winter Star Symposium of Aught Nights.

65
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:27,740


66
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:27,900
It was a great time.

67
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:27,900


68
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,600
Winter Star is the annual winter indoor event put on by Ace of Cleveland.

69
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:38,260
The same people who put on Starwood in the summer.

70
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:45,100
They've been inviting me to come and preach at both of those festivals for 18 years now.

71
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,100
There's a lot more at a given Winter Star, though, than just the subgenius revival.

72
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:53,740
For instance, there's the Space Jam cabin.

73
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,740
Where the rather different version of a winter star is.

74
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,940
I want to know.

75
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:01,340
What type of singing well, you have?

76
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,400
Saya.

77
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,500
I'm not aware of revolutionary sleep singing any more.

78
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:09,980
I'm here with Dr. V decree are notière la���che.

79
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,680
I currently have an academic advisor of mine.

80
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:10,860
He didn't make it into college, and it's kind of working his eye out for me.

81
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:10,860


82
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:10,860


83
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,740
I was a part of a Berlin application, of many they were born inунд de Vrij.

84
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,380
Then left for differs Lomb feminine is in a way colonial so much largely came under

85
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,380


86
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:14,380


87
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,120
We're looking like you.

88
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:17,380
Yes.

89
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:22,700
Lee to go and dance with a begeet Oh my mom,amin?

90
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,280
disability folicog

91
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:34,860
A lot of collagerie by Reverend Sweetness McGee, by The Large, and of course by the great Fernanda Nende-Lemur.

92
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:40,580
And a new old song from Phineas Narco of NationalCynical.com.

93
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:47,420
And a little radio synesthesia from WCSB Cleveland talking about radio trolls and kooks.

94
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,500
And finally, friends, a subgenius mass wedding.

95
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:56,800
And I think with that I have given just about all the credits for the entire show.

96
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:03,540
And so, let us join that live revival sermon from Winterstar in progress.

97
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:09,780
Now the subject, this Winterstar, we always have a theme.

98
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,820
And the theme this time was tribal spirituality.

99
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:21,160
Now, I happen to come from a group, I guess you could even call it a tribe, except for one thing.

100
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:28,740
It is a group of people who think that tribalism is the whole problem with religion and spirituality.

101
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:36,680
In other words, the minute you have a spiritual tribe, that means everybody else is in the other tribe.

102
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,520
And suddenly it is the us versus them thing.

103
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:51,260
And if you grew up in Dallas, Texas, you pretty quickly learn that either you are going to go to hell or else.

104
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,920
You have to start your own religion.

105
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:58,600
And so we took that alternate route.

106
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,880
But seriously, tribalism, that is kind of the problem with spirituality.

107
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:11,880
People form these little tribes where they go, well, I am more spiritual than you are, than your tribe is.

108
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,060
Now, if you are talking to me, that is probably true.

109
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,760
You probably are more spiritual than I am.

110
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,020
But.

111
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:27,960
We are, it is a different, the church of the subgenius is a difficult tribe to hold.

112
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:29,700
We do not even try to keep it together.

113
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,620
By definition, every subgenius is different from every other subgenius.

114
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,780
If any two are alike, one must die.

115
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:42,000
And the only thing we have in common is that we have nothing in common with the conspiracy of the normal people.

116
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:46,100
Who do not even know that they are conspiring against the weirdos.

117
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:46,540


118
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:48,900
I recently.

119
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:58,440
I recently realized that one way of putting it is, we are the funny weirdos making fun of the bad weirdos.

120
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:01,360
Now, that does not mean that we are the good weirdos.

121
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,300
That only means we are the funny weirdos.

122
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:03,720
Hopefully.

123
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:09,760
We are here to make civilization fun again, folks.

124
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:11,400
You know.

125
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:15,700
Something keeps getting missing from the equation.

126
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:19,780
Kayنا Did.

127
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,000
We cannot do nothing to stop this.

128
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:30,820
sucking in 있을 fashion.

129
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:37,160
One of our messages, that some of you may not have heard before.

130
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:42,120
Well there is really only one law with this particular religion.

131
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,180
You know, everyone has lots of commandments.

132
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,360
And believe me, we do.

133
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,980
We have a list of sins we suggest

134
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:54,260
that goes on for like 300 or 400 of them in one of our books.

135
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:58,420
I think Dr. Legume came up with most of those sins.

136
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:00,720
What is it a comprehensive list?

137
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,720
It's not.

138
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:06,420
If you come up with a new one, let us know.

139
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,280
We're always looking for new sins and so forth.

140
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:18,860
The idea, really, you know, if you come away from this with remembering anything at all,

141
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:25,020
after these videos, remember to keep your perversions and your twisted,

142
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,700
all the things that everybody else thinks is so messed up about you.

143
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:30,740
That's what you want to hold on to.

144
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,840
Your twistedness, your sickness, that's what makes you you.

145
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:39,960
Now, and in fact, let's see here.

146
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:45,680
According to, I always have to read the program notes to find out what it was I was going to talk about.

147
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,000
And this one was called Forbidden Times.

148
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,240
It's a topic.

149
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,660
Actually, when Jeff called me up and said,

150
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,240
hey, look, I don't have a program description for what you're going to do,

151
00:07:57,340 --> 00:08:03,120
I looked at my email in front of me, and the first thing up was titled Forbidden Topic.

152
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:05,100
And I said, oh, it'll be Forbidden Topic.

153
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:09,020
But I then actually, well, here, let's see.

154
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,900
Pull the wool over your own eyes.

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,060
You'll still be blind, but your head will be warm.

156
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:15,560
I wish I could remember who said that.

157
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:19,000
Reverend Stang will unveil a new doctrine.

158
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:23,240
A doctrinal clarification, one which will cause great joy and slack to all who hear it.

159
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:26,500
This will be the most empowering subgenius rant ever,

160
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,460
but you may be surprised at just what you're being empowered to do.

161
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,780
Well, the email that I was looking at called Forbidden Topic was actually,

162
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,720
believe it or not, I sort of have a speech writer.

163
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:44,580
There's a friend of mine, young Reverend Onan Canobite,

164
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,320
who is 40 years old now.

165
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:53,160
And I'll always, he was the youngest subgenius at one time.

166
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:57,080
At one time, the oldest subgenius was 37,

167
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:02,700
and we couldn't believe that somebody that old would be interested in this stuff.

168
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,920
That's how long we've been around.

169
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:08,860
That guy, I think, is about 65 now.

170
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:15,360
Anyway, Onan had written a thing that he thought that I could use as a rant.

171
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:18,760
And normally, I try not to, I try to pretend I'm just,

172
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,380
saying this stuff, but I'm going to just read it.

173
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,120
Because it hadn't been around for that long, and it's fairly short.

174
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,060
But, it's great.

175
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,540
The only thing is, I noticed that on the side, in my handwriting,

176
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:33,140
is a note that says,

177
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:39,840
Never have I seen such a huge chip on such a small shoulder.

178
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:44,760
I must have been looking in a mirror or something.

179
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,300
It's hard to remember.

180
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,380
I'm a busy person.

181
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:50,980
I'm going to go get a drink here.

182
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:52,820
Water.

183
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:55,600
The greatest drug next to sleep.

184
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,480
As we have told you time and time again,

185
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,660
the Church of the Subgenius is not here to forgive your sins,

186
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,960
but to rationalize them.

187
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:10,760
What you should also know, is that we're here to condone any avenue of inquiry.

188
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,400
No matter how occult or forbidden a topic may be,

189
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:19,000
you are hereby empowered to jump in with all your might.

190
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:27,580
It is your duty to guide other people's lives.

191
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:34,940
And if you're on your way to发장어

192
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:36,060
Even though the government said you're holy.

193
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,060


194
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,060


195
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:36,580
Just like bless all of us,

196
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:39,000
Thy people will break Your people,

197
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,860
One law of sin,

198
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,380
One law of confession,

199
00:10:47,380 --> 00:10:47,920
Arained from Heaven,

200
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:48,980
Pel就可以 cinema,"

201
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:54,260
comic book readers, there are some comics that are cooler than others. But don't you believe it,

202
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:59,140
friends. If you're old, you'll probably get a kick out of some of these new non-superhero

203
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:05,640
comics where nothing happens. If you're young, you better get to reading about Superman and

204
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:13,080
Spider-Man because there is truth in those comics, moral and philosophical four-colored truth.

205
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:20,900
Truth. Should you ask yourself, should you purchase that item of indulgence, whatever it is?

206
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:31,740
Well, why not? Go ahead, be bi-curious in our vendors room here. You can be very bi-curious,

207
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:36,040
and I hope you are. You already have all the money you're going to need for when you're dead,

208
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,440
and you're going to be dead a lot longer than you're going to be alive,

209
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:42,580
so consider it an investment in eternity.

210
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:50,920
Isn't that sweet? The occult and religion are endlessly fascinating, and there's no reason why

211
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:57,780
you shouldn't adopt all of them as your own. The more contradictory, the better. Behold,

212
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:05,200
the immaterial dialectic. It's a war, friends. It's a war, is what it is. On one side are the

213
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:12,500
cool people, and on the other side are the cool people. It's the subgeniuses that are in the middle.

214
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:21,900
And we say enough of their cool war. We're through being cool, to quote our friends, the divas.

215
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:28,560
And through being uncool. No. Actually, that sounds better that way. And we're through being

216
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,860
uncool. We're through being cool and through being uncool. But I think we do that through being

217
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:43,060
uncool. We cast derision upon the cool ostomy bags of the normals, their designer parasites,

218
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:48,940
of being cool or uncool. It has nothing to do with being a subgenius. What matters is having

219
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:56,760
slack. And the subgenius must have slack. By that, we don't mean, oh, you don't have enough

220
00:12:56,760 --> 00:13:00,600
slack, so you have to join our church and buy all our stuff, and then you'll have slack. You do have

221
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:07,480
to buy all our stuff. But to be a subgenius, by definition, you must already have slack. You must

222
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:12,680
have slack, or you wouldn't even be here. Identifying it, remembering it,

223
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:19,720
appreciating it, that's the trick. You were born with original slack, friends, but the conspiracy

224
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:27,900
distracts you from it with false slack, which might include everything I'm saying right now.

225
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:32,340
I don't know. That's up to you to decide now, isn't it? Who here is hungry?

226
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:40,840
Me. I want some food. Actually, I didn't mean right now. I meant who is hungry ever?

227
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:42,820
See?

228
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:51,440
That's right. Somehow, we were created to have an ever-recurring appetite, but only sporadic

229
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:59,500
access to nutrition. We were somehow created to take in nutrition, but to enjoy the living fuck

230
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:07,640
out of sugar-fried bacon. The deck was stacked against us from the start, friends, so go ahead

231
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:12,980
and eat up while you can. The food chains of the law have been broken.

232
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:20,560
Eat what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law. And, oh children, I know that some of you

233
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:28,600
sometimes might just sometimes think about sex. I don't think I need to say anything

234
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:35,500
more. For the advanced subgenius, there are even more exotic vistas to conquer, such as

235
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:41,960
getting a job, keeping it, then getting a better job, maybe even having health insurance.

236
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:46,980
These are some of the marvelous adventures that await many subgeniuses, friends. You

237
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:54,180
are free. Free, free. You can now, I'm a holy man and I can tell you this, as of this moment,

238
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:59,860
you may do anything you want and will still accept your money.

239
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:11,660
Remember friends, there's no I in Bob. There is an I in subgenius, and that I may be you.

240
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:22,380
The you in us. The us that becomes you when you send 30 U.S. dollars to us and become a

241
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:29,660
minister, an ordained minister. And I happen to have a box of ordainment materials if anybody

242
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:34,560
wants to become an ordained minister. And by the way, this is not, that part of it is

243
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:41,540
not a joke. If it is, a lot of subgeniuses have wasted money on divorces. Because I've

244
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,580
performed a lot of marriages under the auspices of the Church of the Subgenius. The Universal

245
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,980
Life Church also helps.

246
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:53,200
We've got entirely too many troublemakers here. They're a slacker.

247
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,620
I don't remember asking you a goddamn thing.

248
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:04,120
You ain't got no problem, Jules. I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there and chill them

249
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:07,500
niggas out. And wait for the Bible to be coming directly.

250
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:11,340
See ya, negro. That's all you had to say.

251
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:11,520
I'm on the motherfucker. Go back in there and chill them niggas out. And wait for the

252
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:11,520


253
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:12,160
Bible to be coming directly.

254
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,500
This is it. That moment they told us about in high school where one day Bob would save

255
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,020
our lives.

256
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,140
Hey, let's cut to the chase, okay? What are you guys selling?

257
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,020
Church of the Subgenius.

258
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:25,160
All right then. All right then.

259
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,280
Look, Church, you just ran.

260
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,440
Don't touch that. It's dirty.

261
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:33,240
Just because you deny something doesn't mean it isn't true. And let me tell you something,

262
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,720
it's so bad I can't even tell you how bad it is.

263
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,940
Why don't you donate $30 to the cause and maybe it'll make you feel better.

264
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,480
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob,

265
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:44,860
Bob.

266
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,680
Why would you do that?

267
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:56,820
What's this is ours to objectate the Chinese 348 chapters gave tax credit to get you surrounded

268
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:56,820


269
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:56,820


270
00:16:56,820 --> 00:17:03,240
When you get into the subgenius thing, it becomes a somewhat inside jokey. Uh, and

271
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:09,720
I, I, you know, we, in a situation like this, we don't talk about the prairie squids, and

272
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,460
the face fucking bats and the frogs, uh —

273
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,760
and the bleeding head and all that kind of fun church stuff.

274
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,800
But sometimes people ask us about serious issues.

275
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,860
I mean, for some people it really is their religion.

276
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,780
They say, Reverend Stang, is there an afterlife?

277
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,500
The afterlife.

278
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:33,580
The Church of the Subgenius does believe in an afterlife.

279
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,200
It's called death.

280
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:39,020
And what happens after your life? You're dead.

281
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,760
You're dead forever.

282
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:45,720
So friends, if you've got some living to do, get busy.

283
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:53,040
There's a couple of people who aren't here because they died.

284
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,580
Damn it.

285
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:57,020
The war against God is not going that well.

286
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,500
I have to admit, we declared war against God,

287
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:04,340
and we knew at the time that it was the ultimate in folly.

288
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,660
That's why they call it subgenius.

289
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:08,820
Subgenius.

290
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:13,720
Somebody had to do it, but really we're not doing that great.

291
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,960
In the war against God, because people keep dying.

292
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,280
I never could understand that death thing.

293
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:23,560
Now, I'm sort of agnostic about that.

294
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:28,340
If I die and go through a tunnel of glowing light

295
00:18:28,340 --> 00:18:32,040
and see all my friends and loved ones, my mom and everybody on the other side,

296
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,800
then you probably won't hear me complaining.

297
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,880
But if I die and don't...

298
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,460
nothing happens at all, you won't hear me complaining either.

299
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:44,040
To alcohol!

300
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:49,540
The cause of and solution to all of life's problems.

301
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,900
Ah, sweet liquor eases the pain.

302
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,400
I demand a sober detest.

303
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,540
That does it. Go like yourself.

304
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:03,260
I demand a sober detest, cause I ain't been drinking.

305
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:05,120
You can't seriously want to ban alcohol.

306
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,320
It tastes great, makes women appear more attractive,

307
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:11,600
and makes a person virtually invulnerable to criticism.

308
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,800
What did you use?

309
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,960
Uh, douche my canal with whiskey.

310
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,360
Well, whoever told you to do that?

311
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,500
Well, that's the way we do back home.

312
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,620
Well, that's a hell of a use for good liquor.

313
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:22,460
Well, Bob...

314
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,240
What do we do now?

315
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,040
I don't know what you're gonna do, but I got a bottle of whiskey around here someplace.

316
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,040
I'm gonna find it.

317
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,800
Everybody knows I'm just a drunk.

318
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,740
Praise God!

319
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:39,040
Praise God!

320
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,860
Hail God!

321
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,860
Hail God!

322
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,720
Hail God!

323
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:43,960
Hail God!

324
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:49,860
It's been difficult to have an organization of non-joiners.

325
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,180
We do eventually. Eventually they do send in their 30 bucks.

326
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,000
You'd be amazed. I've been making my living doing this,

327
00:19:58,920 --> 00:20:03,580
and not much else, for like 15 or 16 years now.

328
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,880
Of course, then there was 15 years before that of utter hell and working three jobs,

329
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,600
and having five lives.

330
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,860
But now we have this...

331
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:15,200
The church has been around for so long that I run into people who go,

332
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,220
Oh yeah, that Bob stuff. I hate that.

333
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:20,580
My parents made me memorize that crap.

334
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,040
Like I say, we do try to deprogram our own zombies.

335
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:28,540
There's...

336
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,140
Sidion was asking last night about...

337
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,740
Well, he was saying...

338
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:42,020
that the ace should have a more interactive website.

339
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,220
And we know that. That's true.

340
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,580
It's just that we're old and lazy.

341
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:55,420
The subgenius group, on the other hand, does not...

342
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,860
We don't want an interactive website.

343
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:03,800
We use a completely different source, alt.slack, which is a free forum

344
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:06,020
you can look at through Google.

345
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,440
It's been around forever.

346
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,440
It was one of the first news groups on the internet, believe it or not.

347
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,040
I didn't even know what the internet was when alt.slack was created.

348
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,140
But we've learned through the years that there's a certain dynamic

349
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:20,660
of who gets interested in this stuff.

350
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,180
There's those who really get the joke.

351
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,100
There's those who think they get the joke.

352
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:30,180
And then there's the ones who haven't figured out that there's a joke at all.

353
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,780
And they're the scary ones, friends.

354
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,720
You really have to be worried about some of those.

355
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,920
We call them the differently reality persons.

356
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,380
Or the alternately sane.

357
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,760
You're not going to...

358
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,320
I don't want to put down crazy people, because that's my friends.

359
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:54,380
But like I say, we're the funny weirdos making fun of the bad weirdos.

360
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:57,760
And you occasionally see these...

361
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:03,140
Well, I guess you could call them kooks or crackpots on the internet

362
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:07,180
who go on and on and on about reality and the afterlife.

363
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,560
And how they're really God and so forth.

364
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:16,400
I've noticed that the one thing that differently reality persons have on the internet

365
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,120
is that they're all writing for future generations

366
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:24,520
who will be able to see in retrospect what a tremendous unsung visionary

367
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:30,120
that, quote, incoherent kook or, quote, blithering superstitious nutcase

368
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:32,860
actually was in his or her time.

369
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,920
The true alternately sane individual

370
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:37,420
welcomes the reality.

371
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:38,300
And that's the reason why we're so rousing and mocking.

372
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:42,060
Because those wiser future generations will be able to clearly see

373
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,200
how stupid the mockers were

374
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:48,000
and how clairvoyantly brilliant the so-called kook was.

375
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,360
Indeed, the more the kook is mocked,

376
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,320
the more proof that he has that he's ahead of his time.

377
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:58,540
And it's so odd and tragic that the super geniuses

378
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,760
so rarely live to see that marvelous day

379
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:04,440
when their old alt-dot slack posts are hailed

380
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,200
from sea to shining sea

381
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,340
and reprinted in best-selling gold-embossed leather-bound books

382
00:23:11,340 --> 00:23:13,960
while their detractors, namely me,

383
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:19,180
are famous only for having been such unseeing, blinkered,

384
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,980
correct grammar-using fools.

385
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,020
As you can tell, I spend a lot of time on the internet.

386
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,460
Probably a little bit more than is healthy, but, um...

387
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:32,960
Yeah, Bob spelled backwards is still Bob.

388
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:35,740
Hey, every stang I got a new joke for ya.

389
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,920
It's just Bob is what it is.

390
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,880
It's just... It's literally Bob.

391
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,380
By week grown up, week ninny-bong.

392
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,920
Hello, legions of Anonymous.

393
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,060
We are Anonymous.

394
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,760
Over the years, we have been watching Anonymous.

395
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,000
We were there when you took down Anonymous.

396
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,240
We were there when you declared war on Anonymous.

397
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,340
We are the best three heads of the Church of the Subterranean Straits.

398
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:02,580
Bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon.

399
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,260
Bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon, bon.

400
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,640
Hello, you're on the air.

401
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:08,660
F*** you.

402
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:09,580
No.

403
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,720
Oh, did he... Did he try and insult you?

404
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,780
Yeah, that was kind of funny.

405
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:14,760
Kind of cute.

406
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,220
You sat on the phone that long just to get hung up on.

407
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,860
That's what always... That's what never ceases to amaze me about...

408
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:23,180
about these little freaks out there.

409
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,340
See, that's... These are the people that I'm worried about.

410
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,420
The lame ducks of the universe.

411
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:30,480
Well, not the universe, but of this planet.

412
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,120
Those who, um...

413
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,900
walk around on one foreskin and believe that, uh...

414
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:39,540
they're gonna do something by throwing a monkey wrench in.

415
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,760
They're throwing it in the wrong places.

416
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,220
Why throw it at you?

417
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,060
Why throw it at the show?

418
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,560
I don't know. I'm sorry.

419
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,740
Maybe because I annoy them.

420
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,880
Because you know them personally?

421
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,260
Because I annoy them.

422
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:55,340
Which is part of the goal of this program.

423
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:58,520
I am in this to annoy listeners.

424
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,240
I don't have to worry about ratings.

425
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,520
I've gotten to do this for, uh...

426
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:05,460
you know, long enough that...

427
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,140
you know, that...

428
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:09,920
if... if I got kicked off the air tomorrow,

429
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:12,780
and I'd probably have to mess something up pretty bad

430
00:25:12,780 --> 00:25:15,000
in order for that to happen, but if it happened tomorrow,

431
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:16,980
I think I've had a pretty good run.

432
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,980
And, uh... you know what?

433
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,760
That guy who called in to insult me

434
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,500
has probably not had such a good time over the last five years.

435
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:27,760
That's right. This is the ism and the asm of all of it,

436
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:30,100
is that you placed a hair shirt on his shoulders

437
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,120
that he can't get off.

438
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,480
And we're...

439
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,580
Well, he could just change the channel.

440
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:37,960
That seems to escape a lot of these people, but...

441
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,100
Yeah. He could change his M.O. too.

442
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,020
I think that's rather, um...

443
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:45,160
Huh?

444
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,860
I hang out with Bobheads these days sometimes.

445
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:48,480
Bobheads?

446
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:50,120
Bobheads have to go over to whatever it is, uh...

447
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:50,980
You mean like Bobbleheads?

448
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:52,560
No, the Bob's Donuts place.

449
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:52,940
Oh, wait.

450
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:54,680
They're going to a different place.

451
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:55,720
You know two of those Bobheads.

452
00:25:55,900 --> 00:25:56,240
Yes, I do.

453
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,380
They go at all hours and run over at 2-3...

454
00:25:58,380 --> 00:26:00,820
around this time, if you're at Bob's right now,

455
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,720
they crank out different kinds of...

456
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,360
They make a donut this big, just for fun.

457
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,060
Where's this?

458
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,540
In the city of, uh...

459
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:10,380
Bob's Donuts, man. Bob's Donuts.

460
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,700
And is it like a regular glazed donut that big?

461
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:13,300
Oh, it's...

462
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:16,440
It's just a giant donut this high, this big around.

463
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,620
It's the biggest donut you've ever shot.

464
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,820
And these two Bobheads were over there the other night,

465
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,700
and they said about 2-3,

466
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,320
they crank out like one kind of series, like the...

467
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,380
the different kinds.

468
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:26,580
Moonrocks?

469
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,780
Eight or... Moonrocks.

470
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:28,600
Yeah, they do Moonrocks.

471
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,400
They do all those and...

472
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,380
Like Michael Jackson?

473
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,700
Oh, Moonrocks.

474
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:31,960
Oh, baby.

475
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,460
Tons of fresh, greasy, sugary crap.

476
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,280
And all the sugar heads are in there.

477
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,160
Every time I go by, it's hilarious.

478
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,560
Bring it.

479
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,440
Yeah, exactly. It's like...

480
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:38,840
Bring it on.

481
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,160
Nature's perfect food.

482
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:42,200
...of sugar dough heads out the door.

483
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,340
Nature's perfect food.

484
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,400
And I guess they're 24...

485
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,280
Well, maybe they close out, but...

486
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,080
How much is the big donut?

487
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,000
I don't know, man.

488
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,520
I meant to ask, and then I was mesmerized by the chocolate.

489
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,640
More than that, who?

490
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:51,540
Ah, at the...

491
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:51,820
Who?

492
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,920
Who is the big donut?

493
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,140


494
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:54,720
It's just Bob.

495
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:56,500
It's what it is.

496
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:56,960
It's just...

497
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,340
It's literally Bob.

498
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,000
But we don't care,

499
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,700
because there will be some donut that we will find acceptable.

500
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,060
Some...

501
00:27:05,060 --> 00:27:07,700
Yeah, that will pass under the door of the history of donuts.

502
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:09,240
I wish we had a donut now...

503
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:09,520
That's a Finland.

504
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,500
...so we could just, like, telescope what life is going to be like...

505
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:14,280
Donut forsake me, oh my goodness.

506
00:27:14,280 --> 00:27:17,180
We could probably actually have law enforcement deliver,

507
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:18,280
because they could pick up now...

508
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,280
Why don't we have them bring one over?

509
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:21,760
...drive to their house, and then they could drive here.

510
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:22,780
I'm sure they would...

511
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:23,380
Why don't you guys...

512
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:23,900
It's a lot of driving they have to do.

513
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,560
...would you do that for us?

514
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,280
Come back over?

515
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:25,920
They're doing it anyway.

516
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:27,220
They're just driving around, you know.

517
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:27,860
They're just driving around.

518
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,880
There isn't even a lawn here.

519
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:31,440
They don't take care of us like that.

520
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,880
Why would they be into lawns, of course?

521
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,140
We're just protecting and serving.

522
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,920
This is the part where we're talking about we don't need any protection,

523
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:38,040
we need some service.

524
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:38,820
Yeah, exactly.

525
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,220
Service and quality.

526
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,900
And also, we're all on the same team here, you know.

527
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,100
We are all on the same team, you know.

528
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:46,280
They're protecting the streets, we're protecting the airwaves.

529
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:48,220
Yeah, and government...

530
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:51,080
The congressmen take our money to pay you guys.

531
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,620
And we make sure that you don't listen to anything else.

532
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:57,700
They take our personal property, and they give it to you.

533
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,960
Okay, I'm way in the back of your mind now.

534
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,240
They'll protect us.

535
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,740
Don't that tell a story.

536
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,600
And serve us.

537
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:04,120
Yep.

538
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:04,740
Uh-huh.

539
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:11,320
The Redded League by Conan Carthusel.

540
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,480
The Redded League.

541
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,880
I had called upon my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,

542
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:21,980
and found him obese, pompous, and slow, with fiery red hair.

543
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,820
With an apology for my intrusion, Holmes closed the door behind me.

544
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:30,280
Sherlock Holmes puffed out his chest with an appearance

545
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:34,100
of some little pride, and pulled a dirty and wrinkled newspaper

546
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:39,100
from the inside pocket of his greatcoat, as was his habit when in high spirits.

547
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:43,300
The fish that you have above your right wrist is quite peculiar,

548
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:47,520
said Holmes, with his thick red finger planted halfway down the column.

549
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,220
I can deduce nothing else.

550
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:54,300
He was doing something in the cellar, something which took many hours a day

551
00:28:54,300 --> 00:29:00,360
for months on end. I hardly looked at his face. His knees were what I wished to see.

552
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,020
I ejaculated twice.

553
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:03,240
I exclaimed,

554
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,040
Here it is.

555
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,160
Very good,

556
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,620
said Sherlock Holmes.

557
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,660
You could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear Watson,

558
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,940
he said in unfeigned admiration.

559
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:19,480
Holmes chuckled and wriggled in his chair, as was his custom when in judicial moods.

560
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,780
But we also, uh, the church,

561
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:35,300
I did not actually expect this to happen back in 1980 when I first took on the job

562
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,800
as sacred scribe, but it turned into kind of a social club.

563
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:43,960
With cliques, you know, there's the inside circle and the outside,

564
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:48,240
and people get to stay in the big house, and people have to sleep in muddy tents

565
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,760
and brushwood dirt.

566
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:56,100
Which is actually a lot more fun than staying in the trailer, I can tell you that.

567
00:29:56,660 --> 00:29:59,540
But people, I've been asked, now come on,

568
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:02,840
do people really get laid at X-Day?

569
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:08,400
Uh, X-Day is an event we have every July, just before Starwood,

570
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:12,380
where we await the prophesied flying saucers that are going to come

571
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,560
and give all the dues-paying subgeniuses everything they ever wanted

572
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:20,760
and kill everyone we ever didn't like.

573
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,740
We're not going to have to do it.

574
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,080
We're going to let the aliens do it.

575
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,780
We're not that kind of kooks.

576
00:30:25,900 --> 00:30:28,960
But, um, but we really do get together every year.

577
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:34,800
We only do it once a year because, by definition, subgeniuses can't get along with each other for very long.

578
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:36,520
Because they're really weird.

579
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,680
They get on each other's nerves.

580
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:44,980
But they really do, there really have been matings at subgenius events.

581
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:49,300
Uh, marriages have resulted many, many times.

582
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:51,200
Babies, even.

583
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:54,100
Even one-night stands have happened.

584
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:57,960
Uh, and agonizing, horrible divorces and so forth.

585
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,360
I remember quite a few of those.

586
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:11,280
Um, people who have not been laid in ten years can possibly get laid at an ex-day subgenius event.

587
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:12,620
Even if they don't want to.

588
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:22,120
In fact, I'm now thinking of a case in which a person who did not really want to get laid was sort of getting...

589
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:22,760
And it was a guy!

590
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:26,280
You know, you see some strange things.

591
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:26,860
Uh...

592
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,200
And those aren't the videos I'll be showing.

593
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:30,760
Um...

594
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:35,840
Well, I'm actually, I didn't meet my wife at a subgenius event.

595
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,460
I met her at an ace event.

596
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:38,740
Starwood.

597
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,920
Sometimes subgeniuses marry pagans.

598
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:43,480
It's, uh, funny.

599
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:45,440
Then they have these weird little mutated children.

600
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:52,820
Um, I'll admit, the chances of a weirdo getting laid are better at Starwood than they are at ex-day.

601
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,140
Uh, just because there's more people.

602
00:31:55,140 --> 00:32:00,580
If we have two gay cross-dressers at ex-day, there's twenty at Starwood!

603
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:01,440
Okay?

604
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:05,460
It's more like a small company, um, picnic.

605
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,480
You might say.

606
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:13,620
There are plenty of pretty girls and so forth, and half of them are married.

607
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:17,260
And there are more boys than girls.

608
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:20,440
But that's true of any gathering except sewing circles.

609
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,220
Uh, so there's no guarantee.

610
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:29,660
But miracles have happened every year, and the laidless get laid.

611
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:35,360
Don't let your spouse go to Starwood alone.

612
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:39,260
That is a really important message.

613
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:49,800
You do not, no matter how bored you are with all that pagan crap, do not let your new age spouse go alone.

614
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,140
Thanks.

615
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,420
Thank you very much.

616
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,300
Hey, just wait a minute.

617
00:32:57,520 --> 00:32:59,060
You sit right down where you are.

618
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:02,240
Um, what do you think I am, some kind of an organ grinder's monkey?

619
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,680
You put on some music a lady can move to.

620
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:05,840
Achoo!

621
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,000
It says here in this book,

622
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:17,520
The average unmarried female, basically insecure,

623
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,240
Due to some long frustration,

624
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,940
May react

625
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,680
With psychosomatic symptoms

626
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,640
Difficult to endure

627
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:35,980
Affecting the upper respiratory tract

628
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:44,900
In other words, just from waiting around for that plain little band of gold,

629
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:49,020
A person can develop a cold.

630
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:55,400
You can spray her wherever you figure the streptococci like.

631
00:33:55,760 --> 00:34:00,740
You can give her a shot for whatever she's got, but it just won't work.

632
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:05,860
If she's tired of getting that fish eye from the hotel clique,

633
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:10,260
A person can develop a cold.

634
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,940
It says here,

635
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:17,780
The female remaining single,

636
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,600
Just in the legal sense,

637
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,260
Shows a neurotic tendency,

638
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:28,640
See note, see note, note,

639
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:32,760
Chronic organic syndromes,

640
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,880
Toxic or hyper tense,

641
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:39,020
Involving the eye, the ear, the nose and throat.

642
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:47,760
In other words, just from wondering whether the wedding is on a rule,

643
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,960
A person can develop a cold.

644
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:58,500
You can feed her all day with the vitamin A and the bromophiz,

645
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:03,780
But the medicine never gets anywhere near where the trouble is.

646
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:09,300
If she's getting a kind of a name for herself and the name ain't his,

647
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,560
A person can develop a cold.

648
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,080
And faith and more, just installing, installing, installing the wedding trip,

649
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,460
A person can develop blood grip.

650
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:29,600
When they get on the train for Niagara,

651
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,800
And she can hear church bells chime,

652
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:36,060
The compartment is air conditioned,

653
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,840
And the mood sublime.

654
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,540
Then they get off at church,

655
00:35:43,540 --> 00:35:47,320
And it's Saratoga for the fourteenth time.

656
00:35:47,660 --> 00:35:51,440
A person can develop blood grip,

657
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:52,580
Blood grip,

658
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:55,540
Blood post nasal drip,

659
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,180
With the wheezes,

660
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,920
And the sneezes,

661
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,740
And a sinus that's really a pip,

662
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:04,960
From a lack of community property,

663
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,060
And a feeling she's getting too old.

664
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:12,060
A person can develop a burn,

665
00:36:12,060 --> 00:36:14,640
A burning cold.

666
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,960
That one goes out to Mr. Sistar and Son.

667
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,600
That song, Adelaide's Lament,

668
00:36:29,660 --> 00:36:36,140
is from the 1950 stage show of Guys and Dolls,

669
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:40,440
which is a great musical about sin and religion and fun,

670
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:43,120
from the olden days.

671
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:47,560
My mother used to play that album all the time when I was a little kid,

672
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:50,540
and I didn't understand that song at all.

673
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:57,420
But now, an important Lemurian public service announcement.

674
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,480
Whether you drive a shiny new 1952 model or a pre-war jalopy,

675
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:07,840
remember that death is the biggest killer on the highways.

676
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:11,000
This year, 500 lives can be saved,

677
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,660
and 15,000 killed,

678
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:15,240
and 500,000 injured.

679
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,920
It'll be curtains for you.

680
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,640
Now they will never know.

681
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:30,180
If you can't pick up the signal, check all the wire connections are correct,

682
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:32,000
and make good contact.

683
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:37,360
Make sure the copper wire on the coil and the end of the connection block are sanded well.

684
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:41,920
This copper wire is coated in plastic and needs to be sanded.

685
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,540
It will allow a contact to be made.

686
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,620
The diode may be the wrong way around.

687
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,060
Remove it and replace the other way.

688
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:53,400
Check the earth connection is to something metal which is already earth.

689
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,700
Check and move the aerial if necessary.

690
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,980
Extend the aerial with more wire.

691
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:02,660
The signal in your area may be very weak.

692
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:07,260
Remember, experiment with the aerial and have fun.

693
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,680
Open and enter another channel to see what happened in this channel.

694
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,160
Next part, it will be interesting.

695
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:18,180
New content is coming.

696
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:18,180


697
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,920
What a magnificent vista.

698
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:25,040
The entire era, the age of radio.

699
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:28,240
Stretching all the way back.

700
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:32,460
The moment Heinrich HertzAf ready for a taste.

701
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:37,720
He had discovered the presence of radio waves.

702
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:41,840
and demonstrated it conclusively in 1886,

703
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:45,080
the year of that great scientific demonstration.

704
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:52,100
And when they referred to radio ever after,

705
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,860
they said, it really hurts,

706
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,860
named after Mr. Heinrich Hertz.

707
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:03,680
Then they invented the coherer in 1890.

708
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:11,360
Before true coherence was achieved,

709
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:12,780
nothing had been coherent,

710
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:14,220
but after the coherer,

711
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,140
all was congruent and coherent.

712
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,040
Then, in 1901, wireless telegraphy came in,

713
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,660
used by Guglielmo Marconi

714
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:26,620
to transmit a Morse message across the Atlantic.

715
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:34,040
Well, you know, repetitio est mater studiorum.

716
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:35,420
But you're right.

717
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,060
Why repeat?

718
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:38,940
If you weren't listening before,

719
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:42,320
that was your final make-up class.

720
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:47,220
There's not going to be any more help from the office.

721
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:47,740
Thank you.

722
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:51,880
Thank you, Dr. Howell.

723
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,900
We were indeed listening.

724
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:58,800
There was some radio history there from the show,

725
00:39:59,080 --> 00:40:00,900
Puzzling Evidence Show,

726
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,220
from KPFA Berkeley,

727
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:05,680
kpfa.org,

728
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,120
which,

729
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:07,820
which,

730
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:07,820


731
00:40:07,820 --> 00:40:11,180
Puzzling Evidence also has a YouTube channel now,

732
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:12,700
Puzzling Evidence TV,

733
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,260
and the show is archived,

734
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,460
and there are links to that

735
00:40:19,460 --> 00:40:22,820
at Philo Drummond's amazing site,

736
00:40:23,020 --> 00:40:25,520
quiveringbrain.com.

737
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:28,580
Dr. Howell, by the way,

738
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:31,380
does all manner of shows every week,

739
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:33,620
and you can check that out at

740

AskDrHowell.com.

742
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:40,100
D-R-Howell being all one word.

743
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,900
And now, back to the subgenius devival live recording

744
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:47,800
from the Association for Consciousness Exploration's

745
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,220
festival called Winter Star.

746
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,460
It is Valentine's Day,

747
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,000
and I am,

748
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,760
and it is getting kind of late, actually.

749
00:40:57,780 --> 00:40:58,380
I'm going to have to,

750
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,360
I want to show this movie with sound.

751
00:41:00,980 --> 00:41:03,660
But first, you know,

752
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:06,520
now, let me explain.

753
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,140
I'm,

754
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:09,160
into hate.

755
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,120
I know that most people are, you know,

756
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,480
especially if you come to Winter Star,

757
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:15,400
you're kind of new agey and so forth.

758
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,760
Your love is good.

759
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,060
That's, that's as it should be.

760
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:23,160
But subgenius hate is a type of hate

761
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,960
that is so all encompassing,

762
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,820
because our dysfunctional relationship

763
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,140
with the rest of society,

764
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:34,200
I guess, or whatever, I don't know.

765
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,020
You know, it's what makes you a subgenius.

766
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,000
It's so gigantic,

767
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:42,020
that you've reached this stage that we call hate squared,

768
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,220
where it's like the only thing you have left to hate is hate itself.

769
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:50,460
Now that's a good spot to reach.

770
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:53,840
I have to admit that for a long time I was preaching slack,

771
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:55,520
but I wasn't getting slack.

772
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,900
I was an angry young man, and our hate was sincere,

773
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:03,680
but oddly enough, some of that bullshit turned out to be true.

774
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:08,160
I did get slack, and I have to fake my hate now.

775
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,760
So have sympathy.

776
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,560
But let's do a mass marriage.

777
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:14,240
What do you think?

778
00:42:14,740 --> 00:42:17,760
Now listen, it's not what you're thinking.

779
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:21,720
You may be here alone or whatnot,

780
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,080
and we're not saying you have to marry someone of the opposite sex

781
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,640
or even of the desired sex or even another person.

782
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:33,060
You can marry, and I would really suggest this,

783
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:33,660
things.

784
00:42:33,680 --> 00:42:34,900
I'm thinking ahead for later on tonight.

785
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:38,180
You can marry your car keys, your cell phone, your glasses.

786
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,960
You're going to be glad you did later, about 3 o'clock this morning.

787
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,420
And I'm not going to ask you all to stand up either,

788
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,360
because that's slackful.

789
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,160
But if you are next to somebody,

790
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,400
you do get to make out at the end of the ceremony.

791
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:57,340
Oh, yes, by the way,

792
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:01,040
I haven't done one of these mass marriages here in like 10 years.

793
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,660
And some of you,

794
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,000
you may go, oh, God, I've heard this thing a million times.

795
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,140
But it really has been that long since I've done the old subgenius mass marriage.

796
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:14,300
We also do real ones, and those are binding.

797
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:16,280
So be careful.

798
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:22,420
Yes, beloved friends, voyeurs, jealous associates, and any hidden cameras,

799
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:28,360
do you, insert name here, swear to tell the truth, all truth, and nothing but the truth, say yes!

800
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:28,940
Yes!

801
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,180
You know, we can name any time, any amount of time,

802
00:43:33,180 --> 00:43:34,920
because these are short-duration marriages,

803
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,400
just as Bob is a short-duration savior.

804
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:40,820
I don't expect you to remain saved by Bob

805
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:42,740
for more than about five minutes after you leave here,

806
00:43:42,860 --> 00:43:44,800
unless you buy one of our videos or books.

807
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:48,440
But these kind of marriages,

808
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:50,860
usually we make them last for about 24 hours,

809
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:56,440
which means you can get away with anything for the next 24 hours.

810
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:59,020
It's a nice place to get away with anything.

811
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,220
So it'll be 24 hours.

812
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:03,160
Dearly beloveds, we're gathered here today in the presence,

813
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:06,180
in the presence of J.R. Bob Dobbs, whatever form he may choose to take,

814
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,740
and, insert other deity names here,

815
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,020
probably about as many of those as there are people in this room,

816
00:44:12,220 --> 00:44:18,220
to join this man, insert name here, and this woman, insert name here,

817
00:44:18,300 --> 00:44:19,860
or this whatever and this whatever,

818
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:25,640
in a temporary but no less virtuous bondage of holy matrimony,

819
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:28,540
for better or for worse, but praise Bob, not for long.

820
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:30,880
Do you feel the spirit?

821
00:44:31,060 --> 00:44:32,460
Everybody say praise Bob!

822
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,780
I love hearing that.

823
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:39,440
And now this is the time you can start putting your hands on each other,

824
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,800
if you feel so inclined.

825
00:44:42,120 --> 00:44:45,200
Now this is a bond of holy wedlock,

826
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:49,960
so no matter what physical position these beloveds may take in the next 24 hours,

827
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,360
their moral standing shall remain upright.

828
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:59,860
If there are any jealous losers here who feel that these creatures should not be joined temporarily,

829
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,760
not even for a mere 24 hours,

830
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:03,080
just hold your peace,

831
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,400
because we don't want to hear about it.

832
00:45:05,620 --> 00:45:06,480
Before we...

833
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,700
Oh, uh, has the preacher been paid?

834
00:45:10,360 --> 00:45:11,960
We'll worry about that later.

835
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,280
Do you, insert name here, take this thing, insert name here,

836
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,980
to be your lawfully wedded whatever,

837
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,300
in short duration subgenius matrimony,

838
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,260
to have and to hold,

839
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,700
in fact to do just damn near about anything you can think of with,

840
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:29,040
that that he or she or it agrees to do,

841
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:30,260
that's the important part,

842
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:32,240
for richer or poorer,

843
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:35,160
in sickness and in kinkiness,

844
00:45:35,360 --> 00:45:40,620
uh, through any hardship or disaster that may befall that thing in the next 24 hours,

845
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:42,780
for whatever sick and twisted,

846
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,120
but no less blessed reasons for the next 24 hours,

847
00:45:46,260 --> 00:45:47,600
say, I do!

848
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,000
I do!

849
00:45:49,420 --> 00:45:51,520
Now shake on it,

850
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,720
and say, it's a deal.

851
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:54,860
It's a deal!

852
00:45:55,420 --> 00:46:00,400
Every year there's all these people who do like that.

853
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:02,180
I meant shake hands.

854
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:02,660
Shake hands.

855
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,240
Okay, um, if you don't have a ring,

856
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,540
we all have the famous temple of Devo.

857
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,260
This is your, your temple of Devo,

858
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,760
and, uh, it's, um,

859
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,900
we take that ring as a symbol of the holy estate of marriage,

860
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,340
and of the shackles,

861
00:46:19,340 --> 00:46:21,820
the veritable handcuffs of wedlock,

862
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,660
as well as the pole going deep into the hole repeatedly,

863
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,000
and, um,

864
00:46:26,560 --> 00:46:30,040
uh, by the authority invested in me by J.R. Bob Dobson,

865
00:46:30,040 --> 00:46:32,160
in defiance of the law,

866
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:33,460
laws of the state,

867
00:46:33,620 --> 00:46:34,700
and of nature,

868
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,600
I now pronounce all of you

869
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:39,140
man, wife, and thing, or whatever,

870
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:40,940
for the next 24 hours,

871
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,460
you must now

872
00:46:43,060 --> 00:46:44,980
kiss and grope and make out with each other.

873
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:46,480
You are now duly authorized

874
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:49,780
and excused for sexual couplings,

875
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,560
sexual couplings, I repeat,

876
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:56,960
of any perverse, unspeakable kind,

877
00:46:57,180 --> 00:46:59,760
for a period of 24 hours starting right now.

878
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,700
Uh, 10 till 5.

879
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,500
And, uh, friends,

880
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,720
if you don't,

881
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:09,840
you're making a mockery of the holy institution of marriage.

882
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:13,380
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust, it is done,

883
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:18,060
amen, and sir, and a women, and a bunch of yetis praise Bob.

884
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:19,600
And hail Connie!

885
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:22,000
Her way is spreading.

886
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:23,700
That's a new slogan.

887
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:26,540
Hail Connie, her way is spreading.

888
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,160
So, uh, we're not sexist.

889
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,280
We appreciate all the abominatrixes

890
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:35,000
and ovary men and uberfems

891
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,240
and nun snakes.

892
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,640
Oh, as Connie said,

893
00:47:37,980 --> 00:47:42,000
I'll show you everything except mercy.

894
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:47,100
She also, Connie also said,

895
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:50,100
pull yourself up by your own bra straps!

896
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:57,660
Ah, howdy, how's it going?

897
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,720
How's it going?

898
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,000
The loungers.

899
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:04,380
The lounger.

900
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,420
Nowhere in the pages of history can one find the lounger.

901
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,020
Answer!

902
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:12,160
Is this man who is called the lounger the only one?

903
00:48:12,280 --> 00:48:12,460
No.

904
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,280
Yes, the lounger, who is in Crippled Creek.

905
00:48:16,620 --> 00:48:17,460
You mean...

906
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,780
I mean Crippled Creek, in a final attempt to get the lounger.

907
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,900
In this attempt, Anna, I shall fail.

908
00:48:25,340 --> 00:48:30,000
In the meantime, the lounger had been captured in attempts to steal his guns.

909
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:34,900
I can understand a man who is low enough to turn against a Texan.

910
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,000
What about it?

911
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:39,320
Because, as I said, I want to get on top.

912
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,580
A transatlantic telephone call with Joan of Arc.

913
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:44,500
A preview of the Pink Tights.

914
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:48,560
Hello, paisanos!

915
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:53,980
It's Super Mario Super Show!

916
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:56,360
Mario goes boxing!

917
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:59,780
And today I will show you...

918
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:03,940
The song of my users of my items!

919
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:11,320
The people in the cheaper seats clap your hands.

920
00:49:15,460 --> 00:49:17,880
And the rest of you, if you just rattle your jewelry.

921
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:20,860
Hey!

922
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:21,900
Hey!

923
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:23,900
Hey!

924
00:49:24,680 --> 00:49:24,680


925
00:49:24,760 --> 00:49:24,840
Hey!

926
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:25,420
Hey!

927
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:25,600


928
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,440
Hey!

929
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:27,760
Hey!

930
00:49:28,260 --> 00:49:28,560
Hey!

931
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,040
Hey!

932
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:30,600
Hair!

933
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:32,320
Knitting wire!

934
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:32,320


935
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,380
It looks like trash.

936
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,380
Try to find one.

937
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:36,160
What about this one?

938
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:57,220
be Sam는 고 궁금한 치었대

ає

942
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:01,400
Oh, I'm gonna try a little help from my friends.

943
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:10,040
What do I do when my love is away?

944
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:13,020
Does it worry you to be alone?

945
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,180
How do I feel by the end of the day?

946
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,380
Are you sad because you're on your own?

947
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:25,300
No, I get by with a little help from my friends.

948
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:29,320
Get high with a little help from my friends.

949
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:33,220
Oh, I'm gonna try a little help from my friends.

950
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:36,960
Do you need anybody?

951
00:50:38,140 --> 00:50:41,220
I need somebody to love.

952
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:44,560
Could it be anybody?

953
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,160
I want somebody to love.

954
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,160
Would you believe in a love at first sight?

955
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,140
Yes, I'm certain.

956
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:57,240
That it happens all the time.

957
00:50:58,460 --> 00:51:02,080
What do you see when you turn out the light?

958
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:05,040
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine.

959
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,140
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends.

960
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,100
Get high with a little help from my friends.

961
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:17,040
Oh, I'm gonna try a little help from my friends.

962
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:20,460
Do you need anybody?

963
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:24,120
I just need somebody.

964
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:28,840
Could it be anybody?

965
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:33,080
I want somebody to love.

966
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:37,140
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends.

967
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:41,040
Oh, I'm gonna try a little help from my friends.

968
00:51:41,320 --> 00:51:44,960
Get high with a little help from my friends.

969
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:51,120
Oh,

970
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:05,360
Do you want to know why I use a knife?

971
00:52:07,620 --> 00:52:09,000
Guns are too quick.

972
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:14,580
You can't savor all the little emotions.

973
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:24,920
You see, in their last moments, people show you who they really are.

974
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:31,100
So, in a way, I know your friends better than you ever did.

975
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,220
Would you like to know which of them were cowards?

976
00:52:43,580 --> 00:52:44,560
Wouldn't that be enough?

977
00:52:44,580 --> 00:52:46,120
Wouldn't that be enough?

978
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:07,960
A fiery horse with the speed of dust and the hearty Hio Slanger.

979
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:09,760
Please!

980
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:11,440
Please!

981
00:53:12,460 --> 00:53:13,560
Please, mister!

982
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:13,740
Please, mister!

983
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:15,100
What's the matter, Buttons?

984
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,000
I'm making her mad.

985
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:20,260
I don't trust that masked man.

986
00:53:20,440 --> 00:53:21,280
I don't either, darling.

987
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,120
Where are you going?

988
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:22,840
Let's go.

989
00:53:27,620 --> 00:53:28,760
Did you find the wagon?

990
00:53:30,020 --> 00:53:30,600
Come in.

991
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,460
Now, perhaps you'll trust me.

992
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:33,980
Secretly.

993
00:53:34,040 --> 00:53:34,480
Yes.

994
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,480
Don't tell anyone.

995
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:39,020
No offense intended, mister, but I haven't known you long enough.

996
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,560
Well, have it your own way.

997
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:42,160
Adios.

998
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:43,920
But, John.

999
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,480
John.

1000
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:48,640
Then, we must share things.

1001
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,480
The good along with the bad.

1002
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:51,880
Give me a cigarette.

1003
00:53:52,580 --> 00:53:54,080
Yeah, you dumb hasty.

1004
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:54,780
Give me a cigarette.

1005
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:56,700
But I don't understand.

1006
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:58,360
Don't try to understand anything.

1007
00:53:58,460 --> 00:53:59,360
Just give me a cigarette.

1008
00:54:00,120 --> 00:54:01,240
The masked man.

1009
00:54:01,900 --> 00:54:03,200
I wouldn't count on that.

1010
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:04,980
John, take care of her.

1011
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:05,880
Oh, John.

1012
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:11,580
Nice going, John.

1013
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:12,660
Now, tie them up.

1014
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:13,960
Well, Tyler's right, Chose.

1015
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:15,560
That's the important thing.

1016
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:18,500
Well, you outsmarted yourself, Leela.

1017
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,760
It was easy to make a fool out of him.

1018
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:22,500
He's a loner.

1019
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:24,920
I own the land.

1020
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:28,900
You've actually been across to England fairly recently, haven't you?

1021
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:29,480
Yeah, yeah.

1022
00:54:29,520 --> 00:54:31,300
I was thinking about it the other day.

1023
00:54:31,380 --> 00:54:34,640
I've probably spent more time in London than I have in New York City.

1024
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:35,640
Oh, yeah.

1025
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:42,060
Just, we've had a few little tours.

1026
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:42,640
I've been to London.

1027
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:42,640


1028
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:42,640


1029
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:42,640


1030
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:42,640


1031
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:42,640


1032
00:54:42,660 --> 00:54:55,520
London's got, some polite gigantic Vadostown there.

1033
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,340
D'you know the Valdem flaw?

1034
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:56,540
Ah...

1035
00:54:57,360 --> 00:54:57,880
Mammy Bl Lie.

1036
00:54:58,480 --> 00:54:58,540
Mammy Bl Lie?

1037
00:54:58,540 --> 00:54:58,540


1038
00:54:58,540 --> 00:55:05,880
They had those bigишь old sam crashers like you know the O'Galls.

1039
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:07,120
I mean you, I think you, I'm thinking they have them produced by Okay Cass.

1040
00:55:07,140 --> 00:55:08,280
It doesn't, it doesn't work.

1041
00:55:08,660 --> 00:55:12,640
I think the C eyewitness would say, yeah.

1042
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,680
some things. And they ran for office, didn't

1043
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:14,820
they?

1044
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,440
They ran a political party of some sort. That's right,

1045
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,580
yeah, they even got Bob Dobbs

1046
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,400
elected, the Free Party

1047
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,220
they called it. Yeah, I remember seeing that.

1048
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:26,420
If you Google Bob Dobbs

1049
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:28,440
and Free Party, the whole story of the

1050
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:29,500
Brighton Clench

1051
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:32,300
is on there. They pulled off some

1052
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:33,820
amazing stunts.

1053
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,400
And they promised me that

1054
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,540
they were writing a book about it, but I'm

1055
00:55:38,540 --> 00:55:40,060
you know, they're

1056
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:42,340
into slack like the rest of us.

1057
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:44,580
Yeah. I'm not holding my breath for

1058
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:46,560
that. I had a

1059
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,540
great time. I'd never seen anything like

1060
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:50,500
that place. Their laboratory

1061
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,560
was more bobbed up than

1062
00:55:52,560 --> 00:55:53,200
mine is.

1063
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:56,640
They give out stickers. I'm

1064
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,280
about to move to Brighton. My girlfriend lives there.

1065
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:00,600
There's still always Bob stickers all

1066
00:56:00,600 --> 00:56:02,720
over Brighton. Yeah, I started

1067
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:04,500
hearing about these huge raves

1068
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,600
there and I was going, wait a minute, aren't we supposed to

1069
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,320
get a piece of that?

1070
00:56:08,940 --> 00:56:10,540
But I just wish

1071
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:12,500
I could have been there to some of those.

1072
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:14,680
Oh, the Foundry. That's the name

1073
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,680
of the club in London that we've

1074
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:18,140
done two or three shows at.

1075
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:19,780
Yeah. I think that's where

1076
00:56:19,780 --> 00:56:21,920
Jonathan runs the Foundry.

1077
00:56:22,060 --> 00:56:24,720
I think that's where most of the London Revivals are, aren't they?

1078
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:26,660
Yeah. Most of them have been

1079
00:56:26,660 --> 00:56:26,880
there.

1080
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:30,560
Yes, friends, the Foundry. That was

1081
00:56:30,560 --> 00:56:32,300
taken from the British radio

1082
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,580
show right where you

1083
00:56:34,580 --> 00:56:36,700
are sitting now. A great

1084
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,480
show. Look up the

1085
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,660
podcast. You can look

1086
00:56:40,660 --> 00:56:42,480

1089
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:48,680
Home of

1090
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,420
the Hour of Slack and the Church of

1091
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,520
the Subgenius. Well,

1092
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:54,580
except for the part of church in the Subgenius that lives

1093
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,480
in your heart. Before

1094
00:56:56,480 --> 00:56:58,520
that show, we heard some of

1095
00:56:58,520 --> 00:57:00,200
Lee Murr's Lone Sure

1096
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:02,620

00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,720
of NationalCynical.com

1098
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,440
singing with a little help

1099
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:07,600
from my friends.

1100
00:57:08,180 --> 00:57:10,620
And before that, preaching from the Subgenius

1101
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,400
part of Winterstar 09 and

1102
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,100
Praise Bob.

1103
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,460
And now some noise

1104
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,260
from Reverend Sweetness

1105
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:19,980
McGee. Thank you.

1106
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:27,400
Hang on, everybody.

1107
00:57:27,820 --> 00:57:30,480
To all subgeniuses, put your right hand

1108
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:31,520
in the box.

1109
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:33,840
What's in the box?

1110
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,380
Bob, look at

1111
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:38,200
the picture. See

1112
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,480
Bob, the part of

1113
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:42,520
old removed, the masturbation.

1114
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,000
Bob, the radio controls

1115
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:46,380
the Pakistan's broadcasting radio

1116
00:57:46,380 --> 00:57:47,480
and the eyesight again.

1117
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,500
I, the

1118
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:51,120
The first base is

1119
00:57:51,120 --> 00:57:52,020

Czyli.

And happy new month and year.

00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:13,200
Yes, yes, yes.

1140
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:22,720
Yes, yes, yes.

1141
00:59:25,580 --> 00:59:27,360
