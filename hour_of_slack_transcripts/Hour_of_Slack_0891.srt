1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580
Bob?

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,720
Ah, yes, dear friends.

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:07,920
It's rerun time again.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,840
Susie the Floozies.

5
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,700
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse number 51 from 1994.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,200
Praise Susie the Floozy and W-R-E-K in Atlanta.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,060
Praise Bob.

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:30,580
B-O-B-B-O.

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,820
Let the joy jump in the good times roll.

10
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:38,040
Let the pleasure pop.

11
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,280
Now let's take a stroll.

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,200
Light up.

13
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:42,000
Let's all get mellow.

14
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:42,680
Light up.

15
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,240
Get smoke in your eyes.

16
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:45,140
Light up.

17
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:46,720
Get hip, I say, fellas.

18
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:47,600
Light up.

19
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:49,220
Say, what is this job?

20
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:50,040
Light up.

21
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:51,580
Let's all get ready.

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,500
Light up.

23
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,040
I know how you feel.

24
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:54,960
Light up.

25
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,520
Now don't be afraid of me.

26
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,000
You'll find what I mean in any old field.

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:00:59,700
Pop.

28
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,200
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

29
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,560
Blow.

30
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,960
Eight, nine, ten, and then eleven.

31
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:09,720
Light up.

32
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,440
Now get your day going.

33
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,200
Lays up.

34
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,760
I'll say that's the thing.

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:14,620
Light up.

36
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,280
Don't let that man get you.

37
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,500
Just pop on your cig and blow the smoke out.

38
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,620
I may not change my underwear, but I'm changing my ways.

39
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:39,500
Oh, there hasn't been a whole lot of Bob in the Slacktime Funhouse lately.

40
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,820
But now it's battle stations and full speed ahead slack.

41
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,380
Ooh, with the size tension in the air.

42
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:48,900
Whew.

43
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,200
God, it's the reek of future death.

44
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,000
Zooming down on us.

45
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:57,340
This isn't the time to be lulled into warm complacency.

46
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:02,120
Oh, the end times have checked in and they've left an early wake-up call.

47
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:06,840
What does it take to convince you of the signs of the end times anyway?

48
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:09,300
Oh.

49
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,960
The Republican Party and the zombie Jesus slaves of the Christian radical right

50
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,280
have seized power in a bloody coup, which you did little or nothing to prevent.

51
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,040
Oh, think you'll be able to hang on to your precious slack now?

52
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,040
You don't have enough slack to go around now.

53
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:34,380
And they're going to take even that little bit away.

54
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,700
Good luck.

55
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:40,000
Name me one friend you've got left, he said.

56
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,020
Bob, I said.

57
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,080
This was the only lifer in the prison,

58
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,920
the only American to have been convicted of treason during the Korean War.

59
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,340
He was the chief clerk in the supply room where I would soon be given my civilian clothes.

60
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:51,760
He was a science fiction writer of some note,

61
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:54,300
publishing many stories a year under various pseudonyms,

62
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,480
including Frank X. Barlow and Kilgore Trout.

63
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,540
Somebody said, oh, Mr. 666 is way off in the future.

64
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,680
No, my dear friend, he's been around a while.

65
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,820
And he's here tonight.

66
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,940
He's here tonight on the face of this earth.

67
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,700
And all the world is wondering after him.

68
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,800
And that's why this subject is so important.

69
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,500
The deceptions are all around us.

70
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:15,100
Deceptions are saying it's off in the future, it's off in the future.

71
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:15,960
Don't worry about it.

72
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,680
Friends, we better start worrying about it.

73
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,940
And friends, there are some things taking place around us

74
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,680
that's going to come down very, very soon.

75
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,000
Friends, are you ready for it?

76
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,240
Are you ready for it?

77
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,400
I tell you, we're living in serious time.

78
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,020
Look at the signs!

79
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,840
Before basic food groups have been replaced with a pyramid.

80
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:34,160
Isn't that enough to tip you off?

81
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,820
Look at the signs!

82
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:39,920
The new Blue Star ointment commercial no longer mentions tether.

83
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,980
I don't even know what tether is.

84
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,940
They took it away from me.

85
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,400
Look at the signs.

86
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,220
We think we're okay in our little shells, minding our own business.

87
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,080
Standing on the corner of walk and don't walk.

88
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,460
But Seekers, it's time to run!

89
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,520
Quick!

90
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,900
It's not too late.

91
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:01,160
We gotta get some Bob into us.

92
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:04,080
We gotta get some Bob into us.

93
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,820
Bad!

94
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,480
Oh, even if it hurts.

95
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,200
Oh, it will.

96
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,700
It will.

97
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,680
Oh, it's time to read some beads until it bleeds.

98
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,840
The only sensitivity I care about is nerve endings.

99
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,740
Are you serious?

100
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,420
Are you yeti enough to attest yours?

101
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:29,540
So welcome, friends, to Reverend Commandant Susie Der Flusie's Boot Camp for Bob.

102
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:32,580
Today is the first day of your last hurrah.

103
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,320
Hey, you, pink boy!

104
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,920
Drop and give me 20, mister.

105
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,980
The rest of you, you'll have to suffer through these Bob songs.

106
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,360
And don't think you're getting off easy.

107
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:45,700
The hell is just beginning.

108
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,300
She says things I would not dare to articulate.

109
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,420
Well, I'll simply say this.

110
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:58,660
If that is true, why so many of them get injured in the very act?

111
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,040
Why are some of them killed in the act?

112
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:04,140
And why do so many of them have to have colostomies?

113
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,700
Good times.

114
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:06,340
You!

115
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,080
You're one of us!

116
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:08,940
Maybe you're one.

117
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,440
Something to be outright laughed at.

118
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:16,680
I heard someone over here say who's been the most effective evangelist the last 20 years.

119
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,360
His name is Bob.

120
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,720
And why, listen, listen, wait, listen, look at me.

121
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,260
Listen, wait, wait, wait.

122
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:24,020
While he entertains you, he indoctrinates you.

123
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,220
While he entertains you, he gets through to you.

124
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,500
While you laugh, you begin to lose automatically.

125
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,800
I met Bob when he came in the door, when I came in the door to service today.

126
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,660
And Bob was formerly bound by the powers of darkness to a terrible degree.

127
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:38,520
Oh, whatever.

128
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,000
He says he gets a funny feeling down inside when he sees the Boy Scouts and the YMCA.

129
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,840
Thank you very much.

130
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,840
And they were doing these crazy things.

131
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,700
Of course, that's just the start.

132
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,540
Thank goodness that, you know, nobody I knew was there because I thought,

133
00:05:53,620 --> 00:05:55,640
Bobby, I'm never going to another one of these as long as I live.

134
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:58,580
I mean, you know, and he was a little nervous, too, when they grabbed his hand.

135
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,600
You know, it was like, this is not what we're used to.

136
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,340
What we learned a long time ago is that you become what the people you associate with.

137
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,880
And so he started associating with people in this business.

138
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,120
And I began to see the changes.

139
00:06:08,260 --> 00:06:09,960
You know, Bobby was a good person and a good guy.

140
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:13,000
But I started seeing the change of staying away from the people that he was hanging around with

141
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,400
and looking forward to the future.

142
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:17,160
And so I started getting a glimpse of what this business had to offer.

143
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:20,400
So will all you goonie birds answering this description please stand up.

144
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,920
You misfits in this brave new age.

145
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:26,940
You dismally disorganized, improperly apologetic ghosts of the past.

146
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,080
Stand up. Stand up and be counted.

147
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:20,560
To healthcare experts his near-death experience

148
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:20,680
You

149
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:26,880
And now it's time to bring up the headliner of the evening, a very special gentleman.

150
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,660
Please welcome to the stage, Bob.

151
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,340
Bob!

152
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:48,260
Last night my baby wanted to talk to me about art.

153
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:55,620
But I said no, no, let's just close our eyes and watch.

154
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,420
Bob!

155
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,100
Hi, Bob.

156
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,460
I like to get mail, of course, but for some reason I get the strangest kind of mail,

157
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,040
and these are all real letters I'm reading you.

158
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,440
Every one, I assure you, has come in in the mail from someone I don't know.

159
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:15,000
To give you an idea of what the people think of the show and what they like to say in their communications.

160
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,540
Dear Bob, before I tuned in your program,

161
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:18,240
I could never get through to you.

162
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:19,520
I had to get my husband out of bed in the morning.

163
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,880
Now he can't get out of the house fast enough.

164
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,460
Why don't you give up?

165
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,000
Why can't you act like normal people?

166
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,160
Why don't you stop whistling?

167
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:29,080
Why don't you stop acting like a moron?

168
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,840
Or maybe you aren't acting.

169
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,120
Yes!

170
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,200
That's all I'm taking from you.

171
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,340
Get back here, you devil!

172
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:37,960
He's gone!

173
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,120
He's gone!

174
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,260
Find him!

175
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,100
Find him!

176
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:41,740
Find him!

177
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,760
Find him!

178
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:45,980
Oh, yeah.

179
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:47,960
That old slack man.

180
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,520
I wanted to know this thing,

181
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,520


182
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,520


183
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:48,520


184
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,000
And are you?

185
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:56,840
And look!

186
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:56,840


187
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,100
back up now!

188
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:01,380
It's so freezing, Bob!

189
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:04,260
What's wrong, Bob?

190
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,540
Hey!

191
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:05,840
Oh!

192
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,380
I've got it!

193
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:13,820
Johnny,

194
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,340
God

195
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:14,960
Hey,

196
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:18,240
what's up there?

197
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,240


198
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:18,240


199
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:26,300
people have a show called Bob's Slacktime Funhouse. They often say, who's Bob? Well,

200
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:32,020
that certainly separates a wheat from the chaff now, doesn't it? Oh, I like to think that you

201
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:39,140
all know Bob, at least those of you who matter. But don't fool yourself into thinking that that

202
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:46,440
puts you any higher up in the food web because of it. Oh yeah, here at the funhouse, it seems like

203
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:53,820
we've lost our grip on Bob. We gotta latch onto his pipe and pull him down off the ceiling and

204
00:09:53,820 --> 00:09:57,740
bump his stomach and get him into fight and trim because he's our only hope.

205
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:09,680
I want you to get to know Bob personally. If you don't already, those of you who don't know Bob,

206
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:16,120
my heart sings like the prairie squid in rutting season for you at the joy you're about to

207
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,420
experience.

208
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,340
Oh, and those of you who have forgotten Bob,

209
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:28,720
by, by upon thee, wake up. It's time to cover your ass, kids. Don't be a pink boy.

210
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:38,220
Pinks are like sponges that don't work. You, you subgenius tides, yeah. You, on the other hand,

211
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:45,520
soak in this. I want to give you a close encounter with Bob and his amazing life.

212
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:54,520
His precocious youth, his early careers in sports and salesmanship, and his hot, hot linkage with

213
00:10:54,520 --> 00:11:01,280
Connie, his first and primary wife. And all through the wonders of our patented sub-g-liminal

214
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:09,520
hypnognostic brain ventilating system. I want you to take the fronts off of your speaker seekers.

215
00:11:10,460 --> 00:11:15,500
There. Yeah, now, now, put your head in the speaker cone. No, no, no, not, not that way.

216
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:15,500


217
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:24,140
The big one. Yeah. Okay, reach over. Yeah, you can still barely reach now. Turn that dial up to 11.

218
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:34,340
Or lethal, if you have it. And I want you to feel the slack pouring over you like drug tapping,

219
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:44,340
saturating you with pure Bob land. Meanwhile, I'll just notch up your pain meters a little bit.

220
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,460
Ha ha ha!

221
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:45,840
Ha ha ha!

222
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:02,900
Once upon a time, there was Bobby. Bobby was a boy who drank milk. He drank milk in the morning,

223
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:07,020
he drank milk at noon, he drank milk before he went to bed. And where do you think all that

224
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:11,720
milk came from? Well, that milk had a long journey. For once upon a time, there was Bobby,

225
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:14,100
and once upon a time, there also was...

226
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:17,640
Do you hear them?

227
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:26,440
Yes, there also were five cows, five cows, five cows. They didn't like to wait, but came and moved

228
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:33,580
at the farmer's gate. Five big cows. The farmer came when he heard them call and led each one into

229
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:37,860
her stall. Now I must milk them one and all to get the milk for Bobby.

230
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,380
The five cows were Daisy and Squirrel and Queen and Lady and Buttercup. When they were in the barn,

231
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:50,300
the farmer took his stool and big pail and sat down to milk. Squirt, squirt, the milk poured into the

232
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:54,240
pail. And when the five cows had given all their milk, the farmer let the cows wander out of the

233
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:58,820
barn and into the pasture again. There they ate the green grass and forgot all about the milk.

234
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:03,260
But the milk had only just begun its journey. For once upon a time, there was Bobby,

235
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,700
and once upon a time, there also was...

236
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,500
Do you hear it?

237
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:14,620
Yes, there also was a wagon, a wagon with a horse,

238
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,840
whose rubber shoes clipped off each time he started, each time he stopped.

239
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:24,360
A milk wagon! And the milkman said, my work is done before most other works begun.

240
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,100
From house to house, I hurry on to bring the milk to Bobby.

241
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:34,420
The milk wagon came down the street until it stopped at Bobby's house. The driver jumped out

242
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,880
and put down the bottles Bobby's mother had ordered. Then he drove away and forgot all about

243
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:43,500
the milk. But the milk still went on with its journey. For after the milkman went away, Johnny's

244
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,600
mother ran downstairs and...

245
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:44,780
All right, that's the milk that jumped the Romanian cow, Naomi.

246
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:44,780


247
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:44,780


248
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:44,780


249
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:47,400
And when he opened the door, there stood the milk bottles.

250
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:52,340
The milk from the cows who couldn't wait, But said moo moo at the farmer's gate.

251
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,880
The milk in the trucks that couldn't stand still, But went a-hawking down the hill.

252
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,420
The milk on the train that carried the freight, And clickety-clackety, couldn't be late.

253
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:03,000
The milk where the factory whistle blew And said now, there is work to do.

254
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:06,820
The milk that went where the horse could flop, Each time he started, each time he stopped.

255
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:10,800
The milk from the bottle that opened up, And mother poured into Bobby's cup.

256
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,880
Don't call me Bobby.

257
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,700
The milk slipped and slid down Bobby's throat,

258
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,080
and so turned into Bobby.

259
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,060
And so at last, the milk ended its long, long journey.

260
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:34,720
Your commentator was privileged to visit Space Platform 7 last week.

261
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:39,780
And before Cadet Bobby and Cadet Betty went into pre-lunar medical quarantine,

262
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,720
I interviewed them.

263
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:47,560
These telememory tapes will introduce you to these two exceptional youngsters.

264
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:49,260
Cadet Bobby.

265
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,700
Don't call me Bobby.

266
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:59,620
Bob, are you and Betty worried at all about your lunar adventure?

267
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,500
Not really, Doctor.

268
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,740
We've been thoroughly checked out on our space shuttle craft,

269
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:08,060
and of course, adults have made thousands of such trips.

270
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,760
After all the years of...

271
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:13,260
training, I suppose it's really a great thrill.

272
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:14,800
It certainly is.

273
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:18,240
Bob, of course, studied 18 months longer than I.

274
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,000
Bob, where have you trained?

275
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:25,540
Well, I had calculus and logarithms in elementary school in Washington, USA.

276
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,840
Then I spent one year in the Space Flight Center at Houston, USA.

277
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,060
Another year in Moscow on advanced power and propulsion systems.

278
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:37,980
Six months in England at the Academy of Celestial Navigation,

279
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:39,460
and then back to Houston.

280
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,460
I went to the University of Michigan for advanced computer technology.

281
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:46,480
I had just about the same program, except for the fuels and propulsion.

282
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,220
The girls just don't seem to take to the engineering courses.

283
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:54,880
Well, you kids have spent six months here,

284
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,920
50,000 miles from Earth on Space Station number 7,

285
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:05,060
and now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the Moon.

286
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,080
Goodbye.

287
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,600
Goodbye.

288
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,240
And thanks to all of you.

289
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,380
And thanks to all of you.

290
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:09,760
And thanks to all of you.

291
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:18,940
And thanks to all of you.

292
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:19,360
Release Flight!

293
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:20,700
LOL

294
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,800
I think it was just a matter of time.

295
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,800
After all when we were growing up, Bob had a huge supply of Playboys underneath his bed.

296
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,980
His dad had a subscription.

297
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:35,120
Bob dearly loved those Playboys, if I recall.

298
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:37,780
klob circle

299
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:40,740
O

300
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:42,660
B

301
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:45,800
He said, do you know the story about Bob?

302
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:49,640
And I said, well, Coach, the only thing I can tell you, he looks like Mr. Clean.

303
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,080
I mean, he's the largest thing I've ever seen since a Big Mac truck.

304
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:59,120
He is about 225, 230 pounds, packs arms the size of my thighs.

305
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,960
A huge, huge man.

306
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:05,000
This is my friend and colleague, Texan.

307
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:05,960
Howdy there.

308
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,520
I didn't catch your name, mister.

309
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:37,460
I'm Mr. Clean.

310
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,360
He interviews in his letters.

311
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,640
No, he's, you know, not retarded.

312
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,900
I mean, I've talked to the man, and he's pretty quick.

313
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:49,580
But for some reason, you kind of get that impression sometimes.

314
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,700
I don't know, maybe he just like, you know, when he goes into create,

315
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:59,400
it's like somebody playing a musical instrument or driving a car.

316
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,640
They kind of go into that zen state of retardedness

317
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,260
where if they were neurotically trying to,

318
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,900
you know, do something, specifically,

319
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,680
you can't drive a car if you're totally concentrating on it.

320
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,400
You'll go nuts.

321
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:21,180
It's like being, you know, that's the way you are when you're learning to drive.

322
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,060
At the same time, he's kind of nuts.

323
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,880
I mean, he's kind of a nutty guy and eccentric.

324
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,580
I mean, he's not Hugh Beaumont.

325
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,000
He's definitely not Mr. Normal.

326
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,280
Then neither am I.

327
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:39,640
BEEPING

328
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:43,980
Your secrets belong to him

329
00:18:43,980 --> 00:18:46,060
You're at his beck and call

330
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:52,500
You feel his hot breath down your neck

331
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,620
Your skin begins to crawl

332
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,940
He knows your life

333
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:02,580
The things you think no one knows

334
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,000
BEEPING

335
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,500
He has a lot of secrets

336
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,320
He has the files

337
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:10,340
But you know he won't show

338
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:12,740
The eyes are everywhere

339
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:15,240
It's the electric stare

340
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:18,960
No one's there but the face in the window

341
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,580
And when you think he's gone

342
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:23,580
Read your curtains draw

343
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:27,340
His red eyes on the face in the window

344
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,540
BEEPING

345
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:29,540


346
00:19:31,540 --> 00:19:32,380
BEEPING

347

bob

391
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:28,640
ah it it appears to me that you don't need much motivation but i'm going to use it anyway

392
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:36,640
i think probably this is true bob isn't it true then unless you have found your field

393
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,500
in life the thing that you want to do isn't it true that you frequently think of what

394
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:45,040
you are best suited for and if you can only find out what he's best suited for he would

395
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,580
work 18 hours a day i assure you he would study he would self-discipline himself he's

396
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:51,540
stopped fooling around enough things to worry about too and i got to tell you that bob and

397
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:55,320
that you are. I'm just using that as an example. I'll tell you what you're best fitted for.

398
00:21:55,840 --> 00:22:01,520
How do you like that? Now, Bob, if you could ever believe this, you'd just jump out of

399
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:06,480
your skin. I guess you're jumping now, aren't you? Bob, you are best fitted for anything

400
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:11,360
you want to do. Anything. I don't care about your past education. I don't care a thing

401
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:16,540
of your past. You're best fitted for anything. You know this theory that's been known since

402
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:25,920
the beginning of time, that we are what we think. I'm Bob, and this year is my place.

403
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,840
Excellent. Christ.

404
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,000
Ooh, you want to kill me?

405
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,720
I don't think that's a wise thing, not a wise thing to do. Do you really think that

406
00:22:52,720 --> 00:23:01,540
you can't even see him? You will feel him, and if you're dreaming that you can take him,

407
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:03,880
I don't think that's a very wise thing to do.

408
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,520
Ooh, ooh.

409
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,260
Ooh.

410
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:11,720
Ooh, ooh.

411
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,340
Uh-oh.

412
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:16,520
You know who that is?

413
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:22,620
That's right. It's your pal, Bobo the Clown. Yay!

414
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,480
Hey, Bobo. Want to play a game?

415
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:36,100
Okay. Look up. Look down. Now look at Mr. Frying Pan.

416
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,300
Uh-oh. Bobo, fall down. Go boom.

417
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,100
Ooh.

418
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,300
Wake up.

419
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:51,180
Oh, Bob. Wake up.

420
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,200

421
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,840
Boo!

422
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,420

423
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,680

424
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,800

425
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:05,200

426
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:05,780

it's on every station get a trace on that signal now

432
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,340
the other officers quickly take up the slack

433
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:37,740
that's how big it was it could be seen for miles and miles around now here's the king's command

434
00:24:37,740 --> 00:24:42,960
i'm going to command all these musicians to start playing their musical instruments and as soon as

435
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:47,600
they start playing the music you are to fall down and bow down in front of that great image 90 feet

436
00:24:47,600 --> 00:25:02,940
high and pray to it i'm not giving in to a smile or a grin on a face i might never see again

437
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:11,520
i'm not gonna fly in some big phony sky

438
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,940
on a

439
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:28,800
yes bob you rang am i a lousy picker whatever i analyze it and assess it thoroughly and then

440
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:34,380
i make my prediction on the air and i pick the opposite me too i stand on my record

441
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:42,640
but one thing i shared with you this afternoon is that bobby didn't listen to me and i'm

442
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:42,940
thankful for you and i'm thankful for you and i'm thankful for you and i'm thankful for you

443
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,120
and i'm thankful for you and i'm thankful for you and i'm thankful for you and i'm thankful for you

444
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,080
now that he didn't and hopefully if you've got a negative spouse you're not listening to them

445
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:50,020
either because he didn't listen to me and he went about and built the business because he saw

446
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:55,660
something in it a friend of his or acquaintance of his had shown him the plan and i won't bust

447
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:00,780
his bubble that's his part of the story well mr stang it was an almost foolproof plan but let us

448
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:10,900
look to the next paragraph of prophecy which says dateline for dominance 1991 first paragraph and i

449
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:11,260
quote

450
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:22,320
world war three church of the subgenius shifts into operation removal end quote

451
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:29,560
now admittedly dear friends that leaves open some room for interpretation and just what is

452
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:40,300
operation removal designated to remove when knowing bob he'd want to remove the very concept

453
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:42,920
of removal i suppose i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to do that i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to do that

454
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:47,000
i suppose bob told you that his plan has been approved and recruiting is about to open you once

455
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:51,100
offered to help us find the right sort of recruits how many men do you need i thought you'd say that

456
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:57,320
we'll need 1100 men to begin with i'm in this thing any way you can use me looking forward to it mr stang

457
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,520
hi i'm bob hi are you famous

458
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,040
yeah

459
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,780
see i saw this program that i'm talking

460
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:19,280
about tonight some seven years ago seven years ago when i saw this program i folded my arms across

461
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:26,260
my chest i crossed my legs and then i looked at that guy that was talking about this program

462
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:34,200
and i said no way whoever this joker is whoever's up there he's always grinning i thought why was he

463
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:41,320
always grinning it never dawned on me because he is so doggone rich being broke is not a good deal

464
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,380
but he looked at me he says

465
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,880
ow whatever you do you're gonna like area three

466
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:51,740
he says as a matter of fact judging from the first two areas you'll probably want to be involved in

467
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:57,860
area three and i was committed and convinced that area three looked good and then he spelled it out

468
00:27:57,860 --> 00:28:09,840
to me d e a d dead fantastic i'll talk like this bubs your uncle mate that really doesn't help bob

469
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,380
um

470
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,780
you're getting the slack

471
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,140
and all you get the back slim

472
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:30,540
well that would have to have been last fourth of july was very hot out oh so hot it was just

473
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:35,520
blazing and i was at the youth group picnic minister bob was there in his bermuda pants

474
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:42,220
they cover more legs than his bermuda shorts you see and they're just a little bit tighter in the

475
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:42,920
back they just don't fit in the back of the shorts they just don't fit in the back of the shorts

476
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:44,940
so i'll get buns in the cutest way but anyway

477
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:52,180
i was slicing some rice crispy squares i had made and minister bob was filling cups of the punch bowl

478
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:58,200
with his ladle it was the biggest ladle i'd ever seen

479
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:04,340
i wanted to touch it but i was afraid to because it was so abnormally large

480
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:09,500
as i watched him with that ladle he kept dipping it into the bowl and pouring punch

481
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:12,860
and dipping and pouring and dipping and pouring

482
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:15,640
and dipping until all the cups were filled.

483
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:18,220
It didn't take long because that was some big ladle.

484
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,280
And then suddenly, violently, there was a shudder.

485
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,120
My buttocks were tingling.

486
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,320
I was alone, lost in space.

487
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,280
I saw him toss that ladle aside, his arm exhausted.

488
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,920
I must have passed out because that's all I remember.

489
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:32,100
You may call me Connie.

490
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:34,600
You did what was doing the storm, remember?

491
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,740
You said, all right, Connie, we might as well go down together.

492
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,960
I like the way you said Connie.

493
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,240
Connie, it was like a punch in the door.

494
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,800
Now, what's going to happen?

495
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:47,320
Do you know that's breaking the second commandment?

496
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,940
Because Babylon was the head of witchcraft, sorcery, fortune tellers.

497
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:52,480
Notice that.

498
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:56,360
When the music starts playing, you're to bow down and worship the great image.

499
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:00,020
Night and day, you are the one.

500
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:04,660
Only you beneath the moon and under the sun.

501
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:09,040
Whether near to me or far.

502
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:14,880
It's no matter where you are.

503
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,560
I think of you.

504
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,480
Night and day.

505
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:27,580
And I won't tell you, I jumped in with both feet and started listening to tapes and reading books because I didn't.

506
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,060
I had to read lots of books, lots and lots of books.

507
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,060
And sometimes you're going to pick up a book in the beginning and you're going to read it and you're going to think,

508
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,140
I can't finish this.

509
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,200
This book is too heavy.

510
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,960
And you're going to put it down and a couple of years later, a couple of months later,

511
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,500
you're going to pick up that book and all of a sudden it's going to slap you in the face.

512
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:44,700
Hello, Connie.

513
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,100
Bob, I'm so glad.

514
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,120
You're glad.

515
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:51,140
How do you think I feel?

516
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,600
You're just as good as new again.

517
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,180
Stop kidding.

518
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,080
Why are you kidding?

519
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:58,380
In high society, I just ain't the type.

520
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:01,840
Folks all look so surprised when I light my pipe.

521
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:02,760
Oh, yeah.

522
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,720
Do you smoke a pipe, too?

523
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:10,780
No.

524
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:11,660
Don't be coy.

525
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:12,500
I like it, too.

526
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,260
What's it going to get you, Connie?

527
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:22,420
All this business of filling my pipe, pouring my drinks, corned beef and cabbage?

528
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:25,620
I suppose I should pretend that I don't know what you mean by that.

529
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,740
But I won't.

530
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:29,700
Connie, look, for the past few days, all you've done is...

531
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:30,580
All I've done is what?

532
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:33,660
Well, is to tell a man in a thousand little ways.

533
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,420
To tell what man in a thousand little ways?

534
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:38,360
Well, not with words, maybe, but with looks, actions and...

535
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,160
Aren't you ashamed?

536
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,420
All right.

537
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:40,940
Maybe you should say, I'm not.

538
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:40,940


539
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:40,940


540
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,600
A partner in sin?

541
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,500
There was an influence there.

542
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:50,140
Sometimes there is a mood that just...

543
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,640
We don't know why.

544
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:54,020
You wouldn't get a pal, would you, Connie?

545
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:55,760
Or yourself, maybe?

546
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,240
I don't know yet, Bob.

547
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,180
Hello, children.

548
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,100
Oh, here we are, Doc.

549
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,320
The two lovebirds.

550
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,520
I'm all ready for the wedding.

551
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:12,340
Sit down.

552
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,640
Are we healthy enough to get married?

553
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:17,060
Yeah, both as solid as a new dollar.

554
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,760
That first baby didn't hurt you a bit.

555
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,800
You can have a dozen more if you want to.

556
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:27,280
And, Bob, you'll be pleased to know that there's no trace of your old V.D.

557
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,280
One hundred percent sure.

558
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,280
What did you say about a first baby?

559
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,820
You've been married before?

560
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:34,900
Doctor, what did you call it?

561
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,140
V.D.?

562
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,620
You mean to say that Bob has actually had one of those horrible diseases?

563
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:41,520
That isn't true, Doctor.

564
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:43,680
Is that true, Bob?

565
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,980
All right, if you must know, I did have it.

566
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:48,420
But it's no worse than having an illegitimate child.

567
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,700
I think it is.

568
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,520
Why, I'd sooner marry a leper.

569
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:56,260
Thank you for letting me know about this in time, Dr. West.

570
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,840
And now I'm going out into the clean, fresh air.

571
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,040
Well, there went my happy wedding right out the door.

572
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:07,720
I'm terribly sorry, Bob.

573
00:33:14,520 --> 00:33:15,080
Okay, let's get going.

574
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:15,680
You'll be a double.

575
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:19,240
Just grab it by the scalp shaker up and down a bit and chop off the slack.

576
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,180
Come on.

577
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,000
Damn, this streaking out pit.

578
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:25,060
We'll finally blame it on God.

579
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:29,020
And there'll be some kind of church started called the Streaker's Church.

580
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:32,800
And, Bob, they'll just, they'll follow, try to make it religious.

581
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:37,260
But I want to tell you it's abominable and it's filthy and it's rotten.

582
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,980
And then I'll stand up against it and say amen.

583
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:40,740
more show

584
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,440
the pipes

585
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,720
we need a

586
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:44,420
jolly life

587
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,300
jolly life

588
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,200

589

00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:50,680
we drink the

595
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,060
best

596
00:33:51,060 --> 00:33:51,920
no's wrong

597
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:52,660
no's wrong

598
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,440
I'm glad that

599
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,560
this gay life

600
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,520

601
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:56,800
fear the name

00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,340

beef

608
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,540
or chemistry

609
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,980
fear the name

610
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,980

john ad

628
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:15,900
if you understand

629
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:16,800
that we

630
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:17,880
have all had

631
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,460
a partner

632
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:19,000
in sin

633
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:19,960
you really

634
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:20,600
didn't do it

635
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:21,080
by yourself

636
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:21,980
there was an

637
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:22,640
influence there

638
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,280
now we shop

639
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,120
at neiman marcus

640
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:27,580
instead of

641
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:28,460
k martin sears

642
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:29,420
we go on

643
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,020
neiman marcus

644
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:30,840
and as soon as

645
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,460
they spotted us

646
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:31,800
and I was there

647
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:32,440
last year

648
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:33,500
they said

649
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,100
hi bob

650
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:34,700
and bonnie

651
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,520
how are you

652
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,020
they remembered

653
00:34:36,020 --> 00:34:36,300
us

654
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:37,080
and so on

655
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,360
the back

656
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:37,800
they take you

657
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:38,220
in the back

658
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:38,520
and they have

659
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,260
drinks for you

660
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:39,540
whatever

661
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:39,920
it is

662
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:40,840
scotch

663
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:41,100
whiskey

664
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:41,660
whatever you

665
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:41,900
want

666
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,720
and I ask

667
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,300
for the usual

668
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,280
if you drink

669
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:53,040
five gallons

670
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:53,660
of gatorade

671
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,740
you're gonna

672
00:34:54,740 --> 00:34:55,500
expend five

673
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:56,100
gallons of

674
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:56,540
gatorade

675
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:56,940
somewhere

676
00:34:56,940 --> 00:34:57,640
in one of

677
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,100
these restaurants

678
00:34:58,720 --> 00:34:59,700
you buy that

679
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:00,000
right

680
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:00,680
frankly

681
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,240
either way

682
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:01,500
it's

683
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:01,880
something

684
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,800
that's

685
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:03,140
a lot

686
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:03,320
of

687
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:03,520
time

688
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:04,320
to

689
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:04,900
drink

690
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,100
it

691
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:09,520
it's

692
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


693
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


694
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


695
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


696
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


697
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


698
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


699
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


700
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


701
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


702
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


703
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


704
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


705
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


706
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


707
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


708
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


709
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


710
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


711
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


712
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:09,520


713
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:39,520


714
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:44,460
not just

715
00:35:45,840 --> 00:35:46,480
a drink

716
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:46,920
it's a lot

717
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:46,920


718
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:46,920


719
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:46,920


720
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:46,920


721
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:46,920


722
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:46,920


723
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:46,920


724
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:46,920


725
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:46,920


726
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:46,920


727
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:46,920


728
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:46,920


729
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:47,400
have to be

730
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:47,760
careful

731
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:48,440
and you always

732
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:48,900
think about

733
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:49,620
you know

734
00:35:49,620 --> 00:35:50,320
getting poop

735
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:50,940
on the finger

736
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,320
you know

737
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:53,040
and I remember

738
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,660
the first time

739
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,080
it happened

740
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,080
I couldn't

741
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:55,540
believe it

742
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:56,720
I mean

743
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:56,980
it's like

744
00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:57,740
oh my

745
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,240
god

746
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:00,540
I've got

747
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,060
poop

748
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:01,460
on my

749
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:01,900
finger

750
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,100
and then

751
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:04,520
I started

752
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:04,940
thinking

753
00:36:04,940 --> 00:36:05,660
to myself

754
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,660
it could

755
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:07,120
be worse

756
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,340
I could

757
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:08,880
have a job

758
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,820
I don't

759
00:36:17,820 --> 00:36:17,920
think

760
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,520
I can't

761
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:18,820
I just

762
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:19,120
can't

763
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:19,380
do it

764
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:19,740
and I said

765
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:19,880
Bobby

766
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,100
please

767
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:20,500
don't ever

768
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:20,800
make me

769
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:21,040
do that

770
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,220
again

771
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:22,220
don't

772
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:22,460
call me

773
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:22,720
Bobby

774
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,020
no

775
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:24,460
Connie

776
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:24,760
no

777
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,680
call me

778
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,920
call me

779
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:29,340
dear

780
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:30,920
don't

781
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,340
ever

782
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:32,580
ever

783
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:33,060
go

784
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,380
you're

785
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:34,600
my

786
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,120
guiding

787
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:37,080
light

788
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:38,960
each

789
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,280
and

790
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:39,760
all

791
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:40,180
oh my

792
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:40,620
god

793
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:41,080
no

794
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,380
Connie

795
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:41,700
no

796
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:43,720
night

797
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:45,620
and day

798
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,200
under the

799
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:47,620
height

800
00:36:47,620 --> 00:36:48,600
of me

801
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:49,720
there's

802
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,180
oh such

803
00:36:50,180 --> 00:36:50,640
a hungry

804
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,200
yearning

805
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:51,720
burning

806
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:52,120
inside

807
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,020
of me

808
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,200
and the

809
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:54,760
storm

810
00:36:54,760 --> 00:36:56,080
and won't

811
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,860
be through

812
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:58,820
do you

813
00:36:58,820 --> 00:36:59,720
let me

814
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:00,220
spend

815
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,400
my life

816
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:01,860
making

817
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:02,460
love

818
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,180
to you

819
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:03,640
night

820
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,740
and day

821
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:07,640
oh

822
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,160
day

823
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:08,980
and night

824
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:11,800
night

825
00:37:11,800 --> 00:37:13,420
and day

826
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,060
they won't

827
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,520
believe that

828
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,080
they will

829
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:24,520
when they hear

830
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:24,760
the things

831
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,240
you and Bob

832
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:25,760
said to each

833
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,100
other the

834
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:26,440
other night

835
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:26,980
in Irene's

836
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,200
apartment

837
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:27,920
you were

838
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:28,280
there

839
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,580
and there

840
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,000
were probably

841
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,340
a thousand

842
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:31,920
people there

843
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:32,300
but I thought

844
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:32,560
there were

845
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,620
7,000 people

846
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,140
there because

847
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:34,560
there was so

848
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,180
much excitement

849
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:36,140
and for once

850
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:36,660
in my life

851
00:37:36,660 --> 00:37:37,440
I found a place

852
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,060
where I could

853
00:37:38,060 --> 00:37:38,460
be accepted

854
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:38,920
for being

855
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,180
me

856
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:39,680
and that

857
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,220
people loved

858
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:40,940
you unconditionally

859
00:37:40,940 --> 00:37:41,240
no matter

860
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:41,780
who you were

861
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:42,020
no matter

862
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,320
what you

863
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,740
looked like

864
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:43,380
and everybody

865
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:43,860
was going

866
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:44,320
towards a

867
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,780
common goal

868
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,000
everybody

869
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:45,640
was excited

870
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,400
for everybody

871
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:46,820
else

872
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:47,420
and all of a

873
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:47,900
sudden I felt

874
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:48,300
like I was a

875
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:48,740
big lover

876
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:49,180
I just

877
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:49,880
all of a

878
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,220
sudden found

879
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:50,700
a place

880
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,500
that I felt

881
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:51,960
like maybe

882
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,280
I could

883
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:52,720
grow into

884
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:53,760
and of course

885
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,440
that wasn't

886
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,200
the beginning

887
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:55,520
either

888
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:56,280
it's a long

889
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:56,580
stretch

890
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:57,160
it's a journey

891
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:57,580
it's something

892
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:58,100
you do every

893
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,060
day that helps

894
00:37:59,060 --> 00:37:59,480
you get closer

895
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,100
to your dream

896
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,880
well Bill

897
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,000
I'm an admirer

898
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:02,220
of Bob

899
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:02,900
does it worry

900
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:03,700
you Bob

901
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,220
you can't

902
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:04,640
let this

903
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:05,240
thing taste

904
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,320
I think they

905
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:06,820
could take it

906
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:07,620
a step beyond

907
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:07,940
them

908
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:08,880
to the bizarre

909
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,220
the grotesque

910
00:38:10,220 --> 00:38:11,340
to an intentionally

911
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:12,480
mean-spirited

912
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,460
injury of other

913
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:14,320
innocent people

914
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,720
it had Bob's

915
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,400
fingerprints all

916
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:16,800
over it

917
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,640
and he and I

918
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,220
both would agree

919
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:18,700
that Bob's

920
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:19,080
not a nice

921
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:19,400
person

922
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,240
I saw him

923
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:34,740
shoot Bob

924
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,720
he chose what

925
00:38:35,720 --> 00:38:36,080
you get with

926
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:36,260
a little

927
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:36,700
liberal agenda

928
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:37,520
you pump people

929
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:38,140
full of drugs

930
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:38,960
and pipe dreams

931
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:39,540
and what happens

932
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:40,320
they come gunning

933
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,120
for people like Bob

934
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:42,000
but those folks

935
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:42,780
don't realize something

936
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,480
you can't

937
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,380
kill the truth

938
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:45,320
Bob is not

939
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:45,680
going to be

940
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,500
stopped by any

941
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:46,980
bullet

942
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:47,700
he'll be back

943
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,140
and man you

944
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:48,660
better watch out

945
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:49,060
because he's

946
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,480
headed straight

947
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,040
for Washington

948
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,140
and that's all

949
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:51,800
I've got to say

950
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,060
excuse me

951
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:54,500
I have to go pray

952
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:55,460

955
00:38:58,520 --> 00:38:59,020

958

959
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,280
at number two

960
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,800
on the charts

961
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,040
boy let's

962
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,800
never heard

963
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,220
no scene again

964
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,700
officially

965
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,660
presumed

966
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:12,060
is dead

967
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,360
but the words

968
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,700
he left behind

969
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,880
still echo

970
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,620
through my mind

971
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:20,380
I'm the only

972
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:21,840
man who'll

973
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,160
ever get to

974
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:24,700
and come back

975
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,360
alive

976
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:27,560
he's the only

977
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:28,860
man who'll

978
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:30,300
ever get to

979
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:31,800
and come back

980
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,440
alive

981
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,640
so

982
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:37,080

983
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:37,300
now

984
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:38,160

985
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:38,580

00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:29,280


1035
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:30,400
over

1036
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:38,100
will we've rented a porcupine to chaperone so um there are a couple of little canvas chairs there

1037
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:44,700
and they're cooking somebody's skull you know or something and um the scene is an american

1038
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:49,580
and a britisher and they've been discussing all afternoon a little juice and all the vodka

1039
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:57,380
and um the britisher says i know you've hunted in many many sections of the world

1040
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:05,260
and i know that you've killed an innumerous amount of animals of all types birds reptiles

1041
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:10,800
things of that nature but you have never hunted bob in that he's the great white hunter and i

1042
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:16,520
think as far as i'm concerned greatest white hunter of all times yeah i'm looking forward

1043
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:21,200
to meeting him he better be pretty damn good i'll clue you

1044
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:27,280
as i've spent a hundred thousand dollars coming over this godforsaken territory

1045
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:27,360
and i'm looking forward to meeting him

1046
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:35,900
story. True, I've made some foolish investments. I've married three or four times. One was

1047
00:41:35,900 --> 00:41:42,140
a teenager. I was really drunk down in Big D one night. Married a child. Married a child.

1048
00:41:42,460 --> 00:41:48,480
God, she was heaven, oh heaven, heaven. I'm looking forward to this guy. I hope to God

1049
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:53,520
you say he's as good as he is. Believe me, he is. In fact, he's coming up right now.

1050
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,740
Striking blue eyes and carrying a .22 short rifle. What the hell's he expect to kill with that?

1051
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:04,540
I've only known him to be always a crack shot. Strange, I must say, going out after elephant today.

1052
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,180
He'll have to be good all right, won't he?

1053
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:21,340
We have a friend that we don't talk about. Wears a black leather jacket. Sort of I'm the brand of time.

1054
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:23,500
Oh, what a friend.

1055
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:28,480
A friend that we don't like to talk about.

1056
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:39,860
Has black hair and a set of teeth to match.

1057
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:48,160
We're just having cocktails right out here in the sun, jungle, listening to a little hi-fi.

1058
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,260
Pictures of home waiting for you, Texan.

1059
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,520
This is my friend and colleague.

1060
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,060
Out of there. God almighty.

1061
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:06,160
Oh, what a friend that we don't like to talk about.

1062
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:16,720
Ah, I guess this doesn't seem strange to you.

1063
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,920
But you should see what our friends can do.

1064
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:29,080
He lets Satan tempt you. He just lets Satan wet up his knives.

1065
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:36,500
He lets him get the filthiest, rottenest, degradating rot of hell and hit you right smack with it.

1066
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:42,080
And then he says, use my word. Use my name. Use my power.

1067
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:42,500
Yes.

1068
00:43:44,220 --> 00:43:47,160
Get yourself a couple of pints and a chicken tikka masala takeaway.

1069
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,280
Bob's your uncle and f***ing is a rude word.

1070
00:43:49,520 --> 00:43:51,800
I haven't heard it from your mouth. Yours and Bob's.

1071
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:52,740
Yeah, you heard it from him.

1072
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,800
I did not hear it. He slept with you.

1073
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,180
On July 4th, this weekend.

1074
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:59,140
Don't you want to sleep? I'll give you a snack.

1075
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,780
Look at that in your pipe and smoke, good whore.

1076
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,920
I feel bad. I know. I feel bad about the way things happen.

1077
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:12,180
But I don't regret it because I love Bob and I'm happy.

1078
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:16,680
I think it was just a matter of time before Bob came up with a song.

1079
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,860
I want to be Bob.

1080
00:44:22,740 --> 00:44:24,240
Sit and smile all the time.

1081
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:25,920
I want to be Bob.

1082
00:44:26,820 --> 00:44:28,380
Think everything is just fine.

1083
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:30,720
Don't want to be Jesus.

1084
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,800
Always look so sad.

1085
00:44:33,560 --> 00:44:35,220
Don't want to be Jesus.

1086
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,720
Ha ha. He must have had an awful dad.

1087
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,400
I want to be Bob.

1088
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,540
Tell everyone about slack.

1089
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,640
I want to be Bob.

1090
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,180
Let the pigs kiss my crack.

1091
00:44:46,860 --> 00:44:48,500
Don't want to be Jesus.

1092
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,620
Don't want to be no slave.

1093
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:52,720
Don't want to be Jesus.

1094
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:52,720


1095
00:44:53,540 --> 00:44:55,740
He should have stayed in his grave.

1096
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,240
I want to be Bob.

1097
00:44:58,240 --> 00:44:59,720
Never have to work a day.

1098
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:01,900
I want to be Bob.

1099
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:04,120
All eternity's a play.

1100
00:45:04,860 --> 00:45:06,520
Don't want to be Jesus.

1101
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,640
Don't want to carry no cross.

1102
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:11,000
Don't want to be Jesus.

1103
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:13,640
Don't want to speak for no ha ha boss.

1104
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:15,440
I want to be Bob.

1105
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:17,700
See everything all so clear.

1106
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:19,820
I want to be Bob.

1107
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,180
This sh** is in your ear to ear.

1108
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:22,720
I want to be Bob.

1109
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:22,720


1110
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:24,600
Don't want to be Jesus.

1111
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,840
Always trying to figure things out.

1112
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,740
Don't want to be Jesus.

1113
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,440
Who needs all the f**king

1114
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:32,460
apostate doubts.

1115
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,420
I want to be Bob.

1116
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:36,060
Yeah, I want to be Bob.

1117
00:45:36,620 --> 00:45:38,160
I want to be Bob.

1118
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,000
I'd even like an In-N-Out jersey.

1119
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:41,620
Yahoo!

1120
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,560
I wanted you to know what radio announcers

1121
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,480
are up against. Feel sorry for them.

1122
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:50,160
Send in a little something, whatever you can afford.

1123
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,400
And now friends, we have a time check.

1124
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,780
And would you just fill in your own time, please?

1125
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,420
Well, my freedom was so precious.

1126
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,580
I took my noxious alarm clock.

1127
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,760
I took my sludge hammer and I painted it

1128
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,440
red, white, and blue.

1129
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,980
Because in America, if you can afford it,

1130
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,520
you can do it.

1131
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,020
And I smashed it.

1132
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:08,880
And it was so fun.

1133
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,200
What an experience.

1134
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:12,920
It is really fun. I like that.

1135
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:18,700
You know what time we're going to wake up Monday?

1136
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:19,960
See, we don't either.

1137
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,000
Let's be Bob! Let's be Bob!

1138
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,740
Thanks to Bob, our eternal hope.

1139
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:30,300
And praise me to Erwin, New Jersey's Pope.

1140
00:46:30,620 --> 00:46:35,120
We're fickle and free and we don't make no fuss

1141
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:38,600
At the Church of the Subgenius.

1142
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,940
Bob, hear our plea.

1143
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,420
We beseech thee.

1144
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,060
Help us be free from normalcy.

1145
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,720
We're done devoted and done devoted.

1146
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:52,720


1147
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:52,720


1148
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:52,720


1149
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:52,720


1150
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:57,280
So back, please give us an hour of slack.

1151
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:02,500
J.R. Bob Dobbs never fails.

1152
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:07,160
He's the living slack master of mystic sales.

1153
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,300
All you conspiracy doofs, just you wait

1154
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:15,020
till July the 5th, 1998.

1155
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,800
Invaders will come from Planet X

1156
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:26,300
bringing gifts of money, time control and great sex.

1157
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:31,000
A new age will dawn and we'll never look back.

1158
00:47:31,220 --> 00:47:34,740
We'll be busy enjoying our slack.

1159
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:36,160
Everybody now.

1160
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:37,720
Bob here I'm Lee.

1161
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:40,220
We be seized free.

1162
00:47:41,280 --> 00:47:44,880
Help us be free from normalcy.

1163
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:48,520
We're dumb, devoted and dumb.

1164
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:49,680
Talk back.

1165
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,780
Please give us an hour of slack.

1166
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:53,180
Hour of slack.

1167
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,820
He's the bridge between heaven and earth and hell.

1168
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:01,280
He's the patron saint of sales.

1169
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:03,100
Yeah, he's doing well.

1170
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,900
Media, retins and novels and memes.

1171
00:48:07,220 --> 00:48:07,920
Beware.

1172
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:11,460
The slack master sells everywhere.

1173
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,660
Give thanks to Bob.

1174
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:14,980
Give thanks to Bob.

1175
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:17,500
Our eternal hope.

1176
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:18,620
Praise me to Owen.

1177
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,060
Praise me to Owen.

1178
00:48:20,060 --> 00:48:21,140
New Jersey.

1179
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,040
We're fickle and free.

1180
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,420
We're fickle and free.

1181
00:48:24,560 --> 00:48:30,340
And we don't make no fuss at the Church of the Subgenius.

1182
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:31,580
Everybody now.

1183
00:48:32,020 --> 00:48:33,600
Give thanks to Bob.

1184
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,220
Our eternal hope.

1185
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:38,640
And praise me to Owen.

1186
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,240
New Jersey.

1187
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:43,080
We're fickle and free.

1188
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:48,900
And we don't make no fuss at the Church of the Subgenius.

1189
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:51,780
We're fickle and free.

1190
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:07,620
And we don't make no fuss at the Church of the Subgenius.

1191
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:12,440
Dear Bob, I must give you credit for playing some good music, but why spoil it with your

1192
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,860
stupid asinine whistling?

1193
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:14,580
Why?

1194
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:17,600
Lock yourself in a broom closet while the music is on.

1195
00:49:17,860 --> 00:49:20,800
I'm disgusted and from now on I'll do my own whistling in the morning.

1196
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,620
This is from Springfield.

1197
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,560
Is there any lower form of life?

1198
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,680
Let the record show that the witness made a drinky, drinky motion.

1199
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:29,420
A bottle.

1200
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,540
Who has it?

1201
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,160
Stupid mailman, squealing me.

1202
00:49:33,820 --> 00:49:38,520
I still enjoy your program even though you've been back two or three weeks now.

1203
00:49:39,020 --> 00:49:39,880
Isn't that nice?

1204
00:49:40,040 --> 00:49:40,720
Here's one.

1205
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,460
It says, Dear Bob, please don't pick any more winners.

1206
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:44,460
I'm going broke.

1207
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:48,580
And you bull thrower, how are you going to crawl out of this?

1208
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:49,220
That's a nice one.

1209
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:50,080
I like the short one.

1210
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:50,780
At least you're not going to be the only one to get a little bit of a break.

1211
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:50,780


1212
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:50,780


1213
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,140
I think you should get him over with in a hurry.

1214
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:56,680
Dear Bob, I had heard so much about you I was prepared to like you immediately.

1215
00:49:56,880 --> 00:49:59,480
I tuned in your show and you talked me out of it.

1216
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,760
Here's another one from Springfield.

1217
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:05,100
Could you please give me the exact address in Washington, D.C. of the Bureau of Indian

1218
00:50:05,100 --> 00:50:05,400
Affairs?

1219
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:07,700
I've always wanted to have an affair with an Indian.

1220
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:11,060
This from Springfield also.

1221
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:14,960
Dear Bob, this morning you advertised boys' suits for youngsters aged three to seven.

1222
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:16,280
You said they were trimmed with piping.

1223
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:17,760
Piping in a boy's suit?

1224
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:19,980
Wouldn't you think they'd be housebroken at that age?

1225
00:50:19,980 --> 00:50:21,040
Hang in there, Robert.

1226
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:21,700
Yours truly.

1227
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:25,060
This letter from New Britain says, Dear Bob, I was standing in the kitchen in front of

1228
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:29,180
my radio this morning pulling my two-way stretch over my hips when you said, Are you a little

1229
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:29,960
on the fat side?

1230
00:50:30,540 --> 00:50:33,080
What I want to know is, can you see out here?

1231
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:35,020
If so, I must dress somewhere else.

1232
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:39,860
It's a joke, Dobbsy.

1233
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:43,160
Aren't you going to let me in on it?

1234
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:44,620
In on it?

1235
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:46,300
Sure I will.

1236
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:47,400
Sure.

1237
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:48,960
Ah!

1238
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:49,960
Oh, my God.

1239
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:56,300
Isn't it great swimming in a sea of slack?

1240
00:50:57,060 --> 00:51:03,880
Let's just immerse ourselves in the luck plane's surfy, surfy waves and waft along.

1241
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:12,880
Dr. Philo Drummond once said, If slack was water, Bob would be surfing and you'd be drowning.

1242
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:18,740
Hey, I'm willing to settle for death by drowning in slack any day, Doctor.

1243
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:19,960
I'm going to get you a drink.

1244
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:27,580
Oh, this is the soundtrack to Mr. Lucky, which is one of Bob's nine billion middle

1245
00:51:27,580 --> 00:51:28,000
names.

1246
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:34,660
And you know, he's taught me that it's better to be lucky than good any day.

1247
00:51:34,740 --> 00:51:36,280
And what an example he sets.

1248
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:39,240
I rejoice in the failings of Bob.

1249
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:42,200
I exult in the slip-ups of Bob.

1250
00:51:42,620 --> 00:51:46,760
Hey, Bob, show us how you make a mistake and make a million dollars.

1251
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:49,860
Yes, make me a failure, too, Bob.

1252
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:49,960
I'm going to get you a drink.

1253
00:51:49,960 --> 00:51:53,180
Oh, Bob, show me the witching ways of surfing the luck plane.

1254
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,680
Look, Bob, I can hang, too.

1255
00:51:57,060 --> 00:52:00,520
Oh, and when Bob forgets to screw up.

1256
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,380
Oh, when he screws up by not screwing up.

1257
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,160
It's like breaking the bank at Monte Carlo.

1258
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:12,360
It's such blinding, radiant luck that you can't believe it.

1259
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:17,500
You appreciate the good things in life if you don't waste your time counting on them to happen.

1260
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:22,140
But if you expect the bad things, every day can be like Christmas.

1261
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:27,060
Just forget yourself and go with a path of least resistance.

1262
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,340
Sharpen your abnormality focus.

1263
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:35,040
You might do only one weird thing exceptionally well.

1264
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:39,320
Well, take that weird thing and turn it around and milk it dry.

1265
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,340
Milk it for Bobby.

1266
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,360
Tap it.

1267
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:43,660
Strip mine it.

1268
00:52:43,780 --> 00:52:46,000
There's strip mining your slack away.

1269
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:47,320
Leaving toxic slacks.

1270
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:50,900
And toxic poisons to leach into your psychic water table.

1271
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,780
Fight the conspiracy.

1272
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:55,860
Give up for Bob.

1273
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:00,840
On and off the road to Bob.

1274
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:07,120
We are marching forward blind.

1275
00:53:08,080 --> 00:53:13,200
He has gouged out both our eyes.

1276
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,300
And he's laughing close.

1277
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:18,620
Behind.

1278
00:53:20,320 --> 00:53:25,220
He will sell us back our eyes.

1279
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:31,000
When we join his noble plan.

1280
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,600
For just $19.95.

1281
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:43,320
And a taste of our woodland.

1282
00:53:47,320 --> 00:53:52,240
On and off the road with Bob.

1283
00:53:52,820 --> 00:53:58,300
He has handed us the wheel.

1284
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:04,180
And he cuddles up with mine.

1285
00:54:06,320 --> 00:54:10,620
As he counts himself a fiel.

1286
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:16,540
Our eyes are on the road.

1287
00:54:16,540 --> 00:54:17,300
And we're on the road.

1288
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:17,300


1289
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:22,500
But Bob forgot to say.

1290
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:29,060
That the steering wheel went bust.

1291
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:34,520
The road carries us away.

1292
00:54:38,540 --> 00:54:43,780
On and off the road for Bob.

1293
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:49,820
We forgot why we came here.

1294
00:54:50,340 --> 00:54:55,880
We have quit all of our jobs.

1295
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,780
Like a headlight frightened deer.

1296
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:07,740
He has lit the sacred pipe.

1297
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:13,240
And he's smiling at us.

1298
00:55:13,240 --> 00:55:13,940
And he's smiling at us now.

1299
00:55:15,220 --> 00:55:18,600
On and off the road.

1300
00:55:18,980 --> 00:55:20,460
He's Bob.

1301
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:24,180
He's our bull god.

1302
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:28,560
We are his town.

1303
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:33,960
That hurt Bob.

1304
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,300
Bob where are you?

1305
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,340
Who are you?

1306
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:42,140
A friend of Bob's.

1307
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,820
They found my fingerprints on my ashtray.

1308
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,400
And not yours.

1309
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:48,060
It had Bob's fingerprints all over it.

1310
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:50,800
And he and I both would agree that Bob's not a nice person.

1311
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:52,120
That was enough for them.

1312
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:53,800
It's funny because it's true.

1313
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:54,420
And hey.

1314
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:56,720
Admit the truth to yourself now.

1315
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:00,100
You know you'll be clawing your way to the head of the line to buy a membership.

1316
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:03,920
When the atomic heat rays are so close they're welding your butt cheeks together.

1317
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,720
Oh but don't come crying to me.

1318
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,300
I can't wait for X day.

1319
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,000
I love the taste of human flesh.

1320
00:56:12,780 --> 00:56:15,540
I just haven't had it cooked yet.

1321
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:23,100
We get down and dirty in this church because religion happens to be a dirty, dirty business.

1322
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:26,720
This church is a lot like an old car sometimes.

1323
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:31,000
In that it's the dirt that's the only thing that's holding it all together.

1324
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:32,540
And Bob.

1325
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:37,500
Bob is the bondo that keeps our sagging bumpers up.

1326
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:38,580
Bob.

1327
00:56:38,580 --> 00:56:43,120
Isn't that the one thing that we're here for after all, sneakers?

1328
00:56:44,280 --> 00:56:45,580
The dirt.

1329
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,740
So let's dig in and dish it up.

1330
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,520
It's crammed packed with minerals too.

1331
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:56,900
So don't settle for the poop du jour.

1332
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:04,180
Excremeditate your troubles away with the armor-piercing slack of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1333
00:57:08,580 --> 00:57:10,500
I'm mighty, I'm full of it.

1334
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,980
But I'm going to let it go.

1335
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:16,220
And you've got to let it go dear friend.

1336
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:24,500
Just as sure as you can bet it, one of those two greatest guys up there is going to let go just as you is letting go.

1337
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:28,060
Bob, what's Ms. Preskey's heat so far?

1338
00:57:28,260 --> 00:57:28,900
Right Jack.

1339
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:30,160
Ah.

1340
00:57:31,800 --> 00:57:32,360
Yes.

1341
00:57:36,140 --> 00:57:38,160
Well, how do you feel Ms. Preskey?

1342
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:39,960
Sick.

1343
00:57:40,060 --> 00:57:42,100
Ah well, you can afford it now love.

1344
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:46,300
But like the good book says, there are bigger deals to come.

1345
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:47,580
Oh Christ.

1346
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,420
Right Jack.

1347
00:58:03,420 --> 00:58:14,360
Uh oh.

1348
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,360
Let me keep the do littlehammer.

1349
00:58:24,420 --> 00:58:24,900
Snatch on the next opportunity.

1350
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:24,900


1351
00:58:24,900 --> 00:58:24,900


1352
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:29,360
Don't know much.

1353
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:31,500
I can't say go.

1354
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:43,300
I hope things work out the way you want them to.

1355
00:58:44,340 --> 00:58:45,000
Thanks, bud.

1356
00:58:45,640 --> 00:58:46,620
I'm hoping too.

1357
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:51,840
Oh, crap! It's on fire!

1358
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,920
