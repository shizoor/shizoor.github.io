1
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,760
I never lie.

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,740
Stay tuned. We'll have more right after this.

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,820
It's time for the Watchman Bulletin, a radio ministry of Watchman Fellowship.

4
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:31,300
The Watchman Bulletin is designed to give today's Christian the latest news and vital information on cults in America.

5
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:35,000
And now, for today's bulletin, your host, Bob.

6
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,500
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

7
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:50,040
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius.

8
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:52,680
Our host, the Watch.

9
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,360
Open up that bottle of slack and pour out a big old glass.

10
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:09,740
Sit back and listen to the priest chanting.

11
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,440
Messages from outer space? Oh, sure.

12
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:17,060
Radio show? Sure.

13
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,040
Oh, sure.

14
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,980
Oh, sure.

15
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:25,960
What is that stuff? Echo? Sure.

16
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:29,960
Wow, there's echo.

17
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:30,960
Oh, my God.

18
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,720
Don't crash the car, Dr. Tix.

19
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,360
Too much echoes.

20
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,360
Must reach.

21
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,400
Must reach.

22
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:39,020
Cancel button.

23
00:01:39,980 --> 00:01:40,900
Must reach.

24
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,120
Fake phone call.

25
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,140
I'll get it.

26
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,480
By the way, how does the Church of the Subgenius survive financially?

27
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,900
Oh, we're doing great right now.

28
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,640
Mm-hmm.

29
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:54,460
You know, especially since...

30
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,140
Swagger came over.

31
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,780
Listen to this.

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,460
Listen to this.

33
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,800
Listen to this.

34
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:05,460
Listen to this.

35
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,880
What I'm going to tell you now may shock some of you, but it's the truth.

36
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,760
I was in the rock music scene.

37
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:13,560
I was a part of it for years.

38
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:15,500
I was a musician.

39
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,300
I was a singer.

40
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,080
Singing about what the kids want to hear.

41
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,580
Speed and pop.

42
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,720
Sex outside of marriage.

43
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,440
Said old masochistic sexual technique.

44
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:24,800
Said old masochistic sexual technique.

45
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:24,800


46
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:27,940
Did it cause any problems.

47
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,360
Lost both sex.

48
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,360


49
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,360


50
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,360


51
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,520
It's still working.

52
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,520


53
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,520


54
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,520


55
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,520


56
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:28,520


57
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,600
Money stinks in the stinch and the filth and the rod and the bondage and the darkness.

58
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,760
Listen to this.

59
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,300
One of the greatest days of my life

60
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:41,740
This particular night I was there with crowd control

61
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:45,700
That coliseum was packed to capacity with tens of thousands of people

62
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:48,940
Thousands, thousands, thousands, thousands, thousands there that night

63
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,320
The air was heavily laden with marijuana

64
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,660
Marijuana smokes were thick

65
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:54,280
And it was so thick

66
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,820
You could get high by just being in the place

67
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:57,340
You would even get high walking through it

68
00:02:57,340 --> 00:03:00,460
And the scene was straight out of Danny's Inferno

69
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:04,560
It was like animals, it was like dogs sponsoring this huge

70
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,280
Travaganza will be

71
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:14,020
Some of the mightiest corporations in the United States of America

72
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,540
I would give my body to this group until it was black and blue

73
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,240
I mean it

74
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,800
I'd get down on my hands and knees

75
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,320
I'd give them anything they wanted

76
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,260
They're like God

77
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,020
They're even better than God

78
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,540
Listen to this

79
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,580
To be blunt

80
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,500
You will, after the show is over

81
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,040
You'll go backstage and

82
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,540
You'll go backstage and

83
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:35,380
You'll go backstage and

84
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:38,340
Let these animals do about anything they want to do to you

85
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,080
So what?

86
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:41,700
It would be worth it to me

87
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:42,940
Listen to this

88
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:45,740
Listen to this

89
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,520
Listen to this

90
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:56,000
I awakened on the couch to the flaring reverberation of a monstrous stereo that had played all night long

91
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,620
A little stale cigarette set up to attempt to focus on my immediate surroundings

92
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,340
Garbage, garbage, cigarette butt, cigarette butt

93
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:04,840
Garbage, garbage, cigarette butt, cigarette butt

94
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,060
Dope trays, dope trays

95
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:10,120
Needles and albums were strung about with clothes ankle-deep on the floor

96
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:17,420
I reached forward to begin consuming one of the leftover untouched drinks when I noticed the television set was on

97
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,260
I almost turned it off

98
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:21,520
But something said watch it

99
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:22,960
I looked at my life

100
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,980
It means nothing anymore

101
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:26,360
Do you hear me?

102
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,560
It means nothing anymore

103
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,880
I sat there transfixed

104
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,500
Battling with myself

105
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,320
And the world

106
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:34,680
And the devil

107
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,320
Whether to make an altar right there in front of that TV set

108
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,880
Finally I declared to myself that I couldn't make it on my own

109
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,540
I had to turn to somebody bigger than me

110
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:49,340
My previous dope dealer

111
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,560
Listen to this

112
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:52,440
Listen to this

113
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,040
Listen to this

114
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:02,460
God has told me that your parents or anyone else who tells you what to do is the devil and you ought to shout right back at them

115
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,320
No I'm not a Christian! I'm not a Christian!

116
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,340
I don't have anything to do with that! I'm not a Christian!

117
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,340
I'm not a Christian!

118
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,480
I won't just say it so plain that a two year old child will understand me

119
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:16,800
Be vocal, be loud, be concise and be clear

120
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,680
I don't care who you are

121
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,820
You ought to shout right back at them

122
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:23,060
It's a cover up, it's a sham, it's a facade

123
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,500
There is no God, man is God

124
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,680
Yes I know!

125
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,760
Yes I know!

126
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:30,020
There is no God, man is God

127
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,800
Yes I know! Yes I know!

128
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,380
Yes I know!

129
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,940
No I'm not a Christian! I'm not a Christian!

130
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,480
No!

131
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:39,620
Christian, a Christian, a Christian

132
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:44,260
Held up to the American public as that which is good and noble

133
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,540
When in reality it is dirty, degrading, filthy and rotten

134
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,020
You better take a strong look mister at where you're going to church

135
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,700
The church of the subgenius

136
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,800
Salvation or Salivation

137
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,460
Salivation or Salivation

138
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,800
Natural, herbal,

139
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:07,400
moja

140
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,540
Mojo pills

141
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:12,360
Guaranteed hair growth formula

142
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,640
Contains urethral glandulars

143
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,700
and effusive monkey pineal gland extract

144
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,160
blocked out

145
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,940
Made in Malaysia

146
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:22,780
Endorsed by Doctors for Bob

147
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,620
We make illness an art form

148
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:28,100
Resiled that lube to my own satisfaction

149
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,800
I have sinned against you my lord

150
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,620
And I beg your forgiveness.

151
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,540
I do not call it a mistake.

152
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,820
I do not call it a mendacity.

153
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,720
I call it sin.

154
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,320
I call it sin.

155
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:27,520
I want to address my own sin.

156
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,480
I want to address myself as best as I know how

157
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:37,220
to those that I have wronged, that I have sinned against.

158
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,780
First of all, my wife, Frances.

159
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:50,220
God never gave a man a better helpmate and companion

160
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,200
to stand beside him.

161
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,840
I have sinned against you.

162
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,440
And I beg your forgiveness.

163
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,660
I have sinned against you.

164
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,400
God could never give a man a father, a minister of the gospel,

165
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,560
a finer son.

166
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:33,320
That he has given me and his mother.

167
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,560
Donny and Debbie,

168
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,280
I have sinned against you.

169
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:51,180
And I beg you to forgive me.

170
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,320
I have sinned against you.

171
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:16,860
I know that so many would ask, why?

172
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,580
Why?

173
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:31,280
I have asked myself that 10,000 times, through 10,000 tears.

174
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,940
Why?

175
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,640
Why?

176
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,420
I call it sin.

177
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:58,800
I have sinned against you, my Lord.

178
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:14,420
And I would ask that your precious blood would wash and cleanse every stain.

179
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:19,560
Until it is in me.

180
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:22,060
The seas of God's forgetfulness.

181
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,920
Never to be remembered against me anymore.

182
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,740
It doesn't work. The natives aren't scared off by this.

183
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,600
Look, those naked women are dancing.

184
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,080
Hey, get closer. Get the camera.

185
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,320
Get the camera out.

186
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,900
Yeah, let's go do that.

187
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,200
Okay, ready?

188
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,280
Okay.

189
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,540
And we'll go to Dr. Drummond?

190
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Dr. Drummond, Reverend Howell wants to tell you about President Reagan's operation.

191
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,800
Oh, okay, the new one? His latest and greatest operation?

192
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:07,020
You know, he's had many operations throughout his long checkerboard career as the executive key squancher.

193
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,560
But in fact, this latest Reagan atrocity tops them all.

194
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,860
The burr hole in the head, I understand.

195
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,960
That's right, they are called burr holes in his old burr head.

196
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:24,180
They had to give him a burr haircut, but I understand he was really, that wasn't bothering him.

197
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,260
He'd been thinking about it anyway.

198
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:32,160
Although Reagan has not experienced any other symptoms, doctors advised caution, the spokesperson said.

199
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:38,720
The surgeons made a small burr hole with a jackhammer, then a low-speed pneumatic drill in the ex-president's skull,

200
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:41,380
and drained a collection of correction fluid.

201
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:47,920
The procedure, which was performed under a gibbous paleolithic moon by which doctors waving crude obsidian knives,

202
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,560
lasted slightly over a year.

203
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,360
The procedure lasted for 36 hours, and was without serious complications.

204
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,400
Oh, they're already finished.

205
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:58,540
Dr. Bo Weinberg said he did not know how long Reagan would be hospitalized.

206
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,620
What about Dr., what did Bo Heine say?

207
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:04,200
He will go home when the physicians say he's good and ready, he said.

208
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:08,680
Torquemada Clinic physicians said the former president is in excellent health.

209
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:16,460
Weinberg said earlier, Reagan's wife, Nancy, just say no, Reagan, also underwent routine tests

210
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,280
and was found to be shriveled up like a prune, but otherwise,

211
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:21,440
in excellent health as well, he said.

212
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:29,740
I understand that Bo Hondas, Dr. Bo Hondas, when standing at the operating table after they had made the burr hole

213
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:36,060
and were leaking the viscous, horrible fluids from the president, the ex-president's brain,

214
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:36,580
commented on the viscosity of those fluids.

215
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:43,000
Dr. Bo Hondas described the president's problem as a subdural hematoma caused by President Reagan

216
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,140
being thrown by a bucking syphilitic horse in Death Valley days of July,

217
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,480
indicating the fluid had collected.

218
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:53,660
The blood had collected underneath the dura, a membrane that covers the brain inside the skull.

219
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,020
A hematoma is a pool of blood as in a bruise.

220
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,360
The blood had collected on the top of the right side of the brain, Weinberg said,

221
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:05,300
causing the former president to operate from the left or liberal side of the brain.

222
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:05,920
That's right.

223
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:11,000
Before the operation, Reagan had advocated unilateral disarmament, nudism, the Equal Rights Amendment,

224
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:16,320
eating oat bran, giving in to communism, legalizing drugs and turning the country upside down,

225
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,540
scraping the crud off it and giving it back to the infrastructure.

226
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:20,180
But the president was not the only one who was involved.

227
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:26,300
President George Bush tried unsuccessfully to contact the former chief executive from his command post aboard Air Force One,

228
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:29,380
but was impotent to abort Reagan's tirade.

229
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:34,620
I understand there's a group in San Francisco now that's organized to put the stuff back in Reagan's brain campaign

230
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:38,520
to try to get him to think the other way, maybe to influence Bush a little bit.

231
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:42,160
But like Kennedy's brain, the brain fluid disappeared mysteriously.

232
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,940
The Reagans arrived in Balaponga on Wednesday and checked into the clinic Thursday.

233
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:52,200
They left the clinic Friday morning and he later checked into St. Nowhere,

234
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:55,500
said a hospital spokeswoman who would not be identified.

235
00:13:56,420 --> 00:14:01,820
Reagan, an accomplished rider, was thrown from a frenzied rabid bucking horse July 4th

236
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:05,860
while visiting the ranch of William Wellman, a friend near Los Barrachos, Mexico,

237
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,280
about 30 miles south of the Arizona border.

238
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:16,500
He was flown by ornithopter to an army hospital in Arizona and kept about four hours.

239
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:16,800
.

240
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:16,880
.

241
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:22,180
.

242
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:28,780
.

243
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:28,920
.

244
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:28,980
.

245
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:29,020
.

246
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,080
.

247
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,080


248
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:29,100
.

249
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,160
.

250
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:29,180
.

251
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:29,200
.

252
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:37,420
.

253
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,980
What was Reagan doing out there alone with that horse?

254
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,060
I'll tell you one thing.

255
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:44,320
He was out shooting buffalo gratuitously.

256
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:47,500
Did he run them down and shoot them again and again?

257
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,760
And when they got up, he'd shoot them again?

258
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,720
President Reagan dancing in the world.

259
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,540
Not only did he shoot those beefalos, but he jumped down and he buffed them a lot.

260
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,360
I mean, he jumped off his horse and swirled.

261
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,820
He's so happy with the buffalo.

262
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,320
Oops, he's bumped his head against the horse.

263
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,220
I think there's a bubble of water swelling.

264
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,440
Oh, my God.

265
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,840
President's head is eight times its normal size.

266
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,560
Oh, it's aqueous and...

267
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:11,800
Uh-oh.

268
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,660
Uh-oh, sorry.

269
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,480
Aqueous and what?

270
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:14,620
I get so excited.

271
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,220
Well, the president's head, you know.

272
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,500
Well, I understand he just got back from another trip

273
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,280
where they'd been hunting the great black rhinoceros down on the plains so dry and hot.

274
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:30,500
I didn't know he was doing that, but I'm not kidding that the ranch owned by William Wellman that was in the news...

275
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:32,980
They shot him down and took his horn and left the rest behind.

276
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,140
It's a ranch in Mexico where they have deliberately gathered buffalo

277
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,540
for rich people to shoot.

278
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,280
That's right.

279
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,780
And that's where the Reagans were.

280
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,580
I'm not making that up.

281
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,360
It's true, but people think these things are made up.

282
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,280
It's the show.

283
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,540
No, it's not the show.

284
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,500
It really is true.

285
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:53,880
It's a captive buffalo ranch, which wouldn't be legal in the United States where they can go and blast away the buffalo

286
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,200
just the way their capitalistic precursors and forebears did in the last century.

287
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,680
I understand they take those rhinoceros horns and sell them to the Taiwanese...

288
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,060
They sell them to...

289
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,880
...who make medicines out of them.

290
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:05,380
...quickly impotent businessmen.

291
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:05,640
...who make medicines out of them.

292
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,020
...quickly impotent businessmen.

293
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,020
...quickly impotent businessmen.

294
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,760
The men you...

295
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:08,200
The men you...

296
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:08,200


297
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,720
Yes, just because of the look of the thing, it's sympathetic magic.

298
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:12,460
But to me, it's not that sympathetic.

299
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,800
Yeah, I think...

300
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:14,780
Wow, look at that thing.

301
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,080
I think it's rather sad.

302
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:17,320
That they kill...

303
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,040
That they kill a gigantic animal for such a small thing.

304
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,260
Even if they killed a tiny animal for a big thing, it would be the same thing.

305
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,620
Or a big animal for...

306
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:30,460
No, you already said that.

307
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:30,880
No, I...

308
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,680
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

309
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,840
How many ways does this work?

310
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,840
If they killed a tiny thing for a big animal, now that's good.

311
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,380
Yeah, that would be very different.

312
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:40,800
I don't know. Everything's relative. It depends on who's who.

313
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:42,460
Well, you know what time it almost is.

314
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,800
Yes, so let's wind up this.

315
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:46,640
Oh, man, cut that out. That's not...

316
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,860
It's time to go for the show.

317
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,860
Dr. Howell, there really kind of hurts, you know.

318
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:54,260
But yeah, in five minutes, all of us will disappear.

319
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,260
Well, I'd like to thank all of your callers tonight.

320
00:16:56,340 --> 00:17:01,700
I really enjoyed speaking with them today or whenever you refer to the time period in those quarters.

321
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,620
But thanks for inviting me on your show.

322
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,760
And I hope we can do this again sometime in the near future.

323
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:11,760
I love talking to the audience and answering their questions

324
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:18,740
and engaging their attitudes, their positive stances on different common issues.

325
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,720
Issues and gesundheits and answers.

326
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,500
That's right.

327
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:30,280
And once again, thank you so much from Missouri via the call forwarding services of the International Telephone.

328
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,160
And we're going to do it again real soon.

329
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,300
Here to...

330
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:34,220
Uh...

331
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,180
Doppestown, Malaysia.

332
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:40,060
Torquemada physicians also...

333
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,560
Are we still on?

334
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,040
Yeah.

335
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:41,660
Oh, okay.

336
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,300
That was for a fact.

337
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:47,580
And then that's where we splice in all the cheering and all that, you know, stuff like that.

338
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,740
But in the meantime, hold on, and I'll find out what these callers want.

339
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,900
The wine base.

340
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:54,240
Yeah, well, it was good asking questions, Dr. Farrow.

341
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:04,100
The most obnoxious caller called back to wish Dr. Farrow a happy journey into the great luminous beyond.

342
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:06,540
Thank you.

343
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,740
All personnel not immediately needed.

344
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,260
During this operation...

345
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:13,020
Okay, caller, you're one of the personnel needed.

346
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,020
So go ahead with your question to Dr. Farrow Drummond.

347
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,760
Oh, this is my question.

348
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,980
Do you prefer red, brown, black, or gold beef curtains?

349
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:29,160
The question is, do you prefer red, brown, black, or gold beef curtains?

350
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,920
Does that make any sense or sent out post to you?

351
00:18:32,020 --> 00:18:33,840
Yeah, well, the question was, do you...

352
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,760
Do you prefer any black, brown...

353
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:37,840
No, it was green.

354
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,380
Silver, green, or pink?

355
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:40,320
No, wait, it was...

356
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,180
Not pink.

357
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:43,000
No, no, I mean...

358
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,200
Red, brown, no...

359
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,720
Yeah, do you prefer...

360
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,980
Uh-oh, look out there.

361
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,100
Emmett's rocket's taking off.

362
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,420
The system is melting down everywhere.

363
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,620
Ruined in the cave.

364
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,340
It's crumbling away.

365
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,720
There are beams pulled out on nylon ropes.

366
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:58,960
The ancient custom of beef curtains and your preference in their color.

367
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,540
Yeah, Dr. Beef Curtain was never a good act, I always thought.

368
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:03,760
It's some stupid call.

369
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,460
It's a dollar joke, and they're trying...

370
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,460
You know, they think of these things, and they want to get it on the air,

371
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,100
and they use it on their own show,

372
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:11,080
but then they transfer that show to here.

373
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:14,060
Do you prefer red, black, brown, or yellow beef curtains is the question.

374
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,540
I like the brown one.

375
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:16,940
Brown is the answer.

376
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,740
Caller, I hope you're still tuned in.

377
00:19:19,380 --> 00:19:19,700
Obnoxious?

378
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,520
Well, you know, Bob Dobbs is obnoxious, so...

379
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,280
Yeah, but he's him, and you're you.

380
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:26,520
Well, there was one of the wiser callers realizing,

381
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,160
trying to share with us the truth that Bob Dobbs is obnoxious,

382
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:29,880
but of course we all know that,

383
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:31,680
and it's time probably to go away from the rocket show now

384
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,680
and fly high away.

385
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,820
So, Dr. Doman, thanks for talking to us.

386
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,560
We'll talk to you again soon.

387
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:35,160
All right.

388
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,320
For all the rest of the callers, well, it's time.

389
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:39,060
Based on the Torquemada Clinic statement,

390
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,120
Victor Frankenstein,

391
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,280
who was a surgeon at Ingleside University Hospital in Geneva,

392
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:43,700
characterized the operation as a...

393
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,300
Oh, yeah, the characterization.

394
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:44,900
Hey, could you do it?

395
00:19:45,020 --> 00:19:45,800
Give me a picture of your head.

396
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:48,980
And it's eternal salvation, or triple your money back.

397
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:53,320
Now, I would love to see any other church offer that.

398
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,120
In other words, if you go to hell as a result of buying a $20 subgenius membership,

399
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,300
we will send you a check for $60.

400
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,820
Well, how can any...

401
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:04,680
Anybody object to that?

402
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,640
What an incredible deal.

403
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,240
Yeah, or your money back.

404
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,540
Let's go back to the telephone with the Reverend Ivan Stang

405
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,600
from the Immortal Church of the Subgenius.

406
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,620
Good morning, Brandon in North Dallas.

407
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,840
Hi, Kevin, how you doing?

408
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,280
Peachy.

409
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,360
Oh, I just had a question.

410
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,380
I heard him say a moment ago that the end of the world

411
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:26,380
was going to come about on July 5th, 1998.

412
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:28,100
That is correct.

413
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,000
That happens to be my 35th birthday,

414
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,360
and I was wondering what kind of divine intuition

415
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,380
or guidance or anything you could give me.

416
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,240
What significance does that have to me?

417
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,000
Well, basically it means it's your birthday?

418
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,400
That's my 35th birthday.

419
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,840
Well, then join the party.

420
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:48,240
We've got 10 years to plan the biggest party Dallas has ever seen.

421
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:50,720
Now, where we're going to do it, I'm not sure.

422
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:53,020
In fact, we may not even be in Dallas.

423
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:56,940
We may end up doing the main party in Antarctica or someplace.

424
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:58,220
Or Sherman Denison.

425
00:20:58,440 --> 00:20:59,840
Yeah, someplace safe.

426
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:02,840
So how's this thing going to come about?

427
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,520
Well, the men from Planet X will arrive on that morning,

428
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,100
and it can go either of two ways.

429
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:16,460
They're going to, these godlike beings from space will arrive at Earth,

430
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:19,260
and they'll be faced with the same choice that you would have

431
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:22,760
if you saw a dog who'd just been hit by a car on the side of the highway.

432
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,520
You know, do you leave it alone, do you put it to sleep,

433
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,820
or do you take it to the vet?

434
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:33,040
That all depends on how many dues paying,

435
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,060
subgeni there are on this planet when those creatures arrive here.

436
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,920
And whether Bob is their spokesman,

437
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,900
or whether the conspiracy uses a false Bob.

438
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:49,080
There are as many false Bobs running around as false Jesuses.

439
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:52,000
I mean, think how many Bobs you know.

440
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,460
There's a bunch.

441
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:56,480
And not all of them will cut you slack.

442
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,280
Oh, will you cut me some slack?

443
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,400
Yeah, well, yeah.

444
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,260
Well, of course, to a certain extent,

445
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,680
slack is something that one must cut oneself.

446
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:05,320
Yeah.

447
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:06,320
Oh, really?

448
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,060
Yeah, so, you know, not unlike the famous cheese of legend.

449
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,580
Bob delivers slack to those who are willing to take the slack.

450
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:18,560
Brandon, we thank you for calling.

451
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,700
Could you go on a little bit more, Reverend Stang,

452
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,400
about exactly what slack is and how important it is in the Church of the Subgeni?

453
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,120
Well, as the Hell's Angels used to say,

454
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:29,860
if you have to ask, you'll never know.

455
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,240
You know, those who know don't say,

456
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,200
and those who say don't know.

457
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,160
And I realize that didn't help a whole lot.

458
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:35,500
Yes.

459
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:39,980
You either get it, you know, either you know what it means or you don't.

460
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:49,020
Many have said that slack makes happiness feel like having your eyes gouged out,

461
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,740
by comparison.

462
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:57,600
That slack makes the nirvana of the Zen Buddhist monk seem like being buried up to your neck

463
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,740
in the desert and covered with honey for the ants to get you, by comparison.

464
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,080
Slack is awesome.

465
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:05,860
We were all born with original slack.

466
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:11,840
But from the moment that that doctor spanked you behind to make you cry,

467
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,220
the conspiracy has begun to take it away, insidiously stealing it away.

468
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:25,100
And they continue doing that by mean elementary school teachers,

469
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:31,760
through the IRS, you know, through nasty bosses, rude clerks.

470
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,920
The city council.

471
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,680
Bad TV shows.

472
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:34,920
Yep, there you go.

473
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:35,640
Yeah, yeah.

474
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:42,540
So, I mean, it's quite, like I say, it's so insidious that the conspiracy itself does

475
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:48,360
not even know it's a conspiracy, because it is a conspiracy of normality.

476
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,480
Oh, no.

477
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:54,060
It's a consensus agreement on what's normal and what's not.

478
00:23:54,260 --> 00:24:00,860
And most people are not really born normal, and they should be able to exploit their abnormality

479
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:01,740
to generate good news.

480
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:05,200
I think that's what's so interesting about that, is that there's greater slack in their time span,

481
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:12,380
you know, in their brief passage here on earth, before they go back to the before life.

482
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:16,600
The Reverend Ivan Stang from the Church of the Subgenius could...

483
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:23,700
Yeah, well, now, slack is not exactly like money, but having money can help get slack.

484
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:25,540
That's why Bob wants to cut people slack.

485
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:28,820
I mean, he's out to make a buck, and at least he admits it.

486
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,100
We...

487
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,640
That's why he has a little more slack, say, than I do.

488
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,320
Now, let's see.

489
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,020
Now, Kevin, I recently asked you a question.

490
00:24:37,380 --> 00:24:38,380
Yes, Church Lady Mother?

491
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,160
Yes.

492
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,400
Now, just what...

493
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,840
Just what would possess you to have someone like this on your show?

494
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:45,780
Hmm.

495
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:51,780
I'm hoping the closer I can come to being involved with someone like the Reverend Stang

496
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:59,500
and J.R. Bob Dobbs, that maybe someday Jessica Hahn or Fawn Hall or Deborah Price or whoever

497
00:24:59,500 --> 00:24:59,960
she was...

498
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:00,080
Yes.

499
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:00,080


500
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:00,740
...will come to my house.

501
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,900
Maybe they'll come to my house.

502
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:03,180
Hey, you know who the best one is?

503
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:03,880
Who?

504
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,300
Tammy Faye.

505
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:06,160
Oh, yeah.

506
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,920
Tammy, if you're listening out there, I'll never forget that night, baby.

507
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,340
I love you.

508
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,980
Well, I just want to say that I think it might be Satan.

509
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,580
Might be what?

510
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,180
Satan.

511
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,140
Satan?

512
00:25:20,420 --> 00:25:20,680
Yeah.

513
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:21,900
Oh, who?

514
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,100
Who might be Satan?

515
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:27,440
Perhaps maybe Satan is possessed by Kevin to bring you on the show.

516
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:27,920


517
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:28,100
Oh.

518
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,180
Well, they might have made a deal or something.

519
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,520
I doubt if Kevin was possessed.

520
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:32,880
Yeah.

521
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,920
Oh, well, I...

522
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:35,400
I keep my payments up, Church Lady.

523
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,320
Oh, well, very good.

524
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,880
I want to ask a question.

525
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,920
Where can I buy my indulgence at?

526
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:46,700
Oh, now, the indulgences are available from the Catholic Church, which is a fairly large

527
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,880
mystical fellowship you may have heard of.

528
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:49,620
Oh, yes.

529
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,120
They're a minor rival of ours.

530
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,580
Well, I'm a Luthitarian.

531
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:55,140
A what?

532
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,080
A Luthitarian.

533
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,180
Uh-huh.

534
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:57,840
Uh-huh.

535
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,080
And it's an interesting church, too.

536
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,000
Yes, we would have to have you come out and do an evangelistic service for us.

537
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,940
Pay if the price is right, no problem.

538
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,580
Well, I'm sure we can arrange something.

539
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,480
Carl, thank you very much for calling.

540
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:09,980
Well, God bless.

541
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,160
Bye-bye.

542
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,940
And good morning, Norman.

543
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:14,400
Norman.

544
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:14,980
What's the reason?

545
00:26:15,060 --> 00:26:15,320
Ooh.

546
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,460
Oh, yeah.

547
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,500
That one's followed you around, I bet.

548
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,260
Well, if he's saying maybe you won't play, huh?

549
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:20,720
Pardon me?

550
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:25,040
If he's saying maybe you won't play that, uh, or you won't attempt to...

551
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,280
Yeah, that's kind of like our psychic coming up in the next hour.

552
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,780
The end of the world is coming, but he can tell us who's going to be president between now and then.

553
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,580
Well, did the Reverend ever explain to you what subgenius meant?

554
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:36,460
Uh...

555
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,880
As far as their connotations are concerned?

556
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,360
No, we didn't get into that today.

557
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,500
I was just wondering.

558
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:44,920
You know, I just kind of always took it on his face value.

559
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,080
Uh-huh.

560
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,780
Well, if you joined it, you would be subgenius, wouldn't you?

561
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:49,840
I believe so.

562
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,380
What is he going to be when he wakes up and starts breathing?

563
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,020
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

564
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:55,780
Tell you what.

565
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:57,200
I'm not going to turn...

566
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,320
I'm not going to turn my radio on Friday morning no more.

567
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:03,860
Because I thought the little imbibing I'd done last night would pass,

568
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:07,220
but I ran it back into a nightmare when the radio came on.

569
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,200
Stuff happens.

570
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,680
Thank you, Kevin.

571
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,120
Thanks very much for calling, Norman.

572
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,380
Yes, well, the slight man just reminded me of...

573
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:16,540
Yeah, people that send money in for no apparent reason.

574
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,000
Yes.

575
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,720
Okay, we don't want this part in here.

576
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,080
It gets up to some real...

577
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,540
Think of the balls you'll have.

578
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:25,260
You're too young to think about that, Bula balls.

579
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:26,240
Bells.

580
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,040
Okay, okay.

581
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,400
Now we've got to get to the parkway to have this amazing vision.

582
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,300
And it just blew me away.

583
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,180
I literally was just floored.

584
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:38,900
You know, after that thing, we were outside just buzzing

585
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:42,380
because the supreme artistic activity.

586
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:45,820
It's stuff like that that makes me feel bad about Wotan and junk.

587
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:48,720
I mean, I like Wotan because it assaults, hopefully,

588
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,780
and insults the normal majority.

589
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:56,320
But when I see stuff like that, that's what real show should be.

590
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:58,220
Yo, ha, ha!

591
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,640
I don't know where you'd start this tape.

592
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:03,120
I think this will be side one, even though it's actually probably side two.

593
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,880
Some old tape by Jacques de Mangegal.

594
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,380
What I'm going to do is inspect the, uh,

595
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:10,320
mucilus structure for some sheared, uh, donut balls, Sam.

596
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,900
So Hal marches away with the body of Hardy Chester.

597
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,980
Jim Herbst, the music plays now.

598
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,540
Here it is.

599
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:23,580
We're doing the Ed Holm show in Life in the Water.

600
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,940
We would like the first church and the last lad to present.

601
00:28:26,260 --> 00:28:26,720
Let's get it.

602
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,140
Present.

603
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,880
We present you with this check for $1,000.

604
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:29,460
Yes.

605
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,900
$1,000 right there.

606
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,900
$1,000.

607
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,480
And this is for you for services, rent.

608
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,240
You notice right there, it's all signed and everything.

609
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,380
And you're all here in Northland.

610
00:28:37,380 --> 00:28:39,680
There's 10% that goes for the agent's fee.

611
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:40,040
Oh, here.

612
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:40,360
Okay.

613
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,600
But, uh, we want to present you with what's left.

614
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,660
I get some, too, don't I?

615
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,120
What's left?

616
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:45,660
Shake it.

617
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,520
We want to present you with what's left of this check.

618
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,100
But, of course, there's the, uh, the traveling fee, which, of course, is enough.

619
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,520
But we'd like to present you with what's left of this check.

620
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:53,980
Oh, well, thank you.

621
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,200
You're doing such a good job of working your ass off.

622
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,580
But, of course, there's a little mic cut for doing it.

623
00:28:58,660 --> 00:28:59,700
And then there's graphic charges.

624
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:00,780
And then there's the audio thing.

625
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,620
And this, you redeem this, and you can get a donut.

626
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:02,980
Oh.

627
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:07,520
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

628
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,440
Yes, I had my pits pointed and my points pitted.

629
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,420
At the end home show.

630
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,240
And my ingrown hubcaps retooled.

631
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,620
And a lot of automotive work done on the old one.

632
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,780
Wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee, wee.

633
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,340
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

634
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,160
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

635
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:22,720
Show, show, show, show.

636
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,840
And I noticed that someone took the protective, um...

637
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,060
Oh, my God.

638
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,500
Here, I'll just put it back.

639
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,000
Put that condom, show condom back on.

640
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,440
Oh, the smell of rubber.

641
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:35,020
Yes, in order to...

642
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:35,820
It's exciting, all the little colors.

643
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,060
Have safe sex, like the subgenius sex.

644
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,560
You've got to keep these tips on the, uh, microphones here.

645
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,140
Well, it's going to be your parade this year,

646
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:43,860
because I'm not going to be there.

647
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:44,140
Okay.

648
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:45,000
My face is on fire.

649
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,220
Oh, hey, stop raining on that parade.

650
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:48,100
That's obscene.

651
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:50,440
They saved Hitler's mustache.

652
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,960
Starring Ronald Coleman and Vincent Price.

653
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,200
Wow, look at that mustache.

654
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:54,520
I'm a bum.

655
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:54,920
I'm a bum.

656
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:55,380
I'm a bum.

657
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:55,540
I'm a bum.

658
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:55,560
I'm a bum.

659
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:55,560


660
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:55,560


661
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:56,080
Noonday sun.

662
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,240
Yes, this mustache is all that's left

663
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,580
of a different way of life.

664
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:03,940
Look as it rises and expands.

665
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,100
It's moving.

666
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,820
Pretend to make it two, right?

667
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:09,280
Look at it against the sun,

668
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:13,080
that broken cross shining down upon the Bay Area.

669
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,940
I've never seen anything like it.

670
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,140
I met Fantasy Caller in an earlier life,

671
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,980
by the blue waters of the Nile.

672
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,540
And then her name was...

673
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:29,340
P-O-P-I-K-A-N-T...

674
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:30,700
��� Wid WHOLE ROIN-TON...

675
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:34,760
The

676
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:36,380
Andissant who is...

677
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:36,860
Like covert.

678
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:55,540
East into the were Department ofяти which meant, out-nial.

679
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:55,540


680
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,820
What's the...

681
00:30:57,820 --> 00:31:03,700
After that I was very sure that using drugs was a sin.

682
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,920
Note to true subgenii, we could not show this material to full-blood humans.

683
00:31:09,180 --> 00:31:18,300
The humiliation of finding out that truth would be too much for their pathetic human minds, or even worse, they may actually believe that THEY are subgenia!

684
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:23,100
Note to humans, why the hell are you even bothering reading this?

685
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:23,760
Why are you?

686
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,320
Well, if you don't get it, it seems obnoxious. You think it's stupid.

687
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:28,500
Why bother reading this?

688
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:36,920
Well, anyway, you think it's stupid, because although we understand how you think all too well, you can't for the life of you understand how WE think!

689
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,380
Hey, stop it. Hey, somebody, help me.

690
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:40,840
Okay.

691
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,100
Oh, he's beyond help now.

692
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,000
He's now?

693
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:46,380
He's pragmatized in little-collar hell.

694
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,780
Put him on the enlarge-o-scope.

695
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,620
That's right, there are three of them.

696
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:53,500
That's right here, the one-pole is here.

697
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,240
Are you ready to hunt them?

698
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:56,060
Here we go.

699
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:59,280
I remember how the humiliation of reading this was in my brain, how it sounded as it began to stop.

700
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,360
And I put my arms around my neck.

701
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:08,140
Then your flesh begins to sizzle, and your nose drops into your shirtbox.

702
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,200
Endless cigarette dough.

703
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,980
You should just get one of those 120-foot long ones.

704
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:10,920
Because I wouldn't think...

705
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:12,260
Roll it out there and have it come in a little...

706
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,740
I didn't buy an inflatable fallout shelter.

707
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:15,260
I couldn't.

708
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:17,660
I was the inflated American.

709
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,740
And then you can buy it in a reel.

710
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,760
And then you hear it.

711
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:21,060
Wow.

712
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,760
Even the robes of the church...

713
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,180
Sugar and dough.

714
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,180
They smell bad.

715
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,540
Listen everybody, the smell of burning...

716
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,180
Oh, burning flesh.

717
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,540
Every time I buy a doughnut, I don't understand.

718
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:29,940
Listen everybody.

719
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,720
Then it hits you, the smell of burning phlegm.

720
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,120
Phlegm, yeah, that's right, burning phlegm.

721
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:36,080
Listen everybody.

722
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,760
Early in the morning.

723
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,440
Doesn't anybody remember the smell of the burning phlegm?

724
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,040
Listen to me.

725
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,260
Beep, beep, beep.

726
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:43,560
Everybody please listen to me.

727
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,620
Who in the world could find this entertaining?

728
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,740
What a garbled mish-mash of mush.

729
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:49,900
I'm turning in my license.

730
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:50,660
Listen everybody, immediately, you.

731
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,480
And there he goes.

732
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:54,760
Call our savior.

733
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,740
Hey, hey, Dr. Hell, wait.

734
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,460
Don't, don't turn in your license.

735
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,020
It's too late, it's too heavy, I can't stop it.

736
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:06,020
You're not the way the great danger you are here.

737
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,400
Still don't.

738
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,220
We don't have the time.

739
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:09,820
Well, never mind that.

740
00:33:09,880 --> 00:33:14,460
We've got the five mat here, and dominatrix will pin you down to that mat, if you can

741
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,760
answer our special question.

742
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,480
Okay, I already owe ten dollars.

743
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,460
You do?

744
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,920
Well, send it post-paste.

745
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,180
Hmm, yes.

746
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:20,460
Force it.

747
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,540
Then the monster with arms akimbo, who just killed that caller, will come back.

748
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,320
Hmm, yes.

749
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,360
So I'm ready for the test quiz or whatever I have to do.

750
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,800
All right, here's your question, buddy, listen well.

751
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,160
Who is the eighth avtar of Vishnu?

752
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,420
Hmm, who or Falk?

753
00:33:36,120 --> 00:33:36,520
Falk.

754
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:38,160
Falk is sticking.

755
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,860
All right.

756
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:40,060
You have twenty seconds to respond.

757
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,540
Is there anything that you can give me to improvise the answer?

758
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,560
Yeah, here, catch this.

759
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:44,220
Yes.

760
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,260
Two, seven.

761
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:50,440
You know what I've learned from your show is that who is the most powerful?

762
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:50,440


763
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:50,440


764
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,360
Who's in broads or life?

765
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,300
I think that's what I've learned.

766
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:52,980
Who's in broads?

767
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:53,360
Yeah, right.

768
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:56,520
Who's in broads in the Mickey Spillane show of the second?

769
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:02,940
See, the answer to this question, folks, is the word live spelled backwards is evil, okay?

770
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:07,080
Okay, let's smoke some crack, and then we can have a heart attack and explode and catch

771
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:07,620
on fire.

772
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,300
Okay, okay.

773
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:10,060
And we can burn down some churches, too.

774
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:13,180
We heard your quizzes, what about your testes?

775
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:15,940
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha,

776
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,240
Something happened to my microphone once again.

777
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:33,380
I can't say what exactly, but a dense pot seem to have fallen over the stadium.

778
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,340
That crowd looks ugly.

779
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,720
I'm glad I'm not here.

780
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:39,440
That crowd looks ugly.

781
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,800
I'm glad I'm not here.

782
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,100
And with that, I'll...

783
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:44,900
So there.

784
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:45,920
Would you like to see...

785
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:47,440
a few words before leaving.

786
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:47,920
I'd be scared.

787
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:50,620
I'd be scared if Hal said that to you.

788
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,740
...toward the callers.

789
00:34:51,740 --> 00:34:53,400
Now, I want some consideration

790
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,320
on your part toward the callers.

791
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:55,900
Okay, I'm sorry.

792
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,300
That last caller, you just blew him up.

793
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,740
You didn't let him even say any more.

794
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,440
What?

795
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,500
I think your people are sick,

796
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,200
laughing at poor callers.

797
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:03,980
Well, I'm sick.

798
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:05,520
I'm going to send you a bomb.

799
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,660
I'm coming down to the station with my gun.

800
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:08,700
Oh, no, no, no, no.

801
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,780
You're talking about the packages

802
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,620
already here, remember?

803
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:10,980
Oh, okay.

804
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,420
The package I already gave you.

805
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,520
Yeah, the package I already gave you.

806
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:14,500
I didn't even look at it.

807
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:14,880
It's like that.

808
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,680
Okay, well, you practice.

809
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:16,140
We'll be back.

810
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:16,460
Come on.

811
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,000
We're going to be here.

812
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,720
...invacuate the building temporarily

813
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:19,880
owing to a bomb.

814
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:20,360
Why?

815
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,720
Oh, just because you got chosen.

816
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,280
You pressed your little collar,

817
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,480
your button head, and here you are.

818
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,440
But why do you listen to this show?

819
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,680
I mean, I must have something

820
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:29,940
to do at 5 a.m.

821
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,760
I'll buy that for a dollar.

822
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,160
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

823
00:35:36,940 --> 00:35:37,160
Oh!

824
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:47,820
This organization, started in 1889,

825
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,460
is part of what was known at that time

826
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,600
as the Minescience Religions.

827
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,360
Charles Fillmore was a crippled real estate sales man

828
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,680
who witnessed his wife Myrtle be miraculously healed

829
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:02,000
from the dreaded killer, tuberculosis.

830
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:05,040
This supposed cure was obtained through

831
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,140
mental healing and good quality treatment.

832
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:11,440
techniques. Myrtle Fillmore was heavily influenced by Christian science and the

833
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:16,140
writings of Mary Baker Eddy, particularly the book Science and Health with Key to

834
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:21,500
the Scriptures. The Fillmores taught, as did Eddy, that sickness, disease, and sin

835
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:26,140
were all an illusion and through proper thinking they would never materialize.

836
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:30,320
The Fillmores added a new belief to those of Eddy, the doctrine of

837
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:35,640
reincarnation. This false doctrine became a cornerstone of Unity teachings and

838
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:39,740
Unity, headquartered near Lee Summit, Missouri, became a forerunner of the

839
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:44,540
modern New Age movement. Most Christians who learn of Unity through their vast

840
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:49,620
mail-order materials or short radio spots are unaware that it is based on

841
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:54,940
false doctrine. The Watchman Bulletin is a radio ministry of...

842
00:36:54,940 --> 00:37:00,260
He said, number one, they're real. Too many competent witnesses. We've had an entire

843
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:04,460
SWAT team see these things, I think on two occasions.

844
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:05,620
We've had a number of witnesses who have been in the same room with him for a long time.

845
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:09,240
They've been chased by fighter pilots, airline pilots. We've tracked them on

846
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:14,940
radar. So in spite of all the the kooks who may have thought, you know, they saw

847
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,720
something, there is a core of hard data. Number two, he says they're not physical.

848
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,480
Now, he's a materialistic scientist, an agnostic. He says they're not physical.

849
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:29,680
Well, you say, how could that be? They leave impressions. I mean, you've checked it out

850
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,680
with engineers and they could tell you how heavy the object had to be to

851
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:35,600
compact the earth to this extent and they left me with a lot of questions. Well, that's what we're doing.

852
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,500
That was a brilliant...

853
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:38,220
A brilliant original statement.

854
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:38,220


855
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:45,400
story of a person who's just out, destroyer,

856
00:37:46,420 --> 00:38:03,100
yellow and black.

857
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,220
Because of the red evening, you start to turn around and then the red person

858
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:04,220


859
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:04,220


860
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,960
A yellow, a black, a rectangular.

861
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,800
A rectangular, yes.

862
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:10,180
And a what else?

863
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,880
Well, yellow, a black, a rectangular.

864
00:38:14,340 --> 00:38:15,700
A rectangular, yes.

865
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,160
What else?

866
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:22,340
Well, doctor, it has kind of black, a yellow, a black, a rectangular.

867
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:33,880
A yellow, a black, a rectangular.

868
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:20,120
A yellow, a black, a rectangular.

869
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:51,060
A yellow, a black, a rectangular.

870
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:53,400
Yay!

871
00:39:57,860 --> 00:39:59,040
So say it.

872
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:00,000
Say it.

873
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:01,860
Stupid!

874
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:11,240
Yes, it's time for a big cargo load early in the morning back to C-141.

875
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:14,380
Wake up and think, where are we going today?

876
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,300
I set the clock at 200 meters.

877
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:18,800
It is in the tree line.

878
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,940
Big pop, Rob.

879
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,700
We had to call away the...

880
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,820
Wrong patriotism this morning.

881
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,300
We're supposed to be behind all these guys now.

882
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,520
Okay, now we're on the ground.

883
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:29,460
We're advancing across a schoolyard.

884
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:31,440
It's like a video game.

885
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,460
I see a guy over there taking an RPG round.

886
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,700
Inside the building here, he might have wounded.

887
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,240
And we've got friendlies on the wire.

888
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,700
So you have to be careful of the way you lay around.

889
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:51,280
You can't just be zooming all over the show.

890
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:51,780
I don't know.

891
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:52,780
You're dropping the targets.

892
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,260
They're down here.

893
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:55,680
Who's down there?

894
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,660
Good guys?

895
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:57,760
Bad guys.

896
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:58,920
You have people here, right?

897
00:40:59,100 --> 00:40:59,360
Right.

898
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,200
Go work it out of hell, or don't go bring a chopper, they get.

899
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,420
Let's go, engineer!

900
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,440
Let's go, engineer!

901
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,140
Say it.

902
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,020
Say it.

903
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:15,860
Stupid.

904
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,940
The following story is true.

905
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:21,760
All the voices you will hear today are from the people who are in the building.

906
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:21,760


907
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,360
All the people here in the phone calls are the actual people involved in the unfolding of this bizarre tale.

908
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:30,460
Other portions of this story are told through dramatic recreations.

909
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:33,740
But all these scenes actually happened to me.

910
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,720
But I'm getting ahead of myself.

911
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,000
Let me begin at the beginning.

912
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,500
December 15th, 1982.

913
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,460
With Christmas only ten days away,

914
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,680
this cassette was far from complete.

915
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:51,980
I was in a state of isolation.

916
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:55,180
As I walked down Bleaker Street in Greenwich Village,

917
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:59,860
I tried to figure out what I could do to fill the remaining 20 minutes or so of the tape.

918
00:42:00,680 --> 00:42:07,040
Even so, I knew there was a good chance many people would actually receive this tape after December 25th.

919
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,860
I was at my wit's end when I spotted the small record shop.

920
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:18,780
Then and there, I decided that I would go in and find some really awful record and put it on the tape as a gag.

921
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:21,180
Thus started a chain of events,

922
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:21,740
and I was able to do it.

923
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,640
Unlike anything else that's ever happened to me.

924
00:42:24,160 --> 00:42:27,720
Hello there, my good-looking and probably very prosperous fellow.

925
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:29,480
How may I be of service to you today?

926
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:31,820
Well, I have kind of an unusual request.

927
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:34,700
This is the home of a hundred thousand albums.

928
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:37,300
Unusual we got, regular we got.

929
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:38,980
You see my diploma on the wall?

930
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:42,100
Master of recordology, vinyl callologist.

931
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,160
You name it, we got it.

932
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,480
Even you don't name it, we got it.

933
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:49,740
I would like to buy the worst record in the store.

934
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,120
You want to buy the what?

935
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:54,540
I want you to sell me the absolute worst record in the whole store.

936
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:57,300
The most god-awful thing you've ever heard.

937
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,260
I want it.

938
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,320
What's the matter with regular awful?

939
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,880
We got records by Kiss.

940
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,900
We got terrible Andy Williams.

941
00:43:04,260 --> 00:43:08,060
We got a vent guard classical that sounds like static from the radio.

942
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:15,240
I want you to rack your brain and find the one album out of all these here in the store that is truly the most revolting.

943
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,700
My brain, he wants I should rack.

944
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,780
Okay, let me rack for a minute.

945
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:22,220
Wait a minute, I just thought of it.

946
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:26,180
The one I use for the prop up the short leg on the breakfast nook table.

947
00:43:26,380 --> 00:43:27,740
For you, I get it.

948
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,060
Look at the schmutz on this thing here.

949
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:36,440
There you go my friend, the worst thing I ever heard.

950
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,740
The shags.

951
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,120
The shags.

952
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,760
He handed me an album with three young blonde girls pictured on the cover.

953
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:56,120
The liner notes said, the shags are real, pure, unaffected by outside influences.

954
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,960
Their music is different.

955
00:43:58,120 --> 00:43:59,140
It's theirs alone.

956
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:04,020
They will not change their music or style to meet the needs of a frustrated world.

957
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:06,940
I looked back at the shop down there.

958
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:08,440
Of course, the shags.

959
00:44:08,580 --> 00:44:09,860
Look at these three girls.

960
00:44:10,340 --> 00:44:14,280
Sixes from the suburbs with hundred dollar guitars but they don't know how they're playing.

961
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:17,780
I guarantee this album is the one for you.

962
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:19,360
Could you play me just a little bit?

963
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:20,180
I'd like to hear it.

964
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:22,140
You want I should drive away my customers?

965
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,100
Just a little bit.

966
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,980
You drive a hard bung.

967
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:27,060
Here look, you play the record.

968
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:29,200
Just wait till I get out in the other room.

969
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:33,660
Okay, my fingers I'm putting in the ears.

970
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:36,400
Listen, but please not for too long.

971
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:42,640
It was then, for the first time, that I actually encountered the music of the shags.

972
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,120
One of them, Ahound.

973
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:06,940
Well this is the first one.

974
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:06,960


975
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:06,960


976
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:07,980
Yeah, you gotta be fucking serious that.

977
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:09,380
Pretty let's play that way.

978
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:12,040
Eh, sorry.

979
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:12,580
Yeah.

980
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,640
My pal's name is Footfoot, he always likes to roam

981
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:28,920
My pal's name is Footfoot, I never find him home

982
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:32,520
I go to his house, knock at his door

983
00:45:32,520 --> 00:45:37,560
People come out and say, Footfoot, don't live here no more

984
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:41,440
My pal Footfoot, always likes to roam

985
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:45,560
My pal Footfoot, he has no home

986
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,540
Where will Footfoot go?

987
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:49,100
What will Footfoot do?

988
00:45:49,220 --> 00:45:52,480
Oh, Footfoot, I wish I could find you

989
00:45:54,180 --> 00:45:57,860
Quite frankly, I was intrigued. It was awful, all right.

990
00:45:58,140 --> 00:46:01,620
But how did it ever get on a record? And who were the Shags?

991
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:03,100
I had to find out.

992
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,600
My next stop was just around the corner where my friend Steve lived.

993
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:09,660
He's a musical connoisseur, very knowledgeable.

994
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:11,120
When I showed him the album,

995
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:13,480
he thought it was a put-on, a joke.

996
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,760
When I played him a song called

997
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,220
That Little Sports Car,

998
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,480
he was convinced.

999
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:27,820
There was a sports car on the road

1000
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:31,420
I thought I knew the fella that drove

1001
00:46:31,420 --> 00:46:34,920
That little sports car was slippery like an oyster

1002
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:39,760
Following the bus like riding on a roller coaster

1003
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,180
On a roller coaster

1004
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,420
On a roller coaster

1005
00:46:42,420 --> 00:46:43,200
On a roller coaster

1006
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:43,900
On a roller coaster

1007
00:46:45,340 --> 00:46:45,820
On a roller coaster

1008
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:45,820


1009
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:45,820


1010
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:45,820


1011
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:45,820


1012
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:45,820


1013
00:46:45,820 --> 00:46:48,880
Oh, God, it was the most incredible thing I'd ever heard.

1014
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:52,720
It was so bad, I was positive the whole thing was a put-on.

1015
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,820
And I told my name, he said he thought it was for real

1016
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:59,560
and that these really were just some kids who couldn't play so good.

1017
00:46:59,740 --> 00:47:02,580
Well, we argued about it a bit, but it didn't get anywhere,

1018
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:03,640
so I let it drop.

1019
00:47:03,940 --> 00:47:06,060
Little did I know at the time

1020
00:47:06,060 --> 00:47:09,320
that the Shags were to become an obsession with noise.

1021
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:11,420
Well, you see, he had to play.

1022
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:11,420


1023
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:11,420


1024
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:11,420


1025
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:11,420


1026
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:12,740
He had to find out who they were

1027
00:47:12,740 --> 00:47:14,820
and what the truth of the matter was.

1028
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:15,860
It was all ridiculous.

1029
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,700
I listened to the Shags' music all through that night,

1030
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,940
which passed in a haze.

1031
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:23,940
The next thing I remember is some cop

1032
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:26,220
trying to talk me down off a well-known Manhattan bridge.

1033
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,780
Well, maybe that part of the story isn't quite true.

1034
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,660
But then began an endless series of phone calls.

1035
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:33,020
Where were the Shags?

1036
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,920
Had this record died in obscurity

1037
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:37,500
or were others similarly afflicted by its music?

1038
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,500
I found nothing.

1039
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,140
Then,

1040
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:43,300
something I had overlooked leapt out at me.

1041
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:45,400
A list of thank yous on the record's jacket

1042
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,640
and, among them, a newspaper.

1043
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:48,580
The Exeter, New Hampshire newsletter.

1044
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,620
It was a slim chance, but I was clutching at straws now.

1045
00:47:51,780 --> 00:47:52,880
With trembling hands,

1046
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:55,040
my lanky fingers pressed out the phone number.

1047
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,580
Good afternoon, newsletter.

1048
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:06,540
Yes, I'm wondering if somebody there can help me.

1049
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:09,280
I'm trying to track down a musical group

1050
00:48:09,280 --> 00:48:10,800
named the Shags.

1051
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:12,600
Okay, just a moment.

1052
00:48:12,740 --> 00:48:13,120
Okay.

1053
00:48:14,860 --> 00:48:15,900
Mary Kroener speaking.

1054
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:16,600
Yes.

1055
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:20,000
These are three young girls or girls.

1056
00:48:20,260 --> 00:48:20,740
Yes.

1057
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:23,700
In the back of my mind, this is all very familiar,

1058
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:25,040
why it's familiar.

1059
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:27,600
And I don't think that this is real recent,

1060
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,740
but they were around this area

1061
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,140
and they're a local family, I think.

1062
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:33,660
Uh-huh.

1063
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:35,780
But more than that,

1064
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:37,780
is there something about Wiggin on there?

1065
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:41,020
Wiggin, it was produced by an Austin Wiggin Jr.

1066
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,080
and the three members of the group

1067
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:47,460
are Betty, Helen, and Dorothy Wiggin.

1068
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,400
And if you'd heard their music,

1069
00:48:49,460 --> 00:48:51,780
I don't think you would have ever forgotten it.

1070
00:48:51,980 --> 00:48:53,100
Well, the only...

1071
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,520
And what's the name of the other...

1072
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,480
The group is called the Shags.

1073
00:48:57,480 --> 00:48:58,320
Yeah, I know that.

1074
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,680
That's Wiggin.

1075
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,400
Mm-hmm.

1076
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,420
But you say you do vaguely remember them?

1077
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:03,480
I do, but I can't...

1078
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:05,040
That's all I do is vaguely.

1079
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,480
I don't know why I remember or what...

1080
00:49:08,480 --> 00:49:11,180
I can't remember who I was talking to about.

1081
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:11,780
I don't remember these people

1082
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:13,360
because I don't feel like it was like

1083
00:49:13,360 --> 00:49:15,000
more than six to eight months ago

1084
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,880
and I don't know why.

1085
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:16,480
Uh-huh.

1086
00:49:16,560 --> 00:49:17,640
It's just, it really,

1087
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,840
it's a complete blank at this point.

1088
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:22,120
Okay, and the only other names

1089
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,500
on the back of the album here

1090
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:26,000
are Kathy and Bob Olive,

1091
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,040
Gene, Sebulkin,

1092
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:29,540
Ernest Hatzis,

1093
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:30,840
Charles Nuddings,

1094
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:31,620
Ben...

1095
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,900
Boy, that's a tough one to pronounce.

1096
00:49:34,380 --> 00:49:35,740
Swiznicki or something like that.

1097
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:36,260
Swiznicki.

1098
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:36,900
I know who...

1099
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:38,960
I know exactly how it all comes through to me.

1100
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,760
Call Ben's Photoshop in Exeter.

1101
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:45,780
Ben's?

1102
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:46,440
Yep.

1103
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:47,260
Photoshop.

1104
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:49,000
That's exactly what's all...

1105
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,800
I know exactly what it is now.

1106
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:51,740
What was it exactly?

1107
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:52,580
I, that's, I mean,

1108
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:53,800
I know that he was the one

1109
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:54,680
that was talking about him

1110
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,060
and, um, he knows all about him.

1111
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,080
I managed to strike the chord.

1112
00:49:59,240 --> 00:49:59,960
How ironic.

1113
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:01,660
Something the Shags

1114
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,880
have never been able to do.

1115
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,740
I called Ben's Photoshop.

1116
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:06,100
Good afternoon, Ben's Photo.

1117
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,960
Yes, is, uh, Ben Szczynski there, please?

1118
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:09,980
Sure, just a minute, please.

1119
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:11,560
Hello?

1120
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:12,840
Yes, uh, Ben?

1121
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:13,280
Yeah.

1122
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:15,300
Uh, I'm trying to get some information

1123
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:17,960
about a musical group called the Shags.

1124
00:50:18,280 --> 00:50:20,620
I took the only thing I had involved with them,

1125
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:22,420
I took, uh, four photographs

1126
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,360
while they're, uh,

1127
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,780
they're on stage here in Exeter.

1128
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:27,400
I could tell he was scared.

1129
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:28,720
Are they coming back?

1130
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,280
I don't know.

1131
00:50:30,740 --> 00:50:31,700
I think they were,

1132
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:33,220
they're promoting their, uh,

1133
00:50:34,540 --> 00:50:35,440
their, uh,

1134
00:50:35,940 --> 00:50:37,780
record or recordings that they made.

1135
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:38,580
They, uh, you know,

1136
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,540
originated their own music and everything.

1137
00:50:40,840 --> 00:50:40,920
Uh-huh.

1138
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:41,080
You know,

1139
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:41,820
they were, uh,

1140
00:50:42,020 --> 00:50:42,820
quite the threesome.

1141
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:44,400
They didn't know whether

1142
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,400
they were ahead of their time

1143
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:46,820
or what,

1144
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,600
where they fitted into the picture

1145
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:49,720
with the music that they had,

1146
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:51,220
but the girls, uh,

1147
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,100
the girl,

1148
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:52,620
one of the,

1149
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:53,460
one of the girls,

1150
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:54,800
the one I'm thinking about now

1151
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:55,640
is married,

1152
00:50:55,700 --> 00:50:56,900
her name is Semprini.

1153
00:50:59,180 --> 00:50:59,620
So,

1154
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:01,980
hiding out under an assumed name,

1155
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:03,200
but would Ben,

1156
00:51:03,320 --> 00:51:04,260
the friendly photographer,

1157
00:51:04,500 --> 00:51:05,900
be able to lead me to her?

1158
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,400
And we're checking

1159
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:08,440
the phone number now.

1160
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,340
Do you have any other

1161
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:10,280
recollections of them

1162
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:10,840
when they were,

1163
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:11,060
when they were,

1164
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:11,060


1165
00:51:11,060 --> 00:51:11,680
were performing?

1166
00:51:11,740 --> 00:51:12,940
Were they a local hit or?

1167
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:13,740
Well,

1168
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,220
they were well-known in the area

1169
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:15,800
and, uh,

1170
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:16,500
their father,

1171
00:51:16,580 --> 00:51:17,660
he was their manager

1172
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:19,020
and they did get around

1173
00:51:19,020 --> 00:51:19,680
and, uh,

1174
00:51:19,740 --> 00:51:19,940
yes,

1175
00:51:19,940 --> 00:51:21,080
they were well-liked

1176
00:51:21,080 --> 00:51:21,460
and, uh,

1177
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:22,900
have you played the record at all?

1178
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:23,540
Yes, I have.

1179
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:24,000
Uh-huh.

1180
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:25,340
It's, it's, uh,

1181
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:25,900
very different

1182
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:26,820
and very unusual.

1183
00:51:27,080 --> 00:51:27,240
Yeah.

1184
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:28,580
The odd part of it is,

1185
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:28,880
you know,

1186
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:30,180
they gave me one of the first

1187
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:31,200
pressings they had.

1188
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:31,720
Oh, yeah?

1189
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:32,680
We ought to hang on to it.

1190
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,940
It's probably a collector's item.

1191
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,380
And I'm not even in the,

1192
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:35,640
you know,

1193
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,440
I'm not really musically minded.

1194
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,160
I'm a photographer.

1195
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:38,700
Uh-huh.

1196
00:51:38,700 --> 00:51:39,140
I don't have time to look at pictures.

1197
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:40,500
I don't have time to look at,

1198
00:51:40,580 --> 00:51:41,420
so anyhow,

1199
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:41,960
listen to records.

1200
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:42,560
But anyhow,

1201
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:42,940
uh,

1202
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,240
I remember they gave me

1203
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,100
one of the first ones

1204
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:46,860
and I remember seeing the jacket on it

1205
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:48,160
and I filed that away somewhere.

1206
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:48,540
Yeah.

1207
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,760
Did you ever listen to the record?

1208
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:50,260
Uh,

1209
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:51,960
I think I did when I first got it.

1210
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:52,640
And do you recall

1211
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:53,580
what your impressions were?

1212
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,280
Well,

1213
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:55,080
like you say,

1214
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:55,620
it's different

1215
00:51:55,620 --> 00:51:57,420
and I have to think of,

1216
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:57,580
uh,

1217
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,860
as I think of the girls

1218
00:51:58,860 --> 00:51:59,560
and, uh,

1219
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:00,660
listen to the music,

1220
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:00,900
uh,

1221
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,100
I couldn't figure out

1222
00:52:02,100 --> 00:52:03,080
whether it was country music

1223
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:03,620
or whatever.

1224
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,140
They're pretty girls, too.

1225
00:52:05,280 --> 00:52:06,520
I remember the chubby one

1226
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,740
was the one behind the drums.

1227
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:08,400
Yeah.

1228
00:52:08,400 --> 00:52:08,860
I said,

1229
00:52:08,900 --> 00:52:09,040
now,

1230
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:10,280
if I'm going to take your picture

1231
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,000
from this angle,

1232
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:12,200
I think what you better do

1233
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:13,120
is rearrange yourself

1234
00:52:13,120 --> 00:52:13,860
a little bit.

1235
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:15,300
So I was just saying

1236
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:16,620
that she felt very comfortable

1237
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,500
but I thought her knees

1238
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,700
should be a little closer together.

1239
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:19,440
Uh-huh.

1240
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,280
That's the part I remember

1241
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:22,100
because she was a little

1242
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:22,860
on the chubby side.

1243
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,720
It's an odd thing to remember,

1244
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:25,280
but anyhow.

1245
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:26,880
Well,

1246
00:52:26,980 --> 00:52:27,400
I tell you,

1247
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:28,740
we seem to have mislaid that.

1248
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:29,320
Oh, no.

1249
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:29,900
Yeah,

1250
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:30,860
but that's all right.

1251
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:32,060
I think we can get it.

1252
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:32,920
Do you know which,

1253
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:33,580
which of the...

1254
00:52:33,580 --> 00:52:33,620
Oh, wait a second.

1255
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:35,400
She's got it.

1256
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:39,620
At last,

1257
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:41,080
it appeared my quest

1258
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:42,400
was nearing an end.

1259
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,180
But my newfound friend,

1260
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:44,520
Ben,

1261
00:52:44,660 --> 00:52:46,420
still had an incredible revelation

1262
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:47,300
up his sleeve.

1263
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,620
It seemed that

1264
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:49,940
I was not the first

1265
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,820
to seek out the shags.

1266
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:53,480
Uh-huh.

1267
00:52:53,560 --> 00:52:54,660
And had you called

1268
00:52:54,660 --> 00:52:55,500
about this before?

1269
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:56,100
No.

1270
00:52:56,180 --> 00:52:57,220
Because there have been

1271
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:58,400
other people calling

1272
00:52:58,400 --> 00:52:59,840
in the past.

1273
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,240
The,

1274
00:53:01,400 --> 00:53:02,140
who was it,

1275
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:03,080
the Rolling Stones

1276
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,240
magazine,

1277
00:53:04,580 --> 00:53:05,600
this was a couple

1278
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:06,300
years ago.

1279
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,760
Rolling Stone magazine?

1280
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:11,580
This was a rumor

1281
00:53:11,580 --> 00:53:12,560
I had to check out

1282
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:12,980
for myself.

1283
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:21,000
Rolling Stone?

1284
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:21,960
Yes,

1285
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:22,860
I'm calling up

1286
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:23,900
to see if perhaps

1287
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:24,780
anyone there

1288
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:25,180
could give me

1289
00:53:25,180 --> 00:53:25,680
some information

1290
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,260
about an obscure

1291
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:28,240
rock and roll group

1292
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:28,880
that might have been

1293
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,020
written up in Rolling Stone,

1294
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:31,020
I don't know,

1295
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,100
maybe a year or two ago.

1296
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:32,660
Uh-huh.

1297
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,780
It's a group called

1298
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,540
The Shags.

1299
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:35,400
Oh, yeah.

1300
00:53:35,500 --> 00:53:36,280
All girl groups.

1301
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:36,860
Right.

1302
00:53:37,100 --> 00:53:37,420
Uh-huh.

1303
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:39,160
You're familiar with them?

1304
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:39,360
Yeah.

1305
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:40,140
Did the magazine

1306
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:41,360
write them up at some point?

1307
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:42,720
Maybe, hang on.

1308
00:53:43,860 --> 00:53:44,300
Chris,

1309
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:45,840
are you familiar

1310
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:47,380
with any piece

1311
00:53:47,380 --> 00:53:48,640
we've done on the shags?

1312
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,180
Did we do one

1313
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,500
last year?

1314
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:53,880
Yeah, we did one

1315
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:54,320
last year

1316
00:53:54,320 --> 00:53:55,380
on the Dolly Parton issue.

1317
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,540
Available at my

1318
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,240
local library.

1319
00:53:58,500 --> 00:53:59,300
I don't know,

1320
00:53:59,340 --> 00:53:59,940
it depends about

1321
00:53:59,940 --> 00:54:00,480
your library,

1322
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:02,360
but we have

1323
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,400
back issues here on,

1324
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:03,500
too.

1325
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:03,840
Have you ever

1326
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,600
heard this group?

1327
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:05,500
No, I've never

1328
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:06,020
heard them, no.

1329
00:54:06,300 --> 00:54:07,000
They are,

1330
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:07,840
uh,

1331
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,160
you have to hear them.

1332
00:54:10,260 --> 00:54:10,900
I know, I've heard

1333
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:11,440
a lot of good things

1334
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:11,920
about them.

1335
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:12,880
Have you?

1336
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,180
What have you heard?

1337
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:14,780
What's the talk

1338
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:15,200
there been?

1339
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:17,940
Well, what I've heard

1340
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,660
is simply that

1341
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:19,700
they're different,

1342
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:20,840
but after you listen

1343
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:21,300
to them a while,

1344
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:21,900
you understand that

1345
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:22,420
there's a lot more

1346
00:54:22,420 --> 00:54:23,480
going on than you realize.

1347
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,360
But I have yet

1348
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:25,800
to hear them,

1349
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,400
so I don't know.

1350
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:27,240
Uh-huh.

1351
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:28,240
I picked up a copy

1352
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:28,780
of the album

1353
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:29,980
down at Village Oldies

1354
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:32,520
when I walked in

1355
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:33,240
and said to them,

1356
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:34,320
what's the worst album

1357
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:34,800
that you have

1358
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,340
in the store?

1359
00:54:35,560 --> 00:54:36,160
Oh, my God.

1360
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:36,480
I got it.

1361
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:36,720
Yeah.

1362
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:37,660
He gave you that?

1363
00:54:37,820 --> 00:54:38,320
And he gave me

1364
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:39,040
the shags, yeah.

1365
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:40,300
Well, they're supposed,

1366
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,440
well, it's obscure.

1367
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,780
It's obscure

1368
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,420
and perhaps deservedly so.

1369
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,160
Well, I, like I said,

1370
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:46,940
I've never heard them,

1371
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,200
but I...

1372
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:47,700
But there's somebody

1373
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:48,500
there who's,

1374
00:54:48,500 --> 00:54:49,620
who's obviously

1375
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:51,700
dug into their music,

1376
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:53,520
which upon first hearing

1377
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:54,560
is pretty horrendous.

1378
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:54,880
Yeah?

1379
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,540
I would say

1380
00:54:55,540 --> 00:54:56,820
leaning toward the hideous

1381
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,620
and, and, and

1382
00:54:58,620 --> 00:54:59,800
pulled something

1383
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,320
out of it

1384
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:01,820
that in all probability

1385
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:03,120
is not really there,

1386
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,800
as Rolling Stone

1387
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:05,640
is wont to do

1388
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:05,880
from,

1389
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:06,820
from time to time.

1390
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,240
I'd love to speak

1391
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:10,000
to whoever it was

1392
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:10,940
who wrote this article.

1393
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:11,740
Hang on, Chris,

1394
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:12,860
you know who wrote the piece?

1395
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:15,860
Oh, hang on.

1396
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:16,180
Okay.

1397
00:55:17,980 --> 00:55:18,380
Hello?

1398
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:19,080
Chris?

1399
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:19,480
Yes.

1400
00:55:19,660 --> 00:55:21,080
I'm calling about the shags.

1401
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:21,560
Mm-hmm.

1402
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:22,700
Did you write up the group

1403
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:23,720
for Rolling Stone?

1404
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:24,480
Yes, I did.

1405
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:31,720
You know,

1406
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:32,660
it was brought to my attention

1407
00:55:32,660 --> 00:55:34,520
by my editor at the time,

1408
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:35,300
who was Mark Kirkaby,

1409
00:55:35,460 --> 00:55:35,620
who,

1410
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:36,580
I mean,

1411
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:37,980
the record soon became a legend.

1412
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:38,560
It wasn't,

1413
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:39,480
it didn't take long

1414
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,900
until people were playing it

1415
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:41,340
in the office

1416
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,440
and marveling at it.

1417
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:43,640
So we decided

1418
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:44,820
we had to do a story on it

1419
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:46,480
and I got assigned to do it.

1420
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,000
Uh-huh.

1421
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,240
And what's your opinion

1422
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:49,840
of the album?

1423
00:55:50,180 --> 00:55:50,960
Oh, I think it's,

1424
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:51,660
it's so bad,

1425
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:52,180
it's terrific.

1426
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:53,420
Uh-huh.

1427
00:55:53,460 --> 00:55:54,380
Okay, now we're,

1428
00:55:54,380 --> 00:55:55,120
now we're down to,

1429
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:55,760
to cases.

1430
00:55:55,860 --> 00:55:56,460
It's so bad,

1431
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,020
it's terrific.

1432
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:57,460
Uh-huh.

1433
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:57,640
Yeah.

1434
00:55:58,440 --> 00:55:59,740
And what was the,

1435
00:55:59,880 --> 00:56:00,360
I mean,

1436
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,080
did you actually

1437
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:02,400
say this record

1438
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:02,980
is so bad

1439
00:56:02,980 --> 00:56:03,940
that it's good?

1440
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:04,760
I said it was unique.

1441
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:05,620
Unique?

1442
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,020
Yeah.

1443
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:06,680
So in other words,

1444
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:07,620
you sort of couched

1445
00:56:07,620 --> 00:56:08,140
your phrases

1446
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:08,560
when you,

1447
00:56:08,580 --> 00:56:09,040
when you spoke

1448
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,060
to the members,

1449
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:10,940
the ex-members

1450
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:11,480
of the band,

1451
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:12,020
I assume they were.

1452
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:12,560
More or less, yes.

1453
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:12,980
Yeah.

1454
00:56:13,380 --> 00:56:13,740
Are,

1455
00:56:13,760 --> 00:56:14,680
are they aware

1456
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,940
of the true nature

1457
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:18,660
of their musical talents?

1458
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:19,560
I'm not sure.

1459
00:56:20,340 --> 00:56:20,780
I mean,

1460
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:21,080
it's,

1461
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:21,460
it's very,

1462
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:22,960
it's very entertaining music.

1463
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:24,260
You think so?

1464
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:24,680
Yeah.

1465
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:26,300
I mean,

1466
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:27,240
I always have a great time

1467
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:27,980
when I listen to it.

1468
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:29,380
And it's,

1469
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:29,700
I mean,

1470
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:29,900
it's just.

1471
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:30,600
Are you taking chemicals

1472
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,380
into your body

1473
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:32,020
at this time?

1474
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:32,440


1475
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:32,560
I mean,

1476
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:32,920
it's,

1477
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,080
in rock and roll,

1478
00:56:34,080 --> 00:56:34,680
rock and roll

1479
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:35,340
was never really

1480
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,600
about instrumental proficiency.

1481
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:37,480
Well,

1482
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:37,780
actually,

1483
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,860
it was a legend

1484
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,800
even before we,

1485
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:41,340
we did something on it.

1486
00:56:41,460 --> 00:56:42,060
You're kidding.

1487
00:56:42,320 --> 00:56:42,520
No,

1488
00:56:42,540 --> 00:56:42,960
it got,

1489
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:43,860
it was so bad,

1490
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,680
it got a lot of attention.

1491
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:45,940
At the time?

1492
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:46,380
Right off,

1493
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:46,600
yeah.

1494
00:56:47,820 --> 00:56:48,180
Yeah,

1495
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:48,880
I was even surprised

1496
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:49,580
it didn't show up

1497
00:56:49,580 --> 00:56:50,760
on the top 200 chart

1498
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:51,720
because a lot of people

1499
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,120
in the press

1500
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:52,760
were talking about it.

1501
00:56:52,840 --> 00:56:53,140
I mean,

1502
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:53,860
they got a lot of attention.

1503
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:54,740
This was a record

1504
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:55,900
that could not be passed up.

1505
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:56,780
So,

1506
00:56:56,820 --> 00:56:57,500
they're famous.

1507
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,940
For a moment.

1508
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,000
They had their 15 minutes,

1509
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:00,960
let's put it that way.

1510
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:01,400
Uh-huh,

1511
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:01,920
right.

1512
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:02,600
I think they passed

1513
00:57:02,600 --> 00:57:03,220
into obscurity.

1514
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:03,760
My understanding

1515
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,460
is that there is

1516
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:05,320
another record of theirs

1517
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:06,380
coming out very soon,

1518
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:06,680
though.

1519
00:57:07,040 --> 00:57:07,860
Another collection

1520
00:57:07,860 --> 00:57:08,340
of old songs

1521
00:57:08,340 --> 00:57:08,640
called

1522
00:57:08,640 --> 00:57:09,720
The Shag Zone Thing,

1523
00:57:11,300 --> 00:57:12,140
which will feature

1524
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:12,740
cover versions

1525
00:57:12,740 --> 00:57:13,240
of Michelle

1526
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:14,000
by the Beatles.

1527
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:15,940
It boggles the mind.

1528
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:17,100
It does boggle the mind.

1529
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:18,440
It does boggle the mind.

1530
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:18,860
I've been,

1531
00:57:18,860 --> 00:57:19,740
I've been counting

1532
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:20,180
the minutes,

1533
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:20,600
you know.

1534
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:21,780
Yeah.

1535
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:22,060
There's still time

1536
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,580
to get a visa

1537
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:23,340
to leave the country.

1538
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:23,760
Well,

1539
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:24,040
we can,

1540
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:24,860
it gives us something

1541
00:57:24,860 --> 00:57:25,360
to live for,

1542
00:57:25,420 --> 00:57:25,560
though.

1543
00:57:25,620 --> 00:57:25,980
It does,

1544
00:57:26,020 --> 00:57:26,360
it does.

1545
00:57:26,580 --> 00:57:27,260
It really does.

1546
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:29,220
There isn't much more

1547
00:57:29,220 --> 00:57:29,620
to say,

1548
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:30,860
except all I can tell you

1549
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:31,160
is that they're all

1550
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:32,280
living in trailer homes now,

1551
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:33,180
and they're all married.

1552
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:34,660
Yeah.

1553
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,120
They're happier

1554
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:35,900
than the average

1555
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:37,040
rock and roll musician,

1556
00:57:37,300 --> 00:57:38,300
so good for them.

1557
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:39,600
The time had come

1558
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,400
to get the story

1559
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,540
from the horse's mouth.

1560
00:57:41,840 --> 00:57:43,080
With trembling hands,

1561
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:44,120
I placed a call

1562
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:45,080
to Dot Wiggins,

1563
00:57:45,260 --> 00:57:46,280
alias Semprini.

1564
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:54,900
Hello?

1565
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:58,380
Uh, hello.

1566
00:57:58,460 --> 00:57:59,580
Is this Dot speaking?

1567
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,280
Yes.

1568
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,540
I'm calling because

1569
00:58:06,540 --> 00:58:07,520
of the shags.

1570
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:08,180
Uh-huh.

1571
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,040
I thought maybe you could

1572
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,200
give me a little information

1573
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:10,680
on it.

1574
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:12,080
Oh, sure.

1575
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:14,060
Do you ever get together

1576
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:14,800
and play anymore?

1577
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:15,660
No,

1578
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:16,640
we still have

1579
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:17,260
all the instruments,

1580
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,840
but everybody kind of

1581
00:58:19,420 --> 00:58:20,020
drifted away,

1582
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:20,920
and, you know,

1583
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:21,440
we all have

1584
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,160
our own individual lives.

1585
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,560
We used to play

1586
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:26,800
for volunteers,

1587
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,620
for patients,

1588
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:28,760
like at a county home,

1589
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:29,480
nursing home,

1590
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:30,840
but we haven't even done that.

1591
00:58:30,880 --> 00:58:31,560
We haven't done nothing

1592
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,740
for, well,

1593
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:33,480
at least two years.

1594
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:34,260
Yeah, you know,

1595
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:34,980
it was just something

1596
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,840
that we did at the time,

1597
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:38,820
and it never went anywhere,

1598
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:39,920
and we never

1599
00:58:40,740 --> 00:58:41,740
did anything with it,

1600
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:42,120
so we thought

1601
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:42,920
that would be the end of it.

1602
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:43,880
We'd never hear of it again.

1603
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:45,680
So it was really a surprise.

1604
00:58:46,140 --> 00:58:47,040
Did you have

1605
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:48,220
a lot of musical training,

1606
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:48,820
or...?

1607
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:49,920
Yeah, we took

1608
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,100
guitar lessons

1609
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:51,880
for,

1610
00:58:52,980 --> 00:58:53,680
I don't know,

1611
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,420
it seemed like forever

1612
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:55,000
at the time.

1613
00:58:55,180 --> 00:58:56,560
We did our high school

1614
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,220
at home

1615
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,140
through mail

1616
00:58:58,140 --> 00:58:59,460
so that we would have time

1617
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,260
to also do

1618
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:01,120
our music lessons.

1619
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:02,300
We had singing lessons

1620
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:03,640
and music lessons.

1621
00:59:04,300 --> 00:59:04,680
We went,

1622
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:06,600
one night a week

1623
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:07,840
we went to Manchester

1624
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:09,120
for guitar lessons,

1625
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:10,260
and then another night a week

1626
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:11,020
we went to Manchester

1627
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,960
for voice lessons.

1628
00:59:13,180 --> 00:59:14,500
I know the second album

1629
00:59:14,500 --> 00:59:15,560
as far as songs go

1630
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:16,840
are better than the first album.

1631
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:17,120
Oh, yeah?

1632
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:17,820
Because we knew more

1633
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:18,520
of what we were doing.

1634
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:19,040
Yeah.

1635
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:20,500
So it should sell better.

1636
00:59:20,980 --> 00:59:21,860
I guess you sold

1637
00:59:21,860 --> 00:59:22,640
a lot of these records

1638
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,640
right in the local area there.

1639
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:26,900
I don't know.

1640
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:27,720
We didn't,

1641
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:28,940
like I said,

1642
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,820
we recorded the album.

1643
00:59:30,900 --> 00:59:33,060
My father got a box of them

1644
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:35,020
from the record recording company

1645
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:36,220
and they were supposed

1646
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:37,500
to distribute the others

1647
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,680
and I guess they did

1648
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:39,840
but we assumed they didn't

1649
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,500
because we never heard

1650
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:41,220
a word from anybody

1651
00:59:41,220 --> 00:59:43,300
until like two years ago.

1652
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:45,640
So to my knowledge

1653
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:46,940
they weren't sold at all.

1654
00:59:47,120 --> 00:59:48,720
The man that my father

1655
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:49,260
dealt with

1656
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:49,920
we just thought

1657
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:50,740
he was a crook

1658
00:59:51,260 --> 00:59:52,700
and he took my father's money

1659
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:54,180
and gave us one box of albums

1660
00:59:54,180 --> 00:59:54,580
and ran

1661
00:59:54,580 --> 00:59:55,960
because he was supposed

1662
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:56,760
to distribute them

1663
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:57,600
and, you know,

1664
00:59:57,620 --> 00:59:58,660
keep us informed

1665
00:59:58,660 --> 00:59:59,520
and we never heard

1666
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:00,080
a word from him.

1667
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:02,720
We tried to contact him.

1668
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:03,640
We got lawyers after.

1669
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:04,700
Nobody could find him

1670
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,120
so I don't know what happened.

1671
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:06,880
I guess there was

1672
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:07,700
two or three other people

1673
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:08,540
looking for him too.

1674
01:00:08,680 --> 01:00:08,880
Yeah.

1675
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:09,760
I just figured

1676
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:10,560
he split the country.

1677
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:13,320
Well, you've got the last laugh,

1678
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:14,040
that's for sure.

1679
01:00:14,420 --> 01:00:15,060
That's true.

1680
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,080
And it is true too.

1681
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:20,180
The way the case had turned out

1682
01:00:20,180 --> 01:00:21,400
had surprised me, kind of.

1683
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:22,600
I'd wandered into

1684
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:23,300
that record store

1685
01:00:23,300 --> 01:00:24,440
looking for something awful,

1686
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:25,340
something laughable

1687
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:26,360
and I found it.

1688
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:28,000
But I found much more.

1689
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:29,720
I found a story

1690
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:30,680
that was at once

1691
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:31,880
hilarious and poignant.

1692
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:32,700
It wasn't,

1693
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:33,120
it wasn't just about

1694
01:00:33,120 --> 01:00:33,900
some deluded kids

1695
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:35,100
who thought they had talent.

1696
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,280
It's about something

1697
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:37,520
that's both funny

1698
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:38,060
and admirable

1699
01:00:38,060 --> 01:00:38,980
in the human spirit.

1700
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:40,640
It's about a father,

1701
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:41,180
now gone,

1702
01:00:41,200 --> 01:00:42,120
who so wanted to believe

1703
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:42,760
in his daughters

1704
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:43,680
that he listened

1705
01:00:43,680 --> 01:00:44,260
to their music

1706
01:00:44,260 --> 01:00:44,940
with his heart,

1707
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:46,320
a tone-deaf organ

1708
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,380
if there ever was one.

1709
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:48,680
And it's about

1710
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:49,540
the faded and slightly

1711
01:00:49,540 --> 01:00:50,380
tattered dreams

1712
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:51,060
of some kids

1713
01:00:51,060 --> 01:00:51,960
who had the whole world

1714
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:52,520
before them,

1715
01:00:52,680 --> 01:00:53,460
kids that were

1716
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:54,600
struggling through high school

1717
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,960
about the same time I was,

1718
01:00:56,160 --> 01:00:57,200
grown-up kids

1719
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:58,320
who've seen a thousand dreams

1720
01:00:58,320 --> 01:00:58,920
come and go

1721
01:00:58,920 --> 01:00:59,960
and still find

1722
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:00,620
true happiness

1723
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:01,260
in a trailer

1724
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:01,920
in New Hampshire.

1725
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:03,600
And yet I found

1726
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:04,940
some sort of crazy triumph

1727
01:01:04,940 --> 01:01:05,900
in all this for them.

1728
01:01:06,260 --> 01:01:07,200
An album review

1729
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:07,980
in Rolling Stone,

1730
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:09,320
music that might have

1731
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:09,960
been snickered at

1732
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,100
but was still being heard,

1733
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:12,300
music that was

1734
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,660
in some lunatic way

1735
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:15,000
bringing pleasure to people,

1736
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:16,520
the way I hope it has

1737
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:17,500
on this Christmas cassette

1738
01:01:17,500 --> 01:01:17,960
for you.

1739
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:19,740
There's a lesson

1740
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:20,460
to learn from

1741
01:01:20,460 --> 01:01:21,460
the story of the Shags,

1742
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:23,040
and I think you already

1743
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:23,820
know what it is.

1744
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:25,520
So I'll just mark

1745
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,180
this case closed.

1746
01:01:37,340 --> 01:01:37,820
I hope you enjoyed it.

1747
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:37,820


1748
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:37,820


1749
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:37,820


1750
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:37,820


1751
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:37,820


1752
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:37,820


1753
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:37,820


1754
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:38,200
Worry about

1755
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:39,480
bubonic plague.

1756
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:40,620
No, bubonic plague.

1757
01:01:40,620 --> 01:01:41,440
It could be worse.

1758
01:01:41,820 --> 01:01:43,480
Oh, it could be much worse

1759
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:44,520
than bubonic plague.

1760
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,240
And if you want to know

1761
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,700
just how bad it could be,

1762
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:50,640
right away for that

1763
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:51,680
free information.

1764
01:01:52,100 --> 01:01:52,620
And you're going to

1765
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:53,320
worry about

1766
01:01:53,320 --> 01:01:54,160
That's right.

1767
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,740
One more thing

1768
01:01:55,740 --> 01:01:56,740
to worry about.

1769
01:01:59,040 --> 01:01:59,780
Fight for that

1770
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:00,420
free information

1771
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:01,680
from the Church

1772
01:02:01,680 --> 01:02:02,440
of the Subgenius

1773
01:02:02,440 --> 01:02:02,680
and the Church of the Subgenius.

1774
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:04,180
And you can do that by...

1775
01:02:05,900 --> 01:02:06,800
That's one way.

1776
01:02:07,020 --> 01:02:09,640
Yet another is to simply address a letter.

1777
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:14,100
And on that envelope, you just write...

1778
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:15,040
Bob.

1779
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:17,640
No.

1780
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:19,880
Write Bob, dude.

1781
01:02:23,320 --> 01:02:24,860
Or you can write to Bonnet Clay.

1782
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:29,960
Go write to Bob at P.O. Box 140306.

1783
01:02:31,640 --> 01:02:33,140
In Dallas, Texas.

1784
01:02:35,700 --> 01:02:37,880
And the zip is 75214.
