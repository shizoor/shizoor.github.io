1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
Look out! God is right behind you!

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,800
The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,580
by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.

4
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,560
Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,820
shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,

6
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:28,940
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,060
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger

8
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:41,060
those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.

9
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,280
And you will know my name is Bob.

10
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,760
Oh, Bob. Oh, yeah.

11
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,140
Oh, oh.

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:54,360
Four, three, two, one, fire.

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,960
Welcome to Subgenius.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Radio Ministry Hour of Slang.

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,260
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

16
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,080
Yes, and I'm afraid there's a lot more trouble than we asked for tonight out here, you know.

17
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,220
The Bob Zone.

18
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,500
I've got a message from Bob for all of you.

19
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,480
Don't give up.

20
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:32,600
Yep, he didn't say what not to give up, so I'll tell you what I'm not giving up.

21
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,740
I'm not giving up drugs.

22
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,120
I'm not giving up surfing, and I'm not giving up coming down to this station.

23
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,860
And being a bad noise in your ear.

24
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:46,920
And I'm also not giving up the hope that our boys over there in Malaysia

25
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,920
will be able to assassinate Bob for once and for all and get rid of his kind

26
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,800
before you become one of him.

27
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:57,020
And I'm afraid we'll not be able to take calls tonight.

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,900
You know, wartime situations such as this, we just don't care what you have to say.

29
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,740
You can call the station all you want, and we aren't going to listen.

30
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,060
Okay.

31
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:12,660
And it's time you got to realize that it's people like me are going to have to come up

32
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,840
with the answers for you, and that you're just going to have to live with our decisions.

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,160
We're taking a lot of notes here tonight, so we're going to be thinking about what you're

34
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,820
thinking about.

35
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,000
And we know what you're thinking.

36
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:25,740
Believe me.

37
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:35,800
Tonight's show, unlike normally, we do have a sponsor tonight, and we'll be revealing

38
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,020
that sponsor.

39
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,040
Thanks, thanks.

40
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:44,140
Out here in the horrid, horrid future.

41
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,100
The other doctors are reloading at this moment, and it is expected they'll be storming the station.

42
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,680
I don't believe we're going to have a problem tonight with enemy fire.

43
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,060
Come in the morning.

44
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,440
No one told me how to hear Bob.

45
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,960
It's 12 hours.

46
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:04,360
We're going to go over and I've walked up.

47
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:04,660
Sorry.

48
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,740
There has been an infusion of the...

49
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:14,600
What I refer to as my own personal enemy at this, at this, at this moment.

50
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,860
And like I said before, please don't give up.

51
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,860
Don't give up drugs.

52
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,440
Don't give up going crazy.

53
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,280
And don't give up the hope that someday our nation will be run by people like me.

54
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,100
And of course, people like Dr. Hal.

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,580
Well, you could do worse, I suppose, I suppose.

56
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,720
It all started a long time ago.

57
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,260
I'm not sure that I can even remember when that was.

58
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,700
I don't know.

59
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,400
Long ago and far away.

60
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,160
And I was a bold, strapping young man.

61
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:46,080
So you'd hardly think that to look at me now.

62
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:53,340
I remember you, Doctor, dressed up in that uniform, marching back and forth, poking Dr. Vrede to the bayonet.

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:55,460
You were a fine man in those days.

64
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,560
Doctor, what happened?

65
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,400
He was a stateless person who had to be under the jurisdiction of the new order.

66
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,120
Well, I'm going to make my order right now.

67
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,620
Clams and eggs with a side of toast.

68
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,420
I'll have my...

69
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,060
Hash browns with jam in those little...

70
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,460
What do you call those things?

71
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,140
Those little packets?

72
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,220
Oh, those are...

73
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,100
With grape jelly in there.

74
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,800
Can I get a fresh squeezed orange juice with that?

75
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,320
Yes, just step right over here.

76
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,300
Incredible.

77
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,380
Not since video.

78
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,080
Here, drink this.

79
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,440
Okay.

80
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,600
Say, Doctor, what was that anyway?

81
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,360
That was...

82
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,940
That was war juice, and wasn't it good?

83
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,260
Boy, we're going to be drinking up gallons of it tonight here on the Subgenius Radio Show.

84
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:44,760
Yes, sir.

85
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,200
And I...

86
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,040
I have a feeling that puzzling evidence will be here tonight.

87
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,820
I think he's probably down in the reloading room right now.

88
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:59,080
Israeli tank crews operating in modified Soviet T-55 and T-62 tanks in the Sinai Desert experience...

89
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,320
Oh, give me half a dozen for the hotel room.

90
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,100
Why?

91
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:04,820
Why?

92
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:37,340
Because you were aementå,みんな!

93
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:37,340


94
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:37,340


95
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:37,340


96
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:37,340


97
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:37,340


98
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:37,340


99
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,160
Sorry.

100
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:42,820
Dumb all over, yes we are Dumb all over, near and far

101
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,080
Dumb all over, black and white People, we is not reptite

102
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,200
Nerds on the left, nerds on the right Religious fanatics on the air

103
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:59,020
Every night singing the Bible tells the story Makes the details sound real gory

104
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:03,920
About what to do if the geeks over there Don't believe in the book we got over here

105
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,720
You can't run a race without no feet And pretty soon there won't be no street

106
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:13,880
For dummies to jog on or doggies to dog on Religious fanatics can make it be all gone

107
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,860
I mean it won't blow up and disappear It'll just look ugly for a thousand years

108
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,360
You can't run a country by a book or religion Not by a heap or a lump or a smidgen of foolish rules

109
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,040
Of ancient date designed to make you all feel great

110
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,900
While your foes tend to let me down

111
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:37,160
We'll hang late, those unbelievers From a neighboring state

112
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:45,560
Two arms, two arms, the word that's great Two legs ain't bad unless there's a crate

113
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:50,760
They ship the parts to mama in For souvenirs, two years, get down

114
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:56,500
Not his, not hers, but they The good book says it's gonna be that way

115
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:00,880
But their book says revenge, the Crusades

116
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:03,780
With whips and chains and hand grenades

117
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:06,560
Two arms, two arms

118
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,240
Have another and another

119
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,800
Our God says there ain't no other

120
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
Our God says it's all okay

121
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,620
Our God says this is the way

122
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,860
It says in the book

123
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,680
Burn and destroy

124
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,140
Now repent and redeem

125
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,320
And revenge and deploy

126
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:25,080
And rumble thee forth

127
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,640
To the land of the unbelieving scum

128
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,780
On the other side

129
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,500
Cause they don't go for what's in the book

130
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,800
And that makes them bad

131
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,360
So verily we must chop them up

132
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,720
And stomp them down

133
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,280
Or rent a nice French bomb

134
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:46,940
To prove them out of existence

135
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,920
While leaving their real estate

136
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,360
Just where we need it

137
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,300
To use again for temples

138
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,900
In which to praise our God

139
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,760
Cause he has made us

140
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,020
And really take care of business

141
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,740
And when his humble TV servant

142
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,040
With humble white hair

143
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,020
And humble glasses

144
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,660
And a nice brown suit

145
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:10,440
And maybe a blonde wife

146
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,700
Who takes phone calls

147
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,320
Tells us our God says

148
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,780
It's okay to do this stuff

149
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,920
Then we gotta do it

150
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,360
Cause if we don't do it

151
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,200
We ain't one of the living

152
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,340
Depending on which book

153
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,380
You're using at the time

154
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,200
Can use theirs

155
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:23,900
It don't work

156
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,640
It's all lies

157
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,500
Gotta use mine

158
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,200
Ain't that right

159
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,300
That's what they say

160
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,060
Every night

161
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,740
Every day

162
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,020
Hey we can't really be dumb

163
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,840
If we're just following God's orders

164
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,300
Let's get serious

165
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,120
God knows what he's doing

166
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,580
He wrote this book here

167
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,780
And the book says

168
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:42,240
He made us all to be just like him

169
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,000
So if we're dumb

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,100
Then God is dumb

171
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:49,380
And maybe even a little ugly on the side

172
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,760
Dumb all over

173
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,280
A little ugly on the side

174
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,720
Dumb all over

175
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,240
A little ugly on the side

176
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:03,640
Dumb all over

177
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,220
A little ugly on the side

178
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,660
Dumb all over

179
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,160
A little ugly on the side

180
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,640
Dumb all over

181
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,120
A little ugly on the side

182
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,580
Dumb all over

183
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,020
A little ugly on the side

184
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,500
Dumb all over

185
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,360
A little ugly on the side

186
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,360


187
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,920
A little ugly on the side

188
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,340
Dumb all over

189
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:28,700
Dumb all over

190
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,620
A little left me on the side

191
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,980
Come on over

192
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:05,640
A little left me on the side

193
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,900
Come on over

194
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,480
A little left me on the side

195
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,820
Come on over

196
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,360
A little left me on the side

197
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,700
Come on over

198
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,200
A little left me on the side

199
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,580
Come on over

200
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,020
A little left me on the side

201
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,440
Come on over

202
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,360
Outro Music

203
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,160
Uh, Frank Zappa, dear friends.

204
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,360
The great Frank Zappa with dumb all over.

205
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:12,820
And be prepared tonight or today for a pretty sick show.

206
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,280
It's been a sick reality.

207
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:18,740
We don't usually get topical with this show,

208
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:23,560
but be prepared for a rather unique take on the horror.

209
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,360
It seems, friends, like it sure has taken forever.

210
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,500
Forever for the end times to end.

211
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,080
And whenever the world appears to be ending,

212
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,200
I've noticed that subgeniuses always get this urge to reproduce,

213
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,500
or at least pretend they're going to reproduce,

214
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,460
and to eat as if their very lives depended on it.

215
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,020
It's funny how that works, although it's certainly understandable

216
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:47,740
from an evolutionary point of view.

217
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,740
But it also makes us want to react to the sickness around us

218
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,840
with this sort of sick humor.

219
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:57,000
You know, we hate to see monkeys die.

220
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:57,700
Needlessly.

221
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,160
And I hate to see even humans die.

222
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,200
Needlessly.

223
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,300
Although, you know, if Bob gets his way,

224
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:08,300
any death will become strictly voluntary and refundable.

225
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:11,800
But in the meantime, I don't know.

226
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:15,200
You know, we hate the military industrial complex too,

227
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:19,040
but do we really want to fly around maiming and killing its slaves?

228
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:25,140
I think, you know, when we finally get our escape vessels on X-Day,

229
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:26,400
we'll probably just leave.

230
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:26,980
And we'll probably just leave.

231
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,420
And blow off the massacring.

232
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,160
Don't you think?

233
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,240
Because this mass killing stuff,

234
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,980
I don't think it's getting us off like we expected.

235
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,540
In fact, friends, I'm really hideously bummed

236
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:45,120
if I stop and think about it from a human rather than a subgenius perspective.

237
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,180
And even from the cruel, heartless, vengeful subgenius perspective,

238
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,240
it's all totally sickening.

239
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:56,640
So we approached this on the ESO radio show with Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

240
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:03,180
and Professor Chas, and also Dr. Legume, and Evangela, and Reverend Turin this time.

241
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:10,400
And I also unearthed some old KPFA with Gary Gubrog, friend Doug Wellman,

242
00:13:10,460 --> 00:13:13,580
Puzzling Evidence, Dr. Howell, and Papa Joe Mama

243
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,240
that is a preview of the next war.

244
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:22,540
And yet this tape was done January 11th, 1991.

245
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,500
So stay tuned for that.

246
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,460
Ah, yes.

247
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,580
Keep me covered, ma.

248
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,420
Should we just turn the other cheek, Dave?

249
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:38,020
Well, are we talking about our physical or spiritual cheeks,

250
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:41,180
or are we even just talking about turning the old rumpke around and spanking ourselves?

251
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,900
Or spanking someone else?

252
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:44,980
I think the whole room.

253
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,860
I don't know. What do you think?

254
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:48,860
Well, Oslami Ben Salami, or whatever's...

255
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,280
What do I think?

256
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,360
Yeah, your thoughts are important to something, somebody.

257
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,380
No, my thoughts are always important.

258
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,900
That's why I think them.

259
00:13:58,600 --> 00:13:59,940
Because you're the only one.

260
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,420
I said think.

261
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,660
I ink them.

262
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,900
Well, what is one of your thoughts, if you have one right now?

263
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:11,700
Well, one of my thoughts is that it's time for me to dust up my knuckles

264
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,840
for me and Reverend Stang's big smackdown tomorrow night.

265
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:16,100
That's right, my friends.

266
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:20,840
Doctor, like you and I have had enough of this stuff, all this crap.

267
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,280
This whole problem's been nothing but God.

268
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,560
That's right.

269
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,820
God's the problem here.

270
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:29,260
It's time to kick God's doors down, boys.

271
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,440
That's right, my friends.

272
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,340
Doctor Legume here has said, he has pronounced that he will give up his freedom of religion

273
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,300
if we can wipe out theirs.

274
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,060
That is correct.

275
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:48,700
And to that end, we are challenging God and Osama Bin Laden to a smackdown bare knuckle

276
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,260
fight behind the old church in Jonesboro tomorrow night.

277
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,820
Praise Bob, friends.

278
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,680
It's an unjihad.

279
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,600
It is unholy war.

280
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,020
War on God.

281
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,740
God, we're coming for you.

282
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,200
You hear me?

283
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,720
You hear me, God up there?

284
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,180
We will kick down your house and fillet your servants.

285
00:15:06,500 --> 00:15:07,080
That's right.

286
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:11,760
And we are going to hang a pack up your ass, God.

287
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:19,760
God shall bow down before the Pomerian head idol and kiss where its feet would be, at

288
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:20,420
its feet.

289
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,840
God, you hear me?

290
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:23,800
Let your followers see where God's feet would be.

291
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:23,800


292
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:23,800


293
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:23,800


294
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:23,800


295
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:23,800


296
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:23,800


297
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:23,800


298
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:23,800


299
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:23,800


300
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:23,800


301
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:23,800


302
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,780
Be alive, love, scatter, sow its seeds and be noble and plentiful, a pious king among

303
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:35,780


304
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:35,780


305
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:38,960
World man, we must not bow down to any group of Grabhs.

306
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:39,300
The issue is, Rosh Helite who because there are so many of you here has the same reason

307
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:39,440
he had died long ago?

308
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:41,120
Do we have faith that if we do receive real response from God, whoever we trust, we will

309
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,220
be just as strong as God?

310
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,860
Sancti they that on this earth we are loyal men also today will be just and Iím willing

311
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:46,480
to die for them.

312
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:51,900
Could my Savior nochus be real with you, executor?

313
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,760
was insecure and I told you that

314
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:57,860
God was insecure. Oh, they seem to

315
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,820
think old man God needs

316
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,120
their help since he's so doddering

317
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,920
and old and distracted. They have

318
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,260
to be God's tools, uh-huh.

319
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:07,700
They're scrawny little yellow

320
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:10,220
chicken belly yellow

321
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:10,980
bastard. God damn them.

322
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,160
God damn the goddesses.

323
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,860
I've given him every chance

324
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,680
in the world to smite me too.

325
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,980
I have stood up to my tits

326
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,740
in shark-infested water and

327
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,620
cursed his name, but did I get

328
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,620
eaten? No. I've ridden

329
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,660
my motorcycle a hundred miles an hour

330
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,360
with the blind and rain and ice storms

331
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,260
casting them all the way. And did I die?

332
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:32,780
No. Friends, I

333
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:35,560
dare God to kill me, strike

334
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:37,000
me dead right now.

335
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,340
God and

336
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,460
Ben, all them

337
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:43,620
damn Ben Hollis and Ben Havens

338
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,780
and all the

339
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,560
Craig and the Five and the

340
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:49,600
Fight Club and anybody who

341
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,140
did. Little tiny

342
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,580
flecklets of floam are floating through the air

343
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,280
now spreading from his mouth as he

344
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,420
pronounces more epithets upon the deity

345
00:16:57,420 --> 00:16:59,420
that created him. Friends, as a semi-conscious

346
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:01,080
Now you can hear how Legume is so

347
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,460
pumped up. He's like breathing heavily

348
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,460
into the fire. I am sickened by

349
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,300
God's late disregard

350
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,980
for his creations.

351
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,500
He chained, kept there until the final

352
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:11,900
battle.

353
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,340
That's right, I'll bring you down.

354
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:16,800
And because I'm all aroused now,

355
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,760
my manhood stands at

356
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:20,720
full staff just

357
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,760
thinking about wrapping my fingers

358
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,820
around God.

359
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:25,340
I'm at detention now.

360
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,800
He's been sitting back and just

361
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:30,820
watching this happen. Oh, free

362
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:32,900
will, they say, free will. That's just

363
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,440
God's way of being a coward.

364
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,900
Standing back and letting this

365
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,860
horrible crap be done in his name.

366
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,240
God damn it!

367
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,100
God damn!

368
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,740
And some people say, oh, it's not, but there's no

369
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,660
God. No God could allow this

370
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,820
horrible stuff. They say it's just a

371
00:17:48,820 --> 00:17:50,560
void, a limitless void. Well,

372
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,560
then, void, damn it!

373
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,500
We declare war on the void!

374
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,540
We've had enough of it!

375
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,600
As the Department of

376
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Defense Chairman, Head of

377
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,080
the Defense Department,

378
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,240
this here theocracy,

379
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,780
we'd like just to remind you

380
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:10,600
briefly, if we can, that things

381
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,580
have not really stopped and are not going

382
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:14,080
to be stopping for a while now.

383
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,080
In this war against the

384
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,700
Creator himself, each and

385
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:20,540
every one of us has our own particular cross.

386
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:22,320
An AK-47 to bear.

387
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,660
And remember, always,

388
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,020
in this war,

389
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,400
there are only psychic casualties.

390
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,020
So bandage up those head wounds.

391
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:32,620
I don't think this one's going to be about AK-47s.

392
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,580
No, but the next

393
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:36,300
one will be fought with rock and

394
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,500
stick, my friend. This one might

395
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,880
be fought with germ warfare

396
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,360
and terrorism and the nuclear

397
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,900
smart bomb attacks. But the next one

398
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,520
will be rock and stick!

399
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,540
Did you know that one of the... We haven't tested

400
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,700
that neutron bomb yet.

401
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:52,760
That turf ain't all that valuable,

402
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,380
but what the hell does it have in the oil?

403
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,720
Well, Afghanistan does

404
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,440
have some lovely, lovely frop.

405
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,700
As you must know, everybody loves Afghanistan.

406
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:02,660
Oh, yeah. Does the neutron bomb

407
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,720
destroy the frop? I don't know. We should

408
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,740
ask Strong about that. I'm staying about

409
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,660
that he knows about the original have the frop

410
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,780
for weapons experts.

411
00:19:11,340 --> 00:19:12,560
Does the neutron

412
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,320
bomb destroy the frop crop

413
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,200
in Afghanistan? No, it will leave all

414
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,700
frops standing. Makes it stronger,

415
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:19,340
dude.

416
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,860
If you frop out during fallout

417
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:24,640
and, like, bomb blasts

418
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,500
and... And there we go, man.

419
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:28,820
It makes it, like, four times

420
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:30,840
stronger. No extra toxins

421
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,840
or sexual hormones that could be

422
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:34,580
dangerous to your eyesight or anything there.

423
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,800
It's just as pure as the snow, only

424
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,800
twice as lovely. And, uh,

425
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:40,980
believe me, one hit is enough to send you into...

426
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:42,420
Uh, send you to

427
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,220
paradisio or...

428
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,800
And you're gonna need all that frop,

429
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,880
too, because you're gonna

430
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,580
get powerful munchies.

431
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,700
When you're standing there all fropped up

432
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:53,960
in the holy land,

433
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,120
looking at that new all-pork

434
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,720
burger McDonald's that

435
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,620
we're gonna build where the dome of the

436
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,940
rock stands today.

437
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,100
How much do you think condos will be going for?

438
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,360
That's right. We don't care what your religion is.

439
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,200
We're gonna put a fast food chain

440
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,460
right there in every

441
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,260
holy site in the world.

442
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,820
Sand Disneyland!

443
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,540
That's right. I think the ultimate

444
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,580
treat... Pork served at the most

445
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,600
holy of mosques, and I

446
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,080
guess it, like the Vatican...

447
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,500
By topless waitresses!

448
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,700
By topless waitresses

449
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,400
on roller skates, my friend!

450
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,400
Now, lots of people

451
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,040
don't like pork. They ain't seen

452
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,720
decadent unholiness yet.

453
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:36,320
Get down off that soapbox. You know your feet

454
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:38,060
is getting all squishy. We're gonna open up

455
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:40,720
McCabah. That's what we're re-walking.

456
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,460
We need more pork in the

457
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:44,100
holy land. I think the...

458
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,400
Pork in the holy land. Did you know that

459
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,340
if a Muslim touches pork, he'll

460
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,420
go to hell? You can't get into heaven

461
00:20:50,420 --> 00:20:51,920
if you smell of swine.

462
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,180
Do you know that if a Muslim touches his

463
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,040
own physical orifice, he

464
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,280
sweeps up like a little bladder bag?

465
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,280
He's running them across the place.

466
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,100
If you're taking on God in the ring, I think there's a problem with it.

467
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,320
You know that nothing is a foreign object

468
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
to God, so if he's sneaking up on you

469
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,240
with a folding chair... Right.

470
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,340
You're not gonna know about it. And you can't

471
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:12,100
sneak up on... And the ref will have to allow it because

472
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,820
it's not a foreign object to him.

473
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,320
And of course... If he sneaks up on you with you,

474
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,100
the ref has to allow it.

475
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,400
And he's gonna know your every move through pre-tricolour.

476
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:22,100
He's got a lot of cognition, I suppose, too, so you're

477
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,240
kind of doomed in that way. Also, he knows the outcome,

478
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,900
too, so maybe... I don't know.

479
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,360
Maybe you should just watch the replay

480
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,860
as the planet just starts

481
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,180
to disintegrate.

482
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,640
Okay, Junior. Then Nova.

483
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,700
Back to four.

484
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,900
Come on, guys. Over here.

485
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:42,640
This way.

486
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,420
They're shooting at us.

487
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,340
Come on. Hurry up.

488
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,460
We're gonna be a war soon.

489
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:55,560
Hey, I didn't sign up for this.

490
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,480
What happened?

491
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:59,260
How long has it been like this?

492
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,240
It was peaceful when I left for Arizona.

493
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,040
Oh, the war.

494
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,660
Oh, the war.

495
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,920
Who is that?

496
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,820
Oh, look at that guy over there.

497
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,860
He really bought it.

498
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,300
Yeah, that Andy bar I wanted.

499
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:14,940
He bought it.

500
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:15,420
Oh, yeah.

501
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,200
It doesn't melt in his hands in Operation

502
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,400
T-Rex. It doesn't melt in his hands in Operation T-Rex.

503
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,580
It's like a giant desert dalcon shield.

504
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,200
It's a doctor!

505
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,140
Oh, boy.

506
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,700
We're gonna prophylaxis the world from bad people.

507
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:29,540
Yes, a prophylaxis against bad people

508
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,820
is necessary in this day and age.

509
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,020
Come, my friends.

510
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,720
It is not too late to seek a newer world.

511
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,960
Push off,

512
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,760
and, sitting well in order,

513
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,900
smite the sounding furrows.

514
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,200
Yes, indeed.

515
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,500
Those sounding furrows

516
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,060
aren't gonna bother our brave

517
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:50,400
boys and gals out in the wild.

518
00:22:50,420 --> 00:22:51,980
The hellish inferno of the

519
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,600
Saudi Arabian

520
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,600
whatever it be.

521
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,100
Bacon out there in the sand.

522
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,100
Jesse and Mama

523
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,220
are out there fighting side by side.

524
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:08,300
Dressed in tacky khaki.

525
00:23:10,760 --> 00:23:12,340
Overflown with a camouflage

526
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:14,000
pattern by Mr.

527
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:16,160
Phyllis of Hollywood, California.

528
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:18,220
Which we'll all be wearing

529
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:20,060
from our copies of Banana Republican.

530
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,220
It's simply stunning,

531
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,340
and my ensemble is adorable.

532
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,820
And now they're playing some music for us.

533
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,180
As Hell dances around

534
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,800
in his new combat ensemble.

535
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,420
Shh, Doug, I'm trying to, you know,

536
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:36,100
fit in with the local customs and everything.

537
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,260
No, we're trying not to offend him.

538
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,640
Now, this one has a special...

539
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,160
This has a holy significance to him,

540
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,440
if I can just remember the steps.

541
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,640
Uh-oh, uh,

542
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,700
the guy wants to communicate now.

543
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,400
Let me get out the guidebook.

544
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:50,400


545
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,220
Wait a minute, there's nothing in here about...

546
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,100
about midgets operating puppets?

547
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,160
Well, it's up to somebody else

548
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:03,040
to make the first move.

549
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,380
I'm not up to it.

550
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,100
He's not even up to me.

551
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,820
Not up to my kneecap.

552
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:13,040
Ah, yes, now the second act

553
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:13,500
is beginning.

554
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,620
Sting on this side.

555
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,640
I'll sing a little bit more.

556
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,740
You can't even spell it, Stingers.

557
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,200
Yes, uh,

558
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:20,400
Stingers.

559
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:20,400


560
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,720
You have a stinger,

561
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,960
I'm going to have a glass of champagne.

562
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,380
No, or maybe I'll have one of those

563
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,640
hot buttered rum martinis

564
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:27,980
the rest of you guys are having.

565
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,040
Yeah, yeah, see if he's got any defects cameras.

566
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,320
No, no, no.

567
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:33,660
If he's got that red, a 9-2-M.

568
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:36,260
Out here, you can leave the antifreeze

569
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,800
out of those hot buttered rum martinis.

570
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,280
It's hot enough to melt an egg

571
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,240
on Hell's Grandpa's griddle.

572
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:45,900
Yeah, using the

573
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,460
Deltcon Electronic Advanced Military

574
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,940
Standard 1750A Mission Computer,

575
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,660
we know where we're going by 6 o'clock.

576
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:54,600
That computer's fouled up again, sir.

577
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,460
I think we're having a microphone

578
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:58,080
failure here in the

579
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,420
first quadrant.

580
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,700
Okay, good, well, we'll just plug in the

581
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,620
American Dynamics gun elevation plus

582
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,840
45 degrees or minus 20 centigrade.

583
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,080
Careful with the end of that, fella.

584
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:08,920
Into your M13 turret here.

585
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:11,600
Hey, plug it into your own M13 turret,

586
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,980
you know what I mean? What happened, caller?

587
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,260
That said, now that you're in the

588
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:36,260


589
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:36,260


590
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:36,260


591
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,080
oh come on

592
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,040
I'm

593
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:17,360
I want to join Islamic Jihad

594
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:21,000
I just want to kill for God

595
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,480
Praising Allah is the life for me

596
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:31,800
I'll use pipe bombs, what the fuck?

597
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,380
Killing Hebrews brings good luck

598
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,700
Gotta make Khomeini proud of me

599
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,840
Load a car with dynamite

600
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,360
And drive into a synagogue

601
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,340
Without a car

602
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:48,300
Without any brakes

603
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,540
Nothing could be better

604
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,240
Than impaling your intestines

605
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:55,560
On a big rusty steak

606
00:26:56,720 --> 00:27:00,780
Hand grenades and cattle prods

607
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,840
Let's go out and kill for God

608
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,220
I can hear Muhammad calling me

609
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,140
Yowza, yowza, yowza

610
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:20,300
M nimah login

611
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,320
Force him out

612
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:24,980
Without cocaine

613
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:42,340
Black cop abilities

614
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:42,620
Write, revamp

615
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:43,500
Every fucking

616
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:43,500


617
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:43,860
Jesus Christ

618
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:47,320
Dumb ass

619
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,320


620
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,320


621
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,780
Though the Koran seems quite odd

622
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:15,240
I still want to kill for God

623
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:19,600
Praising Jesus is the life for me

624
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:26,280
Fuck those pagans, they're such cynics

625
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,800
Let's bomb the abortion clinic

626
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,900
Jerry Fowell is my cup of tea

627
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,920
Never thought I'd make it big

628
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:42,080
By selling God to idiots on cable TV

629
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:45,160
What the fuck?

630
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,320
It's not GE, but still a better way

631
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:49,180
To use my business degree

632
00:28:51,180 --> 00:28:54,500
Use a rifle, spare the rod

633
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,040
Let's go out and kill for God

634
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:02,460
Praise the Lord and hand that gun to me

635
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,160
Kill for God by the Rudy Schwartz Project, friends

636
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:13,040
On the CD Salmon Dave

637
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:16,180
You know what?

638
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,980
That makes me mad

639
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,940
We don't care if we're disqualified

640
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,480
For not obeying the rules of fighting with God

641
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:25,000
I love the idea

642
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,360
We were already told we were gonna go to hell

643
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,460
We knew we were gonna go to hell anyway

644
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:33,620
Why do you think we had to join this church of the subgenius?

645
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:38,260
This church has declared war on all churches and religions

646
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:41,560
No, no, we don't have anything against the churches or the followers

647
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:42,380
It's just God

648
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:45,040
Because of his spiteful and angry attitude?

649
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,100
No, no, you know, actually

650
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:50,140
Because of the old testicle style of his arraignments

651
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,800
Well, we have no testicle style

652
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,880
We used to say, we've got nothing against God or Jesus

653
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,300
It's just his fan club

654
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,440
Well, we've decided we've had enough

655
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:00,940
Well, it's also his family

656
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,180
That's exactly right

657
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:06,660
If I was a Satan worshipper, would I be into the fact that America was known as the great Satan?

658
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,020
You probably would then

659
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:09,580
Yeah

660
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:10,620
You could just boogie down Godly

661
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,540
Would I be like, yeah, let's go kick their ass?

662
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,400
No

663
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,860
Because America is the great Satan

664
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:15,820
And I worship Satan

665
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:21,500
You would probably sell toxic flags and sell insurance policies at the same time if you were the real Satan

666
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,100
And then have blood rituals on the side

667
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:23,340
Yeah

668
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:28,620
Afterwards, after maybe a few martoonies and perhaps having sex with a dog with a beard

669
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,960
Well, you know, that one jet flew right over Cleveland

670
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:33,940
What do you call it, quadrangles?

671
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,300
All hail those dudes who brought that plane down

672
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:38,880
Those saints

673
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,540
Oh, man

674
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:42,320
Those saints of bravery

675
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:44,840
I don't know if I would have the ovaries to do that

676
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,320
I might crumble into a small ball and start crying very hard

677
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,500
But that wouldn't get me out of here

678
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,500
I like how Lagoon put it

679
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:50,560
Oh

680
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,100
Yeah, I'm gonna go

681
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,260
You're both gonna go see Allah together

682
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:00,340
We'll all come a-crawling, yes

683
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:03,580
Yeah, let's not wait until we get where you wanna go

684
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,800
Allah's waiting for us

685
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,000
Let's not let him down

686
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,060
Let's go now

687
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,680
Yeah, let's get bare knuckle

688
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,840
I don't mess around when it comes down to it

689
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:15,240
To warfare

690
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:20,280
I'll cut myself open charging and strangle somebody with my own innards

691
00:31:20,280 --> 00:31:21,920
By, by

692
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,920
Customing his body to small dosages of chainsaw

693
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:28,140
Dr. Lagoon soon became immune

694
00:31:28,140 --> 00:31:29,620
Now cut it out

695
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:31,580
Quit hitting me with that shillelagh

696
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:37,760
Unseen blusher in an obscene coal hole

697
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,980
Hey, somebody

698
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,460
Of course you're gonna win this war

699
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:43,660
I

700
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:43,900
I

701
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:43,980
I

702
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:44,840
I

703
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:44,840


704
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:44,840


705
00:31:44,840 --> 00:32:14,840


706
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:44,840


707
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,280
í

708
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,280


709
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,280


710
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,280


711
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,860
But what is the basis of this mythical mish mash Laren

712
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,740
Is there in fact truth to this old fusty legend?

713
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,180
Or is it really

714
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:55,720
Oh, Has been

715
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,120
A discarded relic stinking upon the dust heap of history

716
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,980
Of course, if enough people believe in it, it will become true.

717
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,140
You believe in a depression and you become depressed.

718
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,580
You believe in a recession and you become depressed.

719
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:10,940
You make your own reality, man.

720
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,140
My country hurts.

721
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,900
My question is, why fight these people?

722
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:21,480
Why not just put them out of business with sub-Islam?

723
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,800
The church of sub-Islam?

724
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,840
I don't know. I don't think it's a religious war.

725
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,540
I think it's kind of a corporate state war.

726
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:33,000
I remember Osama Bin Laden is an oil billionaire and so is Cheney and so is Bush.

727
00:33:33,060 --> 00:33:34,840
I think we're kind of getting fooled a little bit.

728
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:39,920
But, you know, they don't mind chopping us all up in the name of family.

729
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:42,860
Is he responsible for all those Japanese cartoons?

730
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:45,200
It is God and mammon.

731
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:50,360
It is God. We declare war not only on God but on mammon as well.

732
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,800
But not mammary glamons.

733
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,600
Unfortunately, I just wish we had more money.

734
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,140
If we only had more breasts and more money.

735
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:58,140
We could...

736
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,900
We could simultaneously declare mammary.

737
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,120
If we had more faith.

738
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:06,220
But, unfortunately, us sub-geniuses, it turns out, don't really make very good terrorists.

739
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:12,460
Turns out we would like to talk real big about X-Day and massacring and so forth.

740
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,120
And then when you actually see a little preview of it,

741
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:19,060
turns out that we don't have really that much of a stomach for killing

742
00:34:19,060 --> 00:34:23,220
and end up just as disgusted as the humans around us.

743
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:23,820
That's right.

744
00:34:24,180 --> 00:34:28,120
We talk about killing, but all we really want is to get a little stinker.

745
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:29,900
That's all we really want.

746
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,880
We don't want the death of others.

747
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:34,900
We only want our pee-pees to become stinky again.

748
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:40,340
If the monkeys knew how to screw right, we wouldn't have all these problems.

749
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,100
Friends, why can't we return to the good old days of dirty tricks and assassinations?

750
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:51,460
That's a kinder, gentler way of waging war.

751
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:55,360
It messes up the politicians instead of the civilians.

752
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:56,720
Locking up...

753
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:57,060
I don't know.

754
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:57,500
You know.

755
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,560
Leave it to the...

756
00:34:58,560 --> 00:34:58,860
Politically the kids.

757
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:04,680
Let the professionals do it in their own arena.

758
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:09,080
Give them millions and millions of dollars to train some paramilitary forces

759
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:11,300
to come by in the middle of the night and kill their kids.

760
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:13,420
Come on. Do it the old way.

761
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:16,260
No, let's just strike them where it really hurts.

762
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,960
In their wallets.

763
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:22,700
All of you should go out and work and work and work as hard as you can

764
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:24,960
and try to make as much mammon as you can.

765
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,480
And then send it to the Church of the Subtlety.

766
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:27,760
Jesus.

767
00:35:27,780 --> 00:35:31,240
PO Box 1403-06 Dallas, Texas 75214.

768
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,260
Calling all martyrs.

769
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,620
Because Jesus is on our side, friends.

770
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,680
Calling all martyrs.

771
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,260
He may be temporarily employed by the devil, but he'll be back to work for Bob pretty soon.

772
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,740
We're looking for martyrs for Bob.

773
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:50,700
We're looking for people who can float tiny wooden airplanes into large structures.

774
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:55,080
We're looking for people who can roller skate with their hands behind their backs.

775
00:35:55,080 --> 00:36:00,660
We're looking for people who can set lunch cakes and other citizens on fire.

776
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:07,340
Is sick humor a valid reaction to the unthinkable, to unthinkable horror?

777
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:09,160
Is that what this is?

778
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,200
Or is it just end times pornography?

779
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:15,640
A brief regurgitation of the week's news.

780
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:22,480
Thank God we have Bob to forgive us for, or rather to bring an excuse for our pathetic sins.

781
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:24,200
And only Bob can forgive us for this.

782
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:24,940
This is a stroke two.

783
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,120
Friends, we don't know.

784
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:35,900
You know, just because one vampire messes with you doesn't mean all vampires in every convenience store is bad.

785
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,540
People are going around hassling the vampiric Americans, the demonic Americans.

786
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:45,420
The only ones that are getting any slack at all are the etheric Americans, and they're already dead.

787
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,100
So it's kind of a moot point.

788
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:47,940
Yeah.

789
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:54,180
Just wait till it, you know, if you want, if you feel that you need to go do something,

790
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:56,620
do something to someone, go enlist, man.

791
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,320
They'll give you like a big gun.

792
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,380
They'll give you a big one.

793
00:36:59,480 --> 00:36:59,800
That's right.

794
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,680
They'll send you over to somewhere where it counts.

795
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,680
If you've got real strong opinions about what they should do.

796
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:06,360
Go join the army.

797
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:06,660
Right.

798
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,800
Go be all you can be, Daniel.

799
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:09,560
That's right.

800
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:11,600
Don't say we unless you're going to go too.

801
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,400
I'm not going to go.

802
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:12,740
That's right.

803
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,780
I had, I read this one guy was saying.

804
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,160
I'm not going, but all these other people saying that we got to go kick some ass.

805
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,760
Well, go kick some ass, damn it.

806
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,720
Join up, man.

807
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,200
Join up.

808
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:24,060
Then you can call the rest of us a bunch of sissies.

809
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:30,500
In the meantime, like human, I declare war against God and challenge God and every every

810
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:36,500
damn terrorist and cult leader out there to meet us behind the old church in Jonesboro

811
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:37,900
tomorrow night.

812
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,060
Any hold you want to throw Jonesboro.

813
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,720
Bring this week.

814
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:46,680
Bring the Samuels Jonesboro battle.

815
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:51,180
Until then, don't be calling somebody else a sissy.

816
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:53,940
And don't be trying to make stink.

817
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,640
Finger with dogs with beards.

818
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:56,200
Hello.

819
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,000
Hello.

820
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:57,700
Hello.

821
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,460
Hello.

822
00:37:58,460 --> 00:37:59,000
Angela.

823
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,240
Angela.

824
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:01,440
I'm a correspondent.

825
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,040
Are you?

826
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,140
I'm a correspondent.

827
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,320
Foreign correspondent.

828
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:08,340
We we don't correspond very well here.

829
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:12,120
We kind of just genius correspondent for which publication.

830
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:12,480
Miss.

831
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:14,280
I wrote a story on the event.

832
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,500
Oh, did you?

833
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:15,900
Yes.

834
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:16,840
What's your vendor?

835
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:17,460
Are you talking about?

836
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,180
You're talking about the explosion of the Pentagon.

837
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,180
The Pentagon is a building.

838
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,920
It's also a shape.

839
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,040
It's in Washington.

840
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:24,040


841
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:26,340
It's where our military is.

842
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:27,800
It was hit with a plane.

843
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,020
Lots of people died.

844
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:32,080
Now we are going to bomb Afghanistan.

845
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,960
It is not just because of that.

846
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,820
Also, the towers are gone.

847
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,920
God is a very bad person.

848
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:44,020
That is one of the most succinctly written journalistic pieces.

849
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:44,420
We're going to kill God.

850
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,060
I think that's what it's coming down to here.

851
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,860
By Evangela Devangela, age seven.

852
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:54,020
Send them F-16s right down into heaven and blow apart them and destroy them.

853
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,020


854
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,020


855
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,020


856
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,020


857
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,020


858
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,020


859
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,020


860
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,020


861
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,020


862
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:54,560
The golden gate.

863
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:56,600
Frankie, age nine.

864
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,700
Sidewinder missiles right between the golden gate.

865
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:05,660
Dan says it has to do with the decadence of Rome falling.

866
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,900
It doesn't have to do with the decadence of Rome falling.

867
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:12,880
It has to do with the decadence of the United snakes encroaching upon its own self.

868
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,620
He said people.

869
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:15,980
That's your opinion.

870
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:17,480
When they start talking about the fall.

871
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:17,860
Of course it's.

872
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,800
But it's a falsely uttered opinion.

873
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,600
But might be true.

874
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:24,000
But I think they come from the south because Mexico is probably going to be the one.

875
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,000


876
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,000


877
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,000


878
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,000


879
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,000


880
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:24,000


881
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:27,300
be scarier than Canada pretty soon when it happens.

882
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:33,560
I think Mexico is a great deal scarier than Canada is now, darling.

883
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:35,560
No, that's because you guys are Yankees.

884
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:41,500
If you were a Texan, you would know that Mexico is our dear brother or sister country

885
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:43,400
next door or something like that.

886
00:39:43,560 --> 00:39:45,920
Hey, you're a Yankee now, too, Stang.

887
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,500
Old stanky Yankee.

888
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,060
I say viva Mexico.

889
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,040
I prefer to be called...

890
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:52,920
And I say viva everybody.

891
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,000
I love everyone.

892
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:55,040
I don't care anything.

893
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:55,780
I don't.

894
00:39:55,780 --> 00:39:56,460
I don't care.

895
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,960
Muff, Dive, and Knive and Ivan will be just fine.

896
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,920
Muff, Dive, and Knive and Ivan.

897
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:06,860
One of America's favorite old wits and souls used to sit on the front porch and slobber

898
00:40:06,860 --> 00:40:07,780
all day long.

899
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,900
Witticism, some call it.

900
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,300
Others call it nanity.

901
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,280
Subterfuge.

902
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:14,660
Blachma.

903
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:15,960
Schmata.

904
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:16,880
And poo.

905
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,300
Can I say hi to Legume?

906
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,840
You just did.

907
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:20,840
Hi, Legume.

908
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:22,520
You're a woman, aren't you, Angela?

909
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:22,900
Hey, this is...

910
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:23,820
This is a radio show.

911
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:26,100
Hey, I think he's getting to something.

912
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,820
Can I say hi to Legume, too?

913
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,340
Oh, well, you know...

914
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:30,340
Some stink finger.

915
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,380
What, are we going to start doing shout-outs now?

916
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,400
I feel that I should say something.

917
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:34,720
Audio stink finger.

918
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:35,420
All right.

919
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,720
I agree completely, Dr. Legume.

920
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,800
I feel that you have a correct...

921
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:40,640
I'm sorry, Stang.

922
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:40,900
Go ahead.

923
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,640
No, no, no.

924
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:42,680
No, after you, Dave.

925
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,300
No, Dave.

926
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:45,140
You lonesome cowboy Dave.

927
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:46,920
I just thought it was astute observation.

928
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:47,660
Go ahead.

929
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,420
Well, speaking of titties and changing friends,

930
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:55,980
friends, not to trivialize like we have

931
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,860
this horrible situation,

932
00:40:58,060 --> 00:41:00,020
but to distract us, perhaps,

933
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,860
I want to announce that starting tomorrow

934
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,260
on SubSight, the SubGenius website,

935
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:10,240
we will be displaying as many titties

936
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,980
as we possibly can in the photographs

937
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:16,800
from the Critical Tits bike ride at Burning Man,

938
00:41:17,020 --> 00:41:21,280
which, by the way, is completely approved by Connie Dobbs,

939
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:24,260
was conceived of by the Y-Mind.

940
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:24,580
Wow.

941
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,440
These are Y-Mind's tits.

942
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:26,780
Wow.

943
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:28,760
Y-Mind's photographed them.

944
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,100
That's wonderful.

945
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,700
They have been tweaked and approved

946
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:33,460
by a representative of the Y-Mind race.

947
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:33,980
Oh, tweaking titties is wonderful.

948
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,180
And these are artistically decorated.

949
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:40,020
Ah, artistic tweaking of titties is even more wonderful.

950
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,220
With at least two pairs of titties each,

951
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:43,000
you do the math,

952
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,180
that's a lot of beautiful distractions

953
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:49,400
from the horrors of the 21st century.

954
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:51,320
Stang, I would just like to ask you a question.

955
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,020
For those of you out there who are interested,

956
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:55,600
that these will all be American titties.

957
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:56,560
That is correct.

958
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,040
These are, there are titties of every race, creed, and color.

959
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,740
That's how you know they're American.

960
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:05,020
There's white titties, black titties, red, brown, yellow,

961
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,960
and a lot, because it's Burning Man,

962
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,860
a lot of blue, striped, flower-colored,

963
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:10,060
all kinds of titties,

964
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,080
because this is a melting pot.

965
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,880
It sure ain't melted together yet.

966
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:15,640
Everybody still hates each other,

967
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,820
but we don't hate each other as much as we hate them.

968
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,000
And now nobody hates anybody.

969
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:25,600
And the hate, the hate is what I hate, friends.

970
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:29,900
I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired of hating the hate.

971
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,920
And that's why I like to just sit back every now and then

972
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:36,220
and get away from it all.

973
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:37,780
Smoke the own corn blaster.

974
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,820
Into sick, depraved humor.

975
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:45,160
The only way that a sensitive person can deal with the absolute horrors

976
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,660
that one is forced to envision

977
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:50,260
when one is forced to once again pay attention

978
00:42:50,260 --> 00:42:51,320
to what they think.

979
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:51,400
Smell it.

980
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:51,400


981
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,160
Call the news!

982
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,060
The goddamn news!

983
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:55,280
God, I hate it!

984
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,580
The goddamn news.

985
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:01,300
And the causes behind the news are even worse than the news itself.

986
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,560
And I don't understand any of it.

987
00:43:05,620 --> 00:43:07,780
They were playing an America-held hosting.

988
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:09,700
I don't understand any of it,

989
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:12,280
and I don't know what to do about it.

990
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:13,900
Our leaders have told us,

991
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:15,720
as our leaders have told us before,

992
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,320
that they are our leaders.

993
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:21,040
This one's for Elvis, baby!

994
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:21,220
This one's for Elvis, baby!

995
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:24,580
Happy trails and heads or tails!

996
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,020
I say bomb them all!

997
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,540
Clean house, baby!

998
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,540
Let Bob sort them out!

999
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:37,900
That's right!

1000
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:38,920
Kill them all!

1001
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,380
That's right!

1002
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,340
Let's turn the whole world into a sheet of glass!

1003
00:43:43,580 --> 00:43:45,260
Blow up this entire planet!

1004
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:46,320
The whole world!

1005
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,160
Earth first!

1006
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:50,120
Goodbye!

1007
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,560
We couldn't make it here.

1008
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:54,700
There were too many people barking.

1009
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,660
We'll destroy the other planets later.

1010
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,760
Couldn't exactly hear what they were saying.

1011
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:01,580
Appleé's

1012
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:01,780
Appleé's

1013
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:03,800
Appleé's

1014
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,380
Appleé's

1015
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,740
Appleé's

1016
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,520
Appleé's

1017
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:21,520


1018
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:23,440
Appleé's

1019
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,140
Appleé's

1020
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:28,740
Appleé's

1021
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:46,700
I love you.

1022
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:28,680
I love you.

1023
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:30,740
I love you.

1024
00:46:10,220 --> 00:46:11,300
I love you.

1025
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,920
I love you.

1026
00:47:08,260 --> 00:47:28,700
I love you.

1027
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,320
I love you.

1028
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,400
Frank Marino.

1029
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:47,920
Power of Rock and Roll is the name of the album.

1030
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:48,820
The old album.

1031
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,720
That song.

1032
00:47:51,080 --> 00:47:51,960
Young Man.

1033
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:53,560
So we moved on.

1034
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:57,880
You know, I spent all of September 11th

1035
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:58,720
on the Ironman.

1036
00:47:58,740 --> 00:48:01,960
CRC, the internet chat world of the subgenius.

1037
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,400
Good thing you weren't on the IRT.

1038
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:07,660
And the youthful ones, the older ones were all saying, oh, let's go nuke them.

1039
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:09,220
The WTC, yes.

1040
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:10,560
Let's nuke them back to the Stone Age.

1041
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:11,120
Back to.

1042
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:15,920
But the youngsters seemed to be afraid.

1043
00:48:16,940 --> 00:48:21,060
The youngsters were worried that this was the beginning of World War III.

1044
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:23,560
Well, it might be.

1045
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,200
Yeah, it might be.

1046
00:48:25,660 --> 00:48:26,760
Well, you might.

1047
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,340
Yeah, sure.

1048
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:30,980
But to the day of least and infinity.

1049
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:32,100
That's what we thought.

1050
00:48:32,180 --> 00:48:33,160
They're trying to take our guns.

1051
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:34,980
Remember that Gulf War miniseries?

1052
00:48:35,380 --> 00:48:36,500
They're trying to take our guns.

1053
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:38,340
I never thought that was going to be a World War III.

1054
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:42,120
But I could see how they could just get carried away.

1055
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:42,820
Grenada.

1056
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:43,920
That's the one I thought.

1057
00:48:44,080 --> 00:48:45,520
Look, either you're on our side or you're not.

1058
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:49,820
And anybody who's on our side, well, we're fighting them.

1059
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:51,280
We're taking out every one of them.

1060
00:48:51,360 --> 00:48:52,420
We might not shoot you if you're on our side.

1061
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,020
And if you're not on our side, well, then you're guilty.

1062
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:56,020
Right along with them.

1063
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:57,220
And damn you.

1064
00:48:58,340 --> 00:49:02,460
And that, my friends, is the American, the American way.

1065
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:07,160
You're getting a McDonald's and you're getting a Velvet Elvis, whether you like it or not.

1066
00:49:07,460 --> 00:49:11,140
Uncle Sam's going for a haircut and a shave now, friends.

1067
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,400
I'd like to line up here, people, for the Americanization.

1068
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,920
And just step right into the vacuum chamber.

1069
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:18,300
Your hair will be automatically cut.

1070
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:19,260
There goes the beard.

1071
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:23,320
I have no funny, no religious hats or anything like that.

1072
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,740
Everybody's going to look exactly like they are.

1073
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:27,260
Get those pants.

1074
00:49:27,340 --> 00:49:28,480
Get those pants off the thing out loud again.

1075
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:33,700
Yeah, baby, I remember I was an American.

1076
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,260
I was a DEA agent.

1077
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:36,520
My friends didn't even know about it.

1078
00:49:37,320 --> 00:49:39,420
Well, Bob, in another life, perhaps.

1079
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:41,580
Another life.

1080
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,800
And besides, we're not talking about human beings here.

1081
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:48,900
It's never been proven their intelligence is in any way...

1082
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:49,500
Oh, come on, Bob.

1083
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:55,080
I don't know about you, but my compassion for someone is not limited to my estimate of their intelligence.

1084
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,320
But what about you?

1085
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,580
You must sit back and look into your Hollybrook skills.

1086
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:11,300
If you think another man is a jacket bag, you're representing them as an average man.

1087
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:17,760
For me to have to look into a jacket bag, is quite passerby.

1088
00:50:17,820 --> 00:50:21,040
I'm just comparing my personal experience every day.

1089
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:21,040


1090
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:21,660
I'm acting on me and test this guy, so I get away.

1091
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:21,940
Let me because you're right.

1092
00:50:21,940 --> 00:50:26,180
I believe that's how I'll...

1093
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:27,300
Was buffeting the jacket, too.

1094
00:50:29,340 --> 00:50:30,280
There we go.

1095
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,760
On the planet Arrakis, yes.

1096
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,020
Oh, my God. Look over there.

1097
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,100
It's the sandworms.

1098
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,660
Hey, what are you doing?

1099
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:44,980
Sorry, I hate to be the first one to tell you, but you got sandworms.

1100
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:46,320
Oh, man.

1101
00:50:47,220 --> 00:50:48,480
Worst case I've ever seen.

1102
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,340
Downwind, boy.

1103
00:50:52,460 --> 00:50:57,760
And so, becoming a social undesirable can warp your entire life.

1104
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:00,100
With some, it's sandworms.

1105
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,400
With others, it's personal uncleanliness.

1106
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:08,820
And thus begins the original one and only live subgenius Albert Slack

1107
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:13,900
brought to you in memory of the ground war fought with sandworms.

1108
00:51:14,540 --> 00:51:18,260
You are about to experience a full-length subgenius show.

1109
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:20,000
It means...

1110
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:21,340
Seriophonic sound.

1111
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:29,200
So relax, sit back, and enjoy our feature presentation.

1112
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,820
Presented the way it was meant to be heard.

1113
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:37,780
If your brain should lob up to the front of your head and explode your eyeballs,

1114
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,540
do not panic, for this is completely normal.

1115
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:43,400
Long live the succotash suckers!

1116
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:45,220
Death to the onion eaters!

1117
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:49,520
Long live King Hussein, the almighty gooter of this country.

1118
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:58,260
To all intents and purposes, it was nonexistent in this crucial phase of the war.

1119
00:51:58,480 --> 00:52:03,940
The waves of American war planes are continuing to bring devastation on the Iraqi military machine.

1120
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:08,720
When the missiles hit Israel, as I said, there was a fear that the Iraqis were using them.

1121
00:52:11,620 --> 00:52:13,580
My God, I think we've got incoming planes.

1122
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,640
Okay, okay, run the hood.

1123
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:17,340
What a turkey. Our own technology can run that stuff.

1124
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:18,720
Get him, boys!

1125
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:19,180
Get him, boys!

1126
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:21,800
They took out those turkey choppers.

1127
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:22,400
Space bleed kit!

1128
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:25,580
That's right.

1129
00:52:25,740 --> 00:52:26,220
Okay, we made it.

1130
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:30,500
Hey, I've got my APHE-EM10 rifle grenade handy.

1131
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:33,660
What you need is your T-33 Scotch on the trainer now.

1132
00:52:33,740 --> 00:52:35,100
The bombardment has started.

1133
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,200
They're beginning with the artillery of the raid.

1134
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:39,340
Work out with ferry hydraulics.

1135
00:52:39,380 --> 00:52:39,460
Hurry in position, sir!

1136
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:40,720
Commence firing on the ally.

1137
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:44,060
These wounds are falling short at the moment, but as the range increases,

1138
00:52:44,620 --> 00:52:50,320
the hapless enemy is going to find itself separated by salty dashes of high-heavy armor.

1139
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,340
He's all for the printer, cover and try-locking cable.

1140
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,180
The operating system is MS-DOS, which gives the access user international standard software,

1141
00:52:59,280 --> 00:53:02,720
such as MS Word, or a multiplan database and MS Terminal.

1142
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:05,520
Now being used at this very moment in the war.

1143
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:09,500
Yes, this is war being done by some intruders.

1144
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:16,020
They're using the 7th teleprinter type 100 CA, or the Hewlett-Packard laser jet.

1145
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,680
We want peace.

1146
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,240
I am convinced that the Jib-Bats eat.

1147
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,640
Cheese and orangutans can exist there in peace.

1148
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,820
And as he spoke, silence pervaded the battlefield.

1149
00:53:28,300 --> 00:53:32,600
The crickets welled up with almighty peaceful ringing of songs.

1150
00:53:33,100 --> 00:53:36,920
Those rotten cricket no-goodniks!

1151
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:37,520
They blew it all!

1152
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:41,460
And again the Middle East became the spawning down of the philosopher king,

1153
00:53:41,860 --> 00:53:44,180
the Messiah, the man-king!

1154
00:53:44,480 --> 00:53:47,960
He will be known as the King of Arrakis.

1155
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:49,020
There, there.

1156
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:56,860
My dear son mohabi the evil Baron Harkonnen and his Republican guards and don't forget stink

1157
00:53:57,520 --> 00:53:58,900
alias Bush master

1158
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:05,900
Yes, George Leroy Herbert Walker sting bush in his leather loincloth now takes on

1159
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:13,120
Madman Saddam and he threatens in his little voice to was Lister the buttocks of the Beast of Baghdad

1160
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,760
Yes, duel in the desert day

1161
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:16,820
664

1162
00:54:17,580 --> 00:54:24,580
It was when we realized the crickets were tripping that we knew there was water deep underneath the crust of Iraqis and

1163
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:30,480
Covered with a milk chocolate shell which makes it purely delicious

1164
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:33,040
once we realized that

1165
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,100
deep in the underbelly of Iraqis

1166
00:54:36,100 --> 00:54:42,700
The deep in the belly of Babylon that the water surged and purged we knew that there was

1167
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,260
dramatic possibility

1168
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:45,840
about

1169
00:54:48,260 --> 00:54:54,380
Problems here in this iraqian war a sudden racking cough overcame me and desperate or a trouble the free

1170
00:54:54,380 --> 00:55:01,100
Is that this one hiding I think rumor has it that they wear their

1171
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:06,200
Freeman's think they find their make car rounds and they're wearing those Freeman's on the base

1172
00:55:06,200 --> 00:55:10,000
I suppose if it tastes like vegetables they keep that water stored and they never go pee

1173
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:14,260
I mean there it comes the green turnip landing a burleson air force base

1174
00:55:14,260 --> 00:55:17,860
I'm strategic left is the true force multiplier at these bases

1175
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:23,240
Yes, the United States faces both a dangerous challenge in a significant up a fam

1176
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:29,280
It is an area of military mobilization and deployed potential we're talking about an increasing on plan

all the

1210
00:56:42,560 --> 00:56:53,160
Post Office Box 140306 in mighty Dallas, Texas.

1211
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:55,280
Dear friends, that's right.

1212
00:56:55,660 --> 00:57:00,560
I'm actually telling you how to find out more.

1213
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:05,220
Far, far more than you may ever have dreamed possible.

1214
00:57:06,440 --> 00:57:08,760
You think it started with this radio show.

1215
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:11,860
Ha! Get that pencil out again and write.

1216
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:15,460
And just say, Bob, send me some.

1217
00:57:17,060 --> 00:57:32,020
And write that to Bob, Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas, 75214.

1218
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:40,580
And learn just what else you can get your grubby little hands on

1219
00:57:40,580 --> 00:57:41,920
and your hideous...

1220
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:43,820
blistered ears upon

1221
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:46,600
and what you can burn out your retinas with.

1222
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,360
You'll see.

1223
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:53,400
Ha, ha, ha, yes, you'll see.

1224
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:59,680
And also, that's www.subgenius.com.

1225
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,580
Now the Fog M fiber optic guided missile is hurtling down

1226
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,320
and turning left at the stairway in front of you

1227
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,820
and up it's going through each bedroom,

1228
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,200
sniffing for the one person typed into its computer printer.

1229
00:58:11,600 --> 00:58:12,540
Stick your...

1230
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:14,340
stick your hand in the ballot box, my boy,

1231
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,420
and taste my Kareem Abdul Jabbar.

1232
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,960
Ha, ha, ha, it's old Saddam Hussein.

1233
00:58:19,240 --> 00:58:20,700
You can sit it right in the basket.

1234
00:58:20,860 --> 00:58:23,160
If you pull your mitts out, that's it.

1235
00:58:23,300 --> 00:58:23,520
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1236
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:24,680
Kaput!

1237
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:25,840
Yes.

1238
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:27,620
And now...

1239
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:30,620
And so, Reverend Mother swept majestically from the room.

1240
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:34,840
Cleaning out under the tables and...

1241
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:36,240
We're breaking up, we're breaking up!

1242
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:38,780
Can't take it. Must reach oxygen switch.

1243
00:58:39,100 --> 00:58:42,140
Uh, it's the fake show here on the fake station.

1244
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,300
In a basement far away from the room.

1245
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:44,300


1246
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,780
Or I shall watch you crash into your rocket away airplane

1247
00:58:47,780 --> 00:58:51,000
while I smoke expensive cigars and make hot-blooded rabattles.

1248
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:54,520
Contrary to popular belief, everybody loves a fat man.

1249
00:58:54,840 --> 00:58:55,720
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

1250
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,760
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1251
00:58:56,820 --> 00:58:58,960
Now watch this one jump when I fire this lightweight,

1252
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,980
folding 9mm caliber machine gun into his stomach.

1253
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:05,020
Look! Up in the sky! It's a bird!

1254
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:05,860
It's a plane!

1255
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:06,440
It's...

1256
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:07,860
Bob the Dod.

1257
00:59:08,320 --> 00:59:09,580
Hey, Bob, this is it.

1258
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:12,220
What is it, Bob?

1259
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:15,160
Breakdown, huh? That's phony to me.

1260
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,700
Breakdown, huh? That's phony to me.

1261
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:22,320
Lone-Cow Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?
