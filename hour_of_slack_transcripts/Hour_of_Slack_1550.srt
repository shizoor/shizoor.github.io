1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,300
You saw me crying and the subgenius power of the tears I shed were tears of sweat.

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:16,200
And you'll surely find the way.

3
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,140
The name of the program is Synesthesia. I'm your host, Dr. Sinister.

4
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,440
And we may be having a very special episode of Synesthesia tonight.

5
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:31,760
Hello, you're on the air.

6
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:34,120
Oh, Dr. Sinister.

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,140
Why, hello.

8
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,820
I can't wait to hear this special show about special sin.

9
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,940
Special sin is my speciality.

10
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:43,200
Yeah.

11
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,440
Yes, what's the new sin? What's the new sin? I want to hear it. I can't wait.

12
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:50,020
Man, I...

13
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,840
That's the wonderful thing about sin is it's a renewable resource.

14
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:58,640
You never run out.

15
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,640
Sins are wonderful things.

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,100
You never run out. You never run out. You never run out.

17
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:06,800
All right. I am going to take another caller here.

18
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:09,640
So, Mark, I guess you know who one of my special guests is now.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,940
Yeah. Hey, Ivan.

20
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,460
Oh, hi, Money Mark. Good to hear you.

21
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:17,760
Good to hear you, too.

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,340
And let's bring on my next special guest here.

23
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:28,900
And Reverend Stang, of course, we and all of us, we express our condolences for the loss of Pappy.

24
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,260
Don't worry about my dad, Pappy.

25
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,420
He is...

26
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:45,120
For one thing, he didn't have to be grumpy for another Thanksgiving with everybody crammed around the table, making too much noise.

27
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:50,060
And as the preacher said, Pappy's gone to walk with Jesus.

28
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,080
Yeah, sooner or later, we all get a...

29
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,000
Pappy is chasing Jesus around with a great big stick going,

30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,920
What do you let your followers get into?

31
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:58,880
You numbskulls.

32
00:01:58,900 --> 00:01:59,400
Well...

33
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,300
What's the name of that place in...

34
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,660
You're doing fine. Now let me take back over again.

35
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:09,940
What's the name of that place in the Tolkien world where it's like, you know, to the west across the ocean,

36
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:13,800
like that's where all the elves go when they get bored with life in Middle Earth?

37
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,540
Like, sooner or later, we all have to make...

38
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:15,700
Stangville.

39
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,920
Sooner or later, we all have to make that journey.

40
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,040
All right. And here's our next guest. Thank you. You are on the air.

41
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,380
Hi, Dr. Sister. I was wondering if the bubble on your forehead went away or if...

42
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,480
Maybe somebody in the Plasmodic Institute decided to do something with the stinking residue.

43
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,780
Well, man, I got to tell you, I had to pop that. I had to pop that bubble myself.

44
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:43,200
And I... It's been a real ongoing problem. I used a rusty needle to do it.

45
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,020
And, of course, it exploded all over the place.

46
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:51,380
And it took me a whole afternoon to clean up all the fluids that spewed out.

47
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,120
Hurt? Yeah. Pain? Pain? That's the least of my worries.

48
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:58,880
Really, I was more annoyed by the fact that I had to clean it all up and the fact that it stunk after I...

49
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,580
I popped that bubble.

50
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,760
And, of course, I had to go get another tetanus shot, too.

51
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,340
That bubble lived.

52
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,560
The bubble...

53
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:06,780
The bubble...

54
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:10,480
It moved just somewhere else. It moved to Dave's head.

55
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,380
Well, you know, Dave's head is...

56
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,300
Exists in a kind of bubble of its own that is really not possible for mere mortals like us to comprehend.

57
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:22,540
Welcome to the program, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

58
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,100
I am so happy to hear from you after all this time.

59
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,440
I wish you'd call in more often, man.

60
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,500
You're one of my favorite...

61
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,740
All-time on-air personalities.

62
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,160
And it's really good to hear from you, and I hope you're holding up.

63
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,600
Well, thank you.

64
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,080
Well, I don't know about holding up.

65
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,060
I have my gastric juices.

66
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,400
Once again, I've been allowed into a balloon vessel.

67
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:46,620
And some of the people who think that I'm going too fast for the overture, you know,

68
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:49,140
I'm trying to make some progress there.

69
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:56,000
A couple doctors from the loony bin still think I'm having situations, they call them.

70
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,060
Well, what do they know?

71
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:58,560
Yeah, really.

72
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,420
What the hell do they know?

73
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,020
They're not real doctors, you know, not like I am.

74
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:02,840
No?

75
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,260
They're quackers.

76
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,420
Just like, well, you know, like you put in your shoe.

77
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,020
Yeah, ducks.

78
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,220
They're like duck soup.

79
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,200
They're ha-ha.

80
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,380
They're very funny, but not to me, you know what I mean?

81
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:19,820
The original working title of that film is going to be Cracked Ice.

82
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:21,640
Cracked Ice?

83
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:22,920
Yep.

84
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,780
I'm calling in from Ashtabula, and I'm calling in from Stank.

85
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,660
Stank County, Texas.

86
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:31,840
It's amazing.

87
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,800
That is a Stank County.

88
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,060
You've got people all over the place.

89
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,880
It's an international call-in you've got here.

90
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,540
Well, sooner or later, one of the foreign listeners will call in.

91
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:42,720
Oh.

92
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,960
I'm real happy.

93
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,400
We're working on me.

94
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,380
I wish I could hear Tanya call in.

95
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,240
That would be fun.

96
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,980
You know, she actually called me in the middle of the night once when I was actually in bed with a girl.

97
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,060
Man.

98
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,160
Perfect timing.

99
00:04:58,880 --> 00:04:59,280
Yep.

100
00:04:59,320 --> 00:04:59,880
A girl?

101
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,420
You were in bed with a girl, Dr. Sanister?

102
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:03,900
Tell us about it.

103
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,980
I want to hear all about that.

104
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:12,020
She's a very nice, she's a very kind, very kind young lady, and that was then.

105
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,420
She would have to be so charitable.

106
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,200
Oh, yeah, to associate with someone like me.

107
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:16,420
Kindly charitable.

108
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:18,500
What's her phone number?

109
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,060
It's 216-555-1212.

110
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,000
Feel free to associate.

111
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,020
Yeah, 555.

112
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,080
I know what that means.

113
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,760
You know, I've actually...

114
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,140
I think the statute of limitations is up on this.

115
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:39,400
But back when I was a 20-something, I actually wrote on a bathroom stall,

116
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,120
for a good time, call 216-687-3515.

117
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,860
I actually did that.

118
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,080
And then your call was received.

119
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:48,460
I remember back in those days, they thought it was a dating service.

120
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:53,340
It's actually Dr. Sanister's suicide helpline.

121
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:55,860
Call in and I'll give you advice on how to kill yourself.

122
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,360
Have you had me?

123
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:04,380
Have you guys noticed that it's like the holiday season and everybody's all depressed

124
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:07,560
and has seasonal affective disorder?

125
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,540
You know what?

126
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:12,680
I'll tell you what's a really good cure for that is doing something.

127
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,560
Like, maybe you had some kind of big project you've been putting off.

128
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,740
Get it done.

129
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,000
You'll feel...

130
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,180
A hot soapy enema works pretty good, too.

131
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,900
I've found that whining and griping, moaning...

132
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,320
In fact...

133
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,240
I have a prescription for it.

134
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,260
Would you guys like to hear it?

135
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,340
It's a list, but it's a short list.

136
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:33,680
Wait, wait.

137
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,140
Not a prescription, but a prescription.

138
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,800
Yeah, a prescription for seasonal affective disorder.

139
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,900
When you have the holiday blues and you can't stand all those ads and all those stupid Christmas carols

140
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,900
and your stupid, horrible family and all your horrible friends.

141
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,380
All right, let's hear it.

142
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,940
Monazine, five milligrams daily with food.

143
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:53,820
What is Monazine?

144
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,560
Five away, three capsules daily.

145
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,540
Wine on.

146
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,560
One teaspoon mixed with juice or water.

147
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,160
Bitch a lot, ten milligrams daily.

148
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,680
Metramine, one injection with dinner.

149
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,320
Complanium, 2.5 milligrams three times daily.

150
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,420
Gronax, 24 hours.

151
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,980
Max height, taken anally.

152
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,900
Spilletivan, one teaspoon for bedtime.

153
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,880
AngraDream.

154
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:23,880
AngraDream, of course.

155
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,860
The Chiefs have been on those for a week and he's a changed man.

156
00:07:26,980 --> 00:07:27,340
Yeah.

157
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:31,420
Finally, the last one is, and this is really good stuff if you can get it.

158
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,120
It's pretty expensive.

159
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,660
Scrutium hydroxide sulfate.

160
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:36,860
Whoa.

161
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,740
And capsules daily with food.

162
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,320
Scrutium hydroxide sulfate?

163
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,700
On the subgenius internet, they're so depressed because they have to go see their families

164
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:52,540
because it's the holiday and they hate everybody and everybody hates them.

165
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:57,000
Well, you know, I mean, I'll tell you what makes Thanksgiving perfect.

166
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,320
It's some wild turkey.

167
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,620
Yeah.

168
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,620
Actually, this Thanksgiving, I learned just how much my uncle is capable of drinking.

169
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,160
And I've known the guy in my home.

170
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,460
Did he shoot anybody?

171
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,760
No, he didn't shoot anybody, no.

172
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,320
But he...

173
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,720
Your uncle can really tuck it away, huh?

174
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,600
At least the whiskey, he could.

175
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:26,580
I see the double entendre there in what you're talking about.

176
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:27,520
He could put a little bit of a shot in there.

177
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:27,520


178
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:27,520


179
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:27,520


180
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:27,520


181
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:27,520


182
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,000
He could put it away and yet he couldn't take his...

183
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,020
Well, he could take his whiskey, but he couldn't take it with him and he tried to kill everybody

184
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:33,620
or something.

185
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:35,020
I mean, you got it wrong.

186
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,480
I'm sorry.

187
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,460
I'll retract that.

188
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:43,720
You know, the thing about family is, you know, I associate my family with my childhood, but

189
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,240
I have a completely different relationship with them as an adult now that I did as a

190
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:47,500
child.

191
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,920
No, now that you're a child.

192
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,400
And now that I don't depend on them...

193
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,620
Because they're not supporting you or something?

194
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,500
Well, you know, my parents will help me.

195
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,060
They'll help me out with one thing or another occasionally, but it's like the fact is like

196
00:09:01,060 --> 00:09:04,120
I don't need them so I can tell them what I really think.

197
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:08,940
And sometimes it turns out that our thoughts aren't all that different after all.

198
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,880
And it's interesting.

199
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,740
It's interesting.

200
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,180
Satisfying.

201
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:14,640
Yeah.

202
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,240
It is actually satisfying.

203
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,120
Many people...

204
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:23,060
I have a lot of subgenius friends who they'll go on and on about how awful their family

205
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,320
is and, you know, what pinks they are.

206
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:26,800
And...

207
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,120
And so forth.

208
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,380
And ultimately I end up siding with the family usually.

209
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,480
Yeah.

210
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:33,340
I remember you telling me...

211
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:37,140
But there's a family that's not whining and moaning endlessly at me and gossiping

212
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,000
and so forth.

213
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:41,260
Well, you know, I didn't turn into the freak that I am by accident, you know.

214
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:45,460
There was a combination of nature and nurture that turned me into the freak that I am today.

215
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:54,360
And, you know, now I get to discover whole new dimensions, shall I say.

216
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:54,880
Yeah.

217
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,900
That's really quite an interesting...

218
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,120
That's a moniker you could use.

219
00:09:58,260 --> 00:09:59,900
Not an accidental freak.

220
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:04,220
You could call yourself that and probably make a lot of headway.

221
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:07,220
Not an accidental freak.

222
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,440
I'm in the middle of a big family thing, of course, because my father died.

223
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,180
Yeah.

224
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:18,180
This was not unexpected, although it happened pretty quick, thankfully.

225
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:23,900
And we just had our first Thanksgiving dinner without Pappy there to grumble.

226
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,180
And I had to carve the turkey.

227
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:26,880
Which is...

228
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,480
Which I could not do nearly as well.

229
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,280
But...

230
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,320
I carved the turkey for the first time.

231
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,340
I mutilated one.

232
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,220
I mutilated it.

233
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:35,460
Yes.

234
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,360
It was a lot harder than I thought it would be.

235
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,640
Well, oh yeah, yeah.

236
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,340
It's not easy.

237
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,600
You have to kind of know what you're doing.

238
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,240
Know your turkey autopsy biology.

239
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,040
Yeah.

240
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,220
You remember the old Norman Rockwell painting on that Mad Magazine?

241
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,680
I think it was...

242
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,360
You know, I just...

243
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,860
There's a lot of people who, for instance, hate turkey.

244
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:56,860


245
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,400
They hate their parents.

246
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:58,920
And...

247
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:00,480
Oh, I only hate my...

248
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:03,400
The only reason I hate my parents is because they had me in the first place.

249
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,120
But aside from that, I like them a lot.

250
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:05,280
Yeah.

251
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,800
That's the difference.

252
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,700
You can't hold that against them forever.

253
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:07,980
Right.

254
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:08,280
It wasn't...

255
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:09,780
They were young and foolish.

256
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,720
They didn't know what they were doing.

257
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,540
So whatever.

258
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,540
Let's make the best of it.

259
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:19,860
Well, a lot of our Slack listeners know that I had a lot of respect for Pappy and I used

260
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:20,800
to quote him a lot.

261
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:22,540
You don't just have a lot of respect for him.

262
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,640
You have portraits...

263
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,040
...a lot of me from him.

264
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,840
You have a portrait of me from him.

265
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,260
You have a portrait of him on your wall.

266
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,480
Yeah.

267
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,060
Yes.

268
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,300
But, yes.

269
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,420
Yeah, it's a nice...

270
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:33,220
An equestrian...

271
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:33,740
I also have a...

272
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,620
An equestrian portrait.

273
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:40,740
He did a lot of legal work for people who didn't have a lot of money and they paid him

274
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,280
in artwork.

275
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,680
I seriously wish I...

276
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:42,960
I know just how that is myself.

277
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,980
I seriously wish I could have met him.

278
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,380
I seriously wish I could have met him.

279
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,280
And you did have some...

280
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:55,940
Well, I just wanted to say, there was a period of time from about my age of 12 to when I

281
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,820
first got married and had my first child.

282
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:59,340
I had a job where I wasn't even speaking to the guy.

283
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,360
I couldn't stand him.

284
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,840
I thought my family was horrible.

285
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:08,440
My parents were hypocritical old drunks that were completely out of it and didn't know

286
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,820
what was going on and...

287
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,560
As opposed to the hypocritical young drunks.

288
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,720
At least by...

289
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:21,820
But no more so than I later found myself to be when I was in their shoes.

290
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:26,680
And, of course, you know, when you have to get a job, suddenly half of what your parents

291
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,320
said started to make sense.

292
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:33,580
When you have a kid, the other half starts to make sense and you realize it's a vicious

293
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,060
circle.

294
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,140
It's never going to end.

295
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,020
Yeah, but it is fun to try on your mom's shoes though, you know what I mean?

296
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:38,280


297
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,000
Well, you ought to see my mom's high heels.

298
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,260
God, my dad's ties.

299
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,860
I can't fit in my father's shoes.

300
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,340
I cannot fit in my father's shoes because he was six feet high and pretty big.

301
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,260
But his ties, man.

302
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:54,900
He had...

303
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,820
Early mid-90s.

304
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,260
I had a man's skull ties.

305
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:07,720
In fact, I wore one of his Australopithecus skull ties to his memorial where I read his

306
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:09,660
self-written eulogy.

307
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:17,240
Yes, my father wrote his own eulogy and I went to Methodist church after he died and

308
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,600
after a lot of rehearsing, I read it.

309
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:24,660
And I will now, in a future show, cut to that recording.

310
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:25,720
Wow.

311
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,860
Reverend Stang, you could cold read just about anything and make it sound better than

312
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,700
anybody who'd rehearsed it.

313
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,100
Yes, but not in this case.

314
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:41,620
My dad's writing had some jokes that you wouldn't know were punchlines unless you timed it right.

315
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,440
I think I did a good job.

316
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:49,100
You were probably guided by an unseen hand at the same time saying, make them laugh,

317
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:49,560
you idiot.

318
00:13:52,020 --> 00:13:53,220
Thank you all for coming.

319
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,700
And I hope you enjoyed this episode.

320
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:55,700


321
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:55,700


322
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:55,700


323
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,920
Leave it to my father to write his own eulogy.

324
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,920
As follows.

325
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:05,600
And I didn't change anything.

326
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:15,660
This eulogy, panegyric or encomium as you may prefer, is being read to you by one of

327
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:23,120
my children as I am unable to do so, being disembodied and living impaired.

328
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,700
I am talking to you.

329
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:25,700


330
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:25,700


331
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:27,940
I am talking to you from the other side.

332
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:33,500
And I tell you right now, you should avoid this trip if at all possible.

333
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:42,180
There will not, of course, be a graveside service of interment as there is nothing left

334
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,540
of me to be interred.

335
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:50,240
I was cremated and my body burned to smithereens, or so I was told before it was done.

336
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,700
I take their word for it as I've never seen one or anything that was described to me in

337
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,940
the Bible as a smithereen.

338
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:06,380
I am now a smithereen, or at the at least a bunch of them.

339
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:13,840
This effectively prevents me from being resurrected in the same body, which I wore out pretty

340
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:14,260
good.

341
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:18,080
I think it prevents me from being resurrected at all.

342
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:23,200
I wanted to be buried in Israel, where there's a higher percentage of resurrection than

343
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:23,860
anywhere else.

344
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,680
But that cost too much.

345
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,240
Too much money.

346
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:31,660
And besides, my children didn't want to take the chance that my tongue might come back

347
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,700
to life and start talking.

348
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:42,120
Now, as to the biography, which is always done at funerals, I was born 27 years after

349
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,620
the beginning of the 20th century in Florence, South Carolina.

350
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:50,800
I was the third of four boys, and the best of them by far.

351
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,660
My mother was born as Marjorie Montgomery Stubbs.

352
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:55,660


353
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:09,280
She was born in New York, and my father was born in Orangeburg, South Carolina, but moved

354
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:15,640
often because he was the son of a Methodist preacher, which are not tolerated by any congregation

355
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,420
after four or five years.

356
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:24,460
As a matter of interest, I want to point out that he didn't become my father until after

357
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,840
they were married.

358
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:29,920
That should settle that question for you skeptics in the audience.

359
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,740
They had four boys.

360
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,860
They all did better than me in life, but I had more fun.

361
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:44,540
My biggest problem was trying to prolong adolescence beyond all reasonable limits.

362
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:54,060
I was married on April 4, 1950, in Washington, D.C., to Nancy Douglas of Wilton, Connecticut,

363
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,440
and she was married to a man named John St. Louis.

364
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:54,440


365
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:54,440


366
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,040
My father was a Catholic and with her assistance, I had three very fine children.

367
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,940
Each of them has done good.

368
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:04,400
At least they haven't been a burden on me.

369
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:10,500
To the contrary, I have been almost arrogant in my pride in each of them.

370
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:17,860
They, in turn, have returned the favor by giving me and Nancy six very fine grandchildren.

371
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:22,580
That's the biography now for the eulogy.

372
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:27,740
As a child, I didn't always do the best I could.

373
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:34,160
I didn't pay much attention to my schooling because I was more anxious to become an adult

374
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,840
so I could start smoking, drinking, and cussing, and using adult language.

375
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:46,420
I graduated from Harvard College, which surprised me as much as it did my family.

376
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,960
But looking back, I realized I deserved it.

377
00:17:52,220 --> 00:17:58,480
I graduated with the lowest possible passing grades over a four-year period

378
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,120
than had ever been scored by any graduate since 1652

379
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,040
when Increase Mather of Boston, Massachusetts did it.

380
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:14,740
My old roommate recently told me that he had reviewed my class standing when we graduated

381
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:19,840
and I was very surprised that I had graduated in the top 98%.

382
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:30,080
I went from there to Georgetown Law School where I graduated despite grades that are still talked about today.

383
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,400
If it wasn't for Nancy, I wouldn't have even that.

384
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:41,940
What I've been most proud of is that I enlisted in the Navy in July 1945

385
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,620
and it so unnerved the Japanese that they unconditionally surrendered

386
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:49,940
two weeks after I graduated.

387
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:56,200
I stayed in the Naval Reserve long enough to become a naval captain.

388
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,120
It took about 25 years.

389
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:06,980
I practiced law on the side, most generally on the inside of a bar.

390
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:14,680
The legal bar was the only one I ever passed in 30 years until Nancy and I moved to Glen Rose.

391
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:18,680
We moved here because Nancy liked the countryside

392
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,940
and I liked the neighborhood.

393
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:19,940


394
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:27,520
the idea of bootlegging. It satisfied both of us. My real estate agent said I

395
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:35,300
would be sorry till the day I died if I lived that long, but I wasn't. The day

396
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:41,140
before I shot through and arrived here, I was sitting on the side of my bed trying

397
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:48,260
to fall awake, but was only barely able to. I think that contributed to my being

398
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:55,420
here. Who knows? Now as to where I am now, I didn't have much to do with it.

399
00:19:55,740 --> 00:20:03,440
Certainly I had no influence on it, but it ain't hot. That's for all you Hugh

400
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,180
Smith haters because I know where you expected me to be. If it had been left up

401
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:16,020
to me, I would have rejected the entire process and opted for immortality. There

402
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,240
is no gravity here or any gravity here.

403
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:22,880
At least I can't detect it, but all the other forces of nature remain at work.

404
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:30,720
Tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis and such. By the way, there are

405
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:36,300
no pearly gates or any other kind to keep the riffraff out and I haven't seen

406
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:41,900
Saint Peter or anyone else of any fame. I'm learning to play the harp for the

407
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:47,640
first time in my life or death. Life, that's just a figure of speech up here.

408
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:52,900
I've been doing Amazing Grace to a boogie beat and I've got this place

409
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:59,460
rocking. My instructor thinks he's in hell. Other than that, it's the same old

410
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:06,840
humdrum. By the way, I don't have wings either and it's the same old Halo I had

411
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:15,880
on earth which is none. This place ain't no Hollywood. Now for some advice, which

412
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,920
I wish I had when I was back amongst

413
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:27,420
you. First, to live a long time, you should avoid death like the plague. It sure was a shock to my

414
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:35,540
system when I shot through. It was a heart-stopping thrill and took my breath away. Second, folks,

415
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:42,400
don't take the Ten Commandments too seriously. Only the first two and the 11th one. The rest

416
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:48,140
of them don't count too much, and you can talk your way out of any trouble. Just confess and say

417
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:53,620
you won't do it again, and you can be honest about it because I guarantee you won't do it again.

418
00:21:54,400 --> 00:22:00,900
So I say, have as much fun as you can during your days on earth, but look out for that 11th

419
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:08,900
commandment. It's a doozy. Shoot for that one and you'll be okay. I learned to my chagrin that

420
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:16,340
drinking, cussing, card playing, gambling, and dancing and other such don't count. I know that'll

421
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:18,120
be a relief to most of you.

422
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:27,100
Contrary to popular tradition, which most people believe rather than the facts, the streets are not

423
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:34,160
paved with gold. They aren't even paved. It doesn't even have streets, but only alleyways

424
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:43,160
paved with good intentions. Presently, those in charge, mostly Methodists, are engaged in a money

425
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:48,120
raising program for new harp lessons, which is naturally seen as a good thing. But if you're not

426
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:51,280
a Methodist, you're not even a Methodist. You're selling chances on a horseless chariot or magic

427
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:57,940
carpet at six for five dollars or ten for eleven dollars, which the Baptists think is a better deal.

428
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:05,300
But the Methodists haven't caught on yet either because nobody has any cash anyway, having left

429
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:12,740
it all behind along with everything else. I don't even have a toothbrush, but I don't have any teeth

430
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:17,380
either, so I'm not complaining. And don't believe that business about

431
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,860
money. Just don't believe it. It's just a kind of sentiment of

432
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:19,860


433
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:26,960
There are many mansions. He was talking about the way things were in around 30 AD. Those buildings were

434
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:33,480
somewhat short of being mansions. I'm talking mud huts. If the mud was hard and solid, they thought

435
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:41,500
of it as a mansion. That's it. I can't think of anything to be eulogized about, but I sure did

436
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:47,400
enjoy all my years on earth made especially nice because of my God,

437
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:57,080
my parents, my wife, my children, my good friends past and present, and wonderful good luck.

438
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:12,000
So, as sailors say, goodbye, Godspeed, safe sailing, and may you always have fair winds and a following sea.

439
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:23,720
P.S. If the preacher lets people stand up to say things about me, please make a recording so I can hold them to it when they get here.

440
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:35,920
Pappy changed his mind and said, very specifically, not to let people go on and on about it.

441
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:41,600
My father was always good at getting the last word.

442
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,960
And we're all going to miss him.

443
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,460
I already do.

444
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:49,900
I'm sure he would have done a better job at reading his own eulogy.

445
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,000
Thank you all very, very much for being here.

446
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:10,340
Well, anyway, it's true that I cried my eyes out for about 20 minutes when my dad died.

447
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:11,140
Because when...

448
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:20,680
That happened, I had my hand on his forehead and my other hand on his shoulder when he finally gave up the ghost.

449
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:21,880
It was...

450
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,800
He'd been sleeping most of the night.

451
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:28,780
I stayed up with him in the hotel, in the hospital room.

452
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,720
And he was tanked on morphine.

453
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,720
Because he was 88 years old and everything, his lungs and heart, it basically just...

454
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,160
They were giving out.

455
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,080
And I...

456
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,000
The nurse...

457
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,840
There was a nurse there with me.

458
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,460
We were just kind of puttering around with him.

459
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:50,380
And suddenly we realized, uh-oh, this is it.

460
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:55,080
And I went over and hung on to him and said, everything's okay, Pappy.

461
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,280
And I saw...

462
00:25:58,280 --> 00:25:59,240
We looked...

463
00:25:59,240 --> 00:25:59,980
I saw...

464
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:01,460
I heard his last breath.

465
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:05,100
And when we looked at the machine, we saw his last heartbeat.

466
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:05,980
She left.

467
00:26:06,100 --> 00:26:11,080
And I stood there and just cried and cried and cried and cried and cried and cried and cried.

468
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,660
Because...

469
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,100
He was my dad.

470
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,500
For better or worse.

471
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,320
And he was actually a really, really cool dad.

472
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,060
But in the end, you know, hey, it's the circle of life.

473
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,500
As the preacher said, he's up there talking to Jesus.

474
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,460
And as I said, no.

475
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,260
Well, yeah, yeah.

476
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:31,600
He's talking to Jesus.

477
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:32,700
You mean Steve, right?

478
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,140
You mean Steve, right?

479
00:26:34,300 --> 00:26:35,840
You've done a good job so far, Jesus.

480
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,280
You can quit now.

481
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:38,560
I'll take back over again.

482
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,640
You see, my father was...

483
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:41,640


484
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:41,640


485
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,260
He was a preacher.

486
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,380
As well as a lawyer.

487
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,460
He was actually a lawyer by trade.

488
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:54,160
But he knew so much about the Bible and had studied so much about the history of the Bible

489
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,980
that he didn't believe any of it.

490
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,000
He didn't believe Jesus even existed.

491
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,920
So, therefore, he taught Bible studies at the local Methodist church.

492
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,600
And he had a lot of fans.

493
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,020
They loved it.

494
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:11,620
He planted seeds of subversion and despotism.

495
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:11,920
This is my belief.

496
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:15,120
All over this Republican county.

497
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:17,700
All over this green and growing land.

498
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:19,520
And we're all real proud of him.

499
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,000
He was...

500
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,640
By the way, my father was a dues-paying subgenius.

501
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:28,440
He had the divine excuse on his wall, which is now my wall.

502
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,880
Except I think my sister's going to move into this house.

503
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:36,420
We will come back to Cleveland and my sister's going to live in my dad's house.

504
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:38,780
And we'll just come visit every winter.

505
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,480
But he was a subgenius.

506
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,720
My mom was a subgenius.

507
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,400
Well, my mom was just a fan of her firstborn son,

508
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:49,640
but my father really was a subgenius.

509
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,720
He appreciated it.

510
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,980
Being a lawyer, the double talk, you know, was something he could enjoy.

511
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,060
And he turned lots of other lawyers on to it.

512
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:02,340
They're all dead now, too, damn it.

513
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:05,620
That's what happens.

514
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:10,140
You hear the voices of dead people, and then you start talking back to them.

515
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:13,240
And next thing you know, they're answering you, and you get in this conversation.

516
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:15,440
Next thing you know, you're flying around.

517
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,100
That's the way it happens, I heard.

518
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:25,400
Well, when somebody dies that's close to you, suddenly everything's different.

519
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,940
And I mean everything is different.

520
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,560
We were prepared.

521
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:31,900
We knew this was coming.

522
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:35,360
For the last five years, every time I drove away from Texas,

523
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:38,180
I'd say goodbye to my dad, and he'd say goodbye to me,

524
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,120
and we both knew that could be the last.

525
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:41,300
The last time we'd see each other.

526
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:44,100
So we said our goodbyes and everything.

527
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,580
It's just that you walk into the house, the old house, and you go,

528
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:54,840
wait a minute, the Playboys don't have to be hidden anymore.

529
00:28:55,180 --> 00:28:57,380
We can just strew them all out all over the place.

530
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:59,220
We can pull out the liquor bottles.

531
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,220
We can have a party.

532
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,120
Oh, liquor bottles in a Methodist household?

533
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:06,860
Liquor bottles in a Methodist household?

534
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:07,440
What the hell?

535
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,780
But really, the only things I wanted,

536
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,680
were the ties and his teeth.

537
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,380
I'll be bringing those back.

538
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,480
You did lick a few bottles.

539
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:16,720
A few?

540
00:29:18,020 --> 00:29:20,020
Well, I licked all the bottles.

541
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,440
Actually, we got to looking at the bottles,

542
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,720
and there was a lot of stuff around here dating from the early 1980s,

543
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:33,460
like tomato sauce and cooking wine and things like that.

544
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,120
We'd look at the dates on them.

545
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,580
Good God, this is 35 years old.

546
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:38,900
Maybe we should throw it out.

547
00:29:39,780 --> 00:29:40,780
Maybe it should run for president.

548
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:41,860
A lot of those tomatoes do have a vintage,

549
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,540
have a 30-year vintage, so.

550
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,300
No, this was cooking wine.

551
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:47,840
That was different.

552
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:49,140
I didn't even sip it.

553
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,320
I didn't even think about it.

554
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,700
That's how proud I am of myself.

555
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:59,180
You know how desperate for a drink you have to be in a drink cooking wine?

556
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,060
It's very hard to go through a dead guy's house.

557
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:05,740
I've had, this is not the first time for me, by any means.

558
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:09,540
And someday, people will go through,

559
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,400
through my house,

560
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,740
go, God, what are we going to do with this?

561
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,760
Throw it in the dumpster.

562
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,240
So.

563
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,900
The great dumpster of history.

564
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,240
But you know nothing bad has ever done in years forever.

565
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,820
People rag on and on about it, like I'm doing now.

566
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,560
Yeah, I tell you what, the horrible mess in my apartment

567
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,840
was like one of the reasons why I haven't killed myself,

568
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:37,700
because like, I wouldn't want anyone else to have to clean that up.

569
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:38,960
Yeah, exactly.

570
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:39,200
Exactly.

571
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,380
Exactly.

572
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:39,520
Exactly.

573
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:39,520


574
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:39,520


575
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:39,520


576
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:39,520


577
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:39,520


578
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:39,520


579
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:39,800
I'm still alive.

580
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,400
But then I went on a cleaning spree recently, and like,

581
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:44,460
oh, does that mean I have one less reason to live?

582
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,780
No, you're clicking on the back stamps.

583
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:48,960
You're going backwards now.

584
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,980
That's not the correct way to think of it.

585
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,500
Yeah.

586
00:30:51,500 --> 00:30:52,620
The correct way to think of it is,

587
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:54,280
as long as your house is messy,

588
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,840
you'll hang in there for one more day,

589
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,740
because maybe you'll,

590
00:30:57,620 --> 00:31:00,840
you won't want people to discover what an insane person you were.

591
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:01,700
Yeah.

592
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,120
One more time.

593
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:05,640
You two probably have a lot in common with,

594
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,480
as far as messy houses go,

595
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,800
from everything you've told me.

596
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,000
Man.

597
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,620
I had the landlord.

598
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,500
You don't have a wife cleaning up after us.

599
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,460
Listen, I thought,

600
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:18,580
I thought for years that there was two levels of clean you could have in your home.

601
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,640
Clean enough to have a guy friend over,

602
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,720
clean enough to have a girlfriend over.

603
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,500
Turns out there's a third level of cleanliness.

604
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,180
Clean enough to have the landlord over.

605
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,300
Ouch.

606
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:29,020
Oh, no.

607
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:32,060
Hey, the landlord liked what he saw when he came over.

608
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:32,940
Yeah.

609
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:33,580
So.

610
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:34,800
But you got to correct him.

611
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:35,900
You got to at least let him know that.

612
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:37,580
Just call me, just call me the cleaner.

613
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,640
Hello, you're on the air.

614
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:40,920
Hello.

615
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:42,020
Hello.

616
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,340
Questions?

617
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,000
Preguntas?

618
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,040
Questions?

619
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,020
Questions.

620
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,060
Preguntas.

621
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:52,240
Actually, I have a fresh out of questions at the moment.

622
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:54,640
There's more delay on this line than I thought.

623
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:55,940
I have to get out of the room.

624
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,320
You know what the,

625
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,140
one of the good things about,

626
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:00,780
one of the good things about the Chinese language is to say that

627
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,220
if you say you have no questions,

628
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,820
it also literally means you have no problems.

629
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:05,180
Me, you're winty.

630
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:07,540
Yeah, I have no problems.

631
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,260
I have no questions.

632
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,860
So let's ask a question.

633
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,420
Anyway, what the hell's going on?

634
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:21,280
Is there something exploding your mind or any other brand new things going on that we need to know and learn, learn about?

635
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,720
There's a lot of water falling out of the sky.

636
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:26,060
Well, that happens sometimes.

637
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:30,300
Yeah, we have, we've been outside seeing, watching the floods in North Texas.

638
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:30,840
It's fun.

639
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,220
Ah, yes.

640
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:33,140
It doesn't affect us.

641
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,000
We're on a hilltop.

642
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,360
That's the place to build your home is on top of a hill.

643
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,240
With some fortifications.

644
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,380
Or the lake, or the rivers.

645
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:47,580
We're in North Texas in a relatively high elevation and, uh.

646
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:50,640
And I didn't even think they had such a thing as high elevation in North Texas.

647
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,740
I thought North Texas was all flat as a pancake.

648
00:32:53,220 --> 00:32:54,000
No, no.

649
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,860
Where we are in Stane County is where what they call the hill country kind of begins.

650
00:32:59,120 --> 00:32:59,560
Uh-huh.

651
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:06,320
It's not as hilly as the real hill country, but it's a hell of a lot hillier than Dallas, Texas.

652
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,340
Exactly.

653
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,580
It's in a sweet spot.

654
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,960
It's two miles away and that's not far.

655
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,480
You said that right.

656
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,140
For me.

657
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:18,540
It's funny, uh, I, I've discovered once my wife walked into the room and called in that

658
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:24,220
I was hearing her voice come back to me over the radio about a half second later than she

659
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,280
was saying it in the room.

660
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:26,220
Isn't that trippy?

661
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,220
I was driving, because, because of you, uh.

662
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:29,860
Well, I mean, if I talk to somebody on the moon.

663
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,040
Because of you, uh.

664
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:36,140
There's a little bit of a lag and I had to get out of the room that she was in or else

665
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,340
it would be like listening.

666
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,060
I was listening to the radio with the radio on.

667
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,420
Oh yeah, well, hey, you know.

668
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,660
You can't talk to somebody on the radio with the radio on.

669
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,560
You can't do that until you get your damn feedback.

670
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:51,760
Because of you recycling my material, I had the pleasure of listening to my own voice

671
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:53,440
on the radio as I was driving down here tonight.

672
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:55,280
Right.

673
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:02,340
That, that's, uh, not nearly as trippy as the time that I had a clock radio and, you

674
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,900
know, heard my own voice on a PSA when I was waking up.

675
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,940
It is kind of strange.

676
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,580
Isn't it?

677
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:12,960
Well, you'll have the experience again, because if the recordings come out in about three

678
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:16,140
or four weeks, uh, you'll hear it again on Hour of Slack.

679
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:17,040
Yes.

680
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,540
It's like a little, you know, kind of thing.

681
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:24,040
Yeah, by the way, by the way, um, we're, we, we may be running short on episodes.

682
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,160
If there's anything else you can send us, it would be greatly appreciated.

683
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,420
Yeah, I, I, I know.

684
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:33,100
I realized, uh, today when I tuned in and heard that excellent Hour of Slack number

685
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,920
931 that, uh, I had not actually, you know, heard it.

686
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,080
I was actually a week behind.

687
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:41,940
So there will be one in the box next week.

688
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:48,280
People with weak behind should never serve in the military as long as we've got these

689
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,600
congruent feelings going.

690
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:54,360
As long as we're all like in this blissful union of let's destroy the rest of the earth

691
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:59,720
and let the powers that be remain asunder or, uh, something like that.

692
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:04,360
We shouldn't let people with weak bottoms join the army or Navy or Air Force or Marine

693
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:04,720
Corps.

694
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,240
Cause they have to be, they have to control their movements.

695
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,600
At least, you know what I'm saying?

696
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:12,720
Yeah.

697
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:21,440
We're on the threshold of great vast with more wars of a great war hood.

698
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:26,440
And we have much, we may even come while we may be excited.

699
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:28,740
Oh, you mean the news?

700
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:34,580
Oh, I, you know, it, it really, it's kind of ridiculous to plan for next week's show.

701
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:41,880
Because probably world war three is going to break out for civil war in the United States.

702
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,200
God, they want us.

703
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,580
There's people that I read comments from on the internet who are dying to have a civil

704
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:49,600
war again.

705
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:55,280
Well, I certainly hope they enjoy their cities being leveled when that happens.

706
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,160
Yeah.

707
00:35:56,360 --> 00:36:00,180
You know, I had ancestors on both sides of the civil war, blue and gray stuff.

708
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,780
And back from a hundred years ago, that was really silly.

709
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,560
I had ancestors on both sides.

710
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:04,560


711
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:08,660
I mean, I'm not saying they're on both sides of the civil war, but, um, on one side, yeah.

712
00:36:08,780 --> 00:36:14,180
Like one of them marched through Atlanta with Sherman and burn it to the ground.

713
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:22,460
Like the phrase that I keep seeing on a new comments after internet news articles is that

714
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:25,960
civil war is coming and the lid parts ain't armed.

715
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,500
They're going to find out.

716
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,160
Oh, they have no idea.

717
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:34,560
They have no idea how many guns are in the possession of the military.

718
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,000
They don't know that they're opponents.

719
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:40,560
I'm a libtard and I'm actually armed, but, um, whatever.

720
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:41,920
I have two arms.

721
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:42,800
Yeah.

722
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,300
Princess.

723
00:36:43,380 --> 00:36:44,980
We have at least two arms.

724
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:48,180
That's only as far as we can tell.

725
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,260
I think the kids don't know.

726
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,780
One of them is kind of sore right now, like Dave, but you know.

727
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:55,700
But you know what?

728
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,940
You know what's, you know what's-

729
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:58,260
WCSB radio spaz.

730
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:02,700
Yeah, we libtards may not be armed, but we know the MacGyver better than they do.

731
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,040
Oh, come on, Mark.

732
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:04,540
You're a libtard.

733
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:04,540


734
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:04,540


735
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:04,540


736
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,640
You're one of those, uh, yeah, yeah, Mark.

737
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,260
I understand that you think guns are Satan incarnate.

738
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:12,980
Guns are cruel, man.

739
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:15,160
Yeah, by the way, loads of combo.

740
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,620
Dave, I have a question for you.

741
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:17,820
A question?

742
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,300
Yeah, I just wanted to confirm that you got your, uh, name from that Per Ubu song.

743
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:28,520
No, I, I actually did not, although I heard it six years before.

744
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,440
Per Ubu got that name from him.

745
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,280
What are you talking about?

746
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:33,540
No, no, no, no, certainly not.

747
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,020
Now, he got it from 200 Motels.

748
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:37,280
There's Lonesome Cowboy Bert.

749
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,400
You know, that St. Kappa song, Lonesome Cowboy Bert.

750
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:41,520
You know the, um-

751
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:45,720
There were lots of Lonesome Cowboys at the time also, besides Lonesome Cowboy Bert and

752
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:51,540
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, which I think was released in 80, and Brain Rock didn't go on the air

753
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,600
until much later than that.

754
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,220
Who was the earliest Lonesome Cowboy?

755
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:59,660
But you know, actually also, um, the band LCD Sound System, they actually got their

756
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:00,840
name from Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

757
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,660
Right.

758
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,400
Well, of course they did.

759
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,820
Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention that many times.

760
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:07,820
Yeah.

761
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,920
I mean, there have been Lonesome Cowboys of many names.

762
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:16,280
The earliest one that I knew of was the Lonesome Cowboy Bill, am I right?

763
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,320
Who was a cowboy singer.

764
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:19,420
I thought it was Bob or something.

765
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:24,540
You know, I'm sorry to say Bob in such a way, but I thought there were many Lonesome

766
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:25,800
Cowboy Bobs and Bills.

767
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,920
We all cross ourselves when he says that.

768
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:33,180
No, wasn't there a Lonesome Cowboy, like a cowboy singer?

769
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,360
Yeah.

770
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,060
In the 20s or 30s.

771
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:38,360
Singing cowboys, what, like Gene Autry?

772
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,440
Yeah.

773
00:38:40,020 --> 00:38:40,540
Yeah.

774
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:45,260
And there was a Lonesome Cowboy Bill or a Lonesome Cowboy Bob or some B-man.

775
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:52,000
There was a movie called B-Level Singer about a bad singer who wound up in jail a lot.

776
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:54,880
Or like Rusty and Lefty on Prairie Home Companion.

777
00:38:55,820 --> 00:39:01,660
It was the guy who did Mayberry, RFD, or what's his name, Andy, Andy Rooney.

778
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,040
You know, that's a bad singer.

779
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:03,160
Andy Rooney.

780
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,160


781
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,160


782
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,160


783
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,160


784
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,160


785
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,160


786
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,160


787
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,160


788
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,160


789
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,160


790
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,160


791
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,160


792
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:03,160


793
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:03,700
Andy Griffith.

794
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,320
Andy Griffith.

795
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:05,480
No.

796
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,060
And it was called Lonesome Cowboy.

797
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,400
The porno star, Andy Griffith.

798
00:39:08,420 --> 00:39:08,720
Sure.

799
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:09,560
Yeah.

800
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:11,920
He's also now into politics.

801
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,220
He's a sheriff now somewhere in western Utah.

802
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:21,720
No, actually, one of Andy Griffith's last roles was in a pornographic scene in a weird

803
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:22,240
movie.

804
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,540
A beard movie?

805
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:31,380
In which he received Philip Fleisho in a movie theater.

806
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,400
In a movie.

807
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,220
Andy Griffith, age 80-something.

808
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,320
Hold on a second.

809
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,320
That was his last movie.

810
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,200
He's like C. Lee Herman.

811
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:39,680
The same thing befell him.

812
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:41,180
We have a long tradition.

813
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:41,580


814
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:45,260
You think these guys are like the perfect Hugh Beaumont, and then you find out Hugh

815
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,080
Beaumont was a S&M transvestite.

816
00:39:48,160 --> 00:39:50,200
Not that there's anything wrong with that.

817
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:51,020
Now, listen.

818
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:54,780
On this program, we have a long tradition of absurdity and whimsy.

819
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,440
Whimsy?

820
00:39:57,260 --> 00:39:58,560
And absurdity, especially.

821
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,160
Whimsy?

822
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:00,920
What?

823
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:02,380
Absurdity and absurdity.

824
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,380


825
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,380


826
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,380


827
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,380


828
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,380


829
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,380


830
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,380


831
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,380


832
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,380


833
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,380


834
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,380


835
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,380


836
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:02,380


837
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:08,860
Whimsy is a long-standing tradition on this program, but I'm sorry, can I kind of break

838
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:12,120
character here for a second and ask you, is that for real?

839
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:14,140
About Andy Griffith?

840
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,600
Andy Griffith as a porno.

841
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:23,700
According to Dr. Howell, it is, and he was really dismayed by this whole thing.

842
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:29,140
Apparently, at the end of his career, the aging Andy Griffith agreed to be in some art

843
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,540
film.

844
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:39,360
And it included a disturbing scene of him getting a you-know on the you-know.

845
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:44,400
And it was one of those things that just...

846
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:46,720
The thing about Dr. Howell is he's...

847
00:40:46,720 --> 00:40:48,400
Nobody can really watch that.

848
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,600
I mean, it was Andy at Mayberry here.

849
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:51,580
The thing about...

850
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:53,200
It's time for a civil war now.

851
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:58,520
Because if our children think this, then our family toilets will go right down the television.

852
00:40:58,820 --> 00:40:59,520
And those kids will be like...

853
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,260
Our values will be totally erased.

854
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:06,260
The thing about Dr. Howell, though, is that he's an interdimensional traveler.

855
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,500
And he has been to so many alternate universes that I wonder if he was talking about this

856
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,600
universe or one of the other alternate universes that he visits.

857
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:18,360
No, this is something that really happened and it really bothered him.

858
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:19,080
Wow.

859
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,000
He was shaken and disturbed.

860
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,520
I think he saw it.

861
00:41:23,940 --> 00:41:28,320
Dr. Sist, if you want to check on what Andy Griffith's last role was in our universe,

862
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,480
there's always IMDB.

863
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:30,800
That's cheating.

864
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,100
Well...

865
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:37,280
Yeah, you have to learn it through an argument with some people who don't really know rather than...

866
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:44,200
Yeah, I mean, if we were young like No Money Mark, we'd Google that and know exactly the whole downfall.

867
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:45,220
We'd know it right now.

868
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:50,980
But instead, we have to talk about the perhapsness of it.

869
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:54,820
I think it's a true thing whether it was or not.

870
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,360
And I think we should salute Andy Griffith.

871
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,540
And all the other Marine Corps that went before his.

872
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:08,220
And that continue on to this very day so that we can salute America and see once again the song.

873
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,220
I remember you had to take quite a few doses of Angadrine to really get it out.

874
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:18,100
Hope for all to be of America.

875
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,980
Oh, forget it.

876
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:22,980
I forget the rest of it.

877
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,440
Then there is the Don Knotts porno film.

878
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,420
But I'm just kidding.

879
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,220
That's more believable.

880
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:37,060
I think that was like one of the too hot for TV Three's Company episodes, wasn't it?

881
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:38,380
Yes.

882
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:46,300
My personal favorite was the episode where Emmet got on with Howard Sprague.

883
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:47,980
No.

884
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:50,140
Not really.

885
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:51,880
Are you serious?

886
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,480
I can't believe it.

887
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,640
I shocked all of you speechless.

888
00:42:55,900 --> 00:42:57,340
I just didn't get the reference.

889
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,940
The problem is deafness, not deafness.

890
00:43:00,020 --> 00:43:05,100
Okay, Emmet and Howard Sprague were two of the secondary characters on the Andy Griffith show.

891
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:07,500
Oh, right.

892
00:43:07,620 --> 00:43:11,220
What was the barber's name?

893
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,040
Floyd.

894
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,000
Floyd.

895
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:14,040
Floyd the barber.

896
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,280
I've never watched a single episode of the Andy Griffith show.

897
00:43:17,720 --> 00:43:20,740
But I do know that you had Earpy.

898
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,940
And I also know about Floyd the barber because Nirvana had a song called Floyd the barber.

899
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:31,020
There was a drunk, a town drunk by the name of Otis.

900
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:39,100
And Otis has been the, you might say, the totem animal or the saint of some subgenius schisms.

901
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,600
I hear the name Otis.

902
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:45,880
The former subgenius pope, David Black, was an Otis devotee.

903
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,160
If I hear the name Otis, I think of Animal House.

904
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,440
And there's not a lot in common with Otis the drunk on Andy Griffith's show.

905
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,860
He was called from small tiny books.

906
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,240
Otis, my man.

907
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:02,180
He looks out the window one day and sees nothing but a long line of people wearing no clothes in the rain.

908
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,280
No, not on purpose or anything.

909
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,840
That is the wisdom of Otis?

910
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,500
Otis, my man.

911
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:12,860
I wasn't an Otis aficionado.

912
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:18,520
The stuff I heard, I never heard about the Andy Griffith story, but I did hear that Otis was a good person.

913
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:23,800
Otis, like so many real drunks, was very funny as long as you weren't one of his family members.

914
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:29,080
Anyway, on that note, I will clear up a line and I'll talk to everybody next time.

915
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,080
Hey Mark, thank you very much for your contributions.

916
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:31,860
No problem.

917
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,020
Thanks for the clemency, Mark.

918
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,540
That wasn't clemency. That was a tragedy.

919
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:39,240
No money Mark was hard to miss at the WCSB Halloween Hall.

920
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:42,020
He had one of those orange emergency seats on.

921
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:46,020
Like, did Lee Schwarzenegger get up for the most recent weekend?

922
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,240
The whole room lights up when he comes in, seriously.

923
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:52,060
I'm not even joking.

924
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:53,780
He's one of the best.

925
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:54,800
One of the nicest people I've ever met.

926
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,060
I would have to agree with that.

927
00:44:57,060 --> 00:45:00,100
Yeah, but he doesn't have any money, so, you know, screw him.

928
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:03,600
Really, this is America, man. You gotta have some bucks.

929
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,200
You gotta have some walking capital.

930
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,680
You have to have some fleas on the doughnut.

931
00:45:07,780 --> 00:45:10,280
You've got to, you've got to, got to, you've got to.

932
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:16,240
I've got a million dollars and I'm the smartest guy in the whole world.

933
00:45:16,260 --> 00:45:20,300
And I can do anything and I do everything right and I've never been wrong.

934
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:22,320
Both me and me.

935
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,680
I have more.

936
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:25,860
I'm as stupid as you are.

937
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:26,860
Come on.

938
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:30,140
If you said things like I say, you'd feel stupid.

939
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:31,780
But when I say it, it sounds great.

940
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:32,780
You'll vote for me.

941
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:33,800
Trump.

942
00:45:34,740 --> 00:45:35,220
2016.

943
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:37,540
That's it.

944
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:44,680
You know, once upon a time, I had a couple of friends who had this very strange thing going on.

945
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:50,460
Where this one girl I knew would refer to this other friend of ours as butthole mouth.

946
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:53,040
Because of...

947
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,760
Because of...

948
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,000
A facial expression he would make frequently.

949
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:56,400
Oh, the mouth like Trump.

950
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:01,620
And as soon as I heard her say that, like, I immediately thought of Donald Trump.

951
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,800
Donald Trump is the real butthole mouth.

952
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:15,220
His mouth, his pursed lips, disapprovingly pursed lips, do in fact resemble a puckered, shall we say, anus.

953
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:22,340
And that has been utilized in numerous internet meme graphics that I've seen.

954
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,760
You know, the other day on the freeway, I was like, oh, I'm going to be a pucker.

955
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:28,860
I saw a Saturn car on the road and it had a bumper sticker that says, my other ride is Uranus.

956
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:36,660
216-Val-no-Val-fier-from-the-right-of-the-iscus is the number to call.

957
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:42,140
Donald Trump, a photo of Donald Trump recently wearing a George Washington wig.

958
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:48,820
And if you don't think that was a male prescription, a horrible thing to see that made you very, very frightened for the future of mankind.

959
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:50,880
Nothing was his.

960
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:52,700
All right.

961
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,360
Your phone sounds a lot better, Dave.

962
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:58,180
Well, that's because I'm not using a real phone, Stan.

963
00:46:58,340 --> 00:46:58,820
Oh, good.

964
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,240
You're good for doing such a thing.

965
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:07,700
I'm using now, I'm using those things you wrap up coins in, those, like, little tubes you put coins in.

966
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:19,920
Yeah, man, I had to drive all the way out to Ashtabula and drag a piece of string the whole way to put a tin can in here connected to the one you have at home.

967
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:21,180
Wow.

968
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:22,680
That's a big issue.

969
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:23,560
That's a big improvement, actually.

970
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:33,640
And it just shows you what people can do in America when the will is there, when the plus rises, when the wisdom comes from without and within.

971
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,080
When people join together, they join hands.

972
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:43,360
Unlike some others who join their knees at the...never mind, never mind.

973
00:47:43,540 --> 00:47:46,020
But you do need 70 miles of string.

974
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,340
No, you only need 52 and a half miles of string.

975
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:52,500
But you need 70 plus miles of encouragement.

976
00:47:52,500 --> 00:48:00,340
And encouragement is a string, which is, like, makes the fidelity much higher and makes you just sound better overall.

977
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:12,980
Well, I like this way of doing radio shows by not being in the station because I can go to the bathroom, I can go get another beer, I can do all kinds of stuff that I can't not do at the station.

978
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:13,620
Yeah.

979
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:17,800
Yes, but we heard you when you went to the bathroom while you were trying to talk like nothing was going on.

980
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:18,340
True story.

981
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:19,940
Oh, you could tell?

982
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:20,660
Oh, darn.

983
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:21,680
True story.

984
00:48:21,780 --> 00:48:23,560
I heard the tingles and...

985
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:23,660
Hold on.

986
00:48:23,660 --> 00:48:24,340
It's a true story.

987
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:25,000
No, hold on.

988
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:26,480
I got a true story for you.

989
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:39,420
I once knew this fellow who was in this noise or industrial kind of band, and he played a show at Doubting Thomas Gallery.

990
00:48:40,260 --> 00:48:41,060
Uh-huh.

991
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:49,500
And the area in the gallery that was being used as the stage was adjacent to the bathroom.

992
00:48:51,380 --> 00:49:03,900
And the leader of the band had to go to the bathroom during his performance, so he just took the microphone into the bathroom with him and continued the show.

993
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,440
The show must go on.

994
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:07,080
That's great.

995
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:08,160
Why not?

996
00:49:08,280 --> 00:49:12,440
It was one of the most impressive things I ever saw.

997
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,700
That's really novel.

998
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:19,480
Well, and I take it that was a radio microphone because that would be kind of tricky with the audio.

999
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:20,800
It had a cord.

1000
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,280
It had a cord.

1001
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:22,480
It had a cord.

1002
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:23,280
But it's one of those old...

1003
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,840
But the bathroom door was one of those old doors that has a gap between the door and the floor.

1004
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:30,640
That's a long cord.

1005
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:35,460
The stage was right by where this one bathroom was.

1006
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:35,780
Yeah.

1007
00:49:35,860 --> 00:49:36,300
Yeah.

1008
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:37,140
No, he did it.

1009
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,680
Oh, I remember one really subgenious thing over on the west side at a gallery.

1010
00:49:41,900 --> 00:49:47,200
I had to go to the bathroom before, during, and after some stuff.

1011
00:49:47,720 --> 00:49:56,780
I had to be very quick about it and pretend like nothing happened because there were a lot of girls and there was only one bathroom as there are sometimes in those ad hoc galleries.

1012
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,460
This is why you cannot be a senator, Dave.

1013
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,460
You'd have to get a catheter.

1014
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:07,400
You don't care about your...

1015
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:16,520
You know what's funny is nowadays they're showing commercials for catheters on TV and they always have that little thing at the bottom of the screen that says, by prescription only.

1016
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:21,060
Yeah, that's because we need to crack down on that recreational catheter market.

1017
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:33,940
I'm sorry, that's so funny, but anybody who's recently viewed a catheter or dispelled rumors about catheters with friends knows that's hilarious and that's quite...

1018
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,260
Yeah, that's real funny.

1019
00:50:35,580 --> 00:50:40,880
Senators who are strapped down should not make public appearances if they can't cut the mustard.

1020
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:42,960
Oh, is that what they're calling it nowadays?

1021
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:45,460
Well, some of them have cloche...

1022
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:45,520
Cloche?

1023
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:46,200


1024
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:47,120
Cloche.

1025
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,020
Oh, man, yeah, I remember.

1026
00:50:51,100 --> 00:51:06,680
Yeah, speaking of family again, you know, like speaking of Thanksgiving again and family, I remember this one time I was over and my grandmother had had some serious intestinal surgery and I heard them talk about like, yeah, they should have support groups for people who've had this surgery.

1027
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:11,900
And I said, yeah, the first rule of Colostomy Club is you do not talk about Colostomy Club.

1028
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:16,500
You'd literally laugh if you had a relative have a colostomy.

1029
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:16,500


1030
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:16,500


1031
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:19,960
I remember I had a colostomy at Thanksgiving and we were all laughing hard.

1032
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:22,100
Oh, God.

1033
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:27,080
What a world, what a world.

1034
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:31,360
You don't need a colostomy bag if you have the diverter.

1035
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:32,240
The what?

1036
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:37,300
Diverts the food that you swallow into a bag before it gets to your stomach.

1037
00:51:37,520 --> 00:51:46,360
You can eat all you want, be a complete glutton, and then give the bag of food, chewed up food to the poor afterwards.

1038
00:51:46,360 --> 00:51:49,860
That is the most disgusting thing I have heard in my life again.

1039
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:50,680
It's a good idea.

1040
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:54,000
If I thought of it, somebody has already done it.

1041
00:51:54,080 --> 00:52:03,680
We could all be like mommy birds then, you know, it's like, you know, mommy birds will actually chew up and spit out the worms into their baby's mouths.

1042
00:52:04,440 --> 00:52:11,760
Well, think if Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie had the diverters installed on them.

1043
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:16,160
They could eat at Spago's or whatever, these fancy L.A. restaurants.

1044
00:52:16,360 --> 00:52:24,900
And then sell, their agents could sell the chewed up food or their bag, their diverter bag, to collectors.

1045
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:26,360
Yeah, I heard a horribly...

1046
00:52:27,040 --> 00:52:27,980
That's a brilliant business idea.

1047
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:36,120
I heard a horribly disturbing story on public radio a couple months ago about somebody who worked in a test kitchen for like a major fast food chain.

1048
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:43,860
And you know how if you go to a wine tasting, like somebody will, you get to see a bunch of rich people dressed up in fancy suits spitting into cups?

1049
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:45,040
Yeah.

1050
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:45,580
Yeah.

1051
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:46,460
Yeah.

1052
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,380
Otherwise they'd get too wasted.

1053
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:50,720
If they had a second liver like I did, they wouldn't.

1054
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,100
They'd hate to spit it out.

1055
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:57,160
But yeah, like in the test kitchen for this fast food chain, like they would chew it up and spit it out.

1056
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,180
And then they'd probably just throw it away, right?

1057
00:53:02,300 --> 00:53:03,600
See, that's the whining of America.

1058
00:53:03,600 --> 00:53:05,080
I don't understand how you can understand...

1059
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:07,260
There are homeless people who could eat, who have no teeth.

1060
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,760
You know, like chewing it up...

1061
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,040
They don't need that kind of chewed up food.

1062
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:10,460
Exactly.

1063
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:14,500
Chewing it up is one thing, all right, but there's also the sensation of swallowing it.

1064
00:53:14,560 --> 00:53:16,340
And there's also the sensation of how it sits in your mouth.

1065
00:53:16,340 --> 00:53:17,080
And it sits in your stomach afterwards.

1066
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:21,040
And there's also the sensation of what happens when it meets its ultimate destiny.

1067
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:23,100
Well, the diverger would still swallow it, but it would be a burger.

1068
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,580
Well, you can't really understand food until you've...

1069
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:28,520
Right after you swallowed it, over into a little bag that was taped to your side.

1070
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:32,180
You can't really understand food until it's gone through the whole process.

1071
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:33,220
A clear bag so people could see what you were eating.

1072
00:53:34,020 --> 00:53:35,780
What if they could eat your thoughts?

1073
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,540
That would be even worse, rather than eating your pre-digested food.

1074
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:42,520
What if people could actually eat your thoughts and your brain?

1075
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,180
Just your thoughts, not necessarily your brain.

1076
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:46,320
Yeah.

1077
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,320


1078
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,320


1079
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,320


1080
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,320


1081
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,320


1082
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,320


1083
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,320


1084
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,320


1085
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,320


1086
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:46,320


1087
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:46,480
That would be a little more nuanced.

1088
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:47,580
Oh, that's silly.

1089
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:48,580
That's science fiction.

1090
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:50,620
At the Baskin Robbins...

1091
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:55,260
That makes a lot more sense to me than eating someone's chewed up food that has all their

1092
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:56,400
enzymes of their...

1093
00:53:56,400 --> 00:53:56,640
Oh, no.

1094
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:59,360
What if it was Brad Pitt's chewed up food?

1095
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,460
No, thank you.

1096
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,120
What if it was Johnny Depp's chewed up food?

1097
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:03,360
That might be different.

1098
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:03,700
No, thank you.

1099
00:54:04,060 --> 00:54:05,440
You know, I generally prefer...

1100
00:54:05,440 --> 00:54:06,240
I think Johnny Depp chewed this.

1101
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,020
You could prove him out, too.

1102
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:10,160
And you could say that you were the...

1103
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:10,600
You had the...

1104
00:54:10,600 --> 00:54:11,000
Yeah.

1105
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,580
You were the hallucinator of such a thought.

1106
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:15,600
You would see that you would be the originator of the thought.

1107
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:16,320
And you could say that you were the hallucinator of such a thought.

1108
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,880
You're eating it from Brad Pitt's brain.

1109
00:54:19,220 --> 00:54:24,320
I think at the Ben & Jerry's test kitchen, they came up with a colostomy fudge chunk.

1110
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:34,520
Because they used so many people who didn't have their digestive systems intact, I should

1111
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:34,700
say.

1112
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:38,800
And they put X's on both Ben & Jerry's eyes on the label.

1113
00:54:39,060 --> 00:54:39,640
Oh, God.

1114
00:54:40,560 --> 00:54:42,180
Oh, God, I need a bucket.

1115
00:54:42,380 --> 00:54:43,100
Oh, my God.

1116
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:44,980
Disgusting.

1117
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:46,300
We need more oil.

1118
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:46,300


1119
00:54:46,300 --> 00:54:46,300


1120
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,840
The organic and the organic.

1121
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:50,940
Orgasmic.

1122
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:51,220
Orgasmic.

1123
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,240
The organic and the organic.

1124
00:54:52,420 --> 00:54:53,820
Yes, they must go together.

1125
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:54,660
Orgasmic.

1126
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:55,240
Orgasmic.

1127
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:55,540
Orgasmic.

1128
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,000
Yeah, that's right.

1129
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:57,500
That's it.

1130
00:54:57,540 --> 00:54:58,020
That's the word.

1131
00:54:58,220 --> 00:54:58,620
Orgasmic.

1132
00:54:59,300 --> 00:54:59,700
Radiation.

1133
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,880
Well, you often mock Reich's word.

1134
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:03,480
I'm getting turned on.

1135
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:04,920
Yeah, really.

1136
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:10,700
And you claim that you're the originator of some of Reich's more serious masturbation

1137
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:11,120
techniques.

1138
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:13,700
And they don't have anything to do with it.

1139
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,160
I'm not real proud of that.

1140
00:55:15,160 --> 00:55:15,540
Hey, man.

1141
00:55:16,500 --> 00:55:19,780
I'm a master of that.

1142
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:22,500
A master of that?

1143
00:55:23,660 --> 00:55:24,240
You do?

1144
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:25,560
Well, you know, I mean, I don't know.

1145
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,440
I should say, I mean, you know, I've-

1146
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:28,180
Go white, Biden.

1147
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:30,580
You know, this is the age of the specialist, right?

1148
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,060
And I've always been a generalist.

1149
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,560
I've always been a generalist.

1150
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:37,860
You know, I kind of specialize in all kinds of things.

1151
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:44,100
So, the result of that is that I'm a jack off at all trades and a masturbator of one.

1152
00:55:45,820 --> 00:55:46,300
I see.

1153
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1154
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1155
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1156
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1157
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1158
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1159
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1160
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1161
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1162
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1163
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1164
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1165
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1166
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1167
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1168
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:46,300


1169
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:47,100
Well, I mean, it's not that you're a generalist.

1170
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,620
That's not, you know, having quite a good head in the world, have you, Dr. Sinister?

1171
00:55:50,860 --> 00:55:51,340
What's that?

1172
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:57,960
Being a generalist who's, you know, kind of got a fairly good handle on things overall.

1173
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,760
But never one thing enough to make a buck.

1174
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:02,800
Yeah.

1175
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:06,500
Well, you know, there is my day job.

1176
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:07,900
I'm pretty good at that.

1177
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,380
Yeah, but that's not a buck.

1178
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,160
You did a bad job.

1179
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,860
You still have to have the day job.

1180
00:56:11,860 --> 00:56:12,100
You did a bad job.

1181
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:12,100


1182
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:14,280
And if it was a good job, you wouldn't have to go to it.

1183
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:15,280
Hmm.

1184
00:56:15,460 --> 00:56:15,860
Yup.

1185
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:16,280
Well, I got to go to this.

1186
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:16,280


1187
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:17,720
You wouldn't have to.

1188
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,760
You'd be allowed if you wanted.

1189
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,300
They let you come into the spa once in a while, too.

1190
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:24,600
When it's your earlier day off, you just go to the spa.

1191
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,420
They pay you to stay home and not make decisions.

1192
00:56:30,100 --> 00:56:32,040
They pay you really well for that.

1193
00:56:33,780 --> 00:56:35,180
That sounds dreamy.

1194
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,360
Well, it's all a dream anyway.

1195
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,000
That's another thing we have to deal with,

1196
00:56:40,040 --> 00:56:43,540
is the fact that we're just kind of imagining ourselves and we're not real.

1197
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:45,460
I hate that part of it.

1198
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,920
Well, doesn't anyone else?

1199
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:54,000
Doesn't anyone else hate the thought that we're all just thoughts imagining ourselves?

1200
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:59,520
And then if we ever slip up and stop to think of it, then we won't exist anymore.

1201
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:02,260
I've been trying that.

1202
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:04,400
I've been trying that since I was 16.

1203
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:08,500
I had that thought, and I tried to forget it for the rest of my life.

1204
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,400
Seriously, I've been trying to make myself not exist

1205
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,540
through analyzing myself for the better part of my life.

1206
00:57:14,620 --> 00:57:15,520
And frankly,

1207
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:17,660
the results have not been...

1208
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:21,280
It has yielded no success.

1209
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:21,880
Yeah.

1210
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,200
Not as anticipated.

1211
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:25,500
I tried to get outside the matrix.

1212
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:26,160
You can't pull back your own brain.

1213
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:28,740
That is an uphill battle.

1214
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:34,240
If you've got one, whether it's fatted and small,

1215
00:57:35,180 --> 00:57:39,460
or just not worth the effort in every other physical and agronomic way,

1216
00:57:40,520 --> 00:57:42,280
you still have to let go, man.

1217
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:43,380
Let go.

1218
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:44,620
Let Bob.

1219
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:45,960
Let it go.

1220
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:46,260
Let it go.

1221
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:46,480
Ooh.

1222
00:57:47,660 --> 00:57:49,340
Yeah, I've got to take a Bob.

1223
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:50,360
Excuse me.

1224
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:51,500
Bob is never a problem.

1225
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,740
Bob is the answer, not the problem.

1226
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:55,560
I've got to go take a Trump.

1227
00:57:55,940 --> 00:57:57,120
Can you hold my Bob?

1228
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:00,540
I want to thank you very much.

1229
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:04,360
Lonesome Cowboy Dave, seriously, I wish I could hear from you more often,

1230
00:58:04,440 --> 00:58:08,320
and I wish that we could talk together off the air sometime.

1231
00:58:08,980 --> 00:58:10,540
I think we'd have a lot to talk about.

1232
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,880
And Princess Wee, Reverend Stang,

1233
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:16,260
thank you very much for getting us all together.

1234
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,480
Thank you.

1235
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:17,480


1236
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:17,480


1237
00:58:17,480 --> 00:58:17,500
My pleasure.

1238
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:18,400
And like I said,

1239
00:58:19,020 --> 00:58:21,240
I started asking what happened to Crap Radio.

1240
00:58:21,540 --> 00:58:23,080
Well, Crap Radio is on its way.

1241
00:58:23,540 --> 00:58:27,540
Crap Radio, you know, the sphincters are just starting to loosen,

1242
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:31,460
and that big pile of crap is about to make itself known.

1243
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,020
Great, Bob.

1244
00:58:33,420 --> 00:58:35,040
Yeah, don't hang up.

1245
00:58:35,080 --> 00:58:35,760
He's Bob.

1246
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,600
Or you guys might have to hang up,

1247
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,960
but don't touch that dial, is what I meant to say.

1248
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:45,300
The work goes on, and the dream shall never die.

1249
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:46,200
Do not.

1250
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:55,780
stand at my grave and weep I am not there I do not sleep I am a thousand

1251
00:58:55,780 --> 00:59:04,680
winds that blow I am the diamond glints on snow I am the sunlight on ripened

1252
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:14,120
grain I am the gentle autumn rain when you awaken in the morning's hush I am

1253
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:23,720
the swift uplifting rush of quiet birds encircled flood I am the soft stars that

1254
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:33,220
shine at night do not stand at my grave and cry I am the subgenius

1255
