1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:02,380
Who's there?

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,240
The self-genius, power of swatching!

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,220
Now I know all about everything.

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:11,700
What?

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,280
Yeah, yeah, yep, yeah, yeah.

6
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,900
Are there any weirdos here tonight?

7
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,280
Well, I'll be damned.

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,000
Are there, by any chance, any fucking weirdos here tonight?

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:28,700
I'm so surprised.

10
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:34,240
Would there, by any chance, be any fucked up weirdos on drugs and alcohol here tonight, my friend?

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,880
Well, in that case, I want to hear a praise bow!

12
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

13
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,000
Now, there's some few of you here who may not know a damn thing about Church of the Subgenius,

14
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:50,240
and I will make it short and sweet,

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,280
because we are, of course, recharging for the amazing architect.

16
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:58,580
My God, man, I never...

17
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,400
I never saw such a thing.

18
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:03,660
In the meantime, friends, if you could just bow your heads,

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,780
and don't feel self-conscious or anything about this,

20
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:11,520
but if you could just join me in a solemn moment of sacred noise!

21
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,740
Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,480
Praise fucking God damn, damn God Bob!

23
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,320
Yes, my friends.

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,480
Open your hearts, close your minds,

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:28,520
unzip your lips and bend over and pull out that wallet.

26
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,440
And if you're not, you're not going to be able to get out of this.

27
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,980
Because Bob is coming.

28
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:34,420
And when I say that, it's not like when you say,

29
00:01:34,460 --> 00:01:37,580
Jesus is coming, that means Jesus is on his way and is going to arrive.

30
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,260
When I say Bob is coming, that's exactly what I mean.

31
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,760
If you come tonight, you will see that man, Bob!

32
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,360
And boys, now boys, don't worry.

33
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,500
It ain't queer if it's Bob, and even if it was, so what?

34
00:01:56,160 --> 00:01:56,640
Um...

35
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:58,680
Friends, there's only three things that I want to say.

36
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,800
There's only three things you need to know about the church and the subgenius.

37
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,420
That's Bob, spelled over there, of what?

38
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,240
That says 808. Well, close enough.

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:07,640
Slack.

40
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,300
And I think some, I can tell that some of you here know about Slack.

41
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,940
But the other thing you need to know about is the conspiracy!

42
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,000
Now, um...

43
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,960
But before I get ahead of myself, there's only there...

44
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:27,380
You know every church has to have some kind of rules and laws.

45
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,460
We only have one!

46
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,340
And I think some of you know what it is.

47
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:33,560
It is, fuck them if they can't take a joke!

48
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,140
And believe it or not, as cynical as that may sound,

49
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:42,020
that is indeed a philosophy that you can live by.

50
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:48,920
Now, uh, the church of the subgenius was founded in 1953 by this salesman,

51
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,600
this incredibly, magically talented salesman, J.R. Bob Dobbs,

52
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:57,280
when he was seized up in the spirit by an alien space monster

53
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:03,780
called Jehovah One, which has disguised itself as God for numerous religions over the centuries.

54
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:12,820
And he told Bob that throughout history there has been a conspiracy of normal people

55
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:19,320
stealing away the slack of the weirdos, the abnormals, the misfits, the disbelievers,

56
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:22,000
and most important of all, those who will believe anything.

57
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,960
Can I get a praise Bob?

58
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,300
Praise God!

59
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,200
So, he founded his church.

60
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,960
Not on a rock, but on a sandy, shifting beach of hypocrisy.

61
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:35,360
Because where's any religion without its hypocrisy, I ask you?

62
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:40,960
It's not that we love Bob that much, it's that we love the idea of everybody else burning in hell!

63
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,520
We're just like any other religion, you know, that's what it's all about.

64
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,880
But, it is a do-it-yourself religion.

65
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:53,560
It is a disorganized religion, a non-organization for non-joiners,

66
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,900
which makes it hard to make a buck off this thing.

67
00:03:57,700 --> 00:04:00,540
All subgeniuses, by definition, are different.

68
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,640
If any two are alike, one must die!

69
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:07,140
So check your neighbor out, make that decision quick.

70
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:11,860
The only thing that we as subgeniuses have in common

71
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:15,440
is that we have nothing in common with the normal people!

72
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,060
Now, so many people ask,

73
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,380
but okay, I've seen this man Bob tattooed on the butts of punks and old hippies and babies everywhere.

74
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,300
Who is this guy?

75
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,480
Well, you've heard the traveling salesman jokes of antiquity.

76
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Those are based on a real person!

77
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,660
Now, some go, no, they can't, yeah, Bob's gotta be made up, he's too good to be true!

78
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:41,180
Well, here's the thing.

79
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,300
Look at the word subgenius.

80
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,380
We didn't call it Church of the Genius, okay?

81
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,100
Almost anybody can qualify.

82
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:54,520
What we're saying is that the conspiracy has been misdefining intelligence all this time.

83
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,360
It's not intelligence, it's the truth!

84
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,040
That's what we're talking about.

85
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,100
That's not what counts.

86
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,460
What counts is sense, common sense, sense of humor, and dollars and cents!

87
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,260
And, uh, after the show, Sense Amelia, I guess.

88
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,720
But the thing is, Bob is not smart!

89
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:14,600
When did being smart ever get you a date?

90
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,540
Well, actually, in this crowd, maybe it did.

91
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,440
But, what he has is luck!

92
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,580
He is lucky!

93
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:25,620
The reason that Bob can do magic and you can't is he doesn't know any better!

94
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,520
He walks the path of least resistance, friends.

95
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,140
That is his path to slack.

96
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,920
And it can be yours, too.

97
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,600
But here's the thing about slack.

98
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:38,240
We're not gonna tell you what it is because we can't!

99
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,920
Only you know what slack is for you!

100
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:47,280
Now, for some people, slack is sitting in front of the TV set and smoking a beer or whatever.

101
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,780
For other people, like me, slack is working your ass off at what you wanted to be working your ass off at!

102
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,180
Woo!

103
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,900
We're not here to forgive your sins.

104
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,400
Bob Dobbs is not the kind of messiah that is...

105
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,500
He's not that well connected.

106
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:11,220
And on top of that, he does not actually give one flip of a shit about your sins!

107
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,520
He doesn't care about your sins!

108
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,020
He comes not to forgive your sins.

109
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:19,100
He brings not forgiveness, but an excuse!

110
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,240
That's all you really needed was an excuse.

111
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,120
And that is what he is for.

112
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,900
Now, and he is here to bring a reminder of slack.

113
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:33,280
Now, slack is, as I said, it's indefinable.

114
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,480
You might call it something for nothing.

115
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:39,600
Now, a lot of people think, oh, this church and subgenius is just all about money.

116
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,540
Well, that, too.

117
00:06:41,420 --> 00:06:43,440
Slack is connected to money.

118
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,360
Slack is connected to sex.

119
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,500
But Bob is slack!

120
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,900
Bob is money!

121
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,140
Bob is sex!

122
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,300
And Bob is coming!

123
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:51,880
Woo!

124
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,220
For boys, girls, and everybody else!

125
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:54,660
Nobody in between!

126
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,720
Also, here's another thing.

127
00:06:57,980 --> 00:07:00,400
You don't want to be using Bob as a crutch.

128
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,640
You let Bob use you as a crutch.

129
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:08,760
Ask not what Bob is smoking in his pipe, for he is smoking you!

130
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,660
You throw yourself into that damn pipe!

131
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,620
Go into his lungs and...

132
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:20,560
But we are not asking you to give your heart, soul, and mind to Bob, just your money.

133
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,860
And here's why.

134
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,000
This is a culture.

135
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:26,280
This is a culture of built-in planned obsolescence.

136
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,420
When they sell you a computer, they know how long that warranty is going to be good for

137
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:32,640
and when it's going to break down.

138
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:36,940
Bob is a short-duration personal savior!

139
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,100
After a while, you get tired of Bob and move on to the next personal savior.

140
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:46,400
It might be some porno star or Star Trek, God forbid.

141
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,400
So, the only thing, friends, that we have standing in between us and Slack,

142
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,540
is that conspiracy I mentioned.

143
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,580
Now, a lot of you folks know about the Q-Dub.

144
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,380
A lot of conspiracies.

145
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,200
There's going to be one for everybody.

146
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:03,800
There's the JFK conspiracy,

147
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,080
the UFOs crashing in Roswell,

148
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:10,220
the 9-11 truth-er conspiracy,

149
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,920
worst of all, the fashion conspiracy!

150
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,000
Friends, don't worry about a one-world governor or one-world religion.

151
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,120
You should be worried about a one-world advertiser!

152
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,380
That's who's going to bend you over and not even get the money.

153
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,300
That's who's going to get the common decency to give you a reach-around.

154
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,720
Friends, we're not asking for love,

155
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,760
because this is a war.

156
00:08:33,040 --> 00:08:36,220
It's really us versus them, and this time we're us!

157
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:42,160
For once, friends, we're trying to lead a return to decadence.

158
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,000
Not trendiness, but decadence.

159
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:49,220
Luckily, I will be followed by two hot chicks and one other ugly old man.

160
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,740
And then by Architect,

161
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,640
who will return.

162
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,780
In the meantime, friends,

163
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,660
yeah, this is a free country, alright?

164
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,640
You're free to work your ass off, right?

165
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,420
They even have a machine now

166
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,820
that can tell when you're thinking.

167
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,900
It's called a television.

168
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,400
And if it's off, you're guilty.

169
00:09:13,020 --> 00:09:17,060
Friends, all we're trying to do is tempt sinners away from the devil.

170
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,740
We don't give a head fuck where you go after that.

171
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,040
We believe in the God

172
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,820
that doesn't want us to believe in it.

173
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,400
That's how ornery we are.

174
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,600
We are unbuckling the Bible belt

175
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,420
so that its pants will drop to its ankle

176
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:38,340
and it will be forced to gaze unflinching upon its own private desires.

177
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:39,900
Ah, yes.

178
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:42,660
Bob said,

179
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,920
don't just eat that hamburger,

180
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:47,160
eat the hell out of it.

181
00:09:47,420 --> 00:09:49,540
And that goes for everything you do.

182
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,020
Uh, I don't practice religion.

183
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,540
That's what I preach,

184
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,640
because I'm not the kind of person I'm preaching to,

185
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,040
as Bob said.

186
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,880
And I could go on and tell you about the sex cults

187
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,000
and the deviation and the special

188
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,700
ex-pay drills and so forth,

189
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:07,780
mind control that we tend to do on you,

190
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,780
but I have to confess something to y'all.

191
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:12,680
There have been times

192
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,440
when I used to look out on the,

193
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,740
what's normally a pretty small audience of subgeniuses,

194
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:18,180
and I'd think,

195
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:22,020
God damn, some of these people are real nerds.

196
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:24,620
I would get frustrated

197
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:29,440
at the sheer nerdliness of half of the subgeniuses.

198
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,420
But then one day I suddenly went,

199
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,400
duh!

200
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,900
That's what this is all about!

201
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,880
It finally sunk in.

202
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,560
Yes, they are fucked up,

203
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:42,880
because there really is a conspiracy of normals

204
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,480
stealing away their slack.

205
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,860
They are fucked up,

206
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:49,080
and that's why J.R. Bob Dobbs is their god.

207
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,660
And that is why you,

208
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,680
you my friend,

209
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,380
you must repent,

210
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,700
quit your job,

211
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,760
and slack off while you still know how.

212
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,480
Question authority.

213
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,580
I see a few people out there

214
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,920
have been reading their prescriptures.

215
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,640
Bob is not,

216
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:13,680
now believe it or not,

217
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,180
some of you Bobbies are going to be surprised by this,

218
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,480
Bob is not the answer,

219
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,520
but neither Christ,

220
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,360
nor Christ Bob is anything else.

221
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,900
But there's one thing I want to leave you with,

222
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:28,720
and that is that one rule of Bob,

223
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,860
the one rule of the church of the subgenius,

224
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:34,200
fuck them if they can't take a joke!

225
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:34,980
Praise Bob!

226
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,480
Praise Princess Pisces!

227
00:11:36,620 --> 00:11:37,800
Praise Dragon Con!

228
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,300
And all you fucked up weirdos on drugs!

229
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:53,540
Look away from the pings to that billowing pipe

230
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,000
From your life of work and toil

231
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Look away

232
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,840
There's a hole in your soul that's burning you alive

233
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:06,320
Where slackdom will never decay

234
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,720
Look away

235
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,280
Your circle of eternal slack

236
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:15,780
From the pings to that billowing pipe

237
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,880
Look away

238
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,500
A triple bubble, you're burning back

239
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,940
From the pings to that billowing pipe

240
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,740
If responsibilities getting heavy to bear

241
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,180
And your blind walk through life's old sphere

242
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:57,700
There's a hypnotic man who is beckoning from

243
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,320
Is his disembodied head always there?

244
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,500
Look away

245
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:06,880
Your circle of eternal slack

246
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,640
Look away

247
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,700
From your pings to that billowing pipe

248
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:08,700


249
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:08,700


250
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:08,700


251
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:19,100
From your life of work and toil

252
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:34,700
Where slackdom will never take a joke

253
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:43,000
If your conflicts with normal bring struggles and strife

254
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,260
May then onward your rantings ensue

255
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:51,960
Look away from the things to that billowing pipe

256
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,260
That's awaiting in the temple you

257
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:59,500
Look away, look away

258
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:04,100
From the things to that billowing pipe

259
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:08,660
Look away, look away

260
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,360
From the things to that billowing pipe

261
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,440
The Mutant Mountain Boys

262
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,540
Recorded live at the Devotional

263
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,780
And before that yours truly delivering

264
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:36,960
Subgenius 101 at DragonCon

265
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:38,160
Before that the Mur

266
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,400
Friends, we still have in the show stash

267
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,200
Some great weird cover songs

268
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,780
Of many already weird artists

269
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:46,560
As well as some heaping leftovers

270
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,320
From the mating of this show, Hour of Slack

271
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,180
With Reverend Susie DeFluzzi's

272
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:54,000
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse on WREK Atlanta

273
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,580
With guests St. Byron Werner and Priestess Pisces

274
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,360
This is a good point for

275
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,640
A free lesson

276
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:01,900
Which would be

277
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,040
Rewardian vs. Emergentile

278
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,720
The easiest way to describe the difference

279
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,060
Between Rewardians and Emergentiles is

280
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,460
Mo is the Emergentile

281
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:15,500
And Larry and Curly are Rewardians

282
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,060
Well actually Curly is the Rewardian

283
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:18,160
And Larry is the Pink

284
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,040
Right

285
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,460
You might say

286
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,320
I mean not that Larry really was

287
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,480
But he was

288
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:28,520
You know he would fit that archetypal

289
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:28,840
Right

290
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,480
Whole thing

291
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,960
That Larry shaped whole in the culture

292
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,200
And some people are both

293
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:35,740
Yeah

294
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:36,740
I'm both

295
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,320
I swing both ways on that

296
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,040
Yeah well I'm both on everything

297
00:15:42,040 --> 00:15:43,680
I'm a pretty hardcore

298
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:45,920
Emergentile

299
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,540
But I've studied under some of the great Rewardians

300
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,060
Like J.R. Bob Dobbs

301
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,000
Dr. Philodrum and Princess We Are Doe

302
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:55,220
Right

303
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:57,860
Those who

304
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:59,480
They reward themselves first

305
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,580
For the work they're going to get around to later

306
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,240
Am I a Punishian then?

307
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:06,860
Because I don't reward myself

308
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:08,720
I castigate and punish myself

309
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:12,360
You're an insane Emergentile most of the time

310
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,160
So you might as well face it

311
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,240
That makes me feel better

312
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:19,840
Anybody who edits like you is a serious Emergentile

313
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:24,080
But there's some Rewardian elements in there

314
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:27,640
Your index finger is an Emergentile

315
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:29,140
It's giving me a witch finger

316
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,760
Yeah

317
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:30,700
Yeah

318
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,000
Which finger?

319
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,080
Susie the floozy

320
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:36,760
Who is flawless looking in every other way

321
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,200
Except for this one bunged up finger

322
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,320
Deformed finger

323
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,380
Which is her clicking finger

324
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:44,820
Which when you're editing on a computer

325
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:47,940
It's starting to split into two fingertips at this point

326
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,420
That's a clicking gout

327
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,880
And it's not even my bird finger

328
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,160
If it were my bird finger

329
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,880
It's all gnarly and scary

330
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,120
See I have to switch back and forth

331
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:01,920
In order to not do that to my index finger

332
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,060
I use my bird finger to click things

333
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:05,200
This finger is so deformed

334
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,800
When I pick my left nostril

335
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,040
It cleans out my right

336
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:08,560
Wow

337
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:10,280
Mine are just crooked

338
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,680
This is hurting my hands just thinking about it

339
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,840
It's reminding me of work

340
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:18,260
And keyboards and computer screens

341
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,700
It's so great to get away from that

342
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:21,360
But the real key thing is

343
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,240
Is that an Emergentile gets slack from work

344
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:28,140
Right, oh yeah, that's the whole thing

345
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,440
Absolutely

346
00:17:29,140 --> 00:17:30,000
It's the only way to get slack

347
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,020
From not doing anything close to work

348
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:33,260
Or from procrastinating

349
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:33,600
Right

350
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,380
Which is why it's weird

351
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,800
There's certain people who are both

352
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,600
I have to procrastinate

353
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,200
As part of the ritual that builds up to the work

354
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,780
Yeah, if it is a desperate last minute

355
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,900
I can't tap into that part of the brain

356
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,540
That's like, oh my god

357
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:49,960
I've totally screwed up

358
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,020
And you have to think outside the butt

359
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,080
That's where the brilliance happens

360
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,680
I wing everything

361
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,560
So I don't know where that puts me

362
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:59,100
But I enjoy doing it

363
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:01,760
Everybody

364
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:04,460
It's a good thing

365
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:05,580
Everybody

366
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:08,200
Wants a good thing

367
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,400
Everybody

368
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,960
Ain't it true that

369
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,000
Everybody's

370
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,740
Looking for the same thing

371
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,180
Ain't it true

372
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,780
There's just no doubt

373
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,480
There's some things that you can't do without

374
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,880
And that's good

375
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,000
That's good

376
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:26,480
That's good

377
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,320
Ain't it true

378
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,900
That everybody's just like you

379
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:32,900


380
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:32,900


381
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,840
That the sun that shines

382
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,200
You got yours

383
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,740
And you got mine

384
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,880
And that's good

385
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,380
Everybody's just like you

386
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,120
It's true

387
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:52,840
Everybody wants a good thing too

388
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,920
Everybody's just like you

389
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,220
It's true

390
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:57,220


391
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,160
Everybody wants a good thing too

392
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,520
Everybody wants a good thing too

393
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:06,520


394
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:06,520


395
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:06,520


396
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,660
Wants a good thing

397
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:09,580
Everybody

398
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,360
Ain't it true that

399
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,220
Everybody's looking for the same thing

400
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,640
Ain't it true

401
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:19,140
There's room for doubt

402
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:23,000
Maybe some things that you could do without

403
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,260
And that's good

404
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,660
That's good

405
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:33,700
Everybody's just like you

406
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,380
Ain't it true

407
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,920
That everybody's just like you

408
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:36,920


409
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,240
Everybody wants a good thing too

410
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,820
Ain't it true

411
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:43,460
Everybody wants a good thing too

412
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:43,700
Ain't it true

413
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,300
That everybody's just like you

414
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:48,320
Ain't it true

415
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:48,320


416
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:49,560
A great big hand

417
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,420
And everybody

418
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,880
Can understand

419
00:19:53,920 --> 00:19:55,380
What life's to be

420
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:23,740
What?

421
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,400
What?

422
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:33,420
This is Mark Hosler of Negative Land, and you're listening to the Hour of Slack with your host, Douglas St. Clair Smith.

423
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:38,020
I revealed the top secret information.

424
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
Yeah, on Wikipedia.

425
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,280
Oh, that's right. Oh, man.

426
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:47,180
When I told my son I was in Wikipedia, he said, so did you put the entry there yourself?

427
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,640
There's just no way to impress my kids, I'll tell you.

428
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,720
Before the ID there, that cover we heard of D.B.

429
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:58,580
I suppose that's good. It's by Great Balancing Act, who are on MySpace by that name.

430
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:02,900
From Volume 8 of Not Necessarily Beautiful But Mutated.

431
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:07,700
Good luck finding a copy, as only 100 of those were made, and I have number 98.

432
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,360
Thanks to Rev Wilder at neo.rr.com.

433
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:18,800
But now, another rarity, available only with a new DVD from NegativeLand.com, the 180Gs.

434
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:20,820
Ring!

435
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:23,720
This is Tom Crott, maker Colin from Rollercoaster.

436
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:24,380
Rolling Stone magazine.

437
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,720
Can I speak to someone in Negative Land?

438
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:27,340
No!

439
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:33,820
Can you comment on the connection that was made between your music, uh, and the ex-moodles last month in Rochester, Minnesota?

440
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,120
Now it begins!

441
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:40,940
Can you tell me, off the record, is there any backwards masking on the song Christianity is Stupid?

442
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,300
What's Negative Land?

443
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,240
No!

444
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,520
No!

445
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:51,140
No!

446
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,460
We have to listen to that word!

447
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:08,940
We have to listen to that word!

448
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:09,880
No!

449
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,640
No, no, no!

450
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:12,780
Yes!

451
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,240
The lyrics, I'm already going to fail.

452
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:14,820
The word gold might not fit, but it's nice.

453
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,200
But I also brought a loved one from New York.

454
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:15,300
Because what they've submitted to Daddy Boy Scuba.

455
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:20,120
Today, I got a good one from bands called the Vampire Damstал.

456
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:22,880
It's the band drafting.

457
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:10,040
And when it comes to killing you, the life that you would set for me is in the book.

458
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:15,600
I'm doing a psychopath, murdering werewolves, murdering marauding me.

459
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,480
It was the kind of murder that came from friends and neighbors that didn't make sense.

460
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,060
You didn't understand.

461
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,320
You didn't understand.

462
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,380
You didn't understand.

463
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:29,500
You didn't understand.

464
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,860
The reality is true.

465
00:23:32,940 --> 00:23:34,380
This is a joke.

466
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,760
It's a monstrous joke.

467
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,480
Gentlemen.

468
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,700
Gentlemen.

469
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:43,700
Gentlemen.

470
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:48,320
Does real life seem to joy?

471
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,500
Are you?

472
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,220
That was not the case.

473
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,960
Or sensationalism.

474
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,560
A vicious tale about a maniac.

475
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,200
Murder and music.

476
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,560
You give it up, punk ass.

477
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:00,620
Murder, and music, or sensationalism.

478
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,700
Enough typewriters.

479
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:04,100
Murder, and music, or sensationalism.

480
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,160
And enough time.

481
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:07,700
Murder, and music, or sensationalism.

482
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:11,880
And one of them will eventually come up with the King James Version of the Bible.

483
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,600
Murder, and music, or sensationalism.

484
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,720
It's your Bible.

485
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,180
We don't have enough data.

486
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,100
We need you.

487
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:19,280
It's your Bible.

488
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,640
We don't have enough data.

489
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:22,080
We don't have enough data.

490
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,320
Your Bible.

491
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,080
It's your Bible.

492
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:24,100
It's your Bible.

493
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:24,100


494
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:25,420
We don't have enough data.

495
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,060
We just don't have enough data.

496
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:29,040
It's punky business.

497
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:35,380
And that's why I'm saying, even in my views, the King James Version of the Bible.

498
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,060
Data.

499
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:36,760
Data.

500
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,540
Data.

501
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,500
Too much data.

502
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,040
He was not a homicidal maniac.

503
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:44,980
It's a murder.

504
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:45,140
He was.

505
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:48,240
Did not show any mercy on your lord.

506
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:48,280
Signed.

507
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,300
Signed.

508
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,300


509
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,300


510
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,300


511
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,300


512
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,300


513
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,300


514
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:48,300


515
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:48,840
Signed.

516
00:24:50,320 --> 00:25:15,940
Send a W住m a little my hair to the basement.

517
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,540
The easiest thing to do is do what he did.

518
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,480
Why me, Lord?

519
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:20,240
Apologize.

520
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:25,100
I was foregone as a dead man out of mind.

521
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,400
He apologized.

522
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,400
Like a broken vessel.

523
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,500
Well, that's America.

524
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,580
Why me, Lord?

525
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:33,180
I consider it a dream.

526
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:34,600
And you're overreacting.

527
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,500
Oh, wretched man that I am.

528
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:39,900
You shall deliver me from the body of death.

529
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,860
I'm going to have to cut it off now.

530
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,820
We're overreacting.

531
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,400
We'll be back after these messages.

532
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:50,280
Here is a smartly styled, softer, beautiful, new, wider rear end,

533
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:52,800
which was made bigger and lower to provide greater visibility

534
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:55,580
that your family will boast of for many months to come.

535
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,780
Drive this great rear end,

536
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:00,580
and you'll thrill to it as thousands already have.

537
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,920
While we're at it, if you were at Dragon Con

538
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,980
and you have met an attractive woman,

539
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,400
don't have sex.

540
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:10,920
Yes, because the attractive ones aren't women.

541
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,020
I saw a couple of Wonder Woman out,

542
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:15,340
uh,

543
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,280
very statuesque,

544
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,660
extremely statuesque Wonder Women

545
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:24,700
with large hands and Adam's apples.

546
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:27,780
Yes.

547
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,380
Now, if I was cool, I'd say,

548
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,540
but that wouldn't stop me.

549
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,180
That's a real big if, though.

550
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,700
Yeah, I...

551
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,460
Well, it's a medium-sized if,

552
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,400
but you can call it a big if if you want to.

553
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,300
Well, sometimes it's a small...

554
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:44,180
You're like that little chicken walking the floor

555
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,860
That if shrivels up when it's cold.

556
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,220
It's a little older.

557
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:47,460
Well, yeah, but, you know,

558
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,440
when it gets angry, it gets a little bigger.

559
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:52,320
It's a large if, quite large if.

560
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,420
No, it's a small if, it is small.

561
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:56,180
It's a very small if.

562
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:58,760
Ice cube, match.

563
00:26:59,060 --> 00:26:59,940
Ice cube, match.

564
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,360
Ah!

565
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,500
Yes, yes, yes.

566
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:06,500
It's like my brain.

567
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,320
Big, small, big, small.

568
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,000
Up, down, up, down.

569
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:11,520
Right, left, right, left.

570
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,100
I'm big, you're small.

571
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:13,000
I'm big, you're small.

572
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,440
You have the horror.

573
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:15,700
Yeah.

574
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,640
You do have the horror.

575
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,220
We got a bad case of the horror, man.

576
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,300
Who's got the horror?

577
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,120
Oh, we all do.

578
00:27:20,260 --> 00:27:20,820
We all do.

579
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,380
It's the horror.

580
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,320
It's the worst with him, though,

581
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,320
because Stang has had the horror for, like,

582
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,520
second longest.

583
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,680
Philo's had it worse.

584
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:29,640
What was her name again?

585
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,020
It's Stang.

586
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,560
Leora Watt.

587
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:35,300
I got a woman, see?

588
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,280
No, no, I think it was Cecilia.

589
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:40,820
But the horror spreads actually airborne now.

590
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,540
It's mutated like that bacon flute.

591
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:44,600
Mm-hmm.

592
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,860
Give him squeeze.

593
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:52,680
Aren't we all going to have swine flu at the end of this week

594
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,220
from mingling and touching the...

595
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:54,260
I think we have to.

596
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,040
Apparently it's a government mandate.

597
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,140
There have been people sneezing.

598
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,960
No, no, I want the Andromeda strain myself.

599
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,680
I've already had it.

600
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,720
That's just your excuse.

601
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,760
You just want an excuse to drink squeeze.

602
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,400
Works good.

603
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:06,620
Give him squeeze.

604
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:07,560
Squeeze.

605
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:08,940
Squeeze.

606
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:10,880
Uh-huh.

607
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:12,480
Have they remade that yet?

608
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,180
I hope not.

609
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:14,660
Yes, and it was terrible.

610
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,140
I watched five minutes of it.

611
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:17,060
It's like, oh, God.

612
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,220
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

613
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,260
They've got to remake everything.

614
00:28:19,260 --> 00:28:21,620
It's not even a good, like, bad film, bad film?

615
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,340
The original one was a Robert Wise film.

616
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,540
The original one was awesome.

617
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,240
That was another one of those pointed-out life movies.

618
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:29,440
The guy that did The Day the Earth Stood Still

619
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,420
and West Side Story and The Haunting,

620
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
all these great films.

621
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,980
I'll tell you an embarrassing story.

622
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,300
Oh, yay.

623
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:37,800
That was...

624
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:40,320
Andromeda strain was premiered in Dallas.

625
00:28:40,420 --> 00:28:42,800
I was about 16 years old,

626
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,340
and I was a young...

627
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,600
filmmaker to be, I thought.

628
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:50,320
And I even had written a little screenplay.

629
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,960
It was inspired by a bad LSD trip.

630
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,700
Oh, kill a surprise.

631
00:28:54,860 --> 00:28:57,660
And I was such an eager beaver.

632
00:28:57,660 --> 00:28:59,000
That you read about in the magazine.

633
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,480
That when they had this premiere of Andromeda strain,

634
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,840
Robert Wise came to the premiere.

635
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,040
And I saw this old guy coming down the red carpet,

636
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:10,240
and I figured that must be him.

637
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:14,560
There was no inner media to look up what somebody looked like.

638
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:18,460
So I ran up to him and thrust the script in his hand

639
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,660
and said,

640
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:21,920
I'm a filmmaker,

641
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,380
and I love your movies and everything,

642
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:27,440
and why don't you look at this or tell me what to do

643
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,180
and how to run my life.

644
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:31,000
He was...

645
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,800
He kind of smirked and smiled and said,

646
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,180
I can't do anything with this.

647
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,240
I'm not going to take your script,

648
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:40,820
but you got the right idea.

649
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,280
You show some spunk.

650
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,120
Keep going, kid.

651
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,300
And so I...

652
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,220
Yeah.

653
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:50,420
I think he had spunk all over the front of him.

654
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:55,680
It was actually an embarrassingly juvenile and stupid script.

655
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,580
And he was right.

656
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,560
What he really should have told me was,

657
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:04,280
kid, you don't want to end up in Hollywood.

658
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:04,900
It's hell.

659
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:08,580
I sent my son instead.

660
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,200
And my son is...

661
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,980
You sacrificed your boy to America's media.

662
00:30:13,980 --> 00:30:16,700
A member of the Directors Guild of America.

663
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:20,840
His name is right before Steven Spielberg's in the...

664
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:22,980
No, it's after Spielberg's.

665
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:23,220
It's Stan.

666
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:24,100
Yeah.

667
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,500
In the handbook.

668
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:27,340
Young Stan.

669
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:27,660
How about that?

670
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:28,240
Yeah.

671
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,800
How about that?

672
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,640
Yeah.

673
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:55,400
You don't care.

674
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:55,400


675
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:55,400


676
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:55,400


677
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:55,400


678
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:56,060
You don't care.

679
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,060
You don't care.

680
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,540
You don't care.

681
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,720
You don't care.

682
00:30:59,760 --> 00:30:59,840
You don't care.

683
00:30:59,840 --> 00:30:59,840


684
00:30:59,840 --> 00:30:59,840


685
00:30:59,840 --> 00:30:59,880
You don't care.

686
00:30:59,880 --> 00:30:59,880


687
00:30:59,880 --> 00:30:59,880


688
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:00,660
You don't care.

689
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:00,660


690
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:00,660


691
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,240
You don't care.

692
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,840
You don't care.

693
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,340
You don't care.

694
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,120
You don't care.

695
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,800
You don't care.

696
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,180
You don't care.

697
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:17,900
We'll see you next time.

698
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:13,820
We'll see you next time.

699
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:26,240
We'll see you next time.

700
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:13,940
We'll see you next time.

701
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:25,880
We'll see you next time.

702
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:53,200
We'll see you next time.

703
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:22,020
We'll see you next time.

704
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,220
We'll see you next time.

705
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:26,760
We'll see you next time.

706
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,120
We'll see you next time.

707
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,640
We'll see you next time.

708
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:48,960
We'll see you next time.

709
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:23,500
We'll see you next time.

710
00:38:04,580 --> 00:38:12,100
We'll see you next time.

711
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:17,460
We'll see you next time.

712
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,800
We'll see you next time.

713
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,460
We'll see you next time.

714
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:25,000
We'll see you next time.

715
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:25,300
We'll see you next time.

716
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,140
Keep going.

717
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:29,780
Keep going.

718
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,200
Let your mind wander.

719
00:38:31,340 --> 00:38:32,140
Let your mind wander.

720
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,780
Turn off your mind.

721
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,960
Relax and float downstream.

722
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,100
While you're thinking about that thought,

723
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,020
I'm going to insert a word.

724
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:40,020
Oh.

725
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:41,600
You ready?

726
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,000
Think about it.

727
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:43,720
Think about it.

728
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:44,520
Think about it.

729
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,080
Duck.

730
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,080
Don't you ever do that to me again.

731
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,580
It's an inside joke.

732
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,280
Yeah.

733
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,140
It was an outside joke now.

734
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,400
I confided in you.

735
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:05,800
You brought that up on the air.

736
00:39:06,820 --> 00:39:09,500
I've been using my outside laugh inside.

737
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:11,000
It hasn't been very pleasant.

738
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:12,520
I tried my inside out laugh.

739
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:13,040
Oh.

740
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:13,300
Oh.

741
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:13,800
Ow.

742
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,880
That tingles all the way down.

743
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:20,220
That's the background music now.

744
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:23,320
It's the Timothy Leary's presidential campaign theme song.

745
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,660
Or did you just switch to something else?

746
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:28,460
Actually, it was a gubernatorial campaign song.

747
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,740
Tim was going to run for governor of California.

748
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:31,160
He raised peanuts.

749
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:36,320
And John Lennon wrote Come Together Right as a campaign song.

750
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,620
Yeah, but it doesn't sound like a very good campaign song.

751
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,680
It doesn't tell you why you should vote for him other than he's got...

752
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:42,740
G.

753
00:39:42,740 --> 00:39:44,020
Down below his knees.

754
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:44,620
Yeah.

755
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,220
Stuff like that.

756
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:46,460
Well.

757
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:50,840
That sounds to be a positive thing for the job.

758
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:54,260
Remember when we elected that guy with no feet and he screwed the country up.

759
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,100
That's a caveat.

760
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:59,680
And they told us up front the guy shoot Coca-Cola.

761
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:00,180
I mean.

762
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,420
Timothy Leary loved Bob.

763
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,460
That's damn nice of him.

764
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,840
He put out for Bob.

765
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,960
And he died, huh?

766
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:10,760
Yeah.

767
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,540
Bob died?

768
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:11,780
Damn.

769
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,300
We killed it.

770
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:14,480
Oh, yeah, yeah, that's right.

771
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,100
I was there.

772
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,580
And I used up all my film before it happened.

773
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,820
And all my tape, so I've got no proof.

774
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,980
He comes back.

775
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:25,260
Rob, but you can see Bob die in the subgenius video for Rise.

776
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:29,580
Over and over and over and over again and over again.

777
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:31,000
No, that was the old version.

778
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,860
Over and more and more and more and harder and faster.

779
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:37,180
People crying, people picking up the pipe and getting hit.

780
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,220
And more people getting hit.

781
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:40,380
And the band doesn't care.

782
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,360
They're sick of Bob.

783
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,620
Yeah, they thought it was hilarious.

784
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:44,640
I wept.

785
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:49,260
And there was that guy with that bone through his dreadlocks tied on his head.

786
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:50,680
It set me off.

787
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:52,580
I couldn't eat for a couple days after that.

788
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:56,140
Some sort of cannonball or something.

789
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,100
It was Dr. Gary Cabrera.

790
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:58,840
Cannonballism.

791
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,080
Cannonballism.

792
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:02,560
It's a very big problem.

793
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:04,980
Especially in the schools.

794
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,580
I noticed they said something in the parade about the cannons on one of the boats that was in the parade.

795
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,680
Always makes me think of cannonballism.

796
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:13,900
You ever get the cannonball runs?

797
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:18,040
Man, splashes everyone by the poolside.

798
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,060
Oh, God.

799
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,220
Yeah.

800
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,080
And on that note.

801
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:23,960
Oh, damn.

802
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,200
The show's not over yet.

803
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:28,600
Hey, we can turn the clocks ahead.

804
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:30,560
That'll work.

805
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:33,520
That's some of that subgenius time control.

806
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:33,840
That's right.

807
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:35,140
Daylight savings month.

808
00:41:35,460 --> 00:41:36,300
Every day.

809
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:39,960
That's as much time control as I've had in my life in a lifetime in your church thing.

810
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,180
So, listeners, what we want you to do.

811
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:45,840
Is go ahead and just go to the clock next to your bed or even look at your watch.

812
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,560
And just change it randomly.

813
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:49,380
Yeah.

814
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:49,740
Yeah.

815
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,860
What time would you like it to be?

816
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,160
Why don't you have a little free will?

817
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:55,140
Why don't you be a clock teaser?

818
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:06,260
It's true that so far the only really useful form of time control that we have available to us is the snooze bar.

819
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,080
And patience.

820
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,160
Patience is another form of time.

821
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:11,200
People don't want to hear.

822
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:11,880
I mean, it's patience.

823
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:12,540
Staying?

824
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,900
Could you tell me about patience?

825
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,160
Now, we want to know.

826
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,020
What's patience?

827
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:16,440
Come on.

828
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,340
I know a clock teaser uses three hands.

829
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:20,380
Sitting here not killing you.

830
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,160
Oh.

831
00:42:22,560 --> 00:42:24,200
That's, yeah, me not killing you.

832
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:24,400
That's patience.

833
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:25,920
I thought that was some of that tolerance crap.

834
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,340
No, no.

835
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,660
That's pure patience.

836
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,600
What's tolerance?

837
00:42:34,740 --> 00:42:37,120
I thought my jokes were repetitive.

838
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,680
I think a clock teaser uses three hands.

839
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,080
Sometimes they have more.

840
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:46,060
I have, oh look, there's three on that one.

841
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,100
I'm just saying.

842
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:49,640
And a hole that says something about dates.

843
00:42:49,640 --> 00:42:51,160
Not those digital clock teasers.

844
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:52,460
No, no, no.

845
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,040
I'm not into digital.

846
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,340
We're more into anal logs.

847
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:01,560
Susie, you're guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.

848
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:03,640
I'm guilty as charged.

849
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:05,740
That's just his analosis.

850
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,920
You can build a house out of those.

851
00:43:07,920 --> 00:43:12,500
I think Abraham Lincoln was built out of a house made out of anal logs.

852
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:17,920
This show is going downhill.

853
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:20,680
And still he walked on the ceiling from what I understand.

854
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:24,120
I'm worried if there's even a bottom to this show.

855
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,300
Where do you think the anal logs are coming from, Stang?

856
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:28,780
Don't you know nothing?

857
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,960
You've got to start from the bottom.

858
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,240
I feel like they're raining on me right now.

859
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,440
That's that hard rain that's going to fall.

860
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:36,920
It's falling on you.

861
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:37,680
It's Bob Dylan's fault.

862
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:38,080
Oh, man.

863
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:42,560
Oh, it just rains and rains and rains.

864
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,180
And then I say, well, get out from underneath the deck.

865
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:54,200
I've got a beautiful version of raindrops keep falling on my head done by Deadbolt.

866
00:43:54,580 --> 00:43:56,000
Oh, I love Deadbolt.

867
00:43:58,420 --> 00:44:00,740
The deranged greaser biker band.

868
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,280
God.

869
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,960
I'm so out of it.

870
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:07,900
I don't know who any of the cool new deranged greaser bikers are.

871
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:13,040
Or any of the new Japanese weird psychedelic bands.

872
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:15,780
We love you because you're so out of touch and anachronistic.

873
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,660
Hey, you know what, though?

874
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:20,340
I know every Devo cover band that ever existed, I think.

875
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:20,940
Well, that's a point.

876
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:21,640
Yeah.

877
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:24,960
He's hip in one way, one single way.

878
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:25,940
You're like Rain Man of hip.

879
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,480
Is the worker in a Devo cover band?

880
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:29,920
Virtual.

881
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,780
Devo Ween cover band.

882
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:34,540
Devo Ween cover band.

883
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,600
That would be a great holiday.

884
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:37,840
Devo Ween.

885
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:37,900
Devo Ween.

886
00:44:38,920 --> 00:44:39,520
Devo Ween.

887
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:39,700
Deve Ween.

888
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:40,020
Devo Wee.

889
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:42,800
And believe it or not, we have a Ween cover.

890
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:45,000
I'm glad I held off on it until now.

891
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:52,040
This is Reverend Basil of the Psychoskeletons from soundclick.com slash thepsychoskeletons.

892
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,780
The pigs made me sweat that they couldn't break me.

893
00:44:54,820 --> 00:44:58,140
I didn't spill the beans no matter what kind of fancy things they dangled in front of my face.

894
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:00,720
The pigs made me sweat that they couldn't break me.

895
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:04,120
I didn't spill the beans no matter what kind of fancy things they dangled in front of my face.

896
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:05,180
Gotta wheezy.

897
00:45:05,220 --> 00:45:05,560
Gotta wheezy.

898
00:45:05,580 --> 00:45:05,920
Gotta wheezy.

899
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:06,280
Gotta wheezy.

900
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:06,600
Gotta wheezy.

901
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:06,980
Gotta wheezy.

902
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,280
Gotta wheezy.

903
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:07,360
Gotta wheezy.

904
00:45:07,400 --> 00:45:07,680
Gotta wheezy.

905
00:46:24,860 --> 00:46:26,000
Ween does that

906
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:27,700
special little song I like.

907
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,480
They do a song in a falsetto.

908
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:30,880
The whole song is in falsetto.

909
00:46:31,100 --> 00:46:31,640
Dean Weebo.

910
00:46:31,940 --> 00:46:33,380
Wow, you mean they got cheaters?

911
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:34,340
They got cutlets?

912
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,740
Well, no, no, no, not that falsetto.

913
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:39,340
I have a falsetto.

914
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,540
Yeah, I just want to look like a real cartoon.

915
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,260
You know, Russ Meyer used to take

916
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,340
Al Capp's Little Abner

917
00:46:47,340 --> 00:46:49,620
and draw bigger boobs on Daisy Mae.

918
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,500
Now, get this.

919
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,640
The princess to whom I'm consort,

920
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:58,820
Princess Wee,

921
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,880
when her mom was pregnant with her,

922
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,480
she would sit, she was a big Al Capp fan,

923
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,840
and she would sit and draw

924
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:06,560
Daisy.

925
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,040
Daisy Mae.

926
00:47:07,940 --> 00:47:10,400
And that's why Princess Wee

927
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,780
looks like Daisy Mae.

928
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:12,180
Yeah.

929
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:14,000
It's a good thing she didn't draw

930
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:14,780
a hairless Joe.

931
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:15,860
Right.

932
00:47:15,980 --> 00:47:16,260
Wow.

933
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,400
Or a fearless Fosdick.

934
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,240
Or Earthquake Magoon.

935
00:47:20,360 --> 00:47:20,940
Right.

936
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,780
Or Mammy Yoakum, for that matter.

937
00:47:24,780 --> 00:47:25,980
Or Evil Eye Flegal.

938
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,520
You kind of favor Mammy Yoakum.

939
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,000
Whoa.

940
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:33,060
No, you kind of favor Mammy Jankum.

941
00:47:35,120 --> 00:47:36,520
She stinks, though.

942
00:47:36,740 --> 00:47:37,240
Man, her breath.

943
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:39,580
No, you're thinking of Moonbeam McSwine.

944
00:47:39,700 --> 00:47:40,200
That's right.

945
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:46,360
I saw both of the Little Abner movies last year.

946
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:47,060
The musical.

947
00:47:47,100 --> 00:47:47,440
They're great.

948
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:48,840
There was a black and white one.

949
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,480
Yeah, the black and white one's creepy.

950
00:47:50,640 --> 00:47:52,040
It's got Doodles Weaver in it.

951
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:55,360
And the theme song of that

952
00:47:55,360 --> 00:47:57,960
was partially written by Milton Berle.

953
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,760
It's got the line,

954
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,620
but when it comes to courting women,

955
00:48:02,720 --> 00:48:03,480
Little Abner says,

956
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,400
gulp, gulp.

957
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:07,440
I'm just saying.

958
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:09,700
That's why he's so popular.

959
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:11,160
You told me earlier

960
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,100
that you personally heckled Milton Berle.

961
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:18,020
Yeah, the unveiling of the Hollywood Walk of Fame

962
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:21,500
star for the Three Stooges.

963
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:25,140
And there were guys that had climbed up

964
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,420
on top of this billboard

965
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:27,920
and were hanging over the side of it,

966
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:29,400
slapping the side of it,

967
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:31,060
yelling, Moe, Larry, jeez.

968
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,220
Moe, Larry, jeez.

969
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,640
And I was working at a little effects studio,

970
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,500
at that time,

971
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,060
and I wasn't going to tell them

972
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:40,800
why I wanted the afternoon off,

973
00:48:40,840 --> 00:48:42,080
but I told them and they said,

974
00:48:42,160 --> 00:48:44,820
go with our blessings and represent our company.

975
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,080
I was working at the right place.

976
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:50,640
Be our stooge.

977
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,980
And the only stooge that was still alive,

978
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:56,720
I hesitate to call him a stooge,

979
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:57,720
is Joe Besser.

980
00:48:58,020 --> 00:48:58,540
Oh.

981
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:01,580
Yeah, and they had some stooge wives there,

982
00:49:01,740 --> 00:49:03,440
and they had Adam West.

983
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:05,120
Stooge wives.

984
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:05,900
Yeah.

985
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:08,320
Oh, that's a couple.

986
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:09,660
You insulted Adam West,

987
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:12,700
thinking he was somebody else.

988
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,320
I saw this slimy Hollywood guy,

989
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,840
and I just thought I'd make fun of him,

990
00:49:16,840 --> 00:49:17,340
and I yelled out,

991
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:19,660
oh, it's Adam West.

992
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,360
And it turns out it really was.

993
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:22,880
Oh, no.

994
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:28,000
Well, he's been our co-star on the show now.

995
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,000
His name's come up a couple of times.

996
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,420
For kids, you little tiny kids out there,

997
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,340
he played Batman in the TV show.

998
00:49:35,900 --> 00:49:37,700
He's been on The Simpsons quite a bit.

999
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:38,740
A family guy.

1000
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:41,600
He's the mayor of Quahog.

1001
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:42,100
Oh, really?

1002
00:49:42,240 --> 00:49:42,540
Yeah.

1003
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,780
Playing himself, essentially.

1004
00:49:45,160 --> 00:49:46,560
Matt said that, you know...

1005
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:49,020
Family guy, I take it as a TV show or something.

1006
00:49:49,100 --> 00:49:49,740
Yeah, yeah.

1007
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,740
An Earth show, one of those Earth shows, they call them.

1008
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,420
Yeah, it's one of those feel-good, you know, emo...

1009
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:57,420
Family.

1010
00:49:57,920 --> 00:49:59,860
It's about family and a guy.

1011
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:03,920
Matt said they have a lot of stars on The Simpsons,

1012
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:05,260
but the one that...

1013
00:50:05,340 --> 00:50:07,420
everyone wanted to meet was Adam West.

1014
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,360
How'd their picture take it with such nerds?

1015
00:50:10,360 --> 00:50:11,900
Of all of those people.

1016
00:50:11,900 --> 00:50:12,820
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1017
00:50:13,540 --> 00:50:15,440
Claudia Schiffer and all these others.

1018
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:16,760
Oh, Mr. West.

1019
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:21,900
Oh, Bill Anderson.

1020
00:50:35,340 --> 00:50:35,480
Yeah.

These boots are made for walking, and that's just what they'll do

00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,980
But these baby boots are gonna walk all over you

1044
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,560
You keep lying when you wanna be losing

And you keep losing when you wanna not be

1046

But, yeah, you keep saving when you wanna be changing

1047

So it's right to say you ain't done right yet

1048

These boots are made for walking, and that's just what they'll do

But these baby boots are gonna walk all over you

1050
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:38,360
You keep playing when you shouldn't be playing

1051
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:43,120
And you keep thinking that you'll never get burned

1052
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:43,960
Ha ha ha!

1053
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:48,500
I just found me a brand new box of matches, yeah

1054
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:52,380
And what it is, you ain't got time to learn

1055

These boots are made for walking, and that's just what they'll do

Are you ready, Boots?

1058
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:09,720

Babushka! The amazing and beautiful Babushka!

Bride of that lucky devil, Little...

00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:37,080
Theodore from his new CD, Peace is Boring.

1066

More can be learned about Little Theodore and Babushka at littletheodore.com.

1067
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:45,140
And Theodore is spelled F-Y-O-D-O-R.

1068
00:53:45,440 --> 00:53:51,620
Before that, a short clip of, yes, adult pachyderm Stomp as performed by Rural War Room.

1069
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:52,680
Also heard in the background.

1070
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:58,780
That was an unreleased preview of the upcoming Rural War Room CD called Timothy Rah-Rah,

1071
00:53:58,940 --> 00:54:03,540
produced by Donovan Suit on MySpace as Rural War Room Records.

1072
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:05,340
And now The Large.

1073
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:09,880
You can do it, we can do it.

1074
00:54:09,940 --> 00:54:14,620
We'll pull together and build the largest wall ever created on the face of...

1075
00:54:14,620 --> 00:54:16,460
You can do it, we can do it.

1076
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:26,820
We'll pull together and build the l-lar-ges.

1077
00:54:28,260 --> 00:54:32,500
Larger, larger, larger, larger, larger, larger, larger.

1078
00:54:32,780 --> 00:54:34,220
We've got to protect America.

1079
00:54:34,320 --> 00:54:35,800
We've got to protect America.

1080
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,660
Once you got a 40,000-foot wall in place all the way around,

1081
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:41,360
and it would have to be a mile thick or so to stay that high,

1082
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,000
you got to have a net over it.

1083
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:54,260
A large, very finely meshed but impenetrable net.

1084
00:54:54,420 --> 00:54:58,640
I'm going to go now and shut you off and shut everything off

1085
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:01,440
and put on some kind of little thing.

1086
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:07,140
If some music follows this, it's Poopy Necropondy doing Disco Boy,

1087
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:11,360
but that's all kind of up to the time monsters.

1088
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:12,220
Goodbye.

1089
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:15,000
Goodbye. I'll spray my briny juices.

1090
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:15,700
Goodbye.

1091
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,720
Goodbye.

1092
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:08,100
I'm dancing, baby, but my feet won't touch the floor.

1093
00:56:08,360 --> 00:56:11,640
I'm a disco boy. I'm a disco boy.

1094
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:12,360
Oh, no.

1095
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:24,020
I've been sleeping 20 years or more.

1096
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:27,960
I remember a long time ago.

1097
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:29,380
Yeah.

1098
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:31,860
Yeah.

00:56:32,700 --> 00:56:33,740
Yeah.

1100
00:56:35,420 --> 00:56:35,740
Yeah.

1101
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:40,760
I've been looking for a chance to do.

1102
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:44,880
I've been looking for some answers to.

1103
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:49,200
Now I'm back to change your mind.

1104
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,140
Now I'm moving right inside.

1105
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:57,580
The world is turning kind.

1106
00:56:58,240 --> 00:57:01,000
I see what's going on.

1107
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,480
Behind my back.

1108
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,180
I'm a disco dancer, baby.

1109
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,520
And I keep dancing on and on.

1110
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:29,540
Disco boy.

1111
00:57:29,800 --> 00:57:30,140
Yeah.

00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,420
I'm a disco boy.

1113
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,360
Oh, no.

1114
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:45,180
I'm a disco dancer, baby, but I think there's something wrong.

1115
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,740
I'm a disco boy.

1116
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,720
I'm a disco boy.

1117
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,520
Oh, no.

1118
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,200
And I keep dancing on and on.

1119
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:54,160
And I keep dancing on and on.

1120
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,900
I've been sleeping 20 years or more.

1121
00:57:57,840 --> 00:57:59,360
I'm a disco boy.

1122
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:00,960

1125
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:01,400


1126
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:05,360
Now I'm back to change your mind

1127
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,800
Now I'm moving right in time

1128
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:14,060
In a world that's turned unkind

1129
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:18,580
I see what's going on behind my back

1130
00:58:18,580 --> 00:58:25,520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1131
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:27,620
I'm on

1132
00:58:29,620 --> 00:58:30,620

1135
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:40,400
With a why.

1136
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,840
Why? Because this has been the hour of slack

1137
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:44,180

1138
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:47,560

1143
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,480
From PR News in Washington,

1144
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:00,480
I'm caused by

1145
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:01,000
arson.

1146
00:59:01,160 --> 00:59:02,700
An act of arson.

1148
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,600
tested sexual misconduct

1149
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:09,560
that would give it a second way to make a weapon.

1150
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,740
North Korea already has

1151
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,820
a lewd behavior enrichment program.

1152
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:15,480

1154

from perfecting sexual enrichment

1155
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,420
but they say there is evidence that

1156
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:23,820
North Korea is working on the lewd process.

1157
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,500
The German government

1158
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,580

1160
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:30,380
