00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,540
The National Broadcasting Company interrupts all its programs to bring you a special broadcast.

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:09,000
A few hours ago, the atomic bomb was dropped on the...

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,960
So genius!

4
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:12,020
Power of...

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,880
Watch!

6
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:22,540
9, 0, 3, 7, 5, 4, 6, 2, 1, 0.

7
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:27,760
You tell them about me, buddy. We're freelance entertainers, officer.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:28,760
Apple Baker Mary.

9
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:30,260
Droolers speaking.

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:31,240
Dig this.

11
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,220
You have a go on Operation Get'em.

12
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:34,920
Got it?

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,120
Good, go get'em!

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:39,900
Hi.

15
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,940
Well, where are you?

16
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:43,680
What?

17
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,900
Oh?

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:47,300
Huh?

19
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:48,780
Oh.

20
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:51,200
Fine.

21
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:52,080
Hello?

22
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,100
Hello?

23
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,100
Hello?

24
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:54,860
Hello?

25
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:55,080


26
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:56,620
Quiet.

27
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:57,340
Quiet.

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,660
We know nothing.

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,500
But every one of us fears the very same thing.

30
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:03,060
The so genius.

31
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,180
Power of...

32
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,020
Watch.

33
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,340
Hang on, everyone.

34
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:13,960
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard about it, read about it.

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,920
But have you ever seen a psychedelic circus?

36
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,160
Those innocent fun games of the hallucination generation?

37
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:27,740
Here you will meet the swingers, the hipsters, the beatniks, and the acid heads who live from pill party to...

38
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,380
The pill party.

39
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,480
That's it. Step right in. Ride the accident.

40
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,740
Called Michael Pepe.

41
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,080
Garrison was very interested in Jack Rupert.

42
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,700
You have to be this intelligent to ride this ride.

43
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,880
...dead straight.

44
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:43,780
Oh, man.

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,280
...except to what he said...

46
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:48,620
You just removed all the subgeniuses from that ride.

47
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:49,380
...assessment.

48
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:53,980
Incoming.

49
00:01:54,220 --> 00:01:54,240
We're done!

50
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,920
Let me go!

51
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:58,380
Let me go!

52
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,020
There's a brick wall coming down soon.

53
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,120
Rockin' like a hurricane.

54
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,040
Yeah, I mean the show in general.

55
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:10,040
...is really not sucking at all tonight.

56
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,780
It's not what?

57
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,360
It's not sucking at all.

58
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,280
Oh, yeah.

59
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,600
It's rocking the night away.

60
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:18,220
And famously.

61
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,060
It's on the interweb.

62
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,420
Yeah, it's on the interweb.

63
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,480
I guess of all the subgenius gods over here on the interweb.

64
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,100
We're in the internet.

65
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,020
...superhighway.

66
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,780
The media netway.

67
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,600
You don't know if anything is real.

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,860
Can I drive in the carpool lane?

69
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:35,300
Remember when you could get on the information superhighway in a little...

70
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:35,560
Anything.

71
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,200
And you knew what was real in those days.

72
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,240
Now you have to take the supercar to get on the information superhighway.

73
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:44,700
You can't just get on there in a regular vehicle anymore.

74
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,020
And you don't know where to get the new supercar.

75
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:49,040
Because you can't use the one you used six months ago.

76
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,320
...to be purchased by children.

77
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,700
And then you can go really fast.

78
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,360
...like the color of the...

79
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:57,640
...rear grass.

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,720
...or in Chicago, New York, or Los Angeles.

81
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,980
Well, uh...

82
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,740
That was some show there, friends.

83
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,040
From Dr. Philodrum and Doug Wellman, Puzzling Evidence,

84
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:17,540
Dr. Howell, Michael Pepe, Don Joyce, and, uh...

85
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,640
I got...

86
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:22,000
Everybody was all over the place there.

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,740
And this also, Hour of Slack number 1035,

88
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,520
an unusually tripped-out show because it's on drugs.

89
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:36,620
That is, it is an educational episode about drugs.

90
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,480
Now, RelPref.

91
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,640
Are we going to get smarter?

92
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:44,900
Cosmological challenges.

93
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:47,580
Drugs, DNA, and the analyst's couch.

94
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,820
The future of happiness.

95
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:52,280
Brain scans, wearables, and brief encounters.

96
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,520
Are we alone? And where?

97
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,480
In the shadow of culture.

98
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,560
Science.

99
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:58,420
This is the big news.

100
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,300
Mastering disease.

101
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,660
Mind, brain, and self.

102
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,800
The greatest anything is ultimately undecidable.

103
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,200
Swappable mind tapping into the beam.

104
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,540
The complexity ceiling.

105
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,100
The future of chaos and complexity.

106
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,560
What causes disease?

107
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,420
The future of matter.

108
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,980
The future, in theory.

109
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:19,540
The merger of flesh and machines.

110
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,560
What is life?

111
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:23,920
The core remains mysterious.

112
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,240
What makes us the way we are?

113
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,740
Are we going to get there?

114
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,060
We are going to get smarter.

115
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,160
In a cartoon, you can do anything.

116
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:38,360
Let's say I, uh, eat, you know, the whole...

117
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,260
What do I do?

118
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,040
The carnivore diet.

119
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,740
Give me a little idea what that is.

120
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,020
I propose that we just eat meat all day long.

121
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,800
Use it up, consume it, eat as quickly as possible.

122
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,540
Okay? That's wise.

123
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,100
And you realize that that high doesn't last for very long.

124
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,080
They're not sick.

125
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,780
So you're looking for the next high.

126
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,860
Right. That's wise.

127
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:00,060
Crenshaw.

128
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:03,080
Hurry, get all your men and send them down to 666 Shadowbrook Road.

129
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:04,240
It's an old mansion.

130
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,620
He's found the amulet. There's no time!

131
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,940
Who the hell is this?

132
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,780
I'm the one they shot last night! I'm a werewolf now!

133
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,940
Have a nice night.

134
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,420
No, no, no, no! Don't hang up!

135
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,220
He's gonna kill your son!

136
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:26,780


137
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,860
So this is a kind piece.

138
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,340
This goes this way.

139
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:50,520
And, um, it's really cool that...

140
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:53,520
Oh! Oh! Oh!

141
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,400
Shit.

142
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,180
Oh my god.

143
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,360
That can't be good.

144
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:58,720
Alright.

145
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,920
Can't be done with that one.

146
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,360
More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more...

147
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,820
It's okay. My dad was an alcoholic.

148
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:13,800
He was always like,

149
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:15,660
I'm drunk, I'm beating you!

150
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,080
So I love alcoholics. I get the humor in them.

151
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,640
Marijuana.

152
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,160
Couple of keys.

153
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,160
The joint.

154
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,240
Hey.

155
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,960
Uh, this is pretty good.

156
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,980
My head is spinning.

157
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,520
Think I...

158
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,280
I can do it.

159
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,360
What, you guys...

160
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,720
You wanna...

161
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,880
Oh!

162
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,740
I think I wanna...

163
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,180
101.

164
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:05,600
Hashem Ben install this thing right there.

165
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,960
I can do it.

166
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,440
Sh homeland, Sera is breathe.

Hav a sweaty neck and all the dirt on here.

171
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,480
Oh my god.

172
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:23,680
I...

173
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:24,840
How can I make you feel free...

174
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:25,380
to do my best to fall?

175
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
Huh?

176
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
Honey.

177
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Too fast.

bumming cigarettes and staring at the cracks there on the floor

186
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,260
the monkeys are asleep

187
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:55,360

188
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,580
They're sending out their resumes.

189
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,600
Auditioning for plays.

190
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:02,060
We've seen it thousand times before.

191
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:04,260
The monkeys are asleep today.

192
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,380
I see them laughing nervously.

193
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:08,640
Their bare teeth painted smiles.

194
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:10,660
They just don't cut it anymore.

195
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,960
The monkeys are asleep today.

196
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,740
They're trying to walk upright.

197
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,620
But the lives upon their backs won't let them quite fit through the door.

198
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:21,040
The monkeys are asleep today.

199
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,220
They're getting laid in restroom stalls.

200
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,520
Their backs are up against the walls.

201
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,960
With nothing in their hands.

202
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,520
The monkeys are asleep today.

203
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,400
They're crawling in the sidewalk cracks.

204
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,600
They're much too tired for fighting back.

205
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,360
They fill the shopping malls.

206
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:53,200
The monkeys are asleep today.

207
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:56,160
They're sitting in their cubicles.

208
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,120
I saw them crossing Market Street with briefcases in tow.

209
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:02,720
The monkeys are asleep today.

210
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,780
They're getting stuck in traffic jams.

211
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,660
They haven't figured out quite yet.

212
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,060
They've got nowhere to go.

213
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,820
Nowhere to go.

214
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,100
Nowhere to go.

215
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:18,440
Nowhere to go.

216
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,340
Nowhere to go.

00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:52,800


234
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:57,740
Then you will always enjoy the best sound performance from your CD player and compact discs.

235
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,520
Please select track 5.

236
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,580
Jeez, I gotta take a leak so bad I can taste it!

237
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:12,700
Golly, you hear a lot of savage and unnatural things about people these days.

238
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,380
Thump their bodies and warp their personalities.

239
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,520
Nature makes mistakes. It's proven every day.

240
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:25,860
This person is a transvestite, a man who is more comfortable wearing girls' clothes.

241
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,120
Thank you very much.

242
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:31,980
Since the only legitimate source of LSD in the United States is the specific type of alcohol,

243
00:17:32,140 --> 00:17:36,580
LSD is used to find itself in large, black, and white.

244
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,240
You want to borrow your sister's dress?

245
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:45,240
LSD is lysergic acid diethylamide, or acid as it's popularly called these days.

246
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,280
To help you set up and adjust the sound from your headphones or speakers,

247
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,500
we are providing the following.

248
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,240
Following music.

249
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:53,020
Amen.

250
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,080
Destroy 40 million little innocent babies.

251
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:55,780
You'll faint!

252
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,720
I don't know if I can give up.

253
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,540
Amen.

254
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,100
I don't know if I can give up.

255
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:50,380


256
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:50,480


257
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:50,480


258
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:50,480


259
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:50,480

266
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:50,480


267
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:50,480


268
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:50,640
It's true!

269
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,700
Standing for LSD, waiting for a psychedelic lightning to strike,

270
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:59,860
More often they swing by exploring the mesmerizing sphere of fear ...

271
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,860
hat this

272
00:19:07,900 --> 00:19:10,460
This is the right channel.

273
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:15,680
And now, both channels

274
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,760
Going insane

275
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:20,460
We are now switching the D Penn Basin to Ministecti Excel.

276
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:20,460


277
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:24,540
on the stereo sound and you will hear the full range quality and fidelity of

278
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,480
the following music as it was recorded

279
00:19:50,600 --> 00:20:00,880
this is one of the most potent chemicals known it produces marked changes in vision time space

280
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:10,600
and self-identity it was synthesized in 1938 by dr albert hoffman in basel switzerland

281
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:15,120
and then about five years later he accidentally inhaled a small amount

282
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,140
of alcohol

283
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,600
no one had a bad trip it was all very good

284
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,340
only you can kill a brain

285
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:49,580
you go ahead and wear your sister's dress plans

286
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:53,260
we did look much better as a girl than you do as a man

287
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:02,340
your laser lens system has now been thoroughly cleaned we suggest that you use this voice

288
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:10,040
assisted laser lens cleaning system on a regular basis but every 10 hours of player use then you

289
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,160
will always enjoy the best sound performance from your cd player and compact discs

290
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:50,400
no we we would have even though it was said that music was completely

291
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:50,440
おいしい

292
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:50,440


293
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,380
me

294
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:54,860
Purple haze is in my eyes

295
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:58,860
Don't know if it's day or night

296
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,200
You got me blowing on my mind

297
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,480
Is it tomorrow or the end of time?

298
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:50,420
Is it tomorrow or the end of time?

299
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,360
Ha!

300
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:20,460


301
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:28,860
Couldn't he have hidden a body in a closet

302
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,800
or someplace around the house?

303
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,900
The only place he could have hidden a body was inside

304
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,340
The Self Genius

305
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,120
Powerhouse

306
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,060
What?

307
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:37,880
No.

308
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,160
Couldn't he have hidden a body in a

309
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:40,460
Bob?

310
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:42,360
someplace around the house?

311
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,820
Zero, two, four, six, eight, it's a bad

312
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:48,940
You really ought to be ashamed of yourself.

313
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:50,320
Here is your talent.

314
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:53,380
For tonight by tomorrow it's not the day and the evening

315
00:23:53,380 --> 00:23:55,360
but still mostly Thursday

316
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,300
so more night for Friday by Saturday

317
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,280
and plenty of Saturday night by Sunday from Tampa.

318
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,560
Lee Murr

319
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,940
Uh, did it.

320
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,780
And the purple haze version there was by

321
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:13,860
the Roto-Rooter Good Time Christmas Band

322
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:18,040
and the long trippy ravey thing before that

323
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,440
was the Industrial Strength CD Cleaner

324
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,640
from lamprey-systems.com

325
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,540
Lamprey Systems

326
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,180
And now a little heart ignition.

And so much time, so little to do.

Um, I suspect it might be something similar.

368
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:12,140
This is PR, helping scientists understand and improve PR.

369
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,520
Those are chimpanzees.

370
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,120
You can't fool me.

371
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,200
These are bonobos.

372
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:18,380
They're pygmy chimps.

373
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,520
Oh, pygmy chimps.

374
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,060
Oh.

375
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:21,880
These nice little fellas, when you get to know them.

376
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,500
I can't afford.

377
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,140
Real nice.

378
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,020
Fifty-one dollars for.

379
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,880
But today the news says.

380
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:28,220
No matter how great a world.

381
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,420
It seemed like it was something that just couldn't lose.

382
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:33,480
You know, Michael Pepe and a lovable family of chimps.

383
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:37,840
But the public, the critics, uh, who can understand things like these?

384
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,880
Uh, you know, it just went, uh, totally tanked.

385
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,200
I mean, it kind of spoiled the Michael Pepe name in Hollywood.

386
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,960
But, uh, a lot of people since that time.

387
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,300
When the DVDs come out, have come to love it.

388
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:56,980
And, uh, they actually have Michael Pepe and the chimp conventions across this land of ours.

389
00:26:57,100 --> 00:27:01,840
In college campuses, uh, sometimes, uh, auditoriums deserve it.

390
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:03,020
Warehouses are.

391
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,180
The kids are five minutes.

392
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,880
Male alike are hardened in cynical contempt.

393
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:13,720
You know, we, uh, had a touring chimpanzee act for a while that we were doing in DeVivals up north.

394
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,860
With Professor Yeti.

395
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,400
We had, we had.

396
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:17,780
Oh.

397
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,020
Do you remember Professor Yeti?

398
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,460
We had, we had died.

399
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,940
From chimpanzee to chimpanzee.

400
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,140
It was a really old chimp.

401
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:27,860
It would have gone to the labs if we hadn't, uh, taken him in.

402
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,040
To your labs.

403
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:30,360
We had, well, yeah.

404
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,920
We, we dyed him white.

405
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:36,160
And we would have him stand in a white, uh, prom suit.

406
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,600
And gesticulate with a Bible in one hand.

407
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:41,460
Or a book of the sub, Genius, rather.

408
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:44,240
And, uh, a pointer in the other.

409
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:47,320
And, uh, that was like the DeVival part.

410
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:47,860
And then it, uh.

411
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:51,880
A, a, a, a, a, a man and woman would stand in front of him.

412
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,980
And he'd wave the book and gesticulate.

413
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,900
And that would be a wedding.

414
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:55,940
Wasn't there some dance?

415
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,640
Uh, yeah.

416
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:01,160
He was one of the best paid of all of the subgenius preachers.

417
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:01,500
Yeah.

418
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,400
In that he at least was fed.

419
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:03,940
One of the smartest.

420
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:09,680
Literally, what we were given, uh, as useless to us was his food.

421
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:10,620
Yeah.

422
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:11,400
So.

423
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:14,540
Well, he had people working for him to get his food together and do all that.

424
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:16,640
He was really, he was really popular.

425
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,360
Oh.

426
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:22,680
But, uh, he went berserk one night, uh, from flash bulbs as they tend to do.

427
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,260
I eat hippos.

428
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:28,000
And he bit, he bit Dr. Legune, who was on that tour.

429
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,560
And, uh, yeah.

430
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,400
Did a big chunk out of his leg.

431
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:34,140
So, did, uh, Dr. Legune have to get a surgery?

432
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,880
I mean, uh, what do you call, uh, a tetanus shot?

433
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:39,360
He stitched it up himself, actually.

434
00:28:39,420 --> 00:28:39,620
Wow.

435
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,920
Hey, Stang, you should come read this, uh, review.

436
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,580
It's really, it's really good.

437
00:28:43,820 --> 00:28:44,120
Well.

438
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,780
And, and then he killed the chimpanzee.

439
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,200
And that was the end of Professor Yeti.

440
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,160
Did he get to do that himself?

441
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,160
Like with his knee on his throat or something?

442
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,180
He had it every once in a while.

443
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,600
Three hours or so.

444
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,680
He won't say.

445
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:54,280
Right, because of the toxins.

446
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,240
He won't say what he did to Professor Yeti.

447
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:57,740
Yeah.

448
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,880
And he, and he knows that most of us are really sensitive about, uh, chimpanzee rights.

449
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,380
Especially, right.

450
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,880
Uh, especially Bonobo.

451
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:06,640
Especially the YETI.

452
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,840
The endangered Bonobo chimpanzee.

453
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:08,060
Yeah.

454
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:08,660
The one thing that about.

455
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,120
The sub, or the, that's the Yeti chimpanzee.

456
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:12,400
Yeah.

457
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,480
In subgenius science.

458
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:14,340
The Yeti Z.

459
00:29:14,340 --> 00:29:16,160
It really should be another name for it.

460
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:16,640
A Yeti Z.

461
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:16,720
Yeah.

462
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:16,760
Yeah.

463
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,660
The Yeti Z.

464
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:18,340
Yeah.

465
00:29:18,460 --> 00:29:19,920
Is that how you, is that?

466
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:21,780
That would be, that would be cinematically more correct.

467
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:21,960
Yeah.

468
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,520
The Yeti Z.

469
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,620
Oh.

470
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,080
Oh.

471
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:24,580
Oh.

472
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:24,960
Oh.

473
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,540
Find out all you need to know.

474
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,660
They're fighting over their food.

475
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:29,640
What food?

476
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:31,460
Us.

477
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:33,340
I don't know.

478
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,460
Sandman Al is a kinda dinosaur.

479
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:38,600
What's an immune system?

480
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,700
Make them sick.

481
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,280
Life.

482
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:45,980
Life.

483
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:46,760
An alien.

484
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:46,760


485
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:46,760


486
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:46,760


487
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:46,760


488
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:46,760


489
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:46,760


490
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:46,760


491
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:46,760


492
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:46,760


493
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,600
Where'd that come from?

494
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:52,940
A thanks to Norrell Preff, and now Soupy Sayles.

495
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:59,960
Oh, hippie has a pair of cha-cha hips.

496
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:03,540
A cha-cha starts and hippie flips.

497
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:09,820
A bongo drum begins to play and hippie is carried away.

498
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:14,720
Hippie can't control his cha-cha hips.

499
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,420
All cha-chas have him in their grips.

500
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:25,040
He simply has to start to sway when a bongo begins to play.

501
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:33,360
The room may shake a little, quake a little, when hippie starts to go, go, go.

502
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:41,000
People scream and fuss, but the Zippopotamus has a built-in cha-cha down below.

503
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:44,540
The Pasadena Duda, the 49er romp, best of all.

504
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,720
The same stupid stuff.

505
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,540
Same stupid.

506
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:47,640
Same stupid.

507
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:48,500
Same stupid.

508
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:50,180
This way.

509
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,160
Are you out of the mood?

510
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,740
I have that record, which is, where is he, by the way?

511
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:56,520
He's the only missing pope, as far as I can see.

512
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,140
Which pope?

513
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,580
Bishop Joey.

514
00:30:58,660 --> 00:30:59,920
Bishop Joey, yes.

515
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:07,040
It's the only pope that, I hope he hasn't been killed by the silent road.

516
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,420
I hope he's not dead.

517
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:09,520
Now stop it.

518
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,780
That's a jinx, old man.

519
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:12,520
We don't do that.

520
00:31:12,520 --> 00:31:13,180
You know, there's...

521
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,700
That happens to subjugate.

522
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,500
You know, subjugate.

523
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:15,920
You know, subjugate.

524
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:15,920


525
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:15,920


526
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:15,920


527
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:15,920


528
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:15,920


529
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:15,920


530
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:15,920


531
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:15,920


532
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:21,940
Well, there are subgenius popes dotting the highways from here to Amsterdam.

533
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,380
I could be lying dead by the side of the road.

534
00:31:24,380 --> 00:31:25,260
Do you think they can?

535
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,000
Yes.

536
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,500
It's happening.

537
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:27,820
It's happening.

538
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,380
No, really.

539
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:34,720
When there are subgenius pope migrations, you'll find them dotting the highways.

540
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:40,760
The corridor along Tennessee on I-40, a lot of them...

541
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,020
Hanging, being crucified.

542
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,380
Well, they try to cross the road.

543
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,620
And get hit by trucks and so forth.

544
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:57,280
The hope of meeting a subgenius pope is so great that it drives them blindly rushing across the hot road.

545
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,720
Yeah.

546
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:58,280
Yeah.

547
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,120
It's like...

548
00:31:59,680 --> 00:31:59,740
Yeah.

549
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:03,040
Their glands get the best of them.

550
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:07,680
That's the way a real subgenius holy pope man is.

551
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,180
Now, you notice I don't call myself a pope.

552
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:14,180
I'm not one of the people driving the trucks, I like to think.

553
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,560
Why is that?

554
00:32:14,720 --> 00:32:15,520
I'm a mere reverend.

555
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:15,940
That's all.

556
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,400
Just a hard-working...

557
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:17,800
Well...

558
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:22,140
I'm not gonna say that I'm getting a word direct from J.R. Bob Dobbs, although I am.

559
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,080
I'm not gonna say it.

560
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:23,500
Well, I am as well.

561
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:25,060
Well, I am.

562
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:26,140
Well, I am.

563
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:27,620
Well, I am.

564
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:29,040
Well, I am.

565
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,040


566
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,040


567
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,040


568
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,040


569
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,040


570
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:29,200
Well, I am.

571
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,280
Well, I am.

572
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:30,860
Well, I am.

573
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:31,780
Well, I am.

574
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,220
Thank you.

575
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:17,780
Thank you.

576
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:51,160
Thank you.

577
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,820
Thank you.

578
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,600
Thank you.

579
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:27,420
Thank you.

580
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,820
Thank you.

581
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,800
Thank you.

582
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,360
Who and what?

583
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:43,220
Who and what?

584
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,520
Welcome to the

585
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:55,700
O.

586
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:59,580
Welcome to not

587
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,600
rying

588
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,700
to

589
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:01,900
now

590
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,560
open

591
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:02,780
the

592
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,560
door.

593
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:14,560


594
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:14,560


595
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:14,700
may

596
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,640
not

597
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:14,700
look

598
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:20,660
Let us go, oh, oh, poo, poo, poo, poo.

599
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:32,180
Let us go, oh, oh, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo, poo.

600
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:38,100
That was Poo Blues by Artemia Salina.

601
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:44,840
Well, you know, there was a, there was that sewer rat.

602
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,160
Back when all the two-year-olds were looking in the sewer hole and they all thought it was cool and they were yelling at it.

603
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:53,140
And I was ten and they were all, yeah, yeah, we're going to say hello.

604
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:57,600
But I was running through the sewers as fast as I could on my new flashy skateboard.

605
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:03,660
And we were talking in the Ninja Turtle, they were too cool for us because we didn't have the same kind of agents and we didn't have the same kind of connections.

606
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,480
But when we went down in the vagina.

607
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:20,940
Of the earth that we've created these artificial zombie cyborg vaginas to crisscrossing all through the cities to counterbalance the big old limousines and pizzas.

608
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:27,740
And you got New York style, you got Chicago style, you got, you got Jägermeister style, you got garlic.

609
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:34,080
And when we got the garlic, we got to be able to pin down those Ninja Turtles and Joseph Heller.

610
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,000
And we said, Joseph Heller, you fucking cunt.

611
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:37,720
I want to.

612
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:38,620
Where are you from?

613
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:44,820
But then you went on and you went on and you went on and you went on and you went on to praise Jesus.

614
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:47,580
And you had your hand all up in the air, just like Adolf Hitler.

615
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:54,940
Because when you get like Adolf Hitler, you realize that you're a political genius, which tells you something about the nature of politics.

616
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:58,880
And when you mention the nature of politics, you reach the nature of man.

617
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,460
Because man was a squid.

618
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:04,780
He was a squid and his tentacles were flying everywhere.

619
00:39:05,060 --> 00:39:08,080
And you understood at that very moment.

620
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:11,400
Friends, that this is not Prairie Home Companion.

621
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:12,180
No way.

622
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,820
And I'm not Garrison fucking Keillor.

623
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:21,780
Because when you realize Garrison Keillor, you realize, you realize what a CD really is, friends.

624
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,000
Which brings us back to Bob.

625
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:32,580
And when Bob rained down his pyroflatulent glandular love onto us.

626
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:38,080
And by us, I mean U.S., which is United States, which is a very esoteric country.

627
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:38,080


628
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:39,380
And we have a very esoteric name for our country.

629
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,360
You can't say, Libya.

630
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,400
Libya? What the hell does that mean?

631
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,480
You look at the United States and you realize that, well, you know what the United States of America?

632
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,560
You know what the great seal of the United States of America means?

633
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:54,900
It means fucking.

634
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:57,640
You fuck in the United States.

635
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:59,140
State, male.

636
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:00,600
State, cat.

637
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,720
And you fuck their cat.

638
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,780
Not that I advocate bestiality.

639
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:08,000
But bestiality by any other name is just...

640
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,300
Sex.

641
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,340
And...

642
00:40:11,620 --> 00:40:15,400
Well, you know, you gotta find your wine bottles.

643
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,680
You gotta collect them up.

644
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:17,780
For Bob!

645
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:21,080
You gotta recycle your wine bottles.

646
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,460
For Bob!

647
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:25,200
And you gotta turn in every single nickel.

648
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,740
Melt them down into pennies.

649
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:30,620
And melt those penny downs into mills.

650
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,300
Little plastic mills.

651
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,200
That are worth a millionth of a cent.

652
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:37,600
And you gotta melt down those millionths of a cent.

653
00:40:37,700 --> 00:40:37,860
And...

654
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:39,420
And you gotta cut off your gonads.

655
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,940
And you gotta cut off your gonads.

656
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:42,680
And then your gonads to...

657
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,220
To Cleveland.

658
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,820
Because Cleveland's where it's at nowadays.

659
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,660
It's where all the cool kids go.

660
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,780
Not really.

661
00:40:49,900 --> 00:40:50,380
Really.

662
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:51,360
In Kansas City.

663
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:53,220
We got barbecue sauce everywhere!

664
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,040
We got dates.

665
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,000
We got masterpieces.

666
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:56,600
We got brides.

667
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,520
We got everything.

668
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,240
Why are we more popular?

669
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,280
We got all the barbecue sauce.

670
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,200
Barbecue sauce is American!

671
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:05,580
Which brings us back to fucking.

672
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:05,800
Fucking.

673
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:06,940
Your.

674
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:07,760
Own.

675
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:08,680
Self.

676
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:09,840
Man.

677
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,480
That's what the eye in the pyramid's all about.

678
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:13,700
That's what.

679
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:16,420
That's what the crescent in the star's all about.

680
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,800
That's what the cross is all about, friends.

681
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:23,100
You have to be screwing in the sewers with the screw-er rats!

682
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:24,040
Yeah!

683
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,660
You gotta be screw in the sewers.

684
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,940
That's what it's all about.

685
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:30,160
It's like that hokey pokey song.

686
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:33,040
You have a hokey pokey life until you find Bob.

687
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,280
And you realize that every little wee bit.

688
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:35,560
Bob!

689
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:35,560


690
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:35,560


691
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:35,560


692
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:35,560


693
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:35,560


694
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:35,560


695
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:35,560


696
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:35,560


697
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:35,560


698
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:35,560


699
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:36,140
Bob!

700
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:37,800
Is actually.

701
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,720
Another Bob!

702
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:42,320
And then you find all these Bob's and they won't stop!

703
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:43,680
You see them everywhere.

704
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,600
And every little electron is a little grinning pipe.

705
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:47,460
And you say.

706
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:48,340
Fuck!

707
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,160
And then you realize there was really just Tony Danza all along.

708
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,640
And Tony Danza was ruining everything.

709
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:53,920
And you found them everywhere.

710
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:54,940
And everything.

711
00:41:55,280 --> 00:42:00,220
And then it was all a hologram because the matrix came and you took the green pill, friends.

712
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,220
Oh man.

713
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,720
You took that green pill.

714
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:04,840
Oh.

715
00:42:05,020 --> 00:42:05,540
Oh.

716
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:05,540


717
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:05,540


718
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:05,540


719
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:05,540


720
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:05,540


721
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:05,540


722
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:05,540


723
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:05,540


724
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:05,540


725
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:05,540


726
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:05,540


727
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:05,540


728
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:05,540


729
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:08,880
I know.

730
00:42:09,180 --> 00:42:11,460
It means you picked your nose, didn't it?

731
00:42:11,520 --> 00:42:16,520
You picked your nose and ate instead of taking the red pill or the blue pill or Bob's pills

732
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,820
cause all they're false pills.

733
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:20,120
You gotta take the true pills, friends.

734
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,120
Why aren't you paying Bob?

735
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:24,880
You have to.

736
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:25,940
I mean.

737
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:27,440
I mean.

738
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,540
Bob.

739
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:30,400
Is Bob.

740
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,540
And he isn't Bob.

741
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:35,540
At the same time.

742
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:35,540


743
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:35,540


744
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:35,540


745
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:35,540


746
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:35,540


747
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:35,540


748
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:35,540


749
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:35,540


750
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:35,540


751
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,160
time.

752
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:35,520
Oh

753
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:05,520
Take me away

754
00:44:05,540 --> 00:44:05,640
Oh

755
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,620
Oh

756
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,280
Oh

757
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:06,680
Oh

758
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,020
Oh

759
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,380
Oh

760
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:07,700
Oh

761
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,100
Oh

762
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:08,560
And uh

763
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,040
Reverend Slaughter

764
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,640
did that rant.

765
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,380
Uh

766
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,360
just uh

767
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:14,520
frightening there

768
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:15,620
relatively new

769
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:16,240
minister

770
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,680
in Kansas

771
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,560
and now

772
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:19,440
little

773
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:20,600
Theodore

774
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,740
I just

775
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,440
sit here

776
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:33,860
watching

777
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,420
squirrel

778
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,520
I

779
00:45:35,540 --> 00:45:39,400
They have much more fun than me

780
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:44,300
Sometimes they run around all day in circles

781
00:45:44,300 --> 00:45:48,900
They fight and squabble, then they lick their wounds

782
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:53,880
At least they seem to have a purpose

783
00:45:55,080 --> 00:45:58,660
My mind's always clogged with leaves

784
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:03,780
Like silly, stupid advertising jingles

785
00:46:03,780 --> 00:46:08,680
And themes from TV shows I do not like

786
00:46:19,420 --> 00:46:22,880
I must not go out the front door

787
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:27,240
I could get hit by a car

788
00:46:28,540 --> 00:46:32,280
Just like the squirrels when a dog is growling

789
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:33,760
I must not go out the front door

790
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,700
There's perfect safety high up in the tree

791
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,980
I know I'm bad to just sit here

792
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,400
I should not be so afraid

793
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:51,040
But once outside I'd have to choose a direction

794
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:56,060
It might be the wrong one so I'll stay here

795
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:10,840
They tell me of self-improvement

796
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:15,480
And someday I could even have a job

797
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:20,520
Then I would have become just like the squirrels

798
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:24,320
I don't see how I could accomplish that

799
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,120
First I'd have to choose a direction

800
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:33,740
Like which tree I should start to climb

801
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:33,740


802
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:33,740


803
00:47:33,740 --> 00:47:33,740


804
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,300
And then I'd have to go to the other side

805
00:47:35,300 --> 00:47:38,800
They all seem to be up to the challenge

806
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,380
I just take whatever's given me

807
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:59,200
So I'm okay here just watching squirrels

808
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:02,220
Though the soundtrack could be much improved

809
00:48:03,100 --> 00:48:03,740
I'm just a little bit scared, I'm just a little bit scared

810
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:03,740


811
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,740
Though silly stupid advertising jingles

812
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:12,540
And things from TV shows I do not like

813
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:16,840
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah wah

814
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,040
Wah wah wah wah wah wah wah

815
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:26,500
Bah la la la la la la la la la la

816
00:48:27,320 --> 00:48:30,820
Bah la la la la la la la la la la

817
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:47,420
Bah la la la la la la la la la

818
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:48,640
餕

819
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:48,900
Ray

820
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,360
Rar

821
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:58,760
La

822
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:00,800
bah

823
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:00,980
mo

824
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:01,760
He's so angry

825
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:03,260
when какоето

826
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,240
when Alan Watts was on there talking about how you couldn't see your own brain.

827
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,740
And then after that show was Birchers.

828
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:12,960
And then after that show was Zen Music.

829
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:17,120
And I thought, boy, someday I want a show on that station.

830
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,540
But in those days, radio was good.

831
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:24,300
This is a different world.

832
00:49:25,540 --> 00:49:29,960
Radio promoted friendly feelings, warm gushiness,

833
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:33,420
and, of course, woe-tanning.

834
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:38,540
Okay, do you mind if we just practice a little bit here?

835
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:39,680
Right, there you go.

836
00:49:39,780 --> 00:49:40,180
Radio.

837
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,600
It rocks.

838
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:57,360
Well, I'll probably be chopping this up and making it into hour of slack number 1023 through 1026.

839
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:01,600
Yep, only 42 chopping days before X-mas.

840
00:50:01,720 --> 00:50:02,100
Yes.

841
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:03,740
Constantly.

842
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:03,740


843
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,280
Yeah, that's right.

844
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:04,600
Little pieces.

845
00:50:04,900 --> 00:50:05,920
Rerun time.

846
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:07,820
Rerun time is coming.

847
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:10,120
The great X-mas reruns.

848
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:14,640
Will you watch what you did all year?

849
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:18,180
No, rerun the Christmas rerun.

850
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,240
We watched what you did last year.

851
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:25,640
Don't go in this show.

852
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:33,480
Don't open up the baseboards and gaze at Bob Nelson's body.

853
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:35,520
Don't remove the blindfolds.

854
00:50:35,520 --> 00:50:37,200
You won't believe the terror.

855
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,220
It's not fun.

856
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:41,340
You won't believe the horror, but it's all to you.

857
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,000
Don't drink the Kool-Aid.

858
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:44,780
Don't look out the door.

859
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:46,560
Don't go in the basement.

860
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:47,820
Don't go in the bathroom.

861
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:49,760
Don't smell your armpit.

862
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,580
Put your hands behind your back.

863
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:53,560
Don't rubber stamp the visas in your back.

864
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:55,060
Stand up straight against the post.

865
00:50:55,060 --> 00:50:56,560
Don't wee-wee on your TV.

866
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,980
Don't take that wool whip lesson you were going to at the circus.

867
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,520
Don't pull that wedgie out in public.

868
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:13,460
Don't ride a UFO too soon after taking narcotic medicine.

869
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:19,400
Do not operate heavy farm machinery at speeds in excess of 70 miles an hour.

870
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:21,520
When taking this medication, it's very good.

871
00:51:21,920 --> 00:51:23,980
Life is very crazy.

872
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:25,760
Oh, look!

873
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:33,700
There's the chocolate train going round and round and round and round and round the canyon.

874
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:33,740


875
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:33,740


876
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:34,040
On the Candy Track.

877
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,620
Soon it will stop and a special passenger will get off.

878
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:39,500
On NBC.

879
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:45,920
The Star Spangled Banana.

880
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:49,020
Chocolate train rides on the Candy Track.

881
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:51,240
The lollipop wheels go clickety-clickety-clack.

882
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:53,480
Ding dong bell goes the dong dong bell.

883
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:54,920
On the Chocolate Train.

884
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:55,600
On NBC.

885
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:58,200
The chocolate train rides on the Candy Track.

886
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:00,460
The lollipop wheels go clickety-clickety-clack.

887
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:02,760
Take a trip to Candy Land.

888
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:03,740
On NBC.

889
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:06,220
That's fine.

890
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:06,980
That's fine.

891
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,240
That's fine.

892
00:52:07,520 --> 00:52:07,840
That's fine.

893
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:10,940
We interrupt this program to bring you a bulletin from our newsroom.

894
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:18,060
In Chicago, another outbreak of violence was reported in Chicago's Grant Park between anti-war demonstrators and the police.

895
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:24,200
Protest leaders complained that several of their marchers were severely and brutally beaten with police nightsticks.

896
00:52:24,620 --> 00:52:26,520
And now, back to the game.

897
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:27,420
On NBC.

898
00:52:27,820 --> 00:52:32,860
And now, we'll give you some valuable advice on how to die in your washing machine.

899
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:35,080
So for laughter, fun, and comedy...

900
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:35,380
Passion.

901
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,280
Bloodshed.

902
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,220
Lust and death.

903
00:52:37,500 --> 00:52:39,660
Everything that makes life worth living.

904
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:44,680
Be sure to see the brand new repeat of the old new show Thursday on NBC.

905
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,100
Chocolate train rides on the Candy Track.

906
00:52:46,180 --> 00:52:48,500
The lollipop wheels go clickety-clickety-clack.

907
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:49,860
On NBC.

908
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:57,540
The lollipop wheels go clickety-clickety-clack.

909
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:00,900
On NBC.

910
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:01,540


911
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:02,840
On NBC.

912
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:02,840


913
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:02,840


914
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:02,840


915
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:02,840


916
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:02,840


917
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:02,840


918
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:02,840


919
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:05,700
And now this word about a different tasting cigarette.

920
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:09,460
Be among the many who change over to a mild tasting Philly cigar.

921
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:12,820
Remember, all the fellas are switching to Philly.

922
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:15,400
And now an ambassador who is stoned in his embassy.

923
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:16,860
On NBC.

924
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,080
Girls.

925
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,720
Do you wake up feeling lustless?

926
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:26,400
Get off.

927
00:53:27,840 --> 00:53:27,860
Girls.

928
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:28,520


929
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:29,380
Girls.

930
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:30,580
Girls.

931
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:31,060
Girls.

932
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:31,360
Girls.

933
00:53:31,760 --> 00:53:32,880
Get off.

934
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:33,960
On NBC.

935
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:39,820
You'll always find the freshest girls on NBC.

from PR News in Washington, I'm from California

1068
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:17,540
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice

1069
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,560
used cruel or degrading practices

1070
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:22,040
on human rights organizations abroad

1071
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,620
cruel, inhuman, and degrading

1072
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:25,800
Bush administration officials

1073
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:26,580
meet the list of the most

1074
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:27,700

1077
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:34,400
the BBC's bad

1078
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:35,760
on Wall Street

1079
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,200
10-8-5-5-2-7-2-2-3

1080
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:40,500
President Bush again today

1081
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:42,300
linked the nation's war on terrorism

1082
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,100
with the war against PR News

1083
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:45,100
in Washington

1084
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:47,500
well, who else was on that show there?

1085
00:58:48,980 --> 00:58:50,860
well, uh, you know

1086
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:52,400
in Flash

1087
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:54,680
we lost many of our

1088
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,380
important contributors

1089
00:58:56,580 --> 00:58:57,840
my ear hurts

1090
00:58:57,840 --> 00:58:58,860
I bet you have

1091
00:58:58,860 --> 00:59:01,200
it sounds like you're down to 10 or 12 people there

1092
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,340
I think the rate of attrition has been absolutely remarkable

1093
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,540
a couple people died

1094
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:08,860
well, you know, I'm gonna go out this afternoon

1095
00:59:08,860 --> 00:59:11,480
I'm gonna make myself some fried peppy steak

1096
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:12,460
wow

1097
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:13,420
and some boom fries

1098
00:59:13,420 --> 00:59:14,800
and some potatoes chips

1099
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:16,600
and some last-lives

1100
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,220
and that poor little peppy died for you

1101
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:20,300
is that what you're saying?

1102
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,520
little peppy Joe

1103
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:23,600
he was a sunny little guy

1104
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:24,480
stoop-toe

1105
00:59:24,480 --> 00:59:26,560
about his former death and it's just a little peppy

1106
00:59:26,560 --> 00:59:26,560


1107
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:27,740
he was a little bit chump on the road

1108
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:29,680
all he ever wanted was a smile

1109
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:32,160
he wanted to die with a smile on his face

1110
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,460
everybody's just stabbing him till he's brown

1111
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:34,880
nonsense

1112
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,860
I remember how he used to say

1113
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:39,420
I just wanted to help you

1114
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,040
well, you can get him

1115
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,320
well, you ought to be ashamed of yourself

1116
00:59:43,320 --> 00:59:45,600
I remember looking through the used-by-Maccato department

1117
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,220
I bet you'd like a little of his help now, would you?

1118
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,200
I think Mike

1119
00:59:50,200 --> 00:59:51,540
well, that you'll never have

1120
00:59:51,540 --> 00:59:52,300
ayeee

1121
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,400
that show's over, huh?
