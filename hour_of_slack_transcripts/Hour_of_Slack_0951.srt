1
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:11,500
We interrupt this program to activate the emergency subgenius power of SWAT.

2
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,680
Yes, friends.

3
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,080
Well, you know, according to subgenius prophecy,

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:38,480
the space monster Jehovah One told mystic salesman J.R. Bob Dobbs

5
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,300
that the world would end,

6
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,940
for everybody except subgenius cult members,

7
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:51,280
at 7 a.m. on July 5th.

8
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,840
Well, my friends,

9
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:02,840
we still aren't really home yet from the New York celebrations of X-Day.

10
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,840
Our minds aren't home yet.

11
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:11,220
So you might as well consider this a live X-Day show.

12
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:17,860
Even though the event itself, July 5th, was weeks ago.

13
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:22,000
Friends, we're always behind after X-Day

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,740
because we blow everything off,

15
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:28,520
assuming that our guru, J.R. Bob Dobbs, is going to be right this time.

16
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,440
We weren't harvested, but yet we harvested lots of recordings,

17
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:39,720
such as this of Acid Corpse performing at Brushwood.

18
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,480
And we harvested many subgenius.

19
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,000
We harvested many subgenius' radio shows,

20
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:45,580
such as the KPFA Berkeley show,

21
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,080
the WREK show in Atlanta,

22
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:51,200
Bob's Lifetime Funhouse,

23
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,160
and the WCSB show in Cleveland,

24
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,240
Dr. Sinister's.

25
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,260
And we'll start with the KPFA Puzzling Evidence show, friends,

26
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:08,820
with Dr. Howell at Puzzling Evidence and Philodruman's X-Day Report.

27
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,760
Yes, everyone's somewhat world-weary here.

28
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:15,620
Because you know what?

29
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,560
These fine young folks have just returned from X-Day,

30
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,840
and they're coming back in their triumphant post-X-Day parade now.

31
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:24,620
They're somewhat bedraggled and debauched,

32
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:28,720
and that's to be expected.

33
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:31,220
But good Lord, how clean they are.

34
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,080
Absolutely sparkling clean.

35
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,820
Their skins shine with a peculiar iridescence.

36
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,840
And, uh, well, I, uh...

37
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:48,420
It almost seems to steam with the heat given by warmth and moisture.

38
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:49,740
Oh, you're not there. Jingle your, uh...

39
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,700
What marvelous sights one sees at X-Day.

40
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,620
Uh, but, um...

41
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,300
One thing we did see, of course,

42
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,220
was when we assembled at 7 o'clock...

43
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,160
No, I see you doing that, but nothing's happening.

44
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:04,920
...a.m.

45
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,520
We're trying to talk to Philodruman down on the field.

46
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:07,820
Yeah.

47
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,740
He is there, and we will be connecting with Philodruman momentarily.

48
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,660
You may have to move to the room in the short term or something, too.

49
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,980
It was at X-Day that we gathered at, uh, 7...

50
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,620
I just heard that, I hope.

51
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,840
...a.m. on July 5th of 2004.

52
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,420
You can yell and scream, but nothing's coming through.

53
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:27,160
And as we waited in the shade of the main pavilion,

54
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:31,140
a band played, and then all eyes...

55
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,760
The house is working, and no one is not.

56
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,440
...went to the zenith of the sky.

57
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:45,580
Where a huge, round, glittering shape rapidly lowered down, expanding in size...

58
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,200
The mic is working.

59
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,500
...and blotting out the light.

60
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,840
With an enormous metallic humming...

61
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:50,800
Now.

62
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,180
...like the ringing of a glass...

63
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:52,500
Now. The mic.

64
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,280
...or the buzzing of innumerable bees.

65
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,180
Long, telescoping legs extended and, uh...

66
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:01,280
There goes those bees again.

67
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,860
Hear that bee in the background? He was just buzzing, buzzing, buzzing.

68
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,140
Well, you know...

69
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,040
Yes, he's a busy little dog.

70
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:10,500
The main theme now is, for the whole of the audience, is they want to know what happened on X-Day.

71
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:11,740
Well, I'm telling you.

72
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:14,760
And so then the ramp came down, and, uh...

73
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,840
We all moved up and down the ramp...

74
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,560
Want to know what happened on X-Day? They keep asking that question.

75
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,860
Now, next up, on Monday, July 5th, at 7 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time,

76
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:32,800
our Earth will be at aphelion, which means that it will be at its farthest point away from our sun for the entire year.

77
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:42,000
Almost 3 million miles farther away than it was when it was at perihelion, its closest, last January 4th.

78
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,960
And then, get ready for a super goodie.

79
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:02,260
All right, Atlanta.

80
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:04,800
Perhaps we have something for you here.

81
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,920
Yes, perhaps. Who knows? It's one of those things that...

82
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,640
Like this church, it's wild and unpredictable.

83
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,820
We are going to attempt to...

84
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:19,460
We are going to attempt to get a live update from X-Day.

85
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,280
From Brushwood, from Ground Zero, 7 a.m., July 5th.

86
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,560
That's where the smokin's gonna start. It'll spread outward from there.

87
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,760
All right, well, let's... let's try to punch him in.

88
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:33,020
Let's see if this thing's working.

89
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,060
Hello, do we have Brushwood?

90
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,860
Atlanta to Brushwood, over.

91
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,900
I think we're being jammed at the source.

92
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:43,740
Uh-oh.

93
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,220
Oh, my God, you don't think they did it, Jonestown, already?

94
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,120
There's something.

95
00:05:55,980 --> 00:06:00,620
Suzie, I don't know if you can hear me, but here at X-Day number 7,

96
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,080
it is a complete catastrophe.

97
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,620
I am watching the fire eat away at the very heavens right now.

98
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,720
It was a terrible tragedy.

99
00:06:08,860 --> 00:06:15,500
The pipe of Bob that we had in the fire circle whenever the burning cross finally fell...

100
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,660
Oh, what the fuck?

101
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,940
Well, it disgorged a little gift for all of humanity,

102
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:24,340
and it's currently burning down everything that we ever loved.

103
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,800
I knew it was gonna be good.

104
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,160
And yet we somehow feel much more cleansed for it.

105
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,900
And now, with more details,

106
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,580
is the Reverend Ivan Singh on site.

107
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,160
Oh, no, that crummy...

108
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,660
It's a perfect success if death and destruction is...

109
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:39,120
Suzie, are you there?

110
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,700
Yes, yes, I'm here, but you can't hear me.

111
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,460
It's a nightmare, and yet it's like heaven.

112
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,240
It's like a Jack Chick comic come to life.

113
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:51,440
It's what every X-Day is supposed to be.

114
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,700
Surely the saucers will be here.

115
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,520
Oh, damn it, damn it.

116
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,680
What? What? Oh, my God, there's silence.

117
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,300
The police are coming.

118
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,020
We're gonna have to...

119
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,740
We may not be able to be on for long.

120
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:04,420
Hold it.

121
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:04,860
Hold on.

122
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,200
I'm gonna...

123
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,760
What?

124
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,780
Stand up.

125
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,780
Suzie, hold on just one second.

126
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:10,680
We're just kind of...

127
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,700
No, don't get away from me, you goddamn...

128
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,280
No, no, no.

129
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:14,000
You're a victim.

130
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:14,840
You're a victim.

131
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:15,980
You're a victim.

132
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:17,820
You can't...

133
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:19,680
You can't stop.

134
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,100
You can't stop.

135
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:20,100


136
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,060
Ow!

137
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:21,420
Ow!

138
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:21,880
Ow!

139
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:22,300
Ow!

140
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:22,620
Ow!

141
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:23,020
Ow!

142
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:23,320


143
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:23,640
Ow!

144
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:29,400
Ow!

145
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:31,660


146
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,100
Oh, shucks!

147
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,100


148
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,140
Oh my...

149
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:35,400
Oh, shit!

150
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,400


151
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,400


152
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,400


153
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:35,400


154
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:36,740
I gave them 32plea rand.

155
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:36,740


156
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:36,740


157
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:38,260
Okay, who are you?

158
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,160
I just sticks a blowjob a 30 this weekend.

159
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,200
Come in.

160
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,200


161
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,200


162
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,200


163
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:40,660
I was gonna say, if you don't block guys, we'll fuck...

164
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:40,660


165
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,760
I missed that time out.

166
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,380
That's an accessory.

167
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:43,620
Call that мест.

168
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:43,660
We will.

169
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,260
We will beat the fuck up.

170
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:55,680
He throws me a blowjob and does one side first.

171
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:58,660
I go.

172
00:07:58,660 --> 00:07:58,660


173
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:02,840
And man, I really need that sort of stuff to bathe in.

174
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:04,680
I can't find virgins anymore.

175
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,140
Oh no, you can't find a good virgin these days.

176
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:10,840
Well, virgin on the ridiculous, but they don't go for the technical virgins.

177
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,540
Ah, it's starting.

178
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,500
The floppy boot.

179
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:16,220
Okay, now we started in the X-Day Parade.

180
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,260
This is inspirational.

181
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:19,860
To be here at the X-Day Parade.

182
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,500
At the 2004 X-Day Celebration.

183
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,580
While we wait for the saucers to descend.

184
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,320
It's a beautiful parade day.

185
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,080
On our...

186
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:27,480
Clear sky.

187
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:30,860
No sign of a saucer yet, but we're all hoping and waiting.

188
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:35,480
Except, of course, for Philo Drummond who decided to stay at home in his bed.

189
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,140
Reading the National Review.

190
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:38,680
But the rest of us are...

191
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:42,260
Wait a minute, is that something that we see up there in the sky?

192
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,560
A glittering round?

193
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,060
It is.

194
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,100
It's the saucer.

195
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,000
It's coming down.

196
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,540
Oh, this is just great.

197
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:49,900
The crowd is really reacting.

198
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,400
Look at their enthusiasm.

199
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,920
And the saucer now makes its way through the float.

200
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:57,660
Parade.

201
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:04,980
Look at those great little cutout characters of space aliens on top of the saucer.

202
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,580
Those aren't cutouts.

203
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,380
I believe they're made out of roses.

204
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,680
Actually, razor thin aliens.

205
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:15,700
Razor thin and razor sharp, I might add.

206
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,460
You wouldn't want them to make a...

207
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:21,000
You don't want to stroke those aliens on the edge or cut your hand.

208
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,140
I don't want to stroke those aliens at all, Philo.

209
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,340
But it may be that I'll have to.

210
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,480
It may be that we'll all have to.

211
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:27,060
You'll have to.

212
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:32,360
Since it's going to be a new day and a new world since we've been visited by our visitors

213
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,220
You have to stroke the alien sometime.

214
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,620
You can depend on me, darling.

215
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,420
Well, I better the aliens have a stroke.

216
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,420
I do depend on you to help me stroke the alien.

217
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,440
All right.

218
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,820
I think we've stroked this alien thing for all it's worth.

219
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:49,100
Isn't that a dance like Shock the Monkey that somebody did?

220
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,260
Stroke the alien.

221
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,860
Okay, if you say so.

222
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:54,060
Wasn't it Cha-Cha-Cha?

223
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:54,940
Nice hitting.

224
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:56,960
No, it wasn't.

225
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,800
Yeah, well, they do have nice cities.

226
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,820
It's hard enough to do these dance moves.

227
00:10:00,020 --> 00:10:02,080
They're half underground, half above ground.

228
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,680
Yeah, this is when the saucers show up over you, these guys' heads.

229
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:15,680
I was strolling through the park one night and oh, I felt so blue

230
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:21,220
When I heard a little voice say, I'm so lonely too

231
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,580
Then I turned around to look and to my surprise

232
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:32,280
A little space girl said they're crying right before my eyes

233
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:39,180
Stepping up a little closer to see what I could see

234
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:44,780
She said, Mr. Earthman, will you please marry me?

235
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,660
I said, why no, I couldn't do that

236
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,780
Well, that just wouldn't be right

237
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,200
Cause you and me and me and you

238
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,560
We don't even know each other anymore

239
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,100
What do we look alike?

240
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:59,620
Cause you've got four arms

241
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:01,200
The better to hold you

242
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,260
Three lips

243
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:03,960
The better to kiss you

244
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,200
Three eyes

245
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,140
All the better to see

246
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,960
I can really rock and swing

247
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,380
Cause I've got more of everything

248
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:18,160
Oh, Mr. Earthman, will you marry me?

249
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,060
Then I said, what will people think

250
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:25,080
When we go strolling by?

251
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,300
Why?

252
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,680
They not only laugh at us

253
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,840
They lay right down and die

254
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,320
Then they'd put you and me in jail

255
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,360
There we would be

256
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,760
And the people, they'd come from miles around

257
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,960
Just to look at you and me

258
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,280
Cause you've got four arms

259
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,900
The better to hold you

260
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,000
Three lips

261
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,700
The better to kiss you

262
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,900
Three eyes

263
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,900
All the better to see

264
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:56,540
I can really rock and swing

265
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,240
Cause I've got more of everything

266
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:02,900
Oh, Mr. Earthman, will you marry me?

267
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,720
I said, this ain't gone far enough

268
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,940
I've had enough of it

269
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:13,860
She said, please, Mr. Earthman

270
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:15,980
Just one little kiss

271
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:19,000
I said, okay, okay, okay

272
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,220
But then you go away

273
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:24,740
But when I finish kissing her

274
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,280
I had this

275
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,800
Then I said, what will people think

276
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,240
When I've got four arms

277
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,940
The better to hold you

278
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:32,020
Three lips

279
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,720
The better to kiss you

280
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:34,900
Three eyes

281
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,900
Oh, the better to see

282
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,680
I can really rock and swing

283
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,100
Cause I've got more of everything

284
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:47,940
Oh, Mr. Earthman, will you marry me?

285
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,880
Why, sure!

286
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:56,240
A thanks to Artemia Savina,

287
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:56,260


288
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,000
for sending that one in.

289
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,600
And now, Reverend Carter LeBlanc,

290
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,780
live at Brushwood.

291
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,820
So, it's X Day.

292
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,260
It's almost X Day.

293
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,780
It's, uh, let's see, how far are we?

294
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,580
Anybody got a countdown calendar going?

295
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,920
How many more minutes till the end of the world?

296
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,520
No, I didn't think so.

297
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,900
Nobody really even seems to be paying attention.

298
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:33,160
I think everybody is kind of suspecting

299
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,880
the same things that I'm kind of expecting,

300
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:40,820
which is, uh, we got sold out, you know?

301
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:46,420
I mean, we really, we really kind of got screwed.

302
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:48,960
You know, we were told saucers 1998.

303
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,000
They make up all these excuses

304
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,440
that seem to justify

305
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,100
you know, the absence of saucers.

306
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:59,340
But the simple truth is

307
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:05,040
the saucers seem to have passed us by.

308
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,200
There were some people after 1998

309
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,680
that came to Stang

310
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,700
and they were, I think, really upset about that.

311
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:15,480
And a lot of those people,

312
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,860
a lot of people didn't come back, actually.

313
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,540
Which is fine

314
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,220
because really maybe those are the people

315
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,280
that got ruptured.

316
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:27,240
They got, uh, you know, they got taken away

317
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,680
because if there's one thing

318
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:31,000
that we really don't need here

319
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,380
in the Church of the Subgenius,

320
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,440
it's a true believer.

321
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,300
I mean, you know, we don't really need any, uh,

322
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,920
I mean, we don't really need any true unbelievers either

323
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,500
because, I mean, belief and disbelief

324
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,360
both mean pretty much the same thing.

325
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,120
You no longer are accepting new ideas

326
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,380
about a certain issue.

327
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:59,580
And, uh, so, so what I'm seeing here

328
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:02,800
is that something special has been given

329
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,340
to those people that lost faith.

330
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,320
You know, those people have been given a gift.

331
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,520
A gift called suspicion and disbelief.

332
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,760
You know, anytime any of those people

333
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,460
that have walked away from the Church of the Subgenius,

334
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:18,760
anytime they go to another religion

335
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:22,360
or another spirituality or another faith,

336
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,080
they're going to be receiving a form of self-indulgent,

337
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,960
uh, you know, self-gratification

338
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,760
that we like to think of as religion,

339
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,260
but it's just really justification for our actions.

340
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,940
Anytime somebody goes somewhere else

341
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:39,680
to find something else somewhere inside their mind,

342
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,660
they're going to be thinking,

343
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:41,860
they're going to be thinking,

344
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,460
is this just another scam?

345
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,940
Is this just somebody else making money off of me?

346
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:53,320
Is somebody else getting rich off of me?

347
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,260
Just like, just like when I gave all that money

348
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,920
to the Church of the Subgenius?

349
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,640
Those people have been given a gift.

350
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,000
It's called disbelief.

351
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,860
You know, the conspiracy pays you well, probably.

352
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:09,680
I mean, compared to how well

353
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,600
the Church of the Subgenius pays you.

354
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,480
Uh, I've, I have worked for both,

355
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,200
and I can tell you that the conspiracy pays you real well

356
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,920
to do work that is not,

357
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,000
is guaranteed to be forgettable.

358
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,800
That's what it's all about.

359
00:16:24,140 --> 00:16:27,100
And so you, you're faced with the problem of,

360
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,080
do you want the pay,

361
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,160
or do you want to do the work that is useful

362
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,380
and will be remembered?

363
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,420
And, uh, uh, friends,

364
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,320
what we'd really like to do is,

365
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,240
you know, neither one.

366
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:42,220
Why, why, why do we have to do either one?

367
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,760
Bob said we should be rich without,

368
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,080
equally rich, without working.

369
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,120
Boy, that would be fair, wouldn't it?

370
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:50,700
Wouldn't it be so fair

371
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,580
if everybody was equally rich without working?

372
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:56,420
Well, friends, you have to make that choice.

373
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,320
Are you enough of a subgenius

374
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:02,700
to, to, to declare July 5th, Monday,

375
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,340
normally a working day,

376
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:07,140
as your religious holiday,

377
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,580
earned by the blood of Bob on that stage

378
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,920
as he bled for it?

379
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,300
Well, he didn't bleed for you, actually.

380
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:15,040
He bled for the insurance money.

381
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,260
We must get off of Earth.

382
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,320
We must get off of Earth.

383
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:21,420
We must get off of Earth.

384
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,420
We must get off of Earth.

385
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,440
We must get off of Earth.

386
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,980
We must get off of Earth.

387
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,220
Oh, Bob.

388
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,580
Oh, please.

389
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,520
Gotta get off Bob.

390
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,020
Bob, Bob, Bob.

391
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:42,540
Oh, oh man.

392
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:45,220
Holiday next day yet, but,

393
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,400
oh, looks like I'm just ahead of the clock radio.

394
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,220
Okay, this is it, this is it.

395
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:51,680
Okay.

396
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:56,820
Ten, nine, seven, eight,

397
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:04,780
five, three, four, three, two,

398
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,720
Monday, July 5th at 7 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

399
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,240
Oh, man, Bob.

400
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,820
Not again.

401
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:14,540
Oh!

402
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:15,520
.

403
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:15,920
.

404
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,500
.

405
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:16,500


406
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,600
Oh, hell.

407
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,200
Oh, at least I'm getting used to it by now.

408
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:25,320
.

409
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:26,640
Okay.

410
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:27,740
.

411
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:33,860
Well, I guess the next step is the inevitable vicious taunting

412
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:35,940
at the hands of evil Susie.

413
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:36,780
.

414
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:37,920
.

415
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:40,540
Yeah, that's the way it always plays out.

416
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:41,380
.

417
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,560
Ah, jeez Louise.

418
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,280
.

419
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,360
I can actually hear that heartless bitch warming up

420
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:47,520
. . .

421
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,980
. . . .the abrasive cacklers.

422
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:49,540
.

423
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:50,580
.

424
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:50,820
.

425
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:50,860
.

426
00:18:50,860 --> 00:18:50,960
.

427
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,020
.

428
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:51,100
.

429
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:51,660
.

430
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,060
.

431
00:18:53,060 --> 00:18:53,140
.

432
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:53,320
.

433
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:53,360
.

434
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:53,420
.

435
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:53,420


436
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:53,480
.

437
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:53,600
.

438
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:53,600


439
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,020
.

440
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,140
.

441
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,140


442
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,140


443
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,140


444
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:55,180
.

445
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,200
You're in my pill stash!

446
00:18:58,420 --> 00:19:00,280
You're right, Blues.

447
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,540
Why'd you have to stash them under the toilet?

448
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,940
They're all tangy.

449
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,160
Spit them out!

450
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,980
Come on!

451
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:10,780
Some of that's for an actual emergency.

452
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:13,840
Let me go.

453
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,920
I don't want to live anymore.

454
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,500
Ah, help!

455
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,680
Get your head out of my damn mouth!

456
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,400
Oh, no!

457
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:27,600
Get out!

458
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,740
Oh, man.

459
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,020
What gives?

460
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,860
Does Freaky Friday fall on a Monday this year?

461
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:43,700
This post-X-Day Suicide Blues thing is my shit, dude.

462
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,500
Bite me!

463
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:52,560
What fools we were to think that we would get to go on some divine killing spree

464
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,340
and crush all the pink boys

465
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:55,160
with a single blow.

466
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,360
With our alien powers.

467
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,200
Well, we believed, uh, we believed Stang.

468
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,800
We did believe Stang.

469
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:02,360
Guess what he said.

470
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:03,560
I bought into it.

471
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,400
I bought into it.

472
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
I sent in my money.

473
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:06,960
Well, so you really bought into it.

474
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,060
Like, literally.

475
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,400
The only kind of bot that counts, baby.

476
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:11,200
All right, baby.

477
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:11,860
Not to Bob.

478
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:15,360
We were, uh, young, dumb, and full of, uh...

479
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,040
Fun.

480
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:16,580
Yeah.

481
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,760
That's what we were.

482
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,660
We were bright-eyed, and, um, I can't spoil the end.

483
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:22,840
You all know what happened.

484
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,060
How do you think?

485
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,000
But about, just listen in.

486
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,380
In about ten minutes before X-Day, we actually started alibi-ing.

487
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:30,280
All right, fine.

488
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,640
Yes, I'm a little bitter.

489
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,520
Yes, I understand that the conspiracy made the calendar.

490
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,940
And it's not 2003.

491
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:38,680
Who knows what year it is?

492
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,000
It could be 1005.

493
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,000
Well, how do we know they got July 5th right?

494
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,240
And X-Day could be at any second.

495
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:45,160
I'm aware of that.

496
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:48,080
Does Ted Man make an appearance on the telephone during the show?

497
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:48,600
Of course he does.

498
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,260
Oh, that's wonderful.

499
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:51,520
I don't think you people have enough Ted Man in your lives.

500
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,180
He has a...

501
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,020
He's calling us from the Observer.

502
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:54,840
Right.

503
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:58,180
Oh, he sees the alien who wants to be his friend, and I think they have sex.

504
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,160
I believe they do.

505
00:20:59,340 --> 00:20:59,860
Well, that's wonderful.

506
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:04,120
And, uh, there's some people who got some science guys, but hey, you're gonna hear it.

507
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,420
This show has been Stalinized for quality.

508
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,740
WCSB, you're on the air.

509
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:09,800
I got lost on the way to the station.

510
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,680
You got lost on the way to the station?

511
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,900
Oh, no, that's right, we already did that show.

512
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,120
Yeah, you already did that show, man.

513
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,820
Only we didn't get to do that show, but we did that other show.

514
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,020
He was patient there.

515
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,720
We need help on the next airport, because I'm stumbling.

516
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,400
We got lost in the station.

517
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,700
We got lost on the way to Planet X, man.

518
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:28,040
Yeah.

519
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,140
Tables say we'll turn around.

520
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,260
Planet X will soon be found.

521
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,240
How could you get in a place...

522
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,020
How could you get lost in a place so plainly and so clearly formatted?

523
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,140
Right in front of you, the holograms are everywhere.

524
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,040
If you get lost, all you have to do is wave your fingers in front of your eyes.

525
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:42,380
Bobbies know they're yeti pests.

526
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:43,440
I think basically we meant that right.

527
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,900
Pink boys, they're all guests.

528
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,020
Yeah.

529
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,080
He's the slack man.

530
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,720
That's why their armpits are so hot.

531
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:51,680
It's so sad that when you...

532
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,220
You...

533
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,000
You expect...

534
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:58,960
You expect to be ruptured and evaporated up into the escape vessels, but it doesn't

535
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:07,020
happen for another year, so you go home and in spite, you start up your lawnmower and rupture

536
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,280
your grass.

537
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,500
Yeah.

538
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:15,960
If I had a million little grass souls that my excess pleasure saucer played by my lawnmower,

539
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,540
I'd spend all morning sucking those little souls up so that they're...

540
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:22,680
Hold for a second.

541
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:27,500
Well, now they're on their way to the city dump, which will double as Planet X for them.

542
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,880
Pink boys, listen, we gotta take a break here.

543
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,460
I hope you guys hold the line for just a moment.

544
00:22:31,700 --> 00:22:32,540
The wind break.

545
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,420
All right.

546
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,520
This isn't over the edge.

547
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,620
No, but it's over the line.

548
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,300
You crossed that line.

549
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:47,740
Oh, man, can't we just go back to have things like they used to be?

550
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,140
Can't we all just get along?

551
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:51,220
Now it's cool back down here.

552
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,440
No, we can't, man, because the world ended, man.

553
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,360
Like I heard last week, the world ended, man.

554
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,840
And you died, man.

555
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:57,480
Yeah.

556
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,100
Well, it didn't actually end.

557
00:22:59,180 --> 00:22:59,880
We thought it was going to.

558
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,580
The big UFOs came.

559
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:04,440
We thought it would, but something happened and prevented it from ending.

560
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,300
No, it actually did.

561
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:12,320
We all received a mental block later, a piece of forced conditioning, which was...

562
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,060
Whenever you see this picture...

563
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:14,880
Ah, yes.

564
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:20,940
You see this particular picture, it brings one out of the trance of oblivion.

565
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:22,020
What picture is that?

566
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,380
I can't see the monitor from over here.

567
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:24,720
Show it.

568
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,500
Is that the X-Day picture?

569
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,200
It's a stereoscopic picture of what happened.

570
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:33,420
I already made a CD that made a million bucks off what you guys were doing last week.

571
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:34,620
Wow, invasion.

572
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,080
Invasion of Earth.

573
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:45,840
But it's really too late to do anything about it, so I don't even really want to get in trouble by talking about it.

574
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:50,480
Now, what was the other highlight of your experience at X-Day, Dr. Howell?

575
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,680
The other highlight?

576
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,800
Other than, you know, the beautiful naked women.

577
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,380
Come on, man, don't step on the Rice Krispies.

578
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,880
That was just one of the many highlights, of course.

579
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:03,220
Don't step on the Rice Krispies thing!

580
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,200
Here it comes.

581
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:13,780
Actually, I enjoyed the easy camaraderie of my comrades in arms in the barracks.

582
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:15,940
Blah, blah, blah.

583
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,460
The man must know that he hath broken his code.

584
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:26,180
And he shall soil thy loincloth with the fear of Jehovah.

585
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:29,760
For Jehovah is the God of wrath.

586
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:32,520
Step away from the bowling ball.

587
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:37,200
I think I saw the staying person light the fuse for the end of the world.

588
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:38,360
Light the fuse.

589
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,960
I think I saw it.

590
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,460
A mulberry stalk.

591
00:24:43,460 --> 00:24:44,960
That's what you say you saw.

592
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:49,980
Well, he bent over and something came out of him.

593
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,420
And then...

594
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,140
Ew!

595
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:58,360
And then everything started shaking and he was running past me away from this area.

596
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,660
That was just his psyche that came out of him.

597
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,040
Why would anyone want to leave beautiful...

598
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:11,260
Uh-oh, he's releasing foul gases.

599
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,420
Yeah, something like that. And then we were running.

600
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:19,220
Apparently, Bob came and did something to all of us.

601
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:21,220
There's Reverend Stang.

602
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,640
Something did come out of him.

603
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:24,360
He changed us somehow.

604
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,460
Reverend Stang.

605
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:25,820
Ew!

606
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:28,400
What are you doing up so early, Reverend Stang?

607
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:29,100
Oh, the...

608
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,200
We...

609
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:33,040
Somebody burned the whole campground down.

610
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,400
Oh, no.

611
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,460
Yeah, I tried to...

612
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:36,860
Jesus!

613
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,340
But we were already gone, so what difference does it make?

614
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:47,200
Well, I was trying to go back there for the love and peace that happens at Brushwood.

615
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:52,660
And the whole campground had been burned down by the subgeniuses of the Black Flash.

616
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,380
All the trees were denuded and black and ash.

617
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,640
Once again, the subgenius Bobbies have ruined everything else.

618
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:02,040
Well, you know what that was? You guys, you didn't listen to me years ago.

619
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:05,320
That's what we would have called prop wash from the UFOs.

620
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,700
Those landing brakes they have just scorch everything, including the little non-normals.

621
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,060
Right, and they don't care. They're just aliens, you know.

622
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:13,700
They don't even see them.

623
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,800
I'm not wearing any pants.

624
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,820
Well, why would you have to?

625
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:19,400
Exactly.

626
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:23,060
In these modern times, no one needs to call themselves a zipper in strange ideas.

627
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,880
Especially not on the radio.

628
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,580
Oh, tell that to my sunburn, Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

629
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,460
Yeah, I got a little sunburned the next day, too, actually.

630
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,360
I don't think it was the sunburn. I think it was the...

631
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,340
It wasn't the sun. It was the saucers hovering overhead.

632
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:38,460
And when you get in the path of that afterburner of theirs, which is a special...

633
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,800
It's a special graviton emission...

634
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:43,920
There's protons.

635
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,120
Well, it's got a couple different...

636
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,780
A couple different principles working in the saucer...

637
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,660
The things that keep the saucers aloft.

638
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,120
One, of course, is the graviton emission.

639
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:53,620
Right.

640
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,740
You can get a sunburn.

641
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,460
You can get a lot of pain in the buttocks.

642
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,200
The other one, of course, is the...

643
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,980
You also got a multiple contusion going on in your skin.

644
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:05,600
Pastor Pressure was showing off a sunburn in the shape of Jesus.

645
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,660
It was an anti-sunburn.

646
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,920
It was like that Jesus was formed by little spots that weren't burned.

647
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,420
It was a reverse Jesus sunburn.

648
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:14,680
In the middle of a burned chest.

649
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:22,560
I think it had gone to a body cursing at a parlor, a biker place, before he attended the festivities.

650
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:23,680
And that's about it, Stang.

651
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,620
I think you're kind of ruminating over what might have been.

652
00:27:26,680 --> 00:27:30,420
There were a lot of people who had actual saucer burn on the buttocks.

653
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,920
I mean, not in America.

654
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:34,860
Maybe 700. That's a lot, right?

655
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:37,900
Well, we had a little bucket of hell and a little bucket of heaven.

656
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:41,180
So you could put your feet in either one at the same time.

657
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:42,880
Get a bucket of heaven.

658
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,860
But yes, after the drag...

659
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,200
What did we do after the drag king, queen...

660
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,480
The drag queen and king balls.

661
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,160
Weren't there a million psycho-freaker rock and roll rock out rock bands?

662
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,880
That's right. We had a great...

663
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:00,380
It was the Acid Corpse played...

664
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,240
I guess that was the first night of band nights.

665
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,360
But what about the Swinging Luv Corpse?

666
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,160
Well, that's their name. That was their name.

667
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,800
We had the Swinging Luv Corpses.

668
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,860
Three members of the Swinging Luv Corpses.

669
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:18,380
Melded with four members of the Amino Acids.

670
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:26,800
So the Amino Acids provided the bass and the drums and the tenor.

671
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,120
I don't forget what kind of...

672
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,780
It wasn't a tenor, but it was maybe a baritone guitar that that one guy had.

673
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:42,220
And then we played sax and guitar and trumpet and violin things.

674
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:42,840
And violins.

675
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,560
We played Kandinsky Protesthera and Paul Jay for over and over again.

676
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:05,560


677
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:05,860
包括 большую доску музыю Someday that Joyeuse.

678
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:05,900
And then we played Stinewindbrderes

679
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:06,660
And we played a hit by Beeume

680
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:08,480
And it felt like the best challenge of our years."

681
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:10,640
Well, we played the Shimoy Baş channel...

682
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,020
And from the bottom of the house we played the singer殴

683
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:13,940
Ready?

684
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:31,920
Dude you got it.

685
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:34,680
His voice is so beautiful.

686
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:48,980
She said, oh, baby.

687
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:56,380
Oh, baby.

688
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:59,300
And then I said, oh, baby.

689
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:11,160
And then ever so gently, ever so nicely.

690
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:17,200
With so many sexual overtones, you looked over at me

691
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:20,320
and you said, baby.

692
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,360
And I knew right there, that's when I knew.

693
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,540
This is the way you said baby.

694
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:35,940
This is the way you said baby.

695
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:39,720
Not so much a B part, but a baby part.

696
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,360
This is the way you said baby.

697
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:48,040
This is the way you said baby.

698
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,040


699
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:48,040


700
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:48,980
Bye-bye.

701
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,040
You couldn't just say baby.

702
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,360
You had to say bye-bye.

703
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:57,640
What is that?

704
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:58,300
What's that?

705
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:58,960
Bye-bye.

706
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,700
Bye-bye.

707
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,240
Bye-bye.

708
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,260
Bye-bye.

709
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,480
Bye-bye.

710
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:34,680
Bye-bye.

711
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:35,380


712
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:35,920
Bye-bye.

713
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:37,100
Bye-bye.

714
00:31:37,100 --> 00:31:38,440
Bye-bye.

715
00:31:38,460 --> 00:31:39,360
Bye-bye.

716
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:40,920
Bye-bye.

717
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,500
That's a little number we've been working on called Bay Bay.

718
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:11,800
We was on drugs.

719
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:14,260
It felt good.

720
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:22,100
So then after the Acid Corpse played, and we played for an hour and 45 minutes, which

721
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,040
only seemed like 20 minutes to me.

722
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,340
It was just like being in heaven.

723
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:34,360
It was such great anti-music and wonderful mystery jazz and great sort of like space

724
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,740
bug surf jam stuff.

725
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:42,200
Space bug surf jam.

726
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:42,780
Yeah.

727
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:54,240
So after that, let's see, I guess after that we just partied until like it was 1999 until

728
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:59,920
about 2 or 3.30 in the morning, 4.30 maybe, and then we'd go to bed.

729
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:06,240
And then we would toss and turn fitfully as the three most thunderous snorers.

730
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,000
Suicide man wants to know something.

731
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:11,600
Oh, I just wanted to know.

732
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,440
No, we're not on the air anymore.

733
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,200
Hey, what happened to you, suicide man?

734
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,540
Are you on drugs or something?

735
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:25,440
I feel a little strange.

736
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:28,080
You feel a little slowed down to me.

737
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,260
Concentrate on the reality we're throwing out to you.

738
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,620
Look out.

739
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:34,940
Hey man, get out of the way.

740
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,080
You got to get out of the way.

741
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,580
The reality will run you down.

742
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:40,660
It's like a tank.

743
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:41,500
Let me dash.

744
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:41,580
Get out of the way.

745
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:41,580


746
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:41,580


747
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:41,580


748
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:41,580


749
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:41,580


750
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,920
It's like a fast tank.

751
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:45,480
It's a fast tank with wheels instead of tracks.

752
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:46,680
I'm just going to tell you what.

753
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,240
Straighten up or fly around.

754
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,460
You can lead a horse to water.

755
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,440
You can't make him drink.

756
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,500
So what's your point, dude?

757
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:00,120
You're sitting on your point, right?

758
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,900
You're sitting on it right now.

759
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,160
Admit it.

760
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:09,460
We were just discussing a strange fellow who claimed to have died, but is still alive to

761
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,380
plague us today.

762
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:11,560
You're right.

763
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:11,560


764
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:11,560


765
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:11,560


766
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:11,560


767
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:11,560


768
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:11,560


769
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:11,560


770
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:11,560


771
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:11,560


772
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:11,560


773
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:15,280
You have never seen such sights.

774
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:25,200
Your heart has never felt such emotion, such sorrow, such joy.

775
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:31,800
You will be uplifted and never have you seen such freaks of nature.

776
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:41,060
One look at them will tell you more than a thousand words of mine.

777
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:41,560
I'm sorry.

778
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:41,560


779
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:41,720
I'm sorry.

780
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,040
Come and see.

781
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:49,720
See little Theodore and .

782
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:05,360
I just sit here watching squirrels.

783
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,440
They have much more fun than me.

784
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,540
Sometimes they run around.

785
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:13,080
They run around all day in circles.

786
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:15,900
They fight and squabble.

787
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,380
Then they lick their wounds.

788
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,720
At least they seem to have a purpose.

789
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,200
My mind's always clogged with leads.

790
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:35,340
Like silly, stupid advertising jingles and themes on TV shows I do not like.

791
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,460
I must not go out the front door.

792
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:00,600
I could get hit by a car.

793
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,140
Just like the squirrels when a dog is growling.

794
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:09,260
There's perfect safety high up in the tree.

795
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,520
I'm not afraid of the squirrels.

796
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:11,520


797
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:11,520


798
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:14,280
I know I'm bad to just sit here.

799
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,240
I should not be so afraid.

800
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:22,740
But once outside I'd have to choose a direction.

801
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,300
It might be the wrong one so I'll stay here.

802
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,700
They tell me of self-improvement.

803
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:54,160
And someday could even have a job.

804
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:59,560
Then I would have become just like the squirrels.

805
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,760
I don't see how I could accomplish that.

806
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,140
First I'd have to choose a direction.

807
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:11,520
Like which tree I should start to climb.

808
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:11,520


809
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:11,520


810
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:11,520


811
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:11,520


812
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:11,520


813
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:11,520


814
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:11,520

822
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,820
just watching squirrels.

823
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:46,820
Though the soundtrack could be much improved.

824
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,880
Those silly, stupid advertising jingles.

825
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:56,240
And themes on TV shows I do not like.

826
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,400
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

827
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,820
Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

Wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah, wah.

00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:31,080

839
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,860
You know, I like him.

840
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,100
He's silly.

841
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,100
The audience doesn't think that's very funny.

842
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,940
I mean, they do think that's very funny.

843
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,740
They're laughing their heads off.

844
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,080
Look, they love it.

845
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,920
Old rape a man.

846
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,720
Old rape a man.

847
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,000
See, I know people that say it's impossible

848
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:18,560
and completely antithetical to the concept

849
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,660
to think that a man could be raped.

850
00:39:23,140 --> 00:39:25,660
That he wouldn't do it willingly and enjoyingly.

851
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,580
Joyfully celebrating the...

852
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:31,380
This is the effect of X-Day, folks.

853
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:34,520
This is what happens to the mind once it's brainwashed.

854
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,720
Yes, thank you, thank you.

855
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,460
We'll run to you.

856
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:37,960
We'll spin you.

857
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,100
Our entire time in the bachelor's cabin

858
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,580
with a crude, raucous joke.

859
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:48,000
We did manage to spend some time at the Frop...

860
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,380
at Dr. Frop's...

861
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:51,740
What do you call it?

862
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,040
Oh, so yeah, what was the entertainment like?

863
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,080
We just called it Frop's Place.

864
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,080
What about all the bands that played?

865
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,440
All the bands were excellent.

866
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,200
There was the amino...

867
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:58,980
the amino...

868
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,000
the amino...

869
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,220
amino acids.

870
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:24,700
The music was literally pyrocyclic.

871
00:40:24,700 --> 00:40:24,700


872
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:24,720


873
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,380
BEHIND THE EVERYTING

874
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,400
BEYOND THE FONE

875
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,740
OOF

876
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:28,740


877
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,700
You better touch this.

878
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:31,140
Yes sir, you better.

00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:36,380

00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,060


882
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:38,060


883
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,620
He is the one doorway to financial heaven.

884
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,440
He is the one real shortcut to slack.

885
00:41:46,940 --> 00:41:52,600
But the amino acids were actually almost shut, you know, not shut down.

886
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,180
And there was Little Theodore.

887
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:55,340
The first act.

888
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,000
Really? Oh, great.

889
00:41:56,140 --> 00:41:57,920
Yeah, Little Theodore was there.

890
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,860
So why were they almost shut down?

891
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,460
Why were they pretend shut down?

892
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,260
Oh, I was just saying they were almost blown away by the band the previous night.

893
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:06,620
They were blown away.

894
00:42:06,620 --> 00:42:14,220
The jam band kicked, literally kicked the posteriors of all the individual subs.

895
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,140
Boy, were they sore.

896
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:17,680
Was it with a big leather boot?

897
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:20,340
With a big leather boot with red straps.

898
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:24,120
Big leather hobnail boot with red straps.

899
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:34,060
Well, now, would you like to say for our listening audience just who were some of the famous subgeniuses present at this earth-shaking event?

900
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:36,600
Well, let's see.

901
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:40,220
We did have, well, we had you.

902
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:40,980
You were there.

903
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:42,060
Well, you're right.

904
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,740
I was there.

905
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:47,200
And not only that, I think I saw Reverend Two Beans there.

906
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,560
Yeah, Two Beans was there.

907
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:49,460
Let's see.

908
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,240
Who else was there?

909
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,220
There was Doc Frop and Sister Decadence.

910
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,160
And Dr. Piss Off.

911
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,460
Doc Piss Off.

912
00:42:55,460 --> 00:42:56,420
Yes, Sister Decadence.

913
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,060
Magdalene and Jesus, of course.

914
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:04,240
Yes, and thousands and thousands of other famous and semi-famous.

915
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,460
Where did all these bobbies come from?

916
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:06,600
I think he was saying, I don't know.

917
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:06,600


918
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:06,600


919
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:06,600


920
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:06,600


921
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:06,600


922
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:07,200
They're not even yet to be famous.

923
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:07,860
That's what he's talking about.

924
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:08,660
I think all the grapes.

925
00:43:08,740 --> 00:43:09,700
Bob Toberfest.

926
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,700
What they do is they cut their hair and then dye their heads purple.

927
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,400
It's having something to do with attracting the sun for Bob.

928
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:19,940
Hey, I think that's a good idea, Reverend Howell.

929
00:43:20,260 --> 00:43:23,120
Maybe we should have a Bob Toberfest.

930
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:24,640
Yeah.

931
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:25,880
I get it.

932
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:26,740
Bob Toberfest.

933
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:28,420
That'd be awesome.

934
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,020
Can we have some beer there?

935
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:30,760
Would you come, caller?

936
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,960
We could find...

937
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,360
Could you bring some women?

938
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:35,520
Yeah.

939
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:35,860
Yeah.

940
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,640
Okay, good.

941
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,720
Sounds like you have a lot there.

942
00:43:38,760 --> 00:43:41,500
You know, they're like smaller versions of us.

943
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,740
Okay, what notes do we play on this song?

944
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,940
Okay, this is Betty Blows.

945
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:50,800
Betty Blows, part one.

946
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,900
This is a little symphony we've been working on for a while.

947
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:05,840
This is a little symphony we've been working on for a while.

948
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:25,440
Let's hear it with Lenny.

949
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:26,220


950
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:26,220


951
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:26,360
Music.

952
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,500
Music.

953
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:27,520


954
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:27,520


955
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:27,520


956
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:27,520


957
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:27,520


958
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:27,520


959
00:44:27,740 --> 00:44:28,060
Music.

960
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,060


961
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,060


962
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,060


963
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,060


964
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,060


965
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,060


966
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,060


967
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,060


968
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:28,180
Music.

969
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:28,660
Music.

970
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:29,320
Music.

971
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:29,820
Music.

972
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:40,840
Sheddy blows, Sheddy blows, Sheddy blows, Sheddy blows, Sheddy blows, Sheddy blows,

973
00:44:42,940 --> 00:44:43,920
He's gonna blow

974
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:46,860
Sheddy blows chumps

975
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,420
A bendy howls

976
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,860
Sheddy blows, Sheddy blows, Sheddy blows, Sheddy blows,

977
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,140
guitar solo

978
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,820
guitar solo

979
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:15,440
guitar solo

980
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,200
guitar solo

981
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:21,380
guitar solo

982
00:46:21,380 --> 00:46:21,860
guitar solo

983
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:24,280
guitar solo

984
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:24,780
guitar solo

985
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:24,780


986
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:24,780


987
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:24,780


988
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:24,780


989
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,360
Blah blah blah

990
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:29,160
And they bringeth the light stone

991
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,700
Blahm, the whore

992
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:34,140
Virgin brain, the guilt finder

993
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:34,980
And smiter

994
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:37,040
The very mark of the covenant

995
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:39,380
And she is the eye of the Father

996
00:46:39,380 --> 00:46:41,160
She shall rule thee

997
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,220
And overcome the mark of the beast

998
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:45,420
And shall give thee fornication

999
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:47,840
And the true sons of Israel

1000
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,380
Shall be snatched up

1001
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,360
Behold, my servant shall prosper

1002
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,080
He shall be exalted

1003
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,080
And lifted up

1004
00:46:55,080 --> 00:46:56,920
And shall be very high

1005
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,380
He who knoweth the fools

1006
00:46:59,380 --> 00:47:00,820
Who prophesy for me

1007
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,440
Shall be made over men

1008
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,840
Many will be astonished at him

1009
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:07,320
For his appearance is so marred

1010
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:09,100
Nond human semblance

1011
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,260
And his form beyond that

1012
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,480
Of the sons of man

1013
00:47:12,480 --> 00:47:14,740
Those who are over men

1014
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,980
Who have followed my almighty word

1015
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,280
Shall be the minister

1016
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:20,660
Of the angelic host

1017
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,620
They shall speak for them

1018
00:47:22,620 --> 00:47:25,120
And my prophet who smiles

1019
00:47:25,120 --> 00:47:26,800
Shall be among them

1020
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:28,760
And shall advise them

1021
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,380
Well, I'm sorry to have to call you on a normal phone

1022
00:47:32,380 --> 00:47:33,980
From somewhere else on earth

1023
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:34,960
And I'm sorry to have to call you on a normal phone

1024
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,000
From somewhere else on earth

1025
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,800
And I'm sorry to have to call you on a normal phone

1026
00:47:38,800 --> 00:47:40,920
I'm sorry Bob let us down

1027
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:43,520
I'm sorry, okay, I'm sorry

1028
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:45,220
Yeah, but you get to be on the ship

1029
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:46,580
You don't have to be sorry

1030
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:48,240
We're gonna do it again next year

1031
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,340
Hey, by the way, were you number one in line

1032
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:52,760
Like your ticket says every year at the gate

1033
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:54,480
Um, no, actually

1034
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:55,280
I'm number one in line

1035
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,500
We use a double because I'm the one

1036
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,640
Filming the line

1037
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:03,220
Ah, there's always a sacred filmer

1038
00:48:03,220 --> 00:48:04,960
And they always think that the sacred filmer

1039
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,100
Is not really an artist

1040
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:08,900
That's right, they don't recognize it

1041
00:48:08,900 --> 00:48:10,380
It's both a blessing and a liability

1042
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,320
Have you looked at any of the footage yet?

1043
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:14,620
Yes, yes and the

1044
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:17,200
The bashing of the Christ

1045
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:18,820
Not to be confused with the

1046
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:20,800
Mashing of the Christ by Negative Plan

1047
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:22,100
But our

1048
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:24,880
Our competition for their short

1049
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,440
Subject should be

1050
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,580
Should really look good

1051
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:31,180
We got plenty of footage, we really hurt Jesus bad

1052
00:48:32,340 --> 00:48:34,080
Did you kill him like Holy George?

1053
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:34,140
He's still alive

1054
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,640
Being a Merovingian

1055
00:48:36,640 --> 00:48:37,380
And we

1056
00:48:37,380 --> 00:48:40,720
So basically everything that way is great

1057
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:42,440
For next year we'll have another Jesus

1058
00:48:42,980 --> 00:48:44,440
The campground will grow back

1059
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,660
The pagans will

1060
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,180
Recuperate, and the subgeniuses

1061
00:48:49,180 --> 00:48:50,600
Will return everything they've stolen

1062
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:51,380
Once again

1063
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:54,160
Wow, is the little fake Bob okay?

1064
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,460
Yeah, that's the funny thing, this was the

1065
00:48:56,460 --> 00:48:58,880
Ex-day when the thieves

1066
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:00,660
Returned what they had stolen

1067
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,040
And

1068
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,920
And asked me to thank them, expecting me to

1069
00:49:04,980 --> 00:49:08,300
You go, oh, thank you for doing that for three years.

1070
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:10,080
That is a strange phenomenon.

1071
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:13,360
But the thing is, back where you are on that planet, they return them.

1072
00:49:13,480 --> 00:49:17,880
Here they just keep them forever and gloat in their living rooms with their two friends.

1073
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:19,300
Yes, yes.

1074
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:21,380
We all know about that.

1075
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:32,500
Ghosts and ghouls and wearing black.

1076
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:39,020
The cross on no one there to come back.

1077
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:45,440
Eternal, blissful, pristine black.

1078
00:49:47,220 --> 00:49:50,740
I've looked at death this way.

1079
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:57,480
But now it's just a boring pain.

1080
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:00,620
You get all stiff.

1081
00:50:01,780 --> 00:50:02,400
You blow.

1082
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,040
You lost the game.

1083
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:10,020
And I think it's your best chance for fame.

1084
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:14,340
When it does you no damn good.

1085
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:21,440
I've looked at death from both sides now.

1086
00:50:22,900 --> 00:50:24,520
From cool and blue.

1087
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,940
And still somehow.

1088
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,140
It's death's illusion time.

1089
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:37,880
I really don't know death.

1090
00:50:41,620 --> 00:50:42,780
Oh, yes.

1091
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:44,280
Little Theodore.

1092
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:47,560
And I'll be giving you contact information for him presently.

1093
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:50,040
Friends, we've heard all kinds of things.

1094
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:54,520
Such as prescripture readings from Doc Ellis.

1095
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,520
From the Book of the Subgenius.

1096
00:50:57,580 --> 00:50:58,860
By Gobs.

1097
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:01,640
Friends, and lots of stuff from Doc Ellis.

1098
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,800

And we heard Little Theodore.

1106
00:51:20,180 --> 00:51:21,120

1109

That's Theodore.

And lonesome cowboy Dave and St. Bucky and I.

1119
00:51:54,760 --> 00:51:58,680
Have been calling in to Dr. Sinister's radio synesthesia.

00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:01,600


1123
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:01,600


1124
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:01,600


1125
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:01,600


1126
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:01,600


1127
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:01,600


1128
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:01,600


1129
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:01,600


1130
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,280
At 7 o'clock.

1131
00:52:02,380 --> 00:52:04,940
No, 10 o'clock p.m. on Sundays.

1132
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:08,280
Friends, that Bob Slacked on Funhouse.

1133
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:11,700
Is on WREK.org at midnight.

1134
00:52:12,980 --> 00:52:18,000
Puzzling Evidence is on at Friday at 5 a.m.

1135
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,560
On KPFA.org.

1136
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,620
And Sinister's show is on at WCSB.org.

1137
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:30,700
Friends, this is Acid Corpse in the background.

1138
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:34,060
And this is Hour of Slack.

1139
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:38,080
At number 951.

1140
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:39,900
Oh, I should mention.

1141
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:45,140
You can download copies of the Puzzling Evidence show from this address.

1142
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,240
Get that pencil tape recorder ready.

1143
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:57,880
That's matrix.c-s-u-s-t-a-n.edu.

1144
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:01,160
Slash negative.

1145
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:01,540
Negative.

1146
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:03,020
Without the E.

1147
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:10,740
Again, friends, this is the Hour of Slack.

1148
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,600
Radio Ministry.

1149
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,260
Church of the Subgenius.

1150
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,140
Episode number 951.

1151
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:19,900
Yeah.

1152
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:30,420
This show has been done more to educate the denizens of Northern California.

1153
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:31,140
And the one and only.

1154
00:53:31,140 --> 00:53:36,460
World on dozens of myths that have pervaded Masonic lore.

1155
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:39,760
It's about saying what's got to be said.

1156
00:53:40,680 --> 00:53:41,320
Fascinating.

1157
00:53:41,540 --> 00:53:42,180
Fascinating.

1158
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:43,900
Horrible.

1159
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:44,920
But fascinating.

1160
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:45,740
Sit down.

1161
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:46,120
Relax.

1162
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:50,000
So, are you glad to be home now, Reverend Stagg?

1163
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:54,680
Well, I'd rather be on my, you know, my home in outer space.

1164
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,560
My own escape vessel planet.

1165
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:58,360
In your special space ranch.

1166
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:00,820
In your special yacht with L. Ron.

1167
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:02,460
The yacht catisma.

1168
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,080
Ha, ha, ha.

1169
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:10,520
Actually, I was more looking forward to seeing Herf Applewhite, previously known as Doe.

1170
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:12,040
Oh, yeah.

1171
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:13,580
And David Koresh.

1172
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:17,240
Yes, they'll be there in the afterlife, waiting with open eyes.

1173
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,300
And all those young eunuchs.

1174
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:24,900
All the great famous Texas evangelists are waiting for me aboard the escape vessel.

1175
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:25,260
Yeah.

1176
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,320
And what about the Nike-wearing eunuchs?

1177
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:28,320
The Nike-wearing eunuchs.

1178
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:29,920
That was first brought up in the artist press.

1179
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,780
The Dobbshead shirt.

1180
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:33,280
The Dobbshead shirt.

1181
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:33,280


1182
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:33,280


1183
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:33,300
The Bob's

1184
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:34,440
The Bob's

1185
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:34,440


1186
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:39,400
Yeah, that's what happened, is the people who did the first Dobbs shooting parody also

1187
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,300
talked about the various heavens that famous people would go to.

1188
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:43,500
And there they are.

1189
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:47,540
And each person gets to go to his kind of famous person heaven.

1190
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,320
But then you're stuck there with people like your own Jeaner.

1191
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:52,760
There's Lon Chaney Jayner.

1192
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:54,980
There's Lon Chaney Senior.

1193
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:57,580
Lon Chaney Jayner.

1194
00:54:57,600 --> 00:54:58,900
There's Della Lugosi.

1195
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:00,420
Lon Chaney.

1196
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:01,020
Ha, ha, ha.

1197
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:03,900
All the great celebrities.

1198
00:55:05,260 --> 00:55:06,260
Ed Wood.

1199
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,640
I got a telephone voice.

1200
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,900
They're all there on board the escape vessel.

1201
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:15,800
Which is what we cover with this radio program, Coastal Damn.

1202
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,340
I'm Art Bells.

1203
00:55:18,180 --> 00:55:18,900
All right.

1204
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:21,340
The saucer last weekend.

1205
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:22,780
The saucer.

1206
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:23,260
Remember that?

1207
00:55:23,400 --> 00:55:24,440
Too good to be true.

1208
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:25,520
I said so at the time.

1209
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:26,260
Well, sure enough.

1210
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,360
The good news is it's there.

1211
00:55:29,640 --> 00:55:30,820
It really is.

1212
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:33,260
It is exactly where the photograph said it was.

1213
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:34,720
The bad news?

1214
00:55:35,860 --> 00:55:44,720
It seems to be an elaborate construction by a member of the Church of the Subgenius.

1215
00:55:45,020 --> 00:55:51,340
A gag mail order classy religion that worships a clip art face named J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1216
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:52,760
For lack of a better explanation.

1217
00:55:54,020 --> 00:55:58,220
The old abandoned saucer home also known as a pleasure saucer.

1218
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,800
Where many a subgenius devour.

1219
00:56:00,820 --> 00:56:02,400
The Bible has no doubt been held.

1220
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:03,640
Can be seen in detail.

1221
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:05,240
And it gives a fine, you know, URL.

1222
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:06,860
But it's the same photograph we have.

1223
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:09,120
So it really is there.

1224
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,280
I knew it.

1225
00:56:12,540 --> 00:56:15,080
They'll pay to know what they really think.

1226
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,980
Well, Mr. Zhang, it was an almost foolproof plan.

1227
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:22,180
They'll pay to know what they really think.

1228
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:25,040
Well, Mr. Zhang, it was an almost foolproof plan.

1229
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:26,640
Because I love Bob and I'm happy.

1230
00:56:26,820 --> 00:56:28,580
Because I love Bob and I'm happy.

1231
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:29,520
You're a fool.

1232
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:30,280
You're a fool.

1233
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:30,780
You're a fool.

1234
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:30,800
You're a fool.

1235
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:30,800


1236
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:31,740
You're a fool.

1237
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:32,660
You're a fool.

1238
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:33,400
You're a fool.

1239
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:34,920
You're a fool.

1240
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:35,320
You're a fool.

1241
00:56:35,620 --> 00:56:36,100
You're a fool.

1242
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:36,220
You're a fool.

1243
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:36,220


1244
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:36,220


1245
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:36,220


1246
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:39,580
Why don't you Dugs go over to Pirate Cat Radio and do your show over there?

1247
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:41,520
We're zero listeners.

1248
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:43,020
Too many Dugs.

1249
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:44,320
Yeah, man.

1250
00:56:46,700 --> 00:56:48,860
Uh-oh, I didn't realize what time it was.

1251
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:49,780
Uh-oh.

1252
00:56:50,080 --> 00:56:50,880
I did.

1253
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:56,140
I could tell, but the show was getting so foggy and hard to hear, I figured it must be ending.

1254
00:56:56,260 --> 00:56:56,860
It's murky.

1255
00:56:57,000 --> 00:56:59,040
We'd like to add the murkiness at the end.

1256
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,160
Sure.

1257
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:01,540
Help murkify it a little bit.

1258
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:04,280
It seemed like it has about a fog of fog.

1259
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:07,180
It said at about six and the murk is moving up.

1260
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:08,620
It's weird.

1261
00:57:08,940 --> 00:57:09,500
Ten.

1262
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,200
Well, the murk is moving in.

1263
00:57:12,300 --> 00:57:20,280
And as you know, it's getting closer to that time in the schedule when puzzling evidence has to shut the special cap on Fox.

1264
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:23,320
How does America handle a headache?

1265
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:26,440
I'm proud to be on a murkin.

1266
00:57:26,540 --> 00:57:27,480
Well, that's true.

1267
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:28,880
And so are we all.

1268
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:39,300
Well, as we stand on that spotty flag after our long history and our climb up from the primordial ooze to our present eminence as prominent American subgeniuses.

1269
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,640
Yeah, I'm going back to the ooze, man.

1270
00:57:41,720 --> 00:57:43,080
You should go back to bed.

1271
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:46,880
You're going to go up to your special chamber.

1272
00:57:47,060 --> 00:57:48,160
My oozing bag.

1273
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:53,240
I'm going to climb back in my oozing bag and go back to sleep.

1274
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:54,700
Good night, Dr. Stang.

1275
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:56,780
Kill them all.

1276
00:57:56,880 --> 00:57:58,160
Let Bob sort them out.

1277
00:57:59,020 --> 00:58:03,100
For in his sorting is not the high epaulet.

1278
00:58:03,760 --> 00:58:06,760
That's the most arbitrary of judges.

1279
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:11,080
Oh, my.

1280
00:58:11,460 --> 00:58:13,820
So here are the engines of the oncoming ships.

1281
00:58:14,480 --> 00:58:15,700
Finally, they're landing.

1282
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:16,960
Oh, no.

1283
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,900
That was another drill.

1284
00:58:19,600 --> 00:58:20,100
Damn.

1285
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:22,260
Well, we'll certainly have one.

1286
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,020
You know the drill.

1287
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:23,760
Oh, my God.

1288
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,160
Christ, Bob.

1289
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:28,700
Hello.

1290
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:28,960
Hello.

1291
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:30,760
Is Bob Dobbs there?

1292
00:58:31,400 --> 00:58:33,720
I'm the little guy who lives in the corner.

1293
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,720
Bob Dobbs, you there?

1294
00:58:37,200 --> 00:58:37,840
Hello?

1295
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:39,960
Oh, you bastard.

1296
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:41,840
I'm going to kill you one day.
