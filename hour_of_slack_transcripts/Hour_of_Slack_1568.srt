00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,680
Dear friends, everything you're about to hear is from July and August of 1994.

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:16,360
This is a rerun of Hour of Slack number 457, Lonesome Cowboy Dave in space.

3
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,340
Hi everybody, nice to be back with you.

4
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:45,520
Well, first of all, I bring a personal message to Dr. Howell, who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the many sacrifices you have made.

5
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:55,360
And of course, his congratulations on your discovery, which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science.

6
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,360
Listen, Howell.

7
00:00:59,220 --> 00:00:59,980
There's never been a time when you've been so grateful.

8
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:04,680
There's never been an instance at all of a computer error occurring in an i-1000 series, has there?

9
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,460
Of course I have.

10
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,600
Sorry about this.

11
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:11,500
I know it's a bit silly.

12
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,600
Just a moment.

13
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:15,400
Just a moment.

14
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:17,720
Yes.

15
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,240
It's puzzling.

16
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:22,460
How is old Bob?

17
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,660
Oh, he's doing good.

18
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:31,180
He's doing great.

19
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:33,360
You are about to participate in a great adventure.

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,360
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...

21
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,240
The subgenius Hour of Slack.

22
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:54,020
Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes.

23
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,180
Uh, yes.

24
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,700
For the next 30 minutes of wrecked up equipment and crummy tape.

25
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:05,960
God.

26
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,900
And the, the, the, uh...

27
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:13,940
Oh, everything's all messed up already and we have to do so many shows so quickly.

28
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,280
And, and, where's the tape?

29
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:16,780
There it is.

30
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:17,540
Oh, there.

31
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,120
Yes.

32
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,200
Yes.

33
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,420
And, well, but...

34
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,780
All things shall pass, they say.

35
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,880
Oh, listen, you can hear the guard dogs.

36
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:27,880
Listen to that.

37
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,960
That's the sound of the new subgenius house.

38
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,500
It's scary, isn't it?

39
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,380
I suppose I should probably go see who's at the door.

40
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:45,560
Yes, just go see.

41
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,660
The phone rang twice more since I went to the door.

42
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:54,840
Let's see.

43
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:57,460
What's some, some good background music here.

44
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,660
Friends, what an auspicious start.

45
00:02:59,780 --> 00:02:59,960
Oh, yes.

46
00:02:59,960 --> 00:02:59,960


47
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,100
I'm going to go to another show.

48
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,440
That was a little old lady at the door.

49
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,740
And, see, I just moved into a new skyscraper studio here.

50
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:11,800
And, and, uh, there was no one else here but me and the guard dogs.

51
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,900
And this little old lady was at the door.

52
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:15,800
And she went out.

53
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,780
We're, I live with, I'm Miss Barry.

54
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:20,520
I live on the house I run behind, behind the road there.

55
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,960
And we're trying to get speed bumps put in.

56
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:28,560
Because people just drive much too fast down that road there.

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,160
And, and, and the fire department says they need it for emergency use.

58
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,080
But there aren't that many emergencies.

59
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,740
And I thought, well, lady, you don't live my life.

60
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,720
But, I was so charming and sweet.

61
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,560
I'm standing there.

62
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,160
I haven't shaved in two days.

63
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:51,020
Wearing a Church of Elvis t-shirt.

64
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,140
24-hour Church of Elvis.

65
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:58,540
With my horrible old gray hair running halfway down my face.

66
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,380
And my back and everything.

67
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,180
And then the phone rings some more.

68
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,540
And then it was Palmer.

69
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,100
And then it was the editor from New York.

70
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,220
And then it was my agent.

71
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:17,940
And, friends, you know, tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow creeps in this petty outer space.

72
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:24,760
From day to day to the last tail leader of recorded tapes.

73
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:32,720
And all our yesterfrops have lighted subgeniuses the way to bad breath.

74
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,100
Out, out brief flashlight batteries.

75
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:39,740
Life is but a walking shadow.

76
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:50,680
A poor pocket pool player who struts and frets his hour of slack upon the airwaves and then is heard no more.

77
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,740
It is a rant yelled at.

78
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:55,420
By idiots.

79
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,300
Full of sound and fury.

80
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,680
Signifying...

81
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,100
Dobbs.

82
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:05,080
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack, dear friends.

83
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,140
The voice of the Church of the subgenius.

84
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:12,540
A celebration of peace, love, and understanding.

85
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:21,300
It just happens to take the form of pain, hate, and confusion for this global village of the damned.

86
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
Oh, oh, and it's also about slack.

87
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,220
And Bob.

88
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:33,840
Dear friends, yes, we mustn't forget those fine things, lest we will be indeed the global village of the damned.

Copyright 1994, Paul Manfredi.

90
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,480
Yes, friends, this old show, this old show has been through many changes recently.

91
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:52,200
First, losing the station in Dallas and having to rebuild a down and dirty mini studio here at the home office.

92
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,520
And then we had to move the home office.

93
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:54,980
Oh, yeah.

94
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:03,240
The Subgenius Foundation Incorporated and Bulldada Time Control, not to mention everything I personally own in this world,

95
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,880
and that includes a hell of a lot of comic books, friends,

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:12,020
has all been physically moved to new digs in another part of Dallas, a new skyscraper.

97
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,520
And, friends, it's been hell.

98
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:18,400
And I don't mean no subgenius hell either.

99
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:19,380
Oh, that'd be a party.

100
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,760
We're not talking about a single bedroom efficiency with flimsy modern aluminum furniture.

101
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:32,000
We're talking about countless heavy massive antiques upon which all our flimsy recording equipment is sitting.

102
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:41,660
Directly behind me as I sit here, seen on screen three, is a 17-foot wall to ceiling,

103
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:48,560
floor to ceiling wall, friends, of tapes, videos, films, albums, CDs, cats and nine tails.

104
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:58,460
We've got a new phone number, a new physical address, although, market, friends, our virtual address, the sacred P.O. box.

105
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,720
181-417 Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

106
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:14,060
That, my friend, is eternal and shall ne'er change while Bob lives and while I live.

107
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,540
But anyway, we had to put off producing the show for two weeks.

108
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,740
And I'm just lucky there's so much tape laying around here screaming and begging to be broadcast.

109
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,840
You can almost hear them there in the background.

110
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,740
But, friends, we're in a new building, too.

111
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,720
And you know what that means?

112
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,060
That means that nothing works.

113
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:37,640
Because it was made in America by union idiots.

114
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,420
And every single fixture sprang a leak, even the electrical ones.

115
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,820
And it was like a Three Stooges comedy brought to life.

116
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,940
I mean, it really was.

117
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:54,940
But, you know, they say subgeniuses work best under pressure.

118
00:07:55,140 --> 00:08:02,500
And of course, we always cause that incredible pressure to build up by blowing everything off until the last minute.

119
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,680
And then, then, only then, with total disaster breathing down our necks with its hot breath,

120
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:13,120
we perform magnificently, far beyond mere hume expectations.

121
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:17,600
It's the fear that amplifies the intelligence, friends.

122
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,140
It's the fight or flight syndrome.

123
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,580
Makes you twenty times smarter than normal.

124
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,120
Unless you're a human.

125
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,580
And then it's just pure panic.

126
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,340
Pure panic.

127
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:31,920
It's like my daughter's theory about the lucidity of the moment of death.

128
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:37,500
My little cute thirteen year old says that if you know you're about to die,

129
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,920
like the Mack truck is coming straight at you or whatever,

130
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:47,020
your brain automatically switches into a higher gear than it has ever been in before.

131
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,780
And not only is your whole life replayed in an instant, complete with smells,

132
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,040
but you also realize you suddenly, for the first time, realize the perfect, foolproof,

133
00:08:58,180 --> 00:09:05,280
and most of all extremely easy scheme that would have saved the planet and made you a billionaire instantly.

134
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,200
But along with that, in those last microseconds of life,

135
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:15,700
comes the frustration of realizing how utterly obvious it should have been to you all along.

136
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,580
How stupid you were not to think that you were going to die.

137
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,020
Think of it.

138
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,080
Eh, too late now, though.

139
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:26,640
And what's worse, as Vreedes pointed out, is that if you happen to live through it,

140
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:28,460
you forget.

141
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,640
Bummer, man.

142
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,980
Anyway, that's the way things are now.

143
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:40,220
No sooner did we move the entire church coffers and all the gear to a new place

144
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,540
and finally unpack and fix the disasters,

145
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:46,000
than I get a phone call this morning

146
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,160
that basically says that if I don't fly to San Francisco right now

147
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:57,000
to ensure, no matter what, that the new subgenius book, Revelation X, Final Layout,

148
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,220
will be done in two weeks, then we're cancelled. Period.

149
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,920
The project is cancelled.

150
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,860
That's right, that's how late we were.

151
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,800
So, it's easy, friends.

152
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:15,000
I just have to drop everything else, spend my life savings getting to the far-off cave of Paul Mavridis and Hal Robbins,

153
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:18,340
and help them finish a chapter a day,

154
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,020
and do all the corrections,

155
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:23,440
and hand-carry the material to the publishers in New York,

156
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,860
that's all, that's all that,

157
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,560
and do the five overdue hour of slack radio shows before I leave!

158
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:39,360
So, this, dear friends, is the ultimate slack of subgenius horror, or something like that.

159
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:42,120
It's the hand that dobs Deltas.

160
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,060
Will we then be jokers?

161
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,560
Or aces?

162
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,200
Or, more likely, just pull a Black Queen and explode?

163
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,260
Only the next fourteen days will tell,

164
00:10:55,380 --> 00:11:03,880
so wish me luck in assembling today two months worth of tapes into five hours of slack between now and tomorrow, would you?

165
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:09,080
And send, after that, your prayers towards the bay

166
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:13,620
for me and Mavridis and Dr. Howell

167
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,940
to somehow have the energy

168
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,820
and brilliance to finish what we started three long years ago

169
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,540
before the conspiracy pulls the plug,

170
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,760
leaving us with the greatest unpublished book in all history

171
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:31,880
and a bill for twenty thousand dollars.

172
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:33,960
Amen.

173
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:43,440
Well, I guess, first let's go to outer space, friends, with lonesome cowboy Dave.

174
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,400
Yeah, I think we'll do that. That hardly takes any editing.

175
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,060
Uh, this was originally broadcast...

176
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:50,920
Whoa!

177
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,280
Man!

178
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,900
They're coming in again!

179
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,480
I can't believe this!

180
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,020
On top of moving, I have to deal with these!

181
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:09,200
Okay, uh, this, uh, coming up was originally broadcast July, uh, on WCSB radio in Cleveland.

182
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,900
Swamp radio.

183
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,600
Uh, the show of Chaz Smith and lonesome cowboy Dave.

184
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,900
I've been saving this stuff, friends, for just such an occasion.

185
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,620
Praise the Lord.

186
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,160
Mavridis!

187
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:26,560
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

188
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:32,280
No kind of world for an old man no more.

189
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:39,460
Well, after this espousal, I can only wonder what kind of surgery you must have gone under

190
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:44,520
to get the pipe-like grin and also some of the weird brain fusions.

191
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:49,940
Oh, they tell me I was born... I'm not a joker, man! I'm an ace! I want you to understand that!

192
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,340
I can't understand the difference between the cards yet.

193
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,480
I know I'm trying, but...

194
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,420
I'm not a joker, man.

195
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,960
I'm not an ace neither.

196
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,980
It's more like a quagmire I'm lost in.

197
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,420
It's just a splattering of 52 different numbers in the deck and I can't figure out which one to go with.

198
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:11,600
I thought I'd like to be a ten of clubs, but it turned out I was a ten of clubfoot.

199
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:12,700
And...

200
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,500
Yeah, that'll get you out of here.

201
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,820
That got me out of Vietnam.

202
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,400
Why did you want to go there?

203
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:23,260
I didn't want to go. I wanted to get out. Luckily, my ten clubs of feet did it.

204
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,960
So you can get out of Vietnam by having clubfeet?

205
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:29,020
Yeah, tell them. They're gonna ship you off if you don't.

206
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,140
Just all you gotta do is take your shoes off in front of the psychiatrist.

207
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:37,020
Well, I thought they were gonna ship me off to one of those off-planet little spin... those little spin containers.

208
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,600
Those little tuna fish cans.

209
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:43,800
Well, the... Vietnam is slang for Venus.

210
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:46,760
Ha! The capital city, Ritz, right?

211
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:52,360
Yeah, and Iran is slang for Mars. You know, we say, oh, we're having a war with Iraq.

212
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,800
You know, what that means is that that's North Mars.

213
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,260
North Mars.

214
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,380
Or South Mars. South Mars.

215
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,020
Oh, well, I thought...

216
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:03,580
Iran is North Mars. Vietnam, that was Venus, man.

217
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:10,740
I mean, they were just... the media tricked you into thinking that we're in this primitive 1990s technology,

218
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,440
when actually, you know, they're shipping people off all the time.

219
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:18,000
Well, there's colony... there's slave colonies on Saturn.

220
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,640
Well, not actually on Saturn. The gravity there would, you know, make you as heavy as Orson Welles.

221
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,200
Well, was the moon landing real?

222
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,400
But, you know, on the... on the... huh?

223
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:30,880
Was the moon landing real?

224
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,960
Yeah, in 1945.

225
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:38,900
You mean Oscar Wilde conquered the moon in 1945 with the Mercury Theater?

226
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,480
Or... no, wait a minute.

227
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,160
No, that was Edward Teller.

228
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:44,420
Oh, it was Mercury.

229
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:49,640
That was... I thought that was Heinrich Tesla, who was Tesla's brother, and actually came up with the... the...

230
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,380
Oppenheimer and all those guys all went to the moon.

231
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,240
Oppenheimer went to the moon?

232
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,500
Yeah, they... they didn't... you know, then they... the thing you saw in 1969 was a...

233
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,640
Ah, Roger. Roger.

234
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:06,280
That was fake. You know, that was like... they wanted to... they... they had run out of funds for their secret space program,

235
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:11,020
so they said, okay, let's tell them we're gonna go to the moon for the first time.

236
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,940
No, no, no.

237
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:13,560
They are nickel.

238
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,520
So they made a big deal. They didn't even really go.

239
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:19,740
I mean, they already had... they couldn't have shown that footage on... there's cities there.

240
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,260
There's cities on the moon?

241
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:27,460
Well, they're mostly underground, but you mean you would... almost anywhere you go there, you see signs, you know, little smokestacks and stuff.

242
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:29,320
Can you get a good gyros there?

243
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:36,480
I... you know, I've heard that some of these places that had been previously inhabited, that they just keep on repopulating them with new kinds of people.

244
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,260
There's always more where that last one came from.

245
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:40,040
What's... what's the...

246
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,540
People are considered cockroaches to these... the owners of these...

247
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:43,540


248
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:43,820
bases.

249
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,740
Well, what do they want the cockroaches to do there other than, like, bug them and get on top of the turntable or something?

250
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:55,520
Well, it's a farm. It's a farm. This is all a farm. The whole solar system is a farm, Dave.

251
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,660
You're part of the... you're not one of the farmers. You're one of the spuds or turnips that's being...

252
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,740
Hop on a new cheese.

253
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:13,040
But there... you had once said that these are beings. These farmers are too hideous to behold, that their faces are all squares and cockeyed angles, and if they were to come into this world and... where... where...

254
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:13,520
You'd rip them apart.

255
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,760
You'd rip your face apart in terror were you to behold one physically.

256
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:22,360
Oh, how do they make their way through the abyss? Do they just blow themselves in there, or do they just, like... have they always been...

257
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:29,140
There is no abyss to them. It is all... they are in no space. All things are touching. They have cosmic consciousness, man.

258
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,820
There's some bad...

259
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,760
All the time.

260
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,020
Mackey-fackies, I guess.

261
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:33,500
Yeah.

262
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,380
Well...

263
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,380
And, uh...

264
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:38,100
We can't get away from them? I mean...

265
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:43,520
Through Bob, you certainly may. But only through Bob. Only... only Bob...

266
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:50,480
And, in fact, not merely through faith or slack in Bob, but through works. Money, Dave. Money.

267
00:16:51,480 --> 00:17:00,020
That $30 is all important. That makes the difference between those who Bob knows trust him and those that Bob doesn't even notice.

268
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:08,880
You can worship him all you want, but if he doesn't whiff your name on that check, then you... you're... you're just another pink boy. You're no better than the pink.

269
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:13,140
Now, remember, we are a non-profit radio station.

270
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:17,280
Yeah, but... Bob's a non-profit.

271
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:22,500
I bet you said that a thousand times.

272
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,460
That's the first time.

273
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,980
Well, that was... the first time...

274
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,220
It's the first time it ever came up.

275
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,200
Now, I'm in trouble.

276
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,420
Well, I don't know if I... if I feel like giving some...

277
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,920
Again, we come back to, is your soul up?

278
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:42,220
Is your soul up, dear friends? Is your soul up? Or did you sell out?

279
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:43,500
Have you sold out?

280
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:50,260
I certainly hope not. We're... we've done our best to walk that tightrope ourselves.

281
00:17:50,420 --> 00:18:01,100
Well, I just thought I'd take a break here from the swamp radio there from WCSB, and just to experience this lovely music that Nenslo sent us.

282
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:12,260
A special tape compilation of background music. Yes, background music that you'll be hearing irritatingly over and over again in the future on these shows.

283
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,800
This particular piece, Nenslo calls...

284
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,300
Quote,

285
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,500
"...the master control theme."

286
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:25,760
Parentheses. Seriously. Unparentheses. Unquote.

287
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:33,460
Hmm... let's just listen for a while before we go back deep into outer space with Lonesome Cowboy Dave Show.

288
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,960
It is...

289
00:18:42,260 --> 00:19:12,260


290
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:42,260


291
00:19:42,260 --> 00:20:12,260


292
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:42,260


293
00:20:42,260 --> 00:21:12,260


294
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:42,260


295
00:21:42,260 --> 00:22:12,260


296
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:42,260


297
00:22:42,260 --> 00:23:12,260


298
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:42,260


299
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:45,500
The show said that it would be 7 o'clock in the morning on July 5th.

300
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,540
Wearing pampers out on a broad Jamaican sea, staring scone at...

301
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,960
That's Jacques Cousteau right there.

302
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,880
I thought that was the meteor magnate... or the meteor man.

303
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,260
Is that the weatherman?

304
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:04,500
That's Peppy in the background. I'm home again. I'm dreaming. I think it's... it's Peppy... Listen...

305
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,060
Wake up, Dave! Wake up, Dave!

306
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,920
Peppy! I stepped on Peppy!

307
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,280
It'll be okay.

308
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,320
It'll be okay.

309
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,160
It's just a dream, Dave.

310
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:16,440
I never had no dog named Peppy.

311
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,700
Your friends are still here.

312
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,880
Me, the Tin Woodsman.

313
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:20,740
Tin Lizzy.

314
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,240
Yeah.

315
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,440
And the Cowardly Lion.

316
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:24,440
Oh, the Cowardly.

317
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:24,880
Yes.

318
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,720
It was only a dream.

319
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:30,180
That horrible, boring world of trucks and sidewalks.

320
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:30,760
And sausages.

321
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,260
It was just a terrible dream.

322
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,240
And fatal onions.

323
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,640
You've been hearing Oz all along.

324
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:36,460
Oh, it's my...

325
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:37,600
These flakes on my mouth.

326
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,140
It's so dry.

327
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:38,560
It's...

328
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,720
I've been here all along?

329
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:40,920
Yeah, you were just...

330
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,780
You got knocked out.

331
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,820
Well, how the hell did I get knocked out?

332
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:46,500
When they dropped that house on your head.

333
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:48,760
Oh, I thought it was when I was arguing with that bitch.

334
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,280
You know what I mean.

335
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:50,960
Yeah.

336
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,260
I think I was...

337
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,100
Don't I?

338
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:55,240
What his problem was, you know, what the hell.

339
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:57,680
She was giving me some stuff, so I might as well...

340
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:58,400
Oh, there.

341
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,340
Here it goes again.

342
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,740
Am I in there?

343
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,180
Yeah.

344
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:06,140
Boy, I think something's missing here now.

345
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,920
This looks like a little teeny...

346
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:08,560
teeny tiny room.

347
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:09,640
Now, how the hell I get in here?

348
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,920
We've been orbiting the whole time, Dave.

349
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:16,800
You're still in a little tuna can in space, remember?

350
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:21,680
It's gonna be another nine months before we get on all the way over to Jupiter.

351
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:23,020
Yeah, but when do they hatch?

352
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,800
Do we get to get out before they hatch or we gotta wait?

353
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:28,060
Oh, you'll know when they're hatching.

354
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,300
I thought I'd be in some kind of hibernation chamber or something.

355
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,740
Well, but you...

356
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:37,900
Most people wake up for the last few seconds of their life as the thing is bursting their...

357
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,620
chest open.

358
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,240
Well, what the hell are we doing this for, then?

359
00:25:40,420 --> 00:25:40,980
Well, we...

360
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:41,840
You signed up.

361
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,680
Yeah.

362
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,400
You signed up.

363
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,240
The contract is in the computer.

364
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:45,960
Well, I...

365
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:49,180
You thought the corporation was a great idea.

366
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,800
You said we should all climb into the little...

367
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,340
little capsule and we'd get paid.

368
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:59,300
By the time we got to Jupiter, we'd be paid a million bucks each, and sure enough, we

369
00:25:59,300 --> 00:25:59,540
will.

370
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:02,100
It's just that it's our estate that gets it.

371
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,580
Yeah, but it's...

372
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:07,780
Because you didn't read the fine print, Dave, and now we're all stuck here.

373
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,320
We're with you.

374
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,920
For another nine months.

375
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,220
I never...

376
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:12,320
Yeah.

377
00:26:12,620 --> 00:26:14,740
I was never capable of reading a fine print.

378
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:15,220
I just...

379
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,960
And you just keep having these dreams and going off into fantasy land, thinking you're

380
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,260
back on Earth doing radio shows.

381
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:21,520
We have to keep nursing back.

382
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:24,520
And every time I have a dream, how come one of you guys changes?

383
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:29,860
Like, I dreamed my wife was attacking me with a car, and next thing I know, out there I

384
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:33,280
was out in a side room, and some Russian was talking to me, and a woman was attacking me

385
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:33,760
with a car.

386
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,260
Somehow, I think you guys were involved in this.

387
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:38,720
Yeah.

388
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:39,480
Yeah.

389
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,840
And what are you keeping back there?

390
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,040
What's in that big box, anyway?

391
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,440
Well, it's our space hyena.

392
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:45,160
Well, what's the...

393
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:45,900
Rover.

394
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,360
And it's...

395
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,600
And the scorpion rooster creature that we picked up on Mars.

396
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,460
Well, how come we don't get to lick at them?

397
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,560
You can't lick them.

398
00:26:54,560 --> 00:26:55,880
You can't lick them any time you want.

399
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,360
Remember what happened last time you licked them, though?

400
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,760
What, the eye socket thing?

401
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:01,320
Yeah.

402
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,220
Well...

403
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:06,500
It wasn't easy getting that scorpion rooster barb out of your eye socket.

404
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:07,760
Well, I thought you said that was another thing.

405
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:07,760


406
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,040
Another dream.

407
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,840
Give me a mirror.

408
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,800
I want to see if there's anything wrong with my eye socket, man.

409
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:11,520
Let me look in the monitor.

410
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,320
You can't look at your own eye, Dave.

411
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:14,260
Yes, you can.

412
00:27:14,360 --> 00:27:16,480
If I look in the monitor, I can look at my own eye.

413
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,380
I'm not listening to you right now.

414
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:20,320
What the hell?

415
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,380
I have no eyes in there.

416
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,100
Why don't you calm down and take a stress pill, Dave?

417
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,840
I don't see what difference that's going to make.

418
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,960
Now, I'm looking in there, and I'm not...

419
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:29,960
Am I hallucinating or something?

420
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:32,080
I have absolutely no eyeballs in my socket.

421
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,000
Now, this isn't what happened in the eye socket and before.

422
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,080
Usually, it just, like, ripped out a chunk of the side of my face.

423
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:37,760
You can't see?

424
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,820
You can't see your own eyes, Dave.

425
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:41,220
You can't run from your own legs.

426
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,980
Jane told you that a long, long time ago.

427
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,540
Yeah, but you can't talk to your own voice?

428
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,980
You can't smell your own nose?

429
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,660
Well, now, wait a minute.

430
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,260
You can't swallow your own throat?

431
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:58,000
If they pull one eye out, just before the optic nerve severs,

432
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,520
that one eye, just for one second, can look at the other eye.

433
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,120
Is that not subtle?

434
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:02,740
That's true.

435
00:28:02,780 --> 00:28:04,740
If you pull it out, and we did this with Jane.

436
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:07,320
We'd pull it out just enough and turn it around.

437
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:08,980
You have to be very careful turning it.

438
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,520
One eye can actually be seeing the other eye.

439
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,600
But, that's not really the point.

440
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,020
The point is, say, a one eye.

441
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:19,560
You can't see your own eye with that eye that's seeing.

442
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:26,020
You can see your other eye, but you can't see your eye that is doing the seeing.

443
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:27,500
You can only see the other eye.

444
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:29,840
You can look in the mirror, but that doesn't count either.

445
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,640
This is all mere metaphysical.

446
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:33,640
You can't digest your own stomach, Dave.

447
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:34,320
Juggling and juxtaposition.

448
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,300
And you can't hide from Bob.

449
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,020
Because he's stupider than you.

450
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,400
I can't believe that.

451
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:41,360
No, it's true.

452
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,520
That's the miracle of it.

453
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:43,960
That's the beautiful thing.

454
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,300
That's why Bob hates you.

455
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:47,840
I'll be whipped by a miracle whip.

456
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,380
I didn't want to lose that.

457
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,940
I didn't want to.

458
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,900
If you're ever that bad, you could turn into a frog or something.

459
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:54,940
You never know.

460
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,180
You're right.

461
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:11,960
You don't know.

462
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,080
There's a devil right there next to you, and you fell asleep and you've fallen down.

463
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,080
I'm an idol.

464
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:16,580
Nobody else has.

465
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:27,060
You and I will sleep in this scandal dead together.

466
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:35,320
And Sam & Maggie will give you some support.

467
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,280
You're ingerect.

468
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:37,320
You can't hide from God.

469
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,880
You can't hide from God in a reefer.

470
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:44,240
You can't hide from God in a glass of alcohol.

471
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,680
You can't hide from God in a...

472
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:47,120
See?

473
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,220
Because he's bigger than you.

474
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:58,300
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's stupider than you are.

475
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:04,980
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's got more black and white little dots in his face than you do.

476
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:14,220
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because his face has been mimeographed and put up in more places than yours has.

477
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,360
You can't hide from God.

478
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:22,320
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because more people worship him than worship you.

479
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:27,160
You can't hide from Dobbs because he's stupider than you are.

480
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,120
Who the hell is somebody?

481
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,340
You can't run from your own legs.

482
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,260
How are you going to run from your own legs?

483
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,640
Because if you run from your own legs, where are you going to run from them with?

484
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:49,060
If you use them to run from them with, where are you going to run away from?

485
00:30:50,380 --> 00:30:52,280
You can't run from your own legs.

486
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:55,260
You can't hide from J.R. Bob Dobbs because he's stupider than you.

487
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,380
You can't hide from God because he's bigger than you.

488
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:58,620
He's bigger than all reality.

489
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,780
He's bigger than all infinity.

490
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:01,080
Help me, somebody.

491
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,320
She ain't got no legs.

492
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,240
Pull the lever down.

493
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,720
My legs are on fire.

494
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,280
I need some help.

495
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:05,720
Praise God.

496
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,300
Doctors for Bob.

497
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,420
It's a beautiful thing.

498
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:10,040
And we'll continue.

499
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:12,660
If I feel like giving something.

500
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,960
Again, we come back to is your soul up?

501
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,540
Is the magic light gone off?

502
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:22,440
But there is no up and down in that realm.

503
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:25,060
There's no up and down?

504
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:28,580
No, there is sideways, but only in one direction.

505
00:31:28,960 --> 00:31:32,800
So it's not a world where we could use the spatula as frequently as we'd like.

506
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,360
No, it's very linear.

507
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,820
It's more like the needle.

508
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:38,240
You might be able to use the needle, but never the spatula.

509
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:40,360
The spatula is too three-dimensional.

510
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:40,880
Yes.

511
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:42,580
And the beach ball would be out of the question.

512
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,140
Yes.

513
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,480
And also the inclement.

514
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,960
The angles are all wrong.

515
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,180
This is non-Euclidean geometries.

516
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,600
Jeez.

517
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:56,760
Just the frequencies of this broadcast are non-Euclidean.

518
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,180
But do they operate on a similar principle?

519
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:03,860
Is the wave magnetics involved in hearing our voices through this medium?

520
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,240
That's the only.

521
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,100
That's the only way.

522
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,400
That's the only thing that hears our voices in this medium.

523
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:15,180
So are they talking deep into the cervical clavichord and beneath the subcutaneous matter?

524
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,020
Are they talking inside our...

525
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:17,360
Sure, but it's pointless.

526
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,780
Who cares?

527
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:22,060
It's just all going out into the void, Dave.

528
00:32:22,380 --> 00:32:28,180
You're all alone in this vast, huge universe spinning around in this little tuna can.

529
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,240
And 30 bucks.

530
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:32,360
Five years from now, you're going to hit Alpha Centauri.

531
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,720
You'll be the first man there, though, Dave.

532
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,800
It's a great honor.

533
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:35,940
It's a great honor.

534
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,240
I'll be the first tuna sandwich on Alpha Centauri.

535
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,200
You're not just some guinea pig.

536
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,400
You're not just some Russian dog that's been sent up in a sputnik.

537
00:32:42,580 --> 00:32:44,300
A guinea pig and a Russian dog.

538
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:44,380
No, you're a hero.

539
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:44,860
I got that.

540
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:45,380
No, I'm sorry.

541
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,580
You're, you're, you're...

542
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,020
I'm a sandwich.

543
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:48,920
You're the vanguard of the human race.

544
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,600
Well, the subgenius race, anyway.

545
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:57,260
And if Lenny Reifenstahl were to make my film, and to have me as the top tuna above all the rest,

546
00:32:57,280 --> 00:33:01,740
standing below there holding flags and everything, and then I forgot the rest of it, too.

547
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,080
It'd be really good photography.

548
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,240
It would be great stuff.

549
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,780
I think we could all get it.

550
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:06,780
We could get uniforms and everything.

551
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,080
And forget Bob.

552
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:08,820
And just...

553
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:09,980
Yeah, just be Dave.

554
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:10,880
Praise Dave.

555
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,120
Thousands and millions of them.

556
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:12,440
Praise Dave.

557
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:12,920
That's right.

558
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,120
No individual personalities.

559
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,780
Just blend with everything.

560
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,520
Like in a big, massive mush pudding.

561
00:33:20,620 --> 00:33:21,420
Tuna pudding.

562
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:25,260
They all start thinking that way when they've been in the tuna can long enough.

563
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:28,360
When they've been spinning through the void for six months,

564
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:32,660
they start fantasizing that they're on Earth in a radio station,

565
00:33:33,340 --> 00:33:34,800
taking over the world.

566
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:37,700
With the brilliance of their new discoveries.

567
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:39,880
It's still pretty hot and oily in here.

568
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,520
I don't know how much longer I can take it.

569
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:47,200
I suppose you haven't.

570
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:52,900
Let's take off these Brazilian slippers here and relax for a while.

571
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:55,680
Maybe something will happen.

572
00:33:56,160 --> 00:33:56,680
Maybe.

573
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,000
Maybe something.

574
00:33:59,060 --> 00:34:02,180
Just enjoy the stars going by outside the window.

575
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,780
Of course, they don't really seem to be moving.

576
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:06,380
We're not going fast enough.

577
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:07,700
It's not like Star Trek.

578
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:09,740
It's just the same.

579
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:15,520
And, of course, that window has to be shielded completely.

580
00:34:15,740 --> 00:34:18,700
The radiation, if you stuck your hand out there for a second,

581
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:20,100
it would burn your finger off.

582
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,840
If the vacuum didn't get you first, Dave.

583
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:27,380
But don't worry.

584
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,820
You know, we spent a lot of money on this capsule.

585
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,740
Well, just as long as I...

586
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:34,380
I guess as long as I'm protected.

587
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,980
And here I can fantasize.

588
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,780
And you've got lots of tapes.

589
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,140
I hope you like mid-60s top 40.

590
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:52,300
You want to hear good vibrations again?

591
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,900
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

592
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,300
Remember that one Hendrix tape?

593
00:34:58,520 --> 00:34:59,560
I think it was...

594
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,840
Oh, that was the one that got torn up.

595
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:01,700
No, no.

596
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:02,140
That's all right.

597
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,940
That's the one you liked.

598
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:04,660
Yeah, the Mormon choir doing Hendrix.

599
00:35:04,780 --> 00:35:05,360
His greatest hits.

600
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:07,480
You said you'd let me listen to that one again.

601
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:09,700
Could you just, like, put it up one more time?

602
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,860
Their version of Machine Gun was really original.

603
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,520
I never would have thought I could...

604
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:19,280
The Mormon Tabernacle Choir doing Machine Gun with just voices.

605
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,840
Boy, there's a lot you can do with the human voice.

606
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,480
Help!

607
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,040
Help!

608
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:28,500
Help!

609
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:29,220
Help!

610
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:29,780
Help!

611
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,700
It's a good thing his suit provides the medication when he freaks.

612
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,440
It's not like that.

613
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:36,700
I know.

614
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,440
It feels better now, doesn't it?

615
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:41,460
Everything's computerized.

616
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:46,300
We've got Dave tucked in, tucked into his little space capsule.

617
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,020
This creaky chair.

618
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,240
His self-medicating space suit.

619
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:52,040
Just me.

620
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:55,220
All the buttons in front of him and flashing lights are just props.

621
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:56,400
Make him feel good.

622
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,920
Make him feel like he's in control.

623
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,780
Actually, he basically was shot out of a glorified blow gun.

624
00:36:02,080 --> 00:36:03,080
And we kind of...

625
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,760
Along with about a thousand other...

626
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,980
People in little tin cans.

627
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,460
And we're just hoping that one or two of them actually makes it to Alpha Centauri.

628
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,720
And we hope it's still there by the time they get there.

629
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:18,640
Carrying their little letters from J.R. Bob Dobbs.

630
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:24,320
To the kings of any other inhabited planets they might fall onto.

631
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:31,360
We would have loved to have put you in suspended animation for this five-year voyage, Dave.

632
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:31,820
But...

633
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:33,360
That...

634
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,360
The taxpayers...

635
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,620
Would have had to pay for that.

636
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,520
Just the cruelty level would not...

637
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,960
The committee decided that...

638
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:41,240
You could just...

639
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,500
Hack it out.

640
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:44,880
Tough it out.

641
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:49,200
Five years of black void sitting here in Orlando,

642
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:52,000
Pretending to be blown out by a puffed-up dart gun.

643
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,220
You're here with us.

644
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,320
The voice is inside your head, Dave.

645
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:59,080
You'll never be alone.

646
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:03,900
You can't even fall asleep.

647
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,860
Your suit will make sure of that.

648
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,180
Let's see now.

649
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:13,120
The first duchy of Poland was started in 1264.

650
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:17,580
By a count from the Ukraine named Vladimir Ashbaugh.

651
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,280
Oh, it's...

652
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:19,800
That's boring.

653
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,680
Oh, it's...

654
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:26,340
It's Winoma time in southern New Mexico.

655
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:29,320
The Winoma Indians are doing the annual Akoma dance.

656
00:37:30,260 --> 00:37:31,400
Let's see now.

657
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,680
Oh, oh.

658
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,200
There's new wine bars.

659
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:38,580
Don't forget, you've got 90 channels of cable TV.

660
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,980
Although, we will admit, there's no sound.

661
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,760
Yeah, but they're all like shopping channels.

662
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:46,800
And I don't have no money up here.

663
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,900
And you keep trying to get money out of me.

664
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,360
And wait a minute, you're a voice in my head, aren't I?

665
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,840
You're building up credits all the time back on Earth.

666
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:57,560
If you ever make it back, you'll be a very rich man.

667
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,700
Yeah, I'm building up credits.

668
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,060
I'm building up credits all the time.

669
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,280
Of course, if you don't make it back,

670
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,660
they go into the J.R. Bob Dobbs Memorial.

671
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:04,420
Fun.

672
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,920
You'll be remembered very fondly

673
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,220
by those of us who had to stay back here on Earth

674
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:11,560
talking to you by radio, Dave.

675
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,560
I'm kind of connected.

676
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:16,240
We wish we could be out there with you in the void

677
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,020
carrying on the torch of humanity.

678
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,280
I can feel you.

679
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:20,780
Discovery.

680
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:23,920
The amazing sense of discovery you must feel.

681
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,900
We all here on Earth envy you, Dave.

682
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,600
I can touch you back there.

683
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,040
I am...

684
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:31,800
I'm blown out of here.

685
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:35,340
You signed up.

686
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,380
You wanted to go for the easy money, Dave.

687
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,940
Yeah, but...

688
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:44,660
You answered that classified ad in the paper.

689
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:46,940
Yeah, but it said...

690
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:47,980
Off-world farming.

691
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:49,300
Big future.

692
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:51,440
Big bucks while you sleep.

693
00:38:53,180 --> 00:38:55,860
Yeah, but it sounded like such a scam.

694
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:57,780
Off-world farming.

695
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,440
What could you possibly have to do but sleep?

696
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:03,980
Sea monkeys are going to be

697
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:06,300
a big cash crop in the future, Dave,

698
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,060
for people on your new colonized planet.

699
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:10,380
Oh, my God.

700
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:11,580
I gotta check out the sea monkeys.

701
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,560
The sea monkeys were all bloated yesterday

702
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,260
and I had to give them their estrogen tablets.

703
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,060
Let's see.

704
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,160
One, two, three, four, third, one, fourth, one.

705
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,420
This hammer is all disconnected here.

706
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:23,540
I hope the sea monkeys aren't dead, Dave.

707
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,360
They're your only source of nutrients.

708
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:28,260
Check them, check them, check the sea monkeys.

709
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,380
Pry this top off.

710
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,760
Oh, sea monkeys are bloated.

711
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,060
Again.

712
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,160
Are you an invalid?

713
00:39:37,640 --> 00:39:38,120
Hey.

714
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,380
Who are you?

715
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:41,600
What?

716
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,700
Who are you?

717
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,440
You're a different voice in my head.

718
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,740
Are you one of the discarnated dead sea monkeys

719
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:49,640
talking to me like the ghost of them?

720
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,520
You posted a WCS feed.

721
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:54,700
I have to tell you what I want to hear.

722
00:39:57,140 --> 00:40:00,620
Hey, this is getting more realistic and lifelike.

723
00:40:00,720 --> 00:40:03,320
There's like retarded people calling me up

724
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:03,960
and talking to me.

725
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:03,960


726
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:03,960


727
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,420
I'm not even sure what they're saying in my head.

728
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,600
I doubt if we'll ever be able to resurrect these sea monkeys.

729
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:13,000
Jeez.

730
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:14,760
Look at this one.

731
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,180
It's sprouting a whole new head.

732
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,500
I wonder if I mix this solution back in again.

733
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:21,380
Maybe some of them

734
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,340
could take a spore from one of them

735
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,780
and reclone the spore.

736
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:31,320
I'll just go take a nap and write a little report to the committee.

737
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,240
I'm telling you.

738
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:34,560
Bob?

739
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:35,960
Bob?

740
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,140
I haven't heard the voice of Bob.

741
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,300
Bob?

742
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,940
There's just something in the background there.

743
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,720
I can't make that voice out.

744
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,040
I can't make that voice out.

745
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,860
Well, the only thing for me to do on this shift is,

746
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,660
well, I gotta remember to go to the bathroom.

747
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:03,520
And I gotta, well, remember to eat.

748
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,680
Eat that stuff they call food.

749
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,740
I could work out again.

750
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:08,680
Yeah.

751
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,280
Hell with that.

752
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,600
I'll go read some more technical manuals.

753
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:15,980
Take on some more stuff on the monitor.

754
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,180
Hell with that.

755
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,800
I'll try on this Mr. Peanut suit.

756
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:29,980
Yeah.

757
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,220
This thing's been laying around for weeks now.

758
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,420
It's hilarious.

759
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,100
It's like hallucinating the Peanut suit again.

760
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:37,560
You'll have to make note of that.

761
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:39,060
Tell the psychiatrist.

762
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,460
Mr. Peanut used to come to all the fairs,

763
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:45,120
and he'd pass out donuts and give favors to the kids,

764
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,160
and bags of peanuts, of course.

765
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,240
I love that monocled eye.

766
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,080
You know what's funny?

767
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,140
All of those volunteer, quote, astronauts, unquote,

768
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:56,280
start imagining the Peanut suit.

769
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:57,980
Something about Mr. Peanut.

770
00:41:57,980 --> 00:42:00,180
Do you suppose the Russians had something to do with that?

771
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:02,400
Could they have breached security

772
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:04,880
and implanted the Mr. Peanut fantasy?

773
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:09,040
Look, he thinks he's Mr. Peanut again.

774
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,940
I'm Mr. Peanut.

775
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,480
And if it's not Mr. Peanut, it's Reddy Kilowatt.

776
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,580
My mom and dad enjoyed the opening of the 7-Eleven.

777
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:17,660
Remember, it's a child-faring corporation.

778
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,140
It's kind of sad in a way.

779
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,220
Oh, boy.

780
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,740
I'm taller than all the other Mr. Peanut men.

781
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:30,040
This is a very, very big, important convention of Mr. Peanut men.

782
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:31,940
I think I'm standing.

783
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:34,220
Do you suppose his suit is over-medicating him?

784
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,780
It's possible.

785
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:37,380
It is possible.

786
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:42,000
But why old advertising figures?

787
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,320
I mean, Mr. Peanut's not even used anymore in marketing, I don't think.

788
00:42:46,360 --> 00:42:47,620
It's something from his past.

789
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:49,400
Yes, they're comforting things.

790
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,680
Oh, Mr. Potato Head.

791
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:54,760
One of the people on the way to Proxima Regulus

792
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:59,420
were all turned into Mr. Potato Head around the six-month mark, just like him.

793
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,440
We'll have to remember that.

794
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:02,960
Yes, we'll make a note of it.

795
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,660
We'll have to tell the psychology department.

796
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,980
Oh, now I'm blonde, Mr. Potato Head.

797
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:09,740
And now I've got red hair.

798
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,240
We'll have to tell the cruelty department, too.

799
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:18,560
They can start implanting evil Mr. Potato Head and evil Mr. Peanut.

800
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:24,820
It's no wonder they gave me a shriveled-up Mr. Potato Head.

801
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,860
Because now I can stare at a child.

802
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,780
I'd like this mask to use.

803
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:35,680
Oh, Mr. Tuber costume.

804
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:38,220
It's the big sweet potato head.

805
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,080
Oh, I love this one the best.

806
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:42,960
It's carved out in the middle.

807
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:51,920
Do you suppose he has any inkling that all of his silly antics

808
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:58,280
are being broadcast to all the people on Earth on the crazy astronaut channel?

809
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:00,780
He's fully lost.

810
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:02,840
Oh, hey, there's somebody watching.

811
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:05,380
One of these days he's going to switch through those channels

812
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,080
and he's going to come upon the channel with him on it.

813
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:09,240
Damn, man.

814
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:11,220
I might as well lift a box.

815
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:12,540
Oh, wow, this is getting boring.

816
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:18,760
Dave, your gyros need stabilizing.

817
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,460
Dave, check your computer.

818
00:44:21,460 --> 00:44:24,040
Your gyro, you're spinning.

819
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,120
You're in a spin, Dave.

820
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:28,300
Whose voice is this?

821
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,520
Stabilize the gyros.

822
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,420
Is this a real voice or is this a real voice?

823
00:44:31,420 --> 00:44:32,680
Turn up the oxygen switch.

824
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:35,400
I get lightheaded in here.

825
00:44:35,620 --> 00:44:37,160
Reach for the oxygen switch, Dave.

826
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,960
I think I'll turn on the oxygen switch.

827
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,280
Oh, he did it.

828
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:44,660
At least he thought it was the oxygen switch.

829
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:49,820
It's a wrong switch.

830
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,880
Just green stuff going on.

831
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,920
He needed a good washing.

832
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,620
Oh, my God.

833
00:44:57,840 --> 00:45:01,040
They always panic when the suit fills up with the cleansing fluid.

834
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,260
My neck hurts so much.

835
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:03,800
Right up to their nostrils.

836
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:04,780
Oh, my God.

837
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:06,280
It's like he doesn't really...

838
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,360
I take off the church air switch.

839
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:09,500
My hands are clean.

840
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:12,120
My face is clean.

841
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:13,100
Hello.

842
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,060
Hello, Dave.

843
00:45:15,360 --> 00:45:16,700
Feeling better now, Dave?

844
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:17,900
Feeling better now, Dave?

845
00:45:18,440 --> 00:45:18,920
What?

846
00:45:20,380 --> 00:45:21,700
Everything I say itches.

847
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:22,740
No, no, no.

848
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:23,980
We're not doing that, it says.

849
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:26,580
It's just...

850
00:45:27,720 --> 00:45:29,540
It's just us, Dave.

851
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:30,880
The voices in you.

852
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:31,220
Yeah.

853
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:34,340
We didn't want you to be alone.

854
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:38,100
I bet I could write a whole symphony on this hollow potato.

855
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:40,820
That would be something to do for five years.

856
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,060
We'd sit around going mad.

857
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:45,400
It's that all we're gonna do.

858
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:48,620
There have been great symphonies written about hollow potatoes, Dave.

859
00:45:48,860 --> 00:45:49,340
Great symphonies.

860
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,120
Why don't you try it?

861
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:52,640
It'll keep you busy for a month or so.

862
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:54,120
Yeah, why don't I try it?

863
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:57,440
I could, like, make thousands and thousands of little holes,

864
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,900
like some sort of chromatic key.

865
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:00,780
I could just get a little...

866
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:03,240
Dave, the cat's loose in the spaceship.

867
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,720
So let me check the monitor for her.

868
00:46:06,020 --> 00:46:06,360
Excuse me.

869
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:07,460
Shh.

870
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,620
The cat's loose.

871
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:09,820
Damn cat.

872
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,780
It's crawling all over all...

873
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:13,020
All those...

874
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,260
Faders are...

875
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:16,100
You better catch that cat, Dave.

876
00:46:16,120 --> 00:46:17,700
It's walking across the control panel.

877
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:18,380
It's right near the control panel.

878
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,500
You're going into a spin again.

879
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:20,160
It's going right out of control.

880
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,040
You're destabilizing.

881
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:21,660
Oh, my God.

882
00:46:22,080 --> 00:46:23,740
I'm gonna destabilize.

883
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:25,000
This thing's gonna start flipping.

884
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,280
If I don't get down there right away...

885
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:26,700
Shh.

886
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:27,740
Shh.

887
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:27,840
Shh.

888
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:28,660
Shh.

889
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:30,480
Ginger?

890
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:31,740
Meow.

891
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:32,900
Ginger?

892
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:34,100
Ginger?

893
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:34,760
Meow.

894
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:35,760
Meow.

895
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:36,620
Meow.

896
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:37,300
Meow.

897
00:46:37,980 --> 00:46:38,140
Meow.

898
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:38,460
Meow.

899
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:38,820
Meow.

900
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:38,820


901
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:40,640
Oh.

902
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:42,840
Oh, good.

903
00:46:42,980 --> 00:46:43,160
Look.

904
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,080
Princess Wee, the cat's mutated.

905
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:46,940
Just as we were hoping.

906
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,120
What the hell did you do?

907
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,680
He let it wander into the cargo hold where it was exposed.

908
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:52,540
What is that?

909
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:53,780
Ginger?

910
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:54,860
Is that you?

911
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:56,800
Sheesh.

912
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:57,720
Oh, my God.

913
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:57,720


914
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:57,720


915
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:01,740
What the hell is this slime all over your neck?

916
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:03,720
What you been getting into?

917
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,660
Just let me get a little closer, okay?

918
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:07,440
What's wrong?

919
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:09,640
Try to make friends with it, Dave.

920
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,860
I'll try and make friends with it.

921
00:47:12,040 --> 00:47:13,820
Try to make friends with Ginger.

922
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:14,940
Yeah.

923
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,920
Ginger is always a nice little kitty.

924
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:18,400
It's sick or something.

925
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:19,480
I'll make friends.

926
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:21,580
I'll pet it and take it back out of here.

927
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:22,660
Ginger?

928
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:24,540
No.

929
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,440
Well, settle down, Dave.

930
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:27,700
Try to make friends with Ginger.

931
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:27,700


932
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:27,700


933
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:27,700


934
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:27,700


935
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:27,700


936
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:27,700


937
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:27,700


938
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:27,700


939
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,860
Try to communicate with it.

940
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,160
It's a new form of life.

941
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:32,480
No one's ever seen a cat spider before.

942
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:35,140
It could teach us things.

943
00:47:37,460 --> 00:47:38,300
Oh, my God.

944
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,560
Think what it could mean to science.

945
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:42,440
Go on in there, Dave.

946
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:43,120
Can I get in there?

947
00:47:43,120 --> 00:47:47,120
Go on back into that cargo hold with that giant mutated cat spider.

948
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,060
If I could just talk to her, maybe.

949
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:51,780
It's got to be intelligent if it's mutating this far.

950
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,940
It maybe has something to tell me.

951
00:47:56,220 --> 00:47:57,680
A little kitty or a little cat?

952
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:57,680


953
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:57,680


954
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:57,680


955
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:57,680


956
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:57,680


957
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:57,680


958
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:57,680


959
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:57,680


960
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:57,680


961
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:57,680


962
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:57,680


963
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:57,680


964
00:47:57,680 --> 00:47:58,160
I don't know.

965
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:58,900
I can't remember.

966
00:47:59,120 --> 00:47:59,320
It's got to be intelligent.

967
00:47:59,320 --> 00:47:59,400
It's got to be intelligent.

968
00:47:59,400 --> 00:47:59,480
I don't know.

969
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,000
I don't know.

970
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,000


971
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:00,000


972
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,460
What the hell is that?

973
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:02,540
What the hell?

974
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:08,000
Oh, it just needs to be comforted, Dave.

975
00:48:08,980 --> 00:48:11,420
The music soothes the savage beast.

976
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:13,000
Why don't you put on some music?

977
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:14,180
Oh, Ginger.

978
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,820
I was going to play a little song for you.

979
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:20,380
Maybe you should put out some milk for it, a little try of milk.

980
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:22,540
Ginger?

981
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,880
I was wondering that.

982
00:48:24,980 --> 00:48:25,700
Be careful now.

983
00:48:26,060 --> 00:48:27,120
Don't let it get hurt.

984
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:27,660
Ginger?

985
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:27,660


986
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:27,660


987
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:27,660


988
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:27,660


989
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:27,660


990
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:27,660


991
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:27,660


992
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:27,660


993
00:48:27,660 --> 00:48:27,660


994
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:30,920
You know, its blood can burn a hole directly through the spaceship hull.

995
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:36,900
It'd create a terrible vacuum and suck you out into space like toothpaste out of a tube.

996
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,280
It looks like you're going through a new...

997
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:43,680
And whatever you do, don't let any harm come to Ginger.

998
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:49,560
The War Department is very interested in your little tabby.

999
00:48:50,420 --> 00:48:52,340
I don't think we can deal with this right now.

1000
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:53,680
I think it's just that.

1001
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:54,340
We're out of here.

1002
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:55,040
We're still out.

1003
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,400
We're going to have to stop.

1004
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,400
We're going to have to stop.

1005
00:48:57,680 --> 00:49:06,960
And we'll be back to the Lonesome Cowboy Dave flipping out in outer space channel after these words from our controller.

1006
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,380
Cue up the controller tape.

1007
00:49:13,780 --> 00:49:17,100
Dealing with overpopulation involves more than birth control.

1008
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:20,740
That idea will take center stage at an upcoming conference in Egypt.

1009
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,000
I'm Steve Pomplin for Earthwatch Radio.

1010
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,940
I say kill them all, let God sort them out.

1011
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:37,900
I'm into the voluntary human extinction movement.

1012
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,700
I say let them eat green cheese.

1013
00:49:42,260 --> 00:49:45,820
Let them eat green cheese and let the cat sort them out.

1014
00:49:45,980 --> 00:49:48,340
Let the mutated spider cat.

1015
00:49:51,020 --> 00:49:52,980
I said so many bullshits.

1016
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:52,980


1017
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:52,980


1018
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:52,980


1019
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,400
The

1020
00:49:55,400 --> 00:50:18,320
Now come on, Dave, I know you've got some of that whiskey stashed somewhere.

1021
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,800
Back with the bio samples from Mars.

1022
00:50:33,580 --> 00:50:38,520
We can't understand a word you're saying.

1023
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,280
He's lost in space, friends.

1024
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,120
It's sad.

1025
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:52,860
It's sad, but it's part of the risks these astronauts take.

1026
00:50:53,180 --> 00:50:56,980
Thank God, Creamora, don't make you sleepy like some of the other ones do.

1027
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:00,140
Well, at one o'clock, your suit will put you to sleep.

1028
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:04,860
I'm waiting. I'm waiting. I'm waiting for my suit to put me to sleep.

1029
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:12,640
Over the last five and a half hours, my suit has enthralled me.

1030
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,780
My suit has put me to sleep and waked me up again.

1031
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:20,140
My suit fed me. My suit evacuated my bowels.

1032
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,200
My suit lulled me into a false sense of security.

1033
00:51:24,260 --> 00:51:25,360
It's a comforting suit.

1034
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:29,780
My suit talked to me. My suit made me feel very insecure.

1035
00:51:30,240 --> 00:51:35,620
My suit expanded and contracted a few times. I didn't understand what that was about.

1036
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:37,300
It was punishing you, Dave.

1037
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:39,400
The suit punishes.

1038
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:42,540
The suit punishes and the suit rewards.

1039
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:45,680
The suit rewards you, Dave.

1040
00:51:45,780 --> 00:51:50,340
My world is in this suit. This is my entire world.

1041
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,040
The suit is your friend.

1042
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:53,960
It's a nurturing cocoon.

1043
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,920
Oh, look at the cut of my socks.

1044
00:51:56,200 --> 00:52:00,780
This is the kind of seasoning that would make any, any young man in America jealous as hell.

1045
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:05,460
I'm a true hero. Wearing this suit made me a hero, and I'm proud of it.

1046
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:09,520
I'm glad I signed up now. I think my suit's filling me with pride.

1047
00:52:10,780 --> 00:52:12,220
Odie, dodie, dodie, Dave.

1048
00:52:12,220 --> 00:52:13,720
I'm afraid that's not pride, Dave.

1049
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,760
You shouldn't have eaten those freezers.

1050
00:52:15,780 --> 00:52:17,260
Dried beans this morning.

1051
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,780
They just had a little fuzz on them.

1052
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:22,100
I didn't see nothing wrong with those beans.

1053
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:26,400
Yeah, your suit may be filling up with a lot more than mere pride.

1054
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:29,020
Oh, there you go. He's using the zero-gravity toilet again.

1055
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:31,220
Oh, boy, this is kind of...

1056
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,420
Oh, no, he left the flap open.

1057
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:39,000
Look, the stuff is floating around inside the cabin now.

1058
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:40,120
It's coating the windows.

1059
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:45,240
Way to go, Dave. Smooth move.

1060
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:48,980
Oh, no.

1061
00:52:50,260 --> 00:52:50,780
Oh, no.

1062
00:52:51,580 --> 00:52:54,360
Well, now the emergency lights have gone off.

1063
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,580
Little robots have to come out and clean up after you again, Dave.

1064
00:52:57,820 --> 00:52:58,680
I have to get to the cleaning unit, please.

1065
00:52:59,560 --> 00:52:59,960
Hello?

1066
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:04,260
The suit's going to have to punish you again, Dave.

1067
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,920
Hello? I'm going to clean up on the front window.

1068
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:09,060
Shh, shh.

1069
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:11,280
I think I'm going to be stuck there for weeks now.

1070
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:15,140
Of course, in this vacuous atmosphere, I won't smell much.

1071
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:15,640
I don't know.

1072
00:53:15,780 --> 00:53:17,540
I just don't take your helmet off.

1073
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:22,100
I wonder what would happen if I took my helmet off.

1074
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:23,640
I never tried it.

1075
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:25,120
No, don't do that, Dave.

1076
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,800
Wait a minute. Maybe something might... I don't know.

1077
00:53:27,860 --> 00:53:29,180
This is not a pressurized cabin.

1078
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:34,360
Might not be such a good idea after all.

1079
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:37,160
Get a little around with this.

1080
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:39,740
Oh, look, he's trying to light a cigarette again.

1081
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,940
He can't get it up to his lips through that helmet.

1082
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,080
That must be the 5,000...

1083
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,920
It's time he's done that.

1084
00:53:47,060 --> 00:53:47,160
Shh.

1085
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,180
Huh.

1086
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:51,240
16 cartons of luggage and I can't smoke a damn cigarette.

1087
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:53,660
It was a brilliant move on the part of the psychology department

1088
00:53:53,660 --> 00:53:56,620
to put that no smoking sign blinking in there

1089
00:53:56,620 --> 00:53:59,700
and those 20 cartons of cigarettes that...

1090
00:54:01,020 --> 00:54:04,560
keeps up the sort of tension that keeps the astronauts...

1091
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:07,360
oddly enough, it keeps them mentally healthy.

1092
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:11,600
You know, it's so alone out here, the only friend I've got's my own guitar.

1093
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:15,520
Lucille, you've been with me through thick and thin.

1094
00:54:15,780 --> 00:54:16,960
I can't smoke.

1095
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:18,840
Can't really eat a good meal.

1096
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,040
But I can still sing a song.

1097
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:24,880
I think I'll sing a song about my intergalactic exploits.

1098
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,360
Scott can't even hardly touch these fragile, these big mitts on.

1099
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,120
I can't.

1100
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:41,080
Years ago and years ago

1101
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:44,340
But still I'm a flying bird

1102
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:47,860
And someday I'll get there

1103
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:49,620
And maybe I won't.

1104
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,140
Then I'll never know the reason why

1105
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:58,020
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo.

1106
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:01,780
Shh, that's the worst one yet.

1107
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:02,260
Too far.

1108
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:04,840
Hey, can't you just keep on working it?

1109
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:07,540
I have my opera all figured out by the time I get there.

1110
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,080
And then, if I make it back to Earth.

1111
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,700
it's more herodom and fame and fortune for me.

1112
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:14,440
I'll just chop that up and...

1113
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,760
You'll be the biggest hero.

1114
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:17,960
folk music star

1115
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:19,740
on Alpha Centauri, Dave.

1116
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,100
God, if I could see it right now,

1117
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,040
I could be like the Woody Guthrie

1118
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:25,220
of Alpha Centauri.

1119
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:27,720
You'll be the only musician in the whole

1120
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:28,980
star system, Dave.

1121
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:31,780
Yeah, I'll be the only musician in the

1122
00:55:31,780 --> 00:55:33,840
whole star system. You'll be the only music

1123
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,680
fan in the whole star system.

1124
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,760
Yeah, and my head will be shaped like a

1125
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:39,780
gigantic fan, like one of

1126
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:41,740
those Komodo dragons, or what do they call

1127
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:43,640
them, monitor lizards, when they get mad.

1128
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,220
Man. Good, good.

1129
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:47,160
We've got him doing

1130
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:49,240
stream of consciousness again. That should

1131
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:51,040
keep him amused for

1132
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:52,600
a few more days.

1133
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:56,140
I wonder if they got

1134
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,560
hot like

1135
00:55:57,560 --> 00:55:59,620
earth-type beige on Alpha Centauri.

1136
00:56:01,620 --> 00:56:03,100
The suit is your

1137
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:04,420
girlfriend, Dave.

1138
00:56:05,560 --> 00:56:06,900
It's clamping down.

1139
00:56:07,140 --> 00:56:08,440
It's constricting.

1140
00:56:09,380 --> 00:56:10,660
It's tightening up.

1141
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:13,200
It's form

1142
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:14,220
fitting, isn't it?

1143
00:56:16,020 --> 00:56:17,980
I didn't know this suit could do this.

1144
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,720
What the heck is going on?

1145
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:26,460
Alright, that's enough.

1146
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,620
Turn off that function of the suit.

1147
00:56:28,740 --> 00:56:29,940
Now let's make him exercise.

1148
00:56:30,080 --> 00:56:31,720
Put the suit in exercise mode.

1149
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,320
There we go. He's plumping up

1150
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,180
and down. He's flopping.

1151
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,100
My knee joint's going on again.

1152
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:40,080
What the hell is this music?

1153
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,580
It's a good aerobicized music.

1154
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:44,980
We must keep our

1155
00:56:44,980 --> 00:56:46,500
astronauts in good shape.

1156
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,920
He's resisting calisthenics

1157
00:56:48,920 --> 00:56:50,980
and jumping jacks at this

1158
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:51,780
time of the morning.

1159
00:56:52,440 --> 00:56:54,760
It'll be five years of this if he's lucky.

1160
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,980
I mean, I can't do this for five years.

1161
00:56:57,040 --> 00:56:58,660
I can't do this for another minute longer.

1162
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:00,840
If he doesn't happen to hit one of the planets,

1163
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:03,660
if there are any, in the Alpha Centauri

1164
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:04,460
system, then he'll

1165
00:57:04,460 --> 00:57:06,960
just have to go on to the next star system

1166
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:09,080
20 years past

1167
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,980
that. But you'll

1168
00:57:10,980 --> 00:57:12,400
probably hit a planet.

1169
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:14,320
Or a moon.

1170
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,360
Or an asteroid.

1171
00:57:15,700 --> 00:57:18,160
Or something. Some body of rock

1172
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:19,240
floating around in space.

1173
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:22,060
Think of the

1174
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:24,320
romantic cartoon man

1175
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:26,200
on a desert island with nothing

1176
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,080
but one palm tree and a shark

1177
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:28,860
swimming around.

1178
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:32,400
That romantic fantasy will be yours.

1179
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:35,980
Only high-tech style, Dave.

1180
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,080
I'm a high-tech

1181
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:40,420
style romantic hero figure.

1182
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:42,920
Abandoned on a distant

1183
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,960
moon. Casting the spades

1184
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,760
like some piece of effluvio

1185
00:57:46,760 --> 00:57:47,660
on the sea.

1186
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:50,300
Someday I'll be home.

1187
00:57:50,900 --> 00:57:52,720
Someday I'll touch

1188
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,840
the shore. A distant shore

1189
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:55,280
somewhere.

1190
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:58,520
Much longer

1191
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,340
to wait. I'll get there

1192
00:58:00,340 --> 00:58:00,900
someday.

1193
00:58:03,560 --> 00:58:06,640
If you get bored, Dave, you can always

1194
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,620
just put a note in a bottle

1195
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:10,520
and send it out into the

1196
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,400
radio waves.

1197
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:13,420
Like you've just done

1198
00:58:13,420 --> 00:58:15,580
for the last two hours.

1199
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:21,560
This has been ESO Radio

1200
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:24,240
on WCSB Cleveland

1201
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:26,200

Ria Ardo. My name is Chaz,

1205
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:33,760
and I'll see you all next week.

1206
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:36,020
Yay for Chaz.

1207
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,020
He's the mix master.

1208
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,180
Oh, my gosh.

1209
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:43,500
He's the mix master.

1210
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,240

00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:38,280


1241
00:59:38,280 --> 00:59:38,360
...

1242
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:38,360


1243
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:38,360


1244
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:38,720
...

1245
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:38,780
...

1246
00:59:41,940 --> 00:59:42,380
...

1247
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:42,720
Welman,

1248
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:45,660
Dennis locked me in this little box.

1249
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:47,600
I can't feel anything.

1250
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:48,840
I can't see anything.

1251
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,280
It's totally black.

1252
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:52,620
I have no sensation in my hands.

1253
00:59:52,720 --> 00:59:54,340
I don't know if I'm moving or what.

1254
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,700
I'm just in this little box.

1255
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,320
He said I could talk to you.

1256
00:59:57,340 --> 00:59:58,520
He said you'd know what to do

1257
00:59:58,520 --> 01:00:00,160
if you wanted to help me.

1258
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:03,080
Oh, good, happy Peter Welman.

1259
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:06,180
I promise I'll pay you all the royalty

1260
01:00:06,180 --> 01:00:08,320
that I didn't tell you about.

1261
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:10,120
And whatever you want.

1262
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:10,740
I mean, anything.

1263
01:00:10,860 --> 01:00:11,280
...

1264
01:00:12,360 --> 01:00:13,620
Tevis, you can have Tevis.

1265
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,500
Just get me out of this box, Wellman.

1266
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:16,800
Please don't.

1267
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:17,060
No.

1268
01:00:17,340 --> 01:00:19,080
Don't believe what Paul told you.

1269
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:19,880
It's all a lie.

1270
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:20,800
It's all a lie.

1271
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,080
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.

1272
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:23,700
I'm sorry.

1273
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:25,060
I let you out of the box, Wellman.

1274
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:25,820
I can't.

1275
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:28,140
This is a bad show, Wellman.

1276
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,460
This is a real bad show.

1277
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,040
She lost her seat.

1278
01:00:41,280 --> 01:00:42,400
She lost her seat.
