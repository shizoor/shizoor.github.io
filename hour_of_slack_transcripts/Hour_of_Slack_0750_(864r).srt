52
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,380
All your money back, all of the religions will be having a heart attack

53
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,980
A pipe full of froth equals what?

54
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:27,180
A lot of slack, no matter how you kill it, he always keeps coming back

55
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,280
Bob, I'm talking about Dobbs

56
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,180
Repent, quit your job and slack off

57
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:35,240
Get ready to blast off when Ed Stain comes

58
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,200
And all the geeks are on the run from Bob

59
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,680
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

60
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:44,160
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

61
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,380
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

62
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,260
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

63
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,540
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

64
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,860
Pull the wool over your own eyes

65
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:00,240
Start to realize what till now has been disguised

66
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,560
Keep looking through the skies at the saucers flying by

67
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,360
And maybe by and by you will see the light at the end of the pipe that leads to Bob Dobbs

68
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,620
Bob Dobbs, talking about the salesman

69
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:11,020
To the gods, he's still a chap that coughed and bled

70
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:13,500
On a conspiracy of normality

71
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,620
Oh, who could it be but Bob?

72
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,700
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

73
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:29,780
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

74
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:35,300
Ahhh, I'm rails

00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:40,820

Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

77
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:41,320
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

78
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,980
Billy Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

79
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,420
Cracking into a Admiral

80
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:48,260
Bob, switch and you won't regret

81
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:48,360
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob

82
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:48,360


83
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,240
Grr

84
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:51,100
Now there is no difference between truth and lies

85
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,200
The rich became the beggar and the fool became the wise

86
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,880
Cause it's a way out, far out, psychedelic freak out

87
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,340
Took a hit of pop and I'm startin' to peak out

You wish you could forget

95
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,580
You wish you could forget

96
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,980
You wish you could forget

97
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,300
You wish you could forget

98
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,960
You wish you could forget about Bob

99
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,100
Everybody up here is so crazy about Bob

100
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,380
Everybody up here is so crazy about Bob.

101
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,740
Everybody up here is so crazy about Bob.

102
00:07:08,060 --> 00:07:10,040
Everybody up here is so crazy about Bob.

103
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,700
Ugh.

104
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,900
Oh, yeah.

105
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,220
You know what time it is.

106
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:21,800
All right, dude.

107
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,860
Well, time to rock, friends.

108
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,700
And the Bob rap were by this new guy, the great Neptune.

109
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:32,140
Yes, the great Neptune.

110
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,900
We're going to be playing tons more stuff by the great Neptune,

111
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,240
who is at www.neptune.itgo.com

112
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:45,680
or josephficus at yahoo.com, friends.

113
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:51,260
And we heard, well, this whole show is the show designed to drive you insane

114
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,780
and make you think somebody slipped you a Mickey.

115
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,740
Isn't that a pretty good meter?

116
00:07:55,780 --> 00:08:00,940
And so we also heard Pat Boone and Modemac driving you crazy.

117
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,120
And upcoming, friends.

118
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:04,420
J.R. Bob Dobbs himself.

119
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:11,840
And in the background, we hear MC Kevrock with time control.

120
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,280
Come on, Bob.

121
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,180
Come on in.

122
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,540
Come on in.

123
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,920
And the worst thing was that I got a little angel baby hair in my spaghetti.

124
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,760
That was the worst thing.

125
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,720
I hate angel baby hair in my spaghetti.

126
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,440
Once I get to my spaghetti, I start to get a little noodley, you know.

127
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,280
I hate that.

128
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,380
I hate to feel noodley.

129
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,740
You know, once you run around here along the sun,

130
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:24,820
you can't have a little too long.

131
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:27,080
You just get noodley, you know.

132
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,800
You start to hang out a little too long.

133
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,960
And it's noodley.

134
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:35,800
The noodle starts to noodle. That's a sad day.

135
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:40,100
I hate it when my little doodly-doodle starts to fart along.

136
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:44,360
So I try to rub things on it.

137
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,480
And little tiny toes.

138
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,800
Little baby toes all over the tent too.

139
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:51,260
There's one right up there, Bob.

140
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,840
Right up on the sleeve of the shirt of the jacket of the tent.

141
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,520
On the sleeve of the shirt of the tangly, fangly...

142
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:04,020
Okay, and now I want you to gently feel your neighbor's nipple to your left and to your right.

143
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,340
Bob?

144
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,900
I ain't got it any younger and I gotta settle down.

145
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,380
Find a wife and make a move to the white-bred part of town.

146
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,740
Get a job and work it for the man when they don't really appreciate you.

147
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,920
I'll shiny go watch in the bed on the back when your hard years of labor are through.

148
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,300
Don't want no babies.

149
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,260
Don't want no wife.

150
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,860
Don't want no nine to five.

151
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,460
I want a life.

152
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,760
Don't want no babies.

153
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,880
Don't want no wife.

154
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,340
Don't want no nine to five.

155
00:10:57,340 --> 00:10:57,500
Don't want no nine to five.

156
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,160
I want a life.

157
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,260
People say that I gotta know a place.

158
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,140
I ain't got it any younger and I gotta settle down.

159
00:11:12,520 --> 00:11:15,660
Find a wife and make me a move to the white-bred part of town.

160
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,080
Get a job and work it for the man when they don't really appreciate you.

161
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:24,260
I'll shiny go watch in the bed on the back when your hard years of labor are through.

162
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,700
And I don't want no babies.

163
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,720
Don't want no wife.

164
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,120
Don't want no nine to five.

165
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,000
I want a life.

166
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,200
Don't want no babies.

167
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,480
Don't want no wife.

168
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,880
Don't want no nine to five.

169
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,640
I want a life.

170
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,820
Cause I love to play music

171

Love to make money

172
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,200
Love to meet women

173
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,220
Is that so funny?

174
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,520
Love to play music

175
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,580

00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,840
Love to meet whereby

177
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,980
Is that so funny?

178
00:11:59,060 --> 00:11:59,340
No!

179
00:12:08,080 --> 00:12:11,120
People say I gotta grow up, I ain't getting any younger

180
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,240
And I gotta settle down

181
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,560

Get a job, working for the man

184
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,300
But they don't give a shit about you

185
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,700
I'll shiny go watch in the bed on the back

186
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,520
When your heart gets a labor of cruel

187
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,760
Well, don't want no babies

188
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,740
Don't want no wife

189
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,320
Don't want no nine to five

190
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,060
I want a life

191
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,400
Don't want no babies

192
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,460
Don't want no wife

193
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:39,920
Don't want no nine to five

194
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,700
I want a life

195
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,760
Cause I love to play music

196
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,120
Love to make money

197
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,220
Love to meet women

198
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:50,380
Is that so funny?

199
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,420
Love to play music

200
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:52,680
Love to make money

201
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:54,580
Love to make money

202
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:56,820
Love to meet women

203
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,820
Is that so funny?

204
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,300
No!

205
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Yeah!

206
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,080
Yeah!

207
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,360
Yeah!

208
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,180
Yeah!

209
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:52,700


210
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,660
Gillas does that for you

211
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:55,700
du ee

212
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:16,540
I'm evenly separated

213
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:16,540


214
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:22,660
There's still more to show

215
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:22,660


216
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:22,660


217
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:22,660


218
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:22,660


219
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:22,680
Do they think we're just ordinary people

220
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:22,680


221
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:22,680


222
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:22,680


223
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:22,680


224
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:22,680


225
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:22,680


226
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:22,680


227
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,620
Yeah!

228
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:32,500
can do to avert this grim fate. This economic depression is far too great for any of us

229
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:41,600
to overcome, and there is nothing left for America to do but suffer. All is lost. The

230
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:54,180
situation is hopeless. Yes, we as a nation are doomed. Doomed, doomed, doomed.

231
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,960
Next song.

232
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:04,540
Ah yes, it took a little while until we found something that was, how shall I say, more

233
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:06,600
spiritually enlightening.

234
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,460
To our, to our generation.

235
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,060
To our atmosphere of new reality.

236
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:23,140
Uh, I don't know the title for this song. Andrew, I'm sure, will write it down on the

237
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:26,180
tape afterwards. But here we go.

238
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:34,300
I, I, I fear.

239
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,460
Hello?

240
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:45,160
Boys and girls and snuggles.

241
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,280
The floppy bunny.

242
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,540
How you like my ears?

243
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,340
They're really floppy, huh?

244
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,860
And really fuzzy.

245
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,500
Ha ha ha.

246
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,700
The floppy crowd.

247
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,240
Everywhere.

248
00:16:07,780 --> 00:16:09,120
Oh look!

249
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,580
There's a thump.

250
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,400
Fuzzy bear.

251
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,500
Everybody be happy.

252
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,640
Or else.

253
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,540
Cotton candy and clowns.

254
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,300
Balloons flying in the sky.

255
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,640
Ha ha ha.

256
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,000
Ha ha ha.

257
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:41,580
Ha ha ha.

258
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:41,580


259
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,340
Everybody be happy.

260
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:49,640
Don t question how or why.

261
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,360
Happiness is gambitory.

262
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:02,380
Sadness is a sin .

263
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:07,420
Don't be ugly.

264
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:10,320
Be cute and snuggly.

265
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:11,020
Ha ha.

266
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:15,400
Be fuzzy, furries in love.

267
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:22,180
Fist is knuckles, you're coming down.

268
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,500
Real cuteness is what I want.

269
00:17:29,980 --> 00:17:34,600
Must be cute, don't be scary.

270
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:40,220
Gotta be furry, don't be hairy.

271
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,000
Happiness is mandatory.

272
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:52,660
No sad ending to the story.

273
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,720
Happiness is mandatory.

274
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,200
Do you feel cute?

275
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:10,920
Well, do you?

276
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:11,860
Do you feel punk?

277
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:19,660
Oh, look at my fluffy tail.

278
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,760
Oh, it's so fluffy and got me.

279
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,100
And everyone must be cute.

280
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,320
Everyone must be cute.

281
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,000
All cute people must be obeyed.

282
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:40,320
All uncute people must be destroyed.

283
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:48,300
The final solution to ugliness will be revealed by the cute.

284
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:49,360
Cute.

285
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,040
We must have big bright eyes.

286
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,560
We must all be cute.

287
00:18:55,680 --> 00:19:01,020
We must all look up in the sky and see the white fluffy clouds.

288
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:06,760
I'm cute.

289
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,420
You're cute.

290
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:11,860
We're all cute.

291
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:14,340
Hello, Bob.

292
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:19,320
This is Father Guido Sarducci, formerly Pope Maurice of the People's Catholic Church,

293
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,380
and all of my fellow popes from the People's Catholic Church.

294
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,380
Salute to the Church of the Sabbath Genius.

295
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,500
Carry on.

296
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:29,100
Hail Mary, Hail...

297
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:34,380

Hail Mary, Hail...

300
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,280
Hail Mary, Hail...

301

Hail Mary.

312
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:57,140
Hail Mary.

313
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,140


314
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:57,140


315
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,240


316
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:57,240


317
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:01,020
Hail Mary.

318
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,120
Hail Mary.

319
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,220
The Nerve

320
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,820
Nerve

321
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,120
Nerve

322
00:21:43,080 --> 00:21:44,480

323
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:44,500
Nerve

324
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:45,200

325
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,700
Nerve

326
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,460
Nerve

327
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,040
You don't deserve this phone abuse

328
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,840
So please just stay your wife

329
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,960
Work in a graveyard shift

330
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,140
Work in a graveyard shift

331
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,340
Work in a graveyard shift

332
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:30,400
Work in a graveyard shift

333
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,800
Work in a graveyard shift

334
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:52,320
From black to blue to white

335
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,400
I'm standing in white light

336
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,420
I have no clue to help me through

337
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,740
So please let's take the night

338
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,760
Work in a graveyard shift

339
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,380
Work in a graveyard shift

340
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:11,800
Work in a graveyard shift

341
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,060
Work in a graveyard shift

342
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:20,140
Work in a graveyard shift

343
00:23:41,780 --> 00:23:43,960
Work in a graveyard shift

344
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:43,960


345
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:43,960


346
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:43,960


347
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:47,000
More things in heaven and earth than in your books

348
00:23:55,860 --> 00:24:00,320
I was working the graveyard shift late one Sunday night

349
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:04,300
Making sure all the trains were running smooth and uptight

350
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:08,180
Keeping a close eye on the back beat and 409

351
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:12,080
Making sure the trains were running on time

352
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:15,300
Then I lucked off into the cold distance

353
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:16,520
And what did I see?

354
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,700
Looked like one solitary headlight coming after me

355
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:25,000
One solitary headlight with his eyes on me

356
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:25,760
Come and take me away

357
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,940
Come and take me away

358
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,100
Come and take me away

359
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,200
Come and take me away

360
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,240
Working a graveyard shift

361
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:47,360
Working a graveyard shift

362
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:51,480
Working a graveyard shift

363
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:55,560
Working a graveyard shift

364
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:33,260
Working a graveyard shift

365
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:37,320
Working a graveyard shift

366
00:25:37,320 --> 00:25:41,520
Working a graveyard shift

367
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:45,660
Working a graveyard shift

368
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:49,720
Working a graveyard shift

369
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:03,380
Is life too weird?

370
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:08,780
to be funny.

371
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:17,840
I won't think so.

372
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,700
Do you?

373
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,060
Do you?

374
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
Do you?

375
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,900
Do you?

376
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,220
Do you?

377
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:21,760
Do you?

378
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,540
Only you can save your soul.

379
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,580
You've got to get off the devil's payroll.

380
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:30,780
Get off the devil's payroll.

381
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,220
I stand before you a change man

382
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:53,380
Just the way the Lord had planned

383
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:55,980
Try as you can understand

384
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:59,320
If you get off the devil's payroll

385
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,700
Get off the devil's payroll

386
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:06,200
I hope you know these words ring true

387
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,360
The Lord he just has love for you

388
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,360
Let the spirit take you to

389
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,440
And you can get off the devil's payroll

390
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,820
Get off the devil's payroll

391
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,800
That's what mama said to me just

392
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:25,600
Trust the Lord he'll set you free

393
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:28,820
But only you can save your soul

394
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:31,920
You gotta get off the devil's payroll

395
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:32,680
Get off the devil's payroll

396
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:32,680


397
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,260
Get off the devil's payroll

398
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:38,460
Get off the devil's payroll

399
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:49,900
Heal to Bob

400
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:54,560
Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob

401
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,760
Bob is a rock

402
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,200
Bob is a tree

403
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,020
Bob is a bear

404
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:00,680
And Bob is a bee

405
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:02,660
Now this ain't all that deep

406
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:02,660


407
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:02,680
Well, do it, Godikat Godikat W BREATHES ALL OF THE B finans

408
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:02,680


409
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:02,680


410
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:02,680


411
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:07,320
And Bob is lies, Bob is cakes and fruits and pies.

412
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:13,980
Bob's my hassle, Bob's my watch, Bob's my sandwich, Bob's my crotch.

413
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:20,320
Bob's my toothpick, Bob's my brain, Bob's that ugly yellow stain.

414
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:26,960
Bob's a cactus, Bob's an itch, Bob is taking off every stitch.

415
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:33,620
Bob's my master, Bob's my slave, Bob will rob me, Bob will save.

416
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:40,060
Bob's my toaster, Bob's my fridge, Bob's my little sister Mitch.

417
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:46,840
Bob will cost you, Bob is free, Bob's the luck and Bob's the key.

418
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:53,320
In short, Bob Dobbs is the man who used your leg as a frying pan.

419
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:56,900
If your mind is a jar, you can pour down the same.

420
00:30:56,960 --> 00:31:00,380
Bob, Bob is Bob, Bob's church, Bob's the most thing Bob liked.

421
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,200
Jump, jump up and down for Bob!

422
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,380
Cause Bob is the future!

423
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:07,000
Woo!

424
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,860
Come on you lazy ass, drag off and don't jump!

425
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,500
Bob!

426
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:18,220
You can see the future, it surrounds you and it surrounds the imagery in the church.

427
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,320
Bob is the industrial information and quantum revolution.

428
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,100
Bob is the color of the future.

429
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,800
What color is the future?

430
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:30,880
Bob is the bright refraction of the quantum field around us.

431
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,780
It's because Bob has slack.

432
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:34,960
Slack is the quantum field!

433
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:39,380
And that's why I'm on my knees praying now.

434
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,400
Praying here before Bob.

435
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:44,080
Because I am Bob.

436
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:51,020
You know, and that's the odd thing is because, you know, I don't know if my mom was raped by a

437
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:56,520
parathletic, uh, man with blonde hair.

438
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,260
Who was delivering milk, pounding the milk.

439
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,360
Getting a little hard, but, you know, but there it was.

440
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,340
And I just came.

441
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,840
And I just came again.

442
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:08,760
And I just keep coming.

443
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:13,040
I can't help, I can't help but come here, you know.

444
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,260
It's a special thing.

445
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:15,580
Hallelujah brother!

446
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,680
And Bob is going to lead us into the future.

447
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,380
Bob is going to be the next revolution.

448
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:25,200
Bob is going to be the nanotech revolution, the quantum revolution, the spiritual revolution!

449
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,020
Ah!

450
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:27,380
Ah!

451
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:28,720
Ah!

452
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:29,640
Ah!

453
00:32:29,700 --> 00:32:30,220
Woo!

454
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,060
All right, yeah.

455
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:38,500
All these dot coms that you see, there's only one dot com that matters.

456
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:44,240
And that is www.subgenius.com!

457
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:45,240
Woo!

458
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,320
So what does this all have to do with you?

459
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:52,760
Well, you guys, you're yetis.

460
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,920
You are the future.

461
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,620
You have to use that quantum field for your future.

462
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:59,560
You guys have to make the apocalypse happen.

463
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,420
The more you're yourself, the faster the apocalypse will come.

464
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:04,740
Ah!

465
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:05,660
Ah!

466
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:05,880
Ah!

467
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:06,480
Ah!

468
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:06,700
Ah!

469
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:06,760
Ah!

470
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:06,980
Ah!

471
00:33:06,980 --> 00:33:07,200
Ah!

472
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,200


473
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:07,480
Ah!

474
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:07,820
Ah!

475
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:07,980
Ah!

476
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:08,040
Ah!

477
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:08,120
Ah!

478
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,120


479
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,120


480
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,480
Ah!

481
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,480


482
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:08,480


483
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:09,480
Ah!

484
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,560
Ah!

485
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,040
Well, right!

486
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:21,700
Right!

487
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,440
Orhhh!?

488
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,640
Just like that?

489
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:44,680
Okay.

490
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:44,720
Okay.

491
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:50,080
Okay, have a nice holiday.

492
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:50,540
Please…

493
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:55,540
Dreams of war, dreams of liars, dreams of dragon's fire and the things that would bite.

494
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:03,920
Sleep with one eye open, gripping your pillow tight.

495
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,580
Exit light, enter night.

496
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:17,600
Rain of sand, we're off to Never Never Land.

497
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:23,520
Hi, this is Pat Paulson. I'd like to endorse Bob as my running mate in this year's election.

498
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:25,400
Bob's a lot of, well, he's not fun.

499
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:28,420
But anyway, this is the Hour of Slack in Dallas, Texas.

500
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:32,760
One of my shoes got cow stuff on them.

501
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,180
It's the way conspiracy works, friends.

502
00:34:38,620 --> 00:34:43,260
Conspiracy creeps into every human endeavor by nature of humanity.

503
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:47,580
That's why we just tried to say, well, screw you.

504
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:49,600
We're humans. We're subgeniuses. We're different.

505
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:59,460
Subgenius can be any age, any size, shape, color, from any background, any nationality, any damn planet or species.

506
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:06,500
We don't care as long as they have the fragment of Bob consciousness

507
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:11,040
and have sent $30 to P.O. Box 1436 Dallas, Texas, and my P.O.

508
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Oh, yes, friends.

509
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,560
You can be saved even if it...

510
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:18,240
kills you.

511
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,520
And that's how much Bob loves you, friends.

512
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:24,020
He will kill you to save you.

513
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:26,960
Because, you know, once you're saved and Bob, you never really die.

514
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:32,640
You know, it's, you know, there's an old saying, what Bob offers, his most famous discovery.

515
00:35:33,120 --> 00:35:38,500
Eternal salvation or triple your money back.

516
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,980
What other words it offers that, friends?

517
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:46,720
If you don't live forever, you get your money back.

518
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:55,500
A perfect, perfect formula for belief and love and, uh, slack.

519
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,500
Or slack, whatever that is.

520
00:35:59,860 --> 00:36:02,400
Slack for me would be to shut up for a minute.

521
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,600
It's been a long day.

522
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:10,060
Someday the exes will come.

523
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:13,200
Bob's promise will come true.

524
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:16,760
Our alien benefactors will give us our own planets.

525
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,140
And we will be able to create the 25-hour day.

526
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:23,180
The 26-hour day.

527
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:25,140
The Martian pineslip.

528
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,040
The day that lasts forever.

529
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,220
The night that never ends, dear friends.

530
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:37,000
The night that smells like cinnamon for three days and then it smells like, uh, epoxy the next three days.

531
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,440
Any planet you want.

532
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:44,900
The most bizarre, outlandish things you can imagine could come physically, literally true.

533
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:48,600
You better hope you have a pure mind when that happens.

534
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:57,040
You better hope that you aren't thinking real paranoid bad thoughts in the back of your mind at the moment when every wish then come true.

535
00:36:57,320 --> 00:37:00,600
You better hope that you really have some good wishes in your head.

536
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:07,640
And so you can't be constantly thinking about how you're gonna get back at that conspiracy bastard or so forth.

537
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,380
Friends, you gotta just learn to rise above it.

538
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:14,480
Time control is what Bob has been preaching all along.

539
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:25,280
And unfortunately, until we get the time machines working, the only true form of time control available to us is that boring virtue called patience.

540
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,880
And that's why you need to remember about the funny little monkeys.

541
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:34,120
Because otherwise, it's so easy to lose patience with them.

542
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:43,980
And God knows, only Bob stands between most of us and us becoming mad serial killers, machine gunning,

543
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:44,880
entire lives.

544
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,320
And we're gonna have to get our perfect dongs full of pink boys out of their smugness.

545
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,880
Kneel down.

546
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:16,980
You ain't what you're not.

547
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,900
So you see what you got.

548
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,940
You are what you is.

549
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,840
And that's all it is.

550
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:37,980
A foolish young man from a middle class family started singing the blues cause he thought it was manly.

551
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,280
Now he talk like a kingfish.

552
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,920
From a Amos and Andy.

553
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:44,880
And I'm gonna have to get my ass kicked.

554
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:45,540
Holy pockiness.

555
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,020
He tell you that chin lens.

556
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,800
Well, they taste just like candy.

557
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:55,580
He thinks that he's got the whole thing down.

558
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:01,540
From the Nibbley Ocean to the Royal Crown.

559
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,560
Do you know what you are?

560
00:39:05,980 --> 00:39:07,580
You are what you is.

561
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:10,540
You is what you am.

562
00:39:11,700 --> 00:39:13,560
A cow don't make ham.

563
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,400
You ain't what you're not.

564
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:19,280
So you see what you got.

565
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:22,440
You are what you is.

566
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,220
And that's all it is.

567
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,580
A foolish young man of the Negro persuasion.

568
00:39:31,580 --> 00:39:31,980
Persuasion?

569
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,300
Did he say persuasions?

570
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:37,720
Devoted his life to become a Caucasian.

571
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,300
He stopped eating pork.

572
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:43,160
He stopped eating greens.

573
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,340
He traded his dashi again.

574
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,140
For some Jordache jeans.

575
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,100
He learned to play golf.

576
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,040
And he got a good score.

577
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,800
Now he said to himself.

578
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,860
I ain't no nigger no more.

579
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,580
Chika boom, chika boom.

580
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,460
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

581
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,840
I don't understand you, Boama Macumba.

582
00:40:10,580 --> 00:40:13,880
Would you speak a little clearly, Mercedes Benz?

583
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,440
Mercedes Benz, hey.

584
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:17,100
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

585
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,500
That's your mama, baby.

586
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,020
Who is who?

587
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:23,900
I don't know.

588
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:24,940
And what is what?

589
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,900
Something I just got to know.

590
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,060
And why is this?

591
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,860
Somebody tell me now.

592
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,140
Appropriate.

593
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:33,300
That's a funny pronunciation if I ever don't like.

594
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,180
But you don't like.

595
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:36,180
Where did you get that word?

596
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:37,160
But you have got.

597
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,120
You have got.

598
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,360
I spend my days.

599
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:41,920
Driving in the dirt, yeah.

600
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:43,200
And letting it rot.

601
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,860
I can smell it now.

602
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:46,500
Someone else.

603
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,420
Here they come, here they come, here they come.

604
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,220
The Shirley car.

605
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,820
I told you they were coming.

606
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,420
To pick it up.

607
00:40:52,420 --> 00:40:53,620
To pick it up, yeah.

608
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:55,320
Because he wants some.

609
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:56,860
And she wanted for free.

610
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:58,420
And when one day.

611
00:40:58,440 --> 00:40:59,760
And then one day.

612
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,260
You wonder who.

613
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,720
You wonder who.

614
00:41:03,160 --> 00:41:04,180
You used to was.

615
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,180
Who was it anyway.

616
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,120
And what you do.

617
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:09,120
I used to work at the post office.

618
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,260
You scratch your head.

619
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,800
I scratch my head.

620
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,040
And look around.

621
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,180
I don't want to, I don't want to do that.

622
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:16,180
But what you lost.

623
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:17,600
Just so you see.

624
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,160
Will not be found.

625
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,060
It just can't be found.

626
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,120
Do you know what you are?

627
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:23,540
I'm gonna buy me a Mercedes.

628
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,080
You are what you get.

629
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,040
I need a big red one now.

630
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,140
Here is what you have.

631
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:29,960
An Avalon 450 SLC.

632
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,100
It can't make hair.

633
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,520
Oh yeah.

634
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:33,920
You ain't what you know.

635
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,900
Some dark club sticking out of the truck.

636
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,000
So you see what you got.

637
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:39,200
I don't want down till it rakes my head.

638
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:39,920
You are what you live.

639
00:41:39,960 --> 00:41:41,620
Do you want to see my grime?

640
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:41,780
I'm not gonna give you my grime.

641
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:41,780


642
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:41,780


643
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:43,040
You are what you live.

644
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:43,860
I'm high.

645
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:44,780
You are beautiful.

646
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,960
You are what you live.

647
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,900
This is some lumpy gravy you make here.

648
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:48,760
And that's all it is.

649
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:50,660
I look like a man to bongo.

650
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,080
You are what you live.

651
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,040
And your mama.

652
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,740
And that's all it is.

653
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:56,860
Give me a car with a head.

654
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:57,900
You are what you live.

655
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:58,840
I'm a boxer.

656
00:41:58,940 --> 00:41:59,480
I'm sure of that.

657
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:00,680
And that's all it is.

658
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:02,820
I don't need no pancakes with my head.

659
00:42:02,860 --> 00:42:03,920
You are what you live.

660
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,980
I know a fat old policeman.

661
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,840
He's always on our street.

662
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:19,260
A fat and jolly red-faced man he really is a treat.

663
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,220
He's dont quite born a policeman.

664
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:26,720
He's never known ast ground and everybody says he is the happiest man in town.

665
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:30,480
Hahahaha!!

666
00:42:32,120 --> 00:42:32,720
Hehehehehe!

667
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:33,960
Hahahaha!!

668
00:42:36,340 --> 00:42:36,940
Hehehehehe!!

669
00:42:36,940 --> 00:42:37,620
Hahahaha!!

670
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:38,760
Hahahaha!!

671
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:38,760


672
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,080
Hehehehehehe!!

673
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:40,520
Hahahaha!!

674
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:41,300
A overall in the うдщ joke of what can happen.

675
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:41,300


676
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:41,300


677
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:41,400
Finding a good seat to sit in.

678
00:42:48,520 --> 00:42:50,740
He laughs upon pointy feet

679
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,440
He laughs upon his feet

680
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:56,140
He laughs at everybody when he's walking in the street

681
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:58,180
He never can stop laughing

682
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,780
He says he's never tried

683
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:03,780
But once he did arrest a man and laughed until he cried

684
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,920
His jolly face it wrinkled

685
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:29,660
And then he shut his eyes

686
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:31,540
He opened his great mouth

687
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,360
It was a wondrous sight

688
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:33,760
He laughed at everybody when he's walking in the street

689
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,380
He said I must arrest you

690
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,020
He didn't know what for

691
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,040
And then he started laughing

692
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:40,960
Until he dragged his jaw

693
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,680
So if you chance to meet him

694
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:07,380
When walking round the town

695
00:44:07,380 --> 00:44:09,740
Just shake him by his fat old hand

696
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:11,160
And give him half a crown

697
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,180
His eyes will beam and sparkle

698
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:14,780
He'll gurgle with delight

699
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:17,000
And then you'll start him laughing

700
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,000
With all his blessed mind

701
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,920
Ha ha ha ha ha

702
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,840
Ha ha ha ha ha

703
00:44:25,840 --> 00:44:27,080
Ha ha ha ha ha

704
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,380
Ha ha ha ha ha

705
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:30,460
Ha ha ha ha ha

706
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:31,820
Ha ha ha ha ha

707
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,200
Ha ha ha ha ha

708
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,520
Ha ha ha ha ha

709
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:45,740
Ha ha ha ha ha

710
00:44:45,740 --> 00:44:46,180
Ha ha ha ha ha

711
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:46,320
Ha ha ha ha ha

712
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:46,320


713
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:46,380
Ha ha ha ha ha

714
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:46,580
Haha

715
00:44:46,580 --> 00:44:46,980
He lit my ear

716
00:44:46,980 --> 00:44:48,220
He wet his fingers

717
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:48,220


718
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:53,200
Ha ha ha ha ha

719
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:54,620
Ha ha ha ha ha

720
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,000
Ha ha ha ha ha

721
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,460
Ha ha ha ha ha

722
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:57,660
Ha ha ha ha ha

723
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:58,820
Ha ha ha

724
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:00,620
He wet PAW

725
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,200
He wet his fingers

726
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:01,800
Ha ha ha ha

727
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:01,800


728
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:06,000
Oh, you're just going to make me stare it out and think about love.

729
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:13,680
And you know what the bad thing about, the bad thing is about love is it's a subgenius love.

730
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,780
And you know what a subgenius love is?

731
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:19,580
Fire and burning and death.

732
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:20,740
Large holes.

733
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:24,580
Yeah, there's just not enough large holes, you know.

734
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:32,100
I really tried to make large holes with my potato cannons, but they just didn't quite reach.

735
00:45:32,420 --> 00:45:34,980
You know, I pounded and pounded.

736
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:36,480
I pounded.

737
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:40,860
I've got a doodle in my noodle and his name is Minky Boodle.

738
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:41,980
Minky Boodle.

739
00:45:41,980 --> 00:45:42,580
Minky Boodle.

740
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,020
Minky Boodle.

741
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:45,000
Minky Boodle.

742
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:46,560
I got my mojo rising.

743
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:48,380
There's a poodle in my strudel.

744
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:49,300
Minky Boodle.

745
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:50,440
Minky Boodle.

746
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,260
Minky Boodle.

747
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,400
Minky Boodle.

748
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:54,060
Cruddle doodle.

749
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:54,460
Goodle.

750
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,020
Poodle, poodle, poodle, zoodle.

751
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,400
I'm sick of this.

752
00:45:57,500 --> 00:45:58,280
Minky Boodle.

753
00:45:58,540 --> 00:45:59,680
Shut up, Brack.

754
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:00,140
No.

755
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,180
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

756
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,020
I got a doodle in my noodle and his name is Minky Boodle.

757
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,820
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

758
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:07,480
Be beautiful.

759
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:11,220
Stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it, stop it.

760
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:13,200
Crazin'.

761
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:13,880
Aw, Bob.

762
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:14,580
Yeah.

763
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:23,900
Get up, everything.

764
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:27,460
Work my life away

765
00:46:28,980 --> 00:46:31,180
I break my back

766
00:46:32,060 --> 00:46:34,220
I never get any slack

767
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,960
When next day comes

768
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,360
All you peeps better run

769
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,020
Cause the excess

770
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:47,300
Might blow up the sun

771
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,400
If life was what it used to be

772
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:01,140
Fuck them and they can't take a joke

773
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:05,080
A ton of particles

774
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:08,760
Oppenheimer's split

775
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,020
And as for Bob

776
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:15,600
Yeah, he cut the shit

777
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,880
When next day comes

778
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,460
All you peeps better run

779
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:24,380
Cause the excess

780
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,320
Might blow up the sun

781
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:42,360
If life was what it used to be

782
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:49,120
Fuck them and they can't take a joke

783
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:53,460
Bob's a rocker

784
00:47:53,460 --> 00:47:54,380
Fuck them and they can't take a joke

785
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:56,620
If life's just a rocker

786
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,440
You just can't believe everything you believe

787
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,380
You just can't believe it at all

788
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,280
You just can't believe everything you believe

789
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,320
You just can't believe it at all

790
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,740
You just can't believe it at all

791
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:18,100
You just can't believe it at all

792
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:34,220
Oh, yes, Bob's Your Uncle by the Reverend LeChuck, delivered to alt-binary slack in mp3.form.

793
00:48:34,380 --> 00:48:40,600
Before that, we heard Space Ghost with Minky Boodle and You Are What You Is.

794
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:47,420
That was The Persuasions doing Zappa from their album, Frankly Acapella.

795
00:48:47,420 --> 00:48:59,360
And before that, we heard some preaching from the Puffer Dome at Starwood 2000 with Einstein's Secret Orchestra and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

796
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,220
Friends, this is the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

797
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:06,540
And if you want more information about Bob, you just write to this post office box I'm about to give.

798
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:07,860
I'm giving it right now. Here it comes.

799
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:16,820
P.O. Box 14306, Dallas, Texas 7521.

800
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:27,580
Once again, that's Bob at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214.

801
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:32,660
And we've got some special Brother Cleve remastered hymnification coming right up.

802
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:36,700
So stay tuned to www.subgenius.com.

803
00:49:37,380 --> 00:49:41,340
This is Ego Plum with EbolaMusic.com in the background.

804
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:15,920
Ego Plum.

805
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:45,540
Ego Plum.

806
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:47,400
Ego Plum.

807
00:50:50,420 --> 00:50:53,220
Ego Plum.

808
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,640
Ego Plum.

809
00:51:25,820 --> 00:51:27,620
Ego Plum.

810
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,980
Ego Plum.

811
00:51:48,860 --> 00:51:51,700
I know he can make it

812
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,560
Without him we can't take it

813
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:57,800
We'll lose the pieces of our minds

814
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,660
To the pink boys and the whims

815
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,740
Until the day that he comes back

816
00:52:04,740 --> 00:52:08,320
It'll be a world without slack

817
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:10,320
Mom's a boy, oh

818
00:52:10,320 --> 00:52:13,720
And he's coming again

819
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,920
Bob is my lord

820
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:22,000
Bob is my lord

821
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,500
Bob is my lord

822
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:25,620
Bob is my lord

823
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:28,980
And he's coming again

824
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:32,980
If we don't want the answers upon us

825
00:52:32,980 --> 00:52:36,200
Then we need Bob to be honest

826
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:38,260
Bob is my lord

827
00:52:38,260 --> 00:52:42,080
Bob is my lord

828
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:43,180
Bob is my lord

829
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:43,700
Bob is my lord

830
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,960
Bob is my lord

831
00:52:47,020 --> 00:52:48,760
And he's coming again

832
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,320
Great God, he's coming for me right now

833
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:56,180
Again

834
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:01,280
Wow.

835
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,300
Great Pope Bob.

836
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:08,200
This is an epistle from the Reverend David Lee Black.

837
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,680
Reverend Stank, you'll be the...

838
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:10,160
I don't believe this.

839
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:12,200
Read the first and last paragraph.

840
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:13,500
Dear fellow sub-geni,

841
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:17,480
The evil forces of anti-slack that prevent me from going to America

842
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:23,340
Are the very same ones that prevent me from being with my brothers and sisters of slack on X-Day in Brushwood.

843
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:24,400
Subsequently,

844
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:26,860
I think he meant consequently.

845
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:29,120
Subsequently,

846
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:34,240
I must have my own X-Day in Kiel, Germany with my brothers and sisters of slack here.

847
00:53:34,320 --> 00:53:36,200
There's nothing, I mean nothing,

848
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:39,920
That will stop me from getting on board the intergalactic love ships

849
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:42,880
On Wednesday, the 5th of July.

850
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,800
And being with the rest of you.

851
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:50,880
Not the DEA, not Janet Cujo-Reno, not Bill Clinton and his hordes of concubines.

852
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:56,740
Not customs, not even Mulder and Scully and the reanimated corpse of J. Edgar Hoover could

853
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:01,960
stop me when that platform lowers, the red carpet rolls out, and I'm carried on board

854
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:07,860
in a throne like an African chieftain by my leather-clad alien love slaves of the cosmos.

855
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:13,340
I had a dream the other night, which makes me believe this year it is.

856
00:54:13,340 --> 00:54:13,480
This is the day.

857
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:13,820
The year.

858
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:18,700
One of the love goddesses came to me in a dream like a space cherub loved succubus.

859
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:24,760
She floated through the air and revealed to me a divine revelation, which I make known to you now.

860
00:54:24,900 --> 00:54:29,380
On her right leg and left leg there were ten holes, and a piece in the middle, there were three.

861
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:31,380
And in the middle there were three holes.

862
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:34,900
She could suckle twenty-three.

863
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:35,640
Twenty.

864
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:39,680
Which is the number of the Illuminator.

865
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,040
She took my hand and we floated up to the heavens.

866
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:47,000
The pills are kicking in about this part in the epiphany.

867
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,100
A Barmageddon.

868
00:54:48,140 --> 00:54:54,440
And anyway, he foresees a battle of Barmageddon where the demonic forces which you guys were

869
00:54:54,440 --> 00:55:00,380
talking about which have enslaved the human race with the yoke of bad television and have

870
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:06,980
sold them sportswear, media-induced self-consciousness, landmines, and cheap adrenaline-producing

871
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:13,020
drugs to then herd their unwitting victims into soccer stadiums and then send them to

872
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:20,860
pop-star concert halls only to farm their pain and misery to feed its insatiable appetite

873
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:27,080
for hurt and suffering have finally realized that the exes know about their evil intentions

874
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:31,820
to make hostile bids for benign alien space corporations only to peddle their superficial

875
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:41,200
cheapness, Hollywood black magic, and sow space minds so they can create a hell in space.

876
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:47,880
The Intergalactic Federation of Alien Races, which currently live in peace and harmony,

877
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:53,780
will not tolerate their Universal Garden of Eden to be invaded by the evil monkey-snake

878
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:54,580
god of Earth.

879
00:55:54,720 --> 00:56:00,840
The evil demon-monkey-snake god who will replace all the stars with poison apples and sell

880
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:04,600
fig leaves to the goddesses who have 23 holes.

881
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,620
This is so black I'll write it.

882
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:12,420
As I looked down into Earth, I saw the saucers hovering over Brushwood, Lemuria, and Kiel.

883
00:56:12,560 --> 00:56:12,800
Yeah!

884
00:56:12,860 --> 00:56:13,000
I'm so glad you're here.

885
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:13,000


886
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:17,220
I saw smaller craft hovering over several other locations where subgenius ministers

887
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:21,480
who are rich in slack but poor in human money supposedly reside.

888
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:26,960
I could see the masses of the illuminated with their suitcases of cool boarding the

889
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,600
saucers of love, hope, and happiness.

890
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:33,140
As they did, the armies of Earth scrambled to destroy the invading love ships of the

891
00:56:33,140 --> 00:56:35,220
sex goddesses, the very threat to their existence.

892
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,600
Then it was the great and final war.

893
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:42,240
As the last space saucer, sex space saucer, lifted high into the heavens.

894
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:43,760
The great war began.

895
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,700
The navies and air armadas with their rapid response forces scrambling to attack.

896
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,940
I could hear the sirens of war around the planet wailing, heralding the inescapably

897
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:57,260
impending doom that awaited citizens of this sinking battleship of hate, war, and misery.

898
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:02,300
But the great armies of Earth didn't battle with the star cruisers of the love goddesses.

899
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,160
They battled with themselves.

900
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:09,880
They battled with each other for the right to battle with the invading saucers of slack.

901
00:57:10,380 --> 00:57:12,220
Hovering up over the planet as it burned.

902
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:13,000
I was so glad.

903
00:57:13,020 --> 00:57:19,240
I could hear the screams of billions of human souls who weren't lucky enough to get off

904
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:20,560
this planet with the chosen ones.

905
00:57:20,660 --> 00:57:25,840
The alien sex goddesses took my hand again and floated with me back down to Earth, to

906
00:57:25,840 --> 00:57:29,120
my bed, back to my alcoholic narcosa.

907
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,420
And so I awakened with this revelation I now give.

908
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:40,680
And with this revelation I also send the symbolic other half in the form of a cake.

909
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:43,000
I want Stang to have everyone laugh.

910
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:43,000


911
00:57:43,020 --> 00:57:48,860
I want the lineup for this cake to be ritualistically served as communion of slack for all at Exday

912
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:49,560
in Brushwood.

913
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:53,900
Make sure Nikki Death Chick gets a big piece.

914
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:58,980
I want a lion's share of the ass whopping next time I see her.

915
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,580
How many minutes was purchase in adultery?

916
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:21,580


917
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:29,420
How many times have you been intentional sit box with your nose.

918
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:31,640
Make out, pipette?

919
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:31,640


920
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:31,640


921
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:31,640


922
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:31,640


923
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:31,640


924
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:31,640


925
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:31,640


926
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:31,640


927
00:58:31,640 --> 00:58:31,740
Do us a favor and join me.

928
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:33,340
Our plans inよ minuti...

929
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:43,500
I'm sorry.

930
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:14,560
I'm sorry.

931
01:00:00,420 --> 01:00:03,220
I'm sorry.

932
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:33,320
I'm sorry.

933
01:00:33,340 --> 01:00:37,540
If we just get a grip on our man-to-hand relationship

934
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:42,160
Come to terms with truly how we feel

935
01:00:44,760 --> 01:00:47,780
If we put our heads together

936
01:00:47,780 --> 01:00:52,220
We'd just stay home forever, dear penis

937
01:00:52,220 --> 01:00:55,360
I beg I like you after all

938
01:00:56,980 --> 01:01:01,980
Oh, and Rodney, while you're shaving, shave my balls

939
01:01:03,340 --> 01:01:07,420
Oh, and Rodney, while you're shaving, shave my balls
