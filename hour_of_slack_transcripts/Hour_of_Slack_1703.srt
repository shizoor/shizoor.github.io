00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
Advice to younger subgenii.

2
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:11,820
If you should be unfortunately lucky enough to meet Bob and talk to Bob,

3
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,140
never ask the question, why?

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:25,400
The hills are alive with the sound of the subgenius.

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,700
Power of splash.

6
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:31,640
We're space cadets and we are proud to say

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:32,700
Bob?

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:36,260
The indisputable leader of the gang.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,540
He's the boss, he's the VIP, he's the championship.

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,560
He's the most tip-top.

11
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:42,600
Bob?

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:42,960
Cap.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,060
It's not a crutch, Dad.

14
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:49,380
It's something I've come to rely on to help me through life.

15
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:53,180
They should all drown in lakes of blood.

16
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,480
Now they will know why they are afraid of the dark.

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,480
Now they will learn why they fear the night.

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,060
Friends, I want to hear a praise Bob!

19
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:06,760
I want to hear a praise Bob damn Bob!

20
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,420
I want to hear a damn praise God Bob!

21
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,940
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

22
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,300
What are you? What are you?

23
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:24,280
He will not reveal his identity, so for today we're calling him Bob.

24
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,360
It's what we call Bob.

25
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:49,900
Why isn't Bob, Bob, Bob?

26
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,140


27
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:50,460
What?

28
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,240
Why don't you tell him Bob?

29
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,000
Cause does Bob Al最爱你 Right now buddy my died boy!

30
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000


31
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000


32
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000


33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000


34
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000


35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000


36
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000


37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000


38
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,000


39
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:56,060
Raj, everything is on the table!

40
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,060


41
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,060


42
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:56,240
He ain't got Tillie!

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,220
No I ain't!

44
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:18,680
is it? No really, what time is it? Does anybody know what time it is? 1230? 1230? Is it 1230?

45
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:30,060
Is it 1230? Well I disagree. I don't believe it's 1230. When everyone knows that it's not

46
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:44,460
1230, it's the end times. That's right brothers and sisters, it's the end times and we at

47
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,660
the Church of the Subgenius are here to give you a message. A message which may even be

48
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:56,840
save your lives. I'd like to tell you a little story about a man who joined the Church of

49
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:03,320
the Subgenius a few years ago. I'm not going to name any names. When he first started out

50
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:07,880
he was kind of an outcast. Nobody really wanted anything to do with him. They all thought

51
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:14,020
he was a weirdo or a freak. People wouldn't talk to him. He could be the last man in the

52
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:17,500
bar at 2am and he still could never get any pussy.

53
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,320
Well one day he found a Subgenius pamphlet laying down on the ground and he read it and

54
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:31,180
he said, wow, you know these people are just like me. These people are outcasts just like

55
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:37,200
me. So he wrote into the address and he bought himself a membership in the Church of the

56
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:43,600
Subgenius. Pardon me a minute. I hear you all talking in the back. Yeah keep talking.

57
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:48,640
I can hear you back there. You won't be talking after July 5th, 1998, do you? Well, I'm going

58
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:48,640


59
00:03:48,660 --> 00:04:00,220
though you'll be screaming in fucking pain well as i was saying this this poor pathetic little

60
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:06,480
loser he he couldn't do nothing right but he went out and he sent his money into the church

61
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,640
of subgenius and he got himself a membership became an ordained preacher for bob

62
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,140
he went and bought himself some bob t-shirts and wore them until they rotted off his back

63
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:25,320
he bought all the subgenius books and memorized them cover to cover you could ask him what's on

64
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:32,360
page 369 of revelation x and he'd say there is no page 369 of revelation x you could say what's

65
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:37,980
on page 69 of the book of the subgenius and he would tell you what's on page 69 of the book

66
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:42,620
of the subgenius word for word in other words he would tell you what's on page 69 of the book

67
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,840
He was a sickening bobby.

68
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:47,440
He got to meet all the other subgeniuses,

69
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,540
but since he kept blabbing on and on and on

70
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:53,360
about all this meaningless bob shit

71
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:55,120
without ever catching on to the truth,

72
00:04:56,140 --> 00:04:57,600
he just irritated them,

73
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,020
and the outcasts cast him out.

74
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,040
And he still didn't ever get any pussy.

75
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,320
Well, eventually, the subgeniuses,

76
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,080
they just didn't want to hang around with him anymore,

77
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,700
and nobody else wanted to hang around with him either

78
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,140
because he was still a pathetic loser.

79
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,700
And finally, his parents didn't want anything to do with him,

80
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,240
and they threw him out of his basement where he was living.

81
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,060
And he didn't have a job or anything,

82
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:28,040
so he just ended up becoming a drunk

83
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,580
and sleeping out in the gutters.

84
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,340
You know, he was cuddling up in the cardboard boxes

85
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,480
back in the alleys, dumpster diving and all this.

86
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:38,240
And one day, a group of people came up,

87
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,940
and they told him,

88
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,480
they told him about Jesus.

89
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,160
That's right, they told him about Jesus.

90
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:47,540
And they took him, and they gave him a job,

91
00:05:47,740 --> 00:05:49,600
and they gave him a place to stay,

92
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:54,740
and they introduced him to a nice Christian girl.

93
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,820
And he thought that everything was pretty good.

94
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:00,920
You know, he ended up getting married,

95
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,040
having some kids, a house with a white picket fence

96
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,040
and a dog in the yard.

97
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,980
He hated the church of the subgenius.

98
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,140
He felt that he'd been shafted by them.

99
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:16,380
He felt that the devil had come into his life

100
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,720
and tried to steer him down this false path.

101
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,620
He hated the church of the subgenius.

102
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,920
He hated the subgenius mythology.

103
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,260
He hated the belief system.

104
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,660
He hated Bob.

105
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,680
He hated Bob.

106
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,100
I know, most of you can't imagine

107
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:36,240
what it would be like to hate Bob, maybe.

108
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,860
He hated Bob.

109
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:39,540
He denied.

110
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,480
He denied that there would be an exist invasion

111
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,980
on July 5th, 1998 at 7 a.m.

112
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,900
He cursed Reverend Stang.

113
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,760
He denied Dr. Lagune three times in one day.

114
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,800
He spit on Jaina Hypercletes.

115
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,320
But then who has him?

116
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:04,880
What, brothers and sisters, will happen to this heretic

117
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,480
on July 5th, 1998?

118
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,280
Would anyone like to take a guess

119
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,460
what's gonna happen to this heretic

120
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:12,480
when the saucers come?

121
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:19,240
He will be on the escape vessels on July 5th, 1998.

122
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,760
He will be on those saucers with the sex goddesses

123
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:27,360
because he paid his $30 subgenius membership fee.

124
00:07:27,660 --> 00:07:30,160
He had his membership card in the church.

125
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,900
And even if you were to go out today

126
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,120
and turn your back on Bob,

127
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,480
did you ever heard any of this?

128
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,980
Even if you were to go out tomorrow

129
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,460
and turn your back on Bob, did you ever heard any of this?

130
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,900
And get a job, maybe even as president

131
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,020
of the United States or a cop somewhere

132
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,040
ripping apart people's cars searching for dope,

133
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,480
you would still be able to get on the pleasure saucers

134
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,220
as long as you had that subgenius membership card,

135
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,820
as long as you paid for that subgenius membership card.

136
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,120
Can you say the same?

137
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,720
Can you say that you're gonna be

138
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,960
on those escape vessels on July 5th?

139
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,900
Do you think you're gonna squeak by

140
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:04,460
just because you're cool?

141
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:08,020
Do you think coolness is gonna get you

142
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,200
onto those space vessels?

143
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:13,140
Well, what are you gonna do on X day

144
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:18,040
when suddenly all your paid in full subgenius buddies

145
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:19,860
disappear?

146
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,740
Many people would say, well, I'm not gonna join up

147
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,160
with the Church of the Subgenius.

148
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,100
The Church of the Subgenius is an organization

149
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,260
of non-joiners, so I'm not gonna join.

150
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:34,440
I'm not gonna join.

151
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:36,480
Well, I got a surprise for you folks.

152
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,500
You're not gonna be joining us on X day either.

153
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:44,380
And X day, you have no idea what's awaiting you all on X day.

154
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:51,260
True slack, true slack is like better than getting gang

155
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:56,540
sucked by a horde of horny, buxom Nordic Valkyries

156
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:03,340
while eating a big juicy T-bone steak on your birthday.

157
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:10,040
But X day, X day makes slack seem like you're wearing

158
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:13,000
a shit helmet with a padlocked chin strap.

159
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:15,940
That's right.

160
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:19,300
By comparison, X day is gonna make any slack you have

161
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,240
seem like nothing.

162
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:26,800
Now, you might think, well, I'm not gonna spend any money

163
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,360
on this Church of the Subgenius.

164
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,560
I'm not gonna spend any money on this.

165
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,100
I got better things to do with my $30.

166
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,440
I can go out and buy a hoodie in the blue.

167
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,780
I can go out and buy a blowfish CD or something without money.

168
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:40,960
And I can sit at home and I can listen to my hoodie

169
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,720
and the blowfish CD over and over and over again.

170
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,700
And I can sit back and just jam and have me a good time

171
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:52,100
listening to my CD player.

172
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,560
Because you like music so much.

173
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,000
Well, on X day, that CD player's gonna melt

174
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,080
into a pile of slack.

175
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,040
That's right.

176
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,720
All your cheap pink entertainment devices

177
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,120
are gonna be destroyed in the fires of the Xist invasion.

178
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,060
There will be no music then.

179
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,740
The only music there will be

180
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,760
will be the screams of the dying.

181
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,160
You may not like the sound of this type of music,

182
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:33,880
but we subgeniuses will damn well be dancing to the tune.

183
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,220
So what can you do?

184
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,780
You can join up with the church of the subgenius

185
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:46,600
or you'll be singing in the choir.

186
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,820
That's right, brothers and sisters.

187
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:52,400
You'll be singing along with all that screaming and pain

188
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:57,280
and all that horrible moaning and wailing and praying.

189
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,260
You know, when I was in Chicago last night,

190
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:04,220
I was down in the dressing room getting ready

191
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:04,420
and all of a sudden, the church of the subgenius

192
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,420


193
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,420


194
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,420


195
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,420


196
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,420


197
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,420


198
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:04,420


199
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,400
was calling me to go up here and preach to the folks out there.

200
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,580
And a cockroach was crawling across the table.

201
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,760
And I took out my ink pen and I was kinda poking it along

202
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,900
and it'd run, go across the table and I'd reach over

203
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,400
and poke it the other way and I'd watch it run.

204
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,060
And I'd sit there and watch the little things

205
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,100
that got so frustrated.

206
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,720
And then I took out my cigarette lighter

207
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,740
and I started singeing around his antennas.

208
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,880
And then I reached around behind him

209
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,420
and started burning.

210
00:11:34,420 --> 00:11:34,420


211
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,360
And he was burning off his wings and he flipped over

212
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,280
and his little legs were kicking and screaming

213
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,200
and flying around in the air.

214
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:45,540
On next day, if you don't have a membership card,

215
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,520
you're gonna pray.

216
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,200
You're gonna wish.

217
00:11:49,380 --> 00:11:52,200
You're gonna wish that you were that cockroach.

218
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,560
That's right, you will wish you were that cockroach on next day.

219
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:57,880
You'll wish that you could just be tortured

220
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:01,760
for a little while and then put out of your misery

221
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,860
in a burst of flame

222
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,360
by some sadistic,

223
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,280
subgenius preacher.

224
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,840
But we're not gonna make it that easy on you.

225
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:09,820
No.

226
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:14,840
Brothers and sisters, the river is rising

227
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,880
and you're gonna drown.

228
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,580
Tonight, I am offering you a personal

229
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:28,000
flotation device to keep your head above this rising river.

230
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,380
I'm offering you a personal flotation device

231
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,840
in the form of this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

232
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:39,440
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

233
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,500
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

234
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,940
It is no accident that you are all here.

235
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:53,400
You all have been chosen to receive this message.

236
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,400
You have been chosen because the water's rising up

237
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:59,960
and it's just about to rise over your heads.

238
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,580
And we're gonna throw you this flotation device

239
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,420
and you can either grab on, or you can just go.

240
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:04,420


241
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,220
You can either go on to it and live,

242
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,380
or you can pass it on by,

243
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,040
and you're gonna go down like yesterday's shit

244
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,580
swirling down the toilet.

245
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,460
It's no accident.

246
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,580
You must join the Church of the Subgenius, or die.

247
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:25,140
You'll be damn glad that you joined.

248
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:29,000
You will be damn glad that you spent that pitiful $30.

249
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,780
I really don't want to see all of you die.

250
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:34,400
I really don't want to see all of you die.

251
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,400


252
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:34,400


253
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,040
Some of you I do.

254
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,540
But I don't want to see all of you die.

255
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,260
We are here to help you.

256
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,360
We are your friends.

257
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,820
We are your friends.

258
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:51,280
You must know, can't you feel, by looking at this man Bob,

259
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:54,000
how much he loves you?

260
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,220
Don't you realize how much Bob loves you?

261
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,000
He loves you so much that he's willing to offer you

262
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,380
a chance to have your every perverse desire

263
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,740
be brought to life.

264
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:13,320
Your every sick sexual fantasy shall be made flesh before you.

265
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,440
Trust us.

266
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,580
Trust Bob.

267
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:21,480
Amen.

268
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,100
Maybe some of you still aren't willing to accept Bob into your lives.

269
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:29,400
Perhaps you need some proof.

270
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,400
Perhaps Bob...

271
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,140
Perhaps...

272
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:34,400


273
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:39,440
My main man, J.R. Bob Dobbs here will give me the power,

274
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,060
the power to heal some lucky member of the audience tonight.

275
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:48,340
Is there anybody here that needs to be healed

276
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,480
of some horrible sickness?

277
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:54,940
Wait, we have a man here waving his hands.

278
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:56,480
Come on up here, brother.

279
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,300
Come on up here.

280
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,800
Come on up here, brother.

281
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:02,660
Let me help you.

282
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:04,720
Good evening, brother.

283
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,740
What's your name?

284
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,960
My name is Eric.

285
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:07,900
Eric.

286
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:09,640
And...

287
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,060
And...

288
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,240
What brought you here tonight, Eric?

289
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,840
What brought you here tonight?

290
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:17,040
My crippled right leg.

291
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,700
Your crippled right leg brought you here tonight.

292
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,760
Well, Bob...

293
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,500
Bob's gonna give me the power to heal you of your maladies.

294
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:29,340
Bob's telling me that you have a problem in your leg.

295
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,040
Bob's telling me you have a tumor.

296
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:32,640
Bob's telling me you have a tumor.

297
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,640
In your leg that you need healed.

298
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:35,200
Is this true?

299
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:40,620
And Bob told me that you had a terrible heart condition, brother.

300
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,680
Is this true?

301
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:43,920
It's true?

302
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:48,700
And Bob tells me that you have bursitis in your shoulder.

303
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,300
Am I right?

304
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,360
Have you got bursitis in your shoulder?

305
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,780
He has bursitis in his shoulder.

306
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,120
He has many maladies.

307
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,920
But Bob is also telling me that you've been having problems with your liver.

308
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:01,520
Is that true?

309
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,540
And that you've been having a problem with sexual dysfunction.

310
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,600
Is that true?

311
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,180
Yes.

312
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:12,720
It's true he's suffering from an obstruction.

313
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,900
Is it true that you're having some problem with your bowels?

314
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,540
That you're having shit in weeks?

315
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:25,180
And that you're here tonight because you were so full of shit that you had to come down here to see subgenius preachers?

316
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,160
And that you're here tonight because you were so full of shit that you had to come down here to see subgenius preachers?

317
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:27,820
Yes.

318
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,380
Yes.

319
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:28,700
Yes.

320
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,500
And Bob also told me that you have a problem with your liver.

321
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,280
And that you have a problem with really bad acne on your ass.

322
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,140
Is it true?

323
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,760
It's all over.

324
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,000
It's sad.

325
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,420
And that all the women call you pizza butt.

326
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:41,220
Is that true?

327
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:42,880
What women?

328
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,580
That's so sad.

329
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:50,440
A man with sexual dysfunction and a pizza butt who can't get a woman.

330
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,220
Bob is saying that you need to be healed of these maladies.

331
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,260
Bob is saying that you've had a problem with your throat too.

332
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,720
And your ears.

333
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,400
And the glands.

334
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,480
And your armpits.

335
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,760
And your left index finger.

336
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,300
And your right middle finger.

337
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:10,060
The one that keeps getting stiff every time a police car goes by.

338
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,020
Is this true brother?

339
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,360
This is the truth.

340
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:16,120
Well brother, tonight we're going to heal you.

341
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,440
We're going to heal you brother.

342
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,700
Oh yes.

343
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:24,920
Brother Bevilacqua is going to come up here to help me out with his healing.

344
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:31,060
Sometimes the power gets in me and it's so strong that I burn out the wires and actually accidentally kill the person.

345
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,460
Turns me into a bit of a emo, never년

346
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:14,580
you. But he, who brothers, he isn't going to be needing this anymore. Yeehaw. Come on

347
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:19,280
up, brother. Come on up. How are you feeling now? How are you feeling now? I'm feeling

348
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:26,200
amazing. Wow. He's shit himself. He's shit with everybody. Be thankful for this man who

349
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:33,660
is shit himself. Now go on out and find yourself a woman in this crowd and see if you can make

350
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:40,620
your dysfunctional organs work. But I've got total faith that Bob is going to do this for

351
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:46,120
you. I've got total faith that Bob is going to do this for you. Yes, brothers and sisters,

352
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:53,260
you've seen the miracles tonight. You've seen the healings and the inflictions of pain.

353
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,840
I see my brother here is actually...

354
00:18:56,200 --> 00:19:00,620
Over here carousing with a woman now who's not looking at him as if he were a disgusting

355
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:08,480
squid. Oh, look at that. He's getting some action. And Bob promises all of you all the

356
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:13,840
action you'll ever need, all the action you'll ever want, and more.

357
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:24,080
Here is my dick. This is my dick right here.

358
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:26,000
Two and a half.

359
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,820
Feet long, solid aluminum.

360
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:35,660
And after 1998, I'm going to be fucking some people up bad with it.

361
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,720
The orifices are going to be stretching. The heads are going to be collapsing.

362
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:51,220
And brothers and sisters, I'm not going to use any lubricant.

363
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,720
Oh, yes.

364
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:59,960
I have but one thing left to say to you all.

365
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:04,900
The supermarket has run out of food.

366
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:09,220
The highway out of town's jammed up. Gridlock.

367
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,480
The doctor's dead.

368
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:14,700
There's a meteor heading for your town.

369
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:23,020
And J.R. Bob Dobbs is sitting at the wheel of the last train out of town.

370
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,660
The brothers...

371
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:26,660
sisters...

372
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:34,340
you gotta get on that train. Because when you come right down to it, you either gotta

373
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:45,080
ride that train or you're gonna get tied to the tracks. Remember, it is far better to

374
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:52,200
be a speeding car than it is to be a blind man crossing against the light.

375
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,060
Thank you.

376
00:20:57,800 --> 00:21:00,100
Amen, brothers and sisters. Can I get an amen?

377
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:00,880
Amen!

378
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,940
Can I get a hallelujah?

379
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:03,860
Hallelujah!

380
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,320
What do you all want tonight, brothers and sisters?

381
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,120
Light!

382
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,220
What do you want?

383
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,200
Light!

384
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,420
Brothers and sisters, I need you to say it again, but I need you to say it loud enough

385
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:22,060
that the exes that are on their way here will hear you. And they're gonna crank up the radio

386
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,760
and roll down the windows on their spaceship.

387
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:30,440
And they're gonna light up a big fat-frop stick and smile. And they're gonna be coming

388
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,020
down. And you gotta let them know that you're all waiting for them. So, what is it that

389
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,140
you want, brothers and sisters?

390
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:37,240
Slack!

391
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:44,660
Yes, brothers and sisters, slack! Oh, yes. And who is gonna give you this slack?

392
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:45,780
Ball!

393
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,000
What the heck?

394
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:53,900
Brothers and sisters, the train's leaving, and a lot of you guys are on the right track.

395
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:54,520
Woo!

396
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,120
Ladies and gentlemen, praise Bob!

397
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,720
Praise Bob!

398
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,100
Praise Bob!

399
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,820
Thank you very much!

400
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:14,700
Well, that was some pretty amazing preaching there, huh? Yes, indeed. Friends, that was

401
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:24,120
Dr. Kitahdin Legume at the Madison, Wisconsin, Devival at the Club DeWash, which burned to

402
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:32,320
the ground the next day during our world tour in February 1976. And this hour of slack and the next

403
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:42,800
one will be a tribute to Dr. Legume because Dr. Legume died last month after a battle with cancer,

404
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:50,480
the incurable kind. I went to see him at his home in Seattle about a week before he boarded the

405
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:57,060
saucers and he was still hobbling around and making sick, sick, sick jokes. But he was in

406
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:03,820
hospice and didn't last much longer after that. I believe his mother and all of his siblings had

407
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:12,560
already died of cancer. I'd known him for 26 years and he was one of my best friends.

408
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:19,060
He practically invented the X-Day drills and certainly kept him jumping with unexpected

409
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:20,200
stunts.

410
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:28,020
Terrifying surprises. But I'm not going to do a big tearjerker eulogy here. It'll serve the memory

411
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:35,980
of this great subgenius much better if we just hear his masterful live devival preaching and

412
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:43,680
some of his calls in to the late Chaz Smith's ESO Swamp Radio on WCSB Cleveland over the years

413
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:49,660
because the subgenius must have slack.

414
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:54,100
Incorrected by the incorrect. Incorrection box.

415
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,800
Speaking of incorrections, they're everywhere.

416
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,040
Let's take a quick flip to the Akashic Records.

417
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,680
And the corruptigating worms of which Dave has spoken in the past.

418
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,180
We may list any page and see what we're talking about.

419
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,960
And them and they and those. The others.

420
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,340
We've got them conspiracy bugs. We've got corruptigating worms.

421
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:14,140
The ludicrous.

422
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:15,980
They're all creeping up on us.

423
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:17,640
You've got your face raping bats.

424
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,540
You've got your face raping bats.

425
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:20,460
You've got your face raping bats.

426
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:20,460


427
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:20,460


428
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:20,460


429
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,100
You've got your rape gorillas.

430
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:25,320
Your vomit ultrasonuses.

431
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:25,920
P-dog.

432
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:26,660
Poop dog.

433
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,060
A poop dog hat.

434
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,200
And what of War War?

435
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,320
What of War War?

436
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,060
We forgot War War.

437
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,720
No one even knows what War War represents.

438
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,460
It's as if they've never even heard of him before.

439
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:42,400
And what of Bob?

440
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:46,780
Did we forget J.R. Bob Dobbs?

441
00:24:46,780 --> 00:24:48,680
The thing that brought us together.

442
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,000
The essence of slack.

443
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,420
We've got to learn a lesson.

444
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,160
The essence of slack.

445
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:54,500
And the essence of the whole thing.

446
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:59,500
We're just starting to get holy and righteous and then you went and called us.

447
00:24:59,600 --> 00:24:59,800
Yes, that's it for everybody.

448
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,900
It's Lagugo.

449
00:25:03,060 --> 00:25:10,880
I suppose you're mighty proud of yourself playing that insolent insanity and decontrolling mind control gravy on this here airwave.

450
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:14,020
It was all an accident.

451
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,400
It was all just a total accident.

452
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:17,960
A turtle accident?

453
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,100
Not just a turtle accident.

454
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:20,120
The eternal.

455
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:20,440
The eternal.

456
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:24,280
We were just downloading Claudine Lager off Morpheus together.

457
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,220
It was a together kind of moment.

458
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:31,340
And Legume says something with his computer that they all play at the same time as they open.

459
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:37,720
And suddenly, he started ICQing me, telling me he was going to shoot himself in the head from the sound.

460
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,200
Dr. Legume, you sound kind of sick.

461
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:42,180
Yeah, like you already shot yourself in the head, man.

462
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,620
Did you actually do it and are still alive there, like Trotsky, screaming and yelling at what's-his-name?

463
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,720
No, but that would be a step up.

464
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:49,660
Oh, really?

465
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:49,800
Really.

466
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,480
Oh, yeah.

467
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,500
What, do you have the Philadelphia flu badge?

468
00:25:52,500 --> 00:26:00,700
Oh, yeah, he's got to go in for like real, he's got to get the radioactive isotopes injected into his bloodstream.

469
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,040
What?

470
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,300
Well, yeah, there's a story behind that.

471
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:04,360
I had it done yesterday.

472
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,500
Oh, my God.

473
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,580
I was just telling some folks about it.

474
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,600
You're just now...

475
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:16,200
I had to drink two great big-ass bottles of Barry Nasty semen-textured crap.

476
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:19,520
And so I drink these two bottles of it, and I get to the hospital.

477
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:21,720
And they say, our machine's broke.

478
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,740
I have no fear, Captain.

479
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,500
Your front seat stage is here, and I'll straighten those ropes.

480
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,260
You were full of chemicals in there for nothing?

481
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,520
And I'm sailing right out for high.

482
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,140
You'll watch me come in by the wheel here.

483
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,200
I start getting a little bit upset.

484
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:45,000
And I say, pardon me, but are you trying to tell me that after I drank those two great big bottles of this vile crap

485
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,700
that your machine is broken and I did it for nothing?

486
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:54,500
And you couldn't bother to call and tell me, sir, don't drink the crap?

487
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:55,180
No.

488
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,340
Jeff, that is very nutritious stuff.

489
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,780
You want to pay attention, close attention to what your holism doctor says to you.

490
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,760
You know, I've sometimes suspected that the medical...

491
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,340
Okay, where do diseases come from?

492
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,340
Doctors, man.

493
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:07,640
Right.

494
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,620
The doctors make the diseases, then they cure you of them.

495
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:15,760
When you go to get a kidney stone removed, where do they put the kidney stone in the guy they just were doing the...

496
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,440
A guy who did not have a kidney stone.

497
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:18,600
Right.

498
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:18,980
That's right.

499
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:19,340
Yeah.

500
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:23,780
Or they plant a new one back in you and they sell the old one to the aliens.

501
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:30,800
Dr. Legume, I wouldn't be surprised if your problems didn't originally come from some doctor

502
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:35,200
who injected something into your mom's womb when you were gestating.

503
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,160
Could I ask you...

504
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:36,940
As a medical experiment.

505
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:39,660
Could I ask you one question?

506
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,740
Actually, you were a medical experiment, weren't you?

507
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,240
Yeah, that's true.

508
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,340
He was.

509
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,620
He was one of the first, wasn't he?

510
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,820
Or was he the second wave?

511
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:48,680
The ones with the smaller apertures and the little...

512
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,800
Besides Bob.

513
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,420
Yeah, besides Bob.

514
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:59,760
I was at one time a tiny, scrawny little child who was injected with these horrendous hormones and steroids.

515
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:07,180
It was this really freaky time when I gained like a hundred pounds and a foot of height in like three months.

516
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,600
Now, if you were to say 23 years, perhaps that would make more sense.

517
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,720
But three months, no.

518
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,380
Then what happened?

519
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,620
That will make the doctor smile.

520
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:15,320
Then what happened?

521
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:15,640
Then it's...

522
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:17,340
Well, then I went back to school.

523
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,620
And all those people who...

524
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:24,540
Beat on a little skinny boy were suddenly faced with this giant, foul-tempered behemoth.

525
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,780
Was your mom named Rosemary?

526
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:27,940
A genius is born.

527
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:36,580
Exposed to strange chemicals, toxic nerve gases around New Jersey where he was growing up.

528
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,140
Scrawny and runtish.

529
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:41,640
Then cured by a miracle of mad science.

530
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:44,540
Dr. Legume now resembles...

531
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:48,660
Would probably get work as a movie expert.

532
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,500
He's a master of playing bikers and...

533
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,580
Sodomizers.

534
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,860
Evil villains, evil warlords and so forth.

535
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:59,520
Also those guys, you know, like the village people type guys that you...

536
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:04,280
He'd play humongous because he looks good in a leather mask.

537
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,440
They say he has his father's eyes.

538
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:11,960
Actually, Dr. Legume has a handsome sort of a baby face.

539
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:15,560
When he smiles, he has these dimples that will hold golf balls.

540
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,620
You cannot see the satanic bequest deep in his...

541
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,180
He's got a skull there.

542
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:20,860
He looks so baby-like.

543
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:21,260
I want...

544
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:21,840
You can't tell.

545
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:25,120
I want you between me and the others.

546
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,680
Dr. Legume.

547
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:28,800
Actually, I...

548
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:29,860
You know, there is a...

549
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:34,340
He was invented by the barium enema and gained its proportionate strength and wall-climbing ability.

550
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,140
Ah, ha, ha, ha, ha.

551
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:37,540
Yes, we all need that.

552
00:29:37,660 --> 00:29:40,840
The wall-climbing ability imparted by a barium enema.

553
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,920
Wall-climbers.

554
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,100
That's what Bob told me to do.

555
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,240
That's what Bob said to do.

556
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:49,240
I'm wall-climbing.

557
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,380
I'm wall-climbing.

558
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,060
Yeah, baby.

559
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,640
Right on.

560
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:01,340
That was from the ESO Swamp Radio show of November 2002, and we'll hear more of that later.

561
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:07,040
I guess Legume and Chaz are jamming on a saucer somewhere now.

562
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,560
Those two were actually very best friends.

563
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:17,380
Anyway, here's a recording of Dr. Legume's sermon from the Akron, Ohio, revival.

564
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,200
Of 2002.

565
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:23,260
A suicide note. Is it mine?

566
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,820
Give it back!

567
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,520
Man, I found this suicide note.

568
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:30,160
It was from a young teenage girl.

569
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:34,540
At least from the content, I'm assuming it was a teenage girl.

570
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:37,840
It says here,

571
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,340
I'm tired of the pain in my heart.

572
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,820
You are all so unfair to me.

573
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,800
You don't love me.

574
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,220
You don't love me.

575
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,240
You don't understand me.

576
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:52,240
Everyone hates me because I'm fat and ugly.

577
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:56,200
The only thing I ever wanted was to be with Patrick.

578
00:30:56,600 --> 00:31:00,300
But I found out he was at the mall with that slut Michelle.

579
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:05,880
And I hope they'll all feel bad when I'm gone.

580
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,000
But, tough.

581
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:09,260
I tried to talk to you about it, Mom.

582
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:15,440
But you was more interested in your soap operas than my real problems.

583
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,320
Awwwwwww.

584
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:20,400
Well, I'm not going to bother any of you anymore.

585
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,680
And I hope Patrick is real happy at the mall with his slut.

586
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,040
You're going so far, you!

587
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,680
I hope you're all happy now. Goodbye.

588
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:33,820
What a stupid little bitch.

589
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:36,060
Fucking shit, yeah.

590
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:44,760
Then the very idea of offing yourself because of some stupid little problem like that makes me think,

591
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,420
well,

592
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:51,180
what is a problem that's worthy of killing yourself?

593
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:53,700
And it reminded me,

594
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:57,020
it reminded me of when I was a child.

595
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:03,160
When I was a child, I grew up in a town called Mansfield, New Jersey.

596
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:09,720
And out on Route 206, which cuts right through Mansfield, New Jersey,

597
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,300
there's a farmer's market.

598
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:15,060
It's the biggest shop in town.

599
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,340
Everybody goes there.

600
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:20,740
It's the only reason anybody comes to Mansfield, is to shop at this farmer's market.

601
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:27,080
But across the street from this farmer's market, there was a junkyard.

602
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,400
Not just any junkyard.

603
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:35,760
It was an old military junkyard full of crashed World War II planes and trucks and tanks and such.

604
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:40,020
And it was owned by a man named John Mihaljec.

605
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,420
John Mihaljec had a lot to say.

606
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:50,940
He had so much to say that out on Route 206, down the entire length of his property,

607
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:55,620
he had these huge billboards with pictures of political figures on them.

608
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,420
They had a picture at the time, it was the 1970s,

609
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:04,980
there was a picture of President Richard Nixon with the bleeding body of a dead rat.

610
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:11,460
And there were these long, long ramps that he would put up on these billboards on his property.

611
00:33:13,420 --> 00:33:15,520
And the town hated him.

612
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:20,880
When you drove by, the ramps on the sides were so long and involved

613
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:25,240
that the cars would have to slow down to five miles an hour just to read them.

614
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,800
Oh yeah, they hated him bad.

615
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,960
So what did John Mihaljec do?

616
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,760
He ran for senator.

617
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:39,840
That pissed off all the people who hated him even more.

618
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:41,620
All the townspeople hated him.

619
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,500
One day they said,

620
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,460
we're going to finally take care of this John Mihaljec problem.

621
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:52,400
So one night, some of the townspeople got together,

622
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:57,200
in the best tradition of the angry villagers in Frankenstein movies,

623
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,240
they all got their torches together and they went down to his property

624
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,560
and they burned his house to the ground.

625
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,080
Oh, they burned his house to the ground, but that's not all they did,

626
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,480
because his wife was in it.

627
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:12,880
They burned his wife in the house.

628
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,560
And they killed his wife.

629
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,340
They killed his wife and they burned down his house.

630
00:34:19,540 --> 00:34:23,420
And they said, finally we're going to see the end of John Mihaljec,

631
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:27,220
because no man is going to be able to stand up after something like this.

632
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:32,000
John Mihaljec had other ideas.

633
00:34:35,180 --> 00:34:40,440
John Mihaljec, in the smoking ashes of the ruins of his home,

634
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:44,740
the smoking ashes of his now dead beloved wife,

635
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,220
built a giant teepee on that spot

636
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:55,260
and let everybody know that we're not going to run him off his land.

637
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,420
The townspeople hated it even more.

638
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:05,680
So one night, the townspeople,

639
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:10,420
in the best tradition of the angry villagers in Frankenstein movies,

640
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:13,040
once again got together

641
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:15,740
and they went out to John Mihaljec's land

642
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:20,280
and they burned down his teepee.

643
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:26,480
This, they said, would run off John Mihaljec.

644
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,680
How much more could one man stand?

645
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,100
He would leave, he would kill himself,

646
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,060
he would do something, but he would be out of their hair forever.

647
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:39,720
John Mihaljec.

648
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:41,480
John Mihaljec had other ideas.

649
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:47,680
And so, on the smoking ruins of his teepee,

650
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:53,260
built on the smoking ruins of his home and his dead beloved wife,

651
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:58,040
John Mihaljec built another teepee,

652
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,300
an identical teepee to the first,

653
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,900
but with one small difference.

654
00:36:04,520 --> 00:36:06,740
It was made of steel!

655
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,360
The villagers didn't know what to do about that.

656
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,520
They hated John Mihaljec.

657
00:36:18,120 --> 00:36:20,940
They wanted to run John Mihaljec off his land.

658
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:24,860
But those stupid motherfuckers never could figure out

659
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,500
how to burn down a steel teepee.

660
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:33,100
And John Mihaljec lived there until he died an old, old man.

661
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:36,560
Can I get a praise John Mihaljec?

662
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,660
Yes, John Mihaljec!

663
00:36:38,660 --> 00:36:41,380
Can I get a praise John Mihaljec?

664
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,660
Yes, John Mihaljec!

665
00:36:44,360 --> 00:36:46,060
Oh, brothers and sisters,

666
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:51,000
John Mihaljec found the perfect solution to his problems.

667
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:55,480
Maybe you have problems too.

668
00:36:56,520 --> 00:37:00,400
Maybe your problems could be solved by giving up or committing suicide.

669
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,920
Probably not.

670
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,280
Well, come to think of it,

671
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,900
we probably solved all your problems.

672
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,160
But we're not the kind of a cult that's going to advocate suicide.

673
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,500
We are the first anti-suicide suicide cult.

674
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:19,460
One day we will all get together,

675
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,620
and after the point of time we will all drink Kool-Aid.

676
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:24,900
Then nothing will happen, we'll just drink some Kool-Aid.

677
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,520
We'll die until we say so.

678
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:29,600
Yes, so I'm sure you have problems too,

679
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,100
but I don't think that many of your problems are going to be solved by a big tin teepee.

680
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,000
However,

681
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,720
there is always a solution to your problems.

682
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:41,700
And only the perfect solution to your problems.

683
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,340
And brothers and sisters,

684
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,500
Bob,

685
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:50,180
Bob will give you a blueprint.

686
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:55,760
A blueprint for your perfect teepee of vengeance.

687
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:03,840
It will help you get over your problems without having to take a hundred Tylenol.

688
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:07,840
Yeah, Tom Waits.

689
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,320
Are there any Tom Waits fans here?

690
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:13,760
Well, I remember there was a song by Tom Waits

691
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,760
where he said something about a woman.

692
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:20,380
She was a crumbling beauty with a tattooed tear on her cheek.

693
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,120
For each year her man was away.

694
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,140
And then Tom Waits said,

695
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,020
Hell, there's nothing wrong with her that a hundred dollars won't fix.

696
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,260
Well, brothers and sisters,

697
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,940
it's even better for all of you.

698
00:38:37,620 --> 00:38:42,220
Because there's nothing wrong with you that thirty dollars won't fix.

699
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:45,220
Yes, brothers and sisters,

700
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,400
because that thirty dollars,

701
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:47,840
when put in the hands of Bob,

702
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,080
will help deliver unto you the blueprint for your own tin teepee.

703
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:54,780
That tin teepee will fill that tin teepee-shaped hole in your lives.

704
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,080
Oh yes, brothers and sisters,

705
00:38:56,160 --> 00:38:58,180
you may not have very small problems,

706
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,940
but you have them kind of problems.

707
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,120
Oh yes,

708
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,300
but Reverend Stang,

709
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,240
he's here to help you.

710
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,240


711
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,940
He's here to help you with those problems.

712
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,420
Maybe that hole in your life is shaped like a little bob pin.

713
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:13,320
Maybe that hole in your life is shaped like a bumper sticker or a t-shirt.

714
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,900
And brothers and sisters,

715
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:17,300
through Bob's love,

716
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,600
Reverend Stang is here tonight

717
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:23,960
to fill that t-shirt-shaped hole in your lives,

718
00:39:23,980 --> 00:39:24,820
brothers and sisters.

719
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:27,360
Oh yes, brothers and sisters.

720
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:28,820
Can I get a praise, Bob?

721
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:32,480
We're filling CD-shaped holes tonight.

722
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,640
Oh yes, brothers and sisters.

723
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,580
And I saw a lot of you out there tonight

724
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:39,620
who have CD-shaped holes in your lives

725
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,820
that are just begging to be filled.

726
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,720
And Reverend Stang is here tonight

727
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,180
to help Bob fill your holes.

728
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,520
Can I get a praise, Bob?

729
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,980
Praise Bob!

730
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:51,980
I'm a naughty boy.

731
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:54,740
A bad boy slapped my nasty ass.

732
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:56,540
I'm a bad, bad boy.

733
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,520
Nasty ass.

734
00:39:57,640 --> 00:39:58,600
A naughty boy.

735
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,460
A nasty, nasty, bad, bad, naughty boy.

736
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:05,520
Bad, bad, bad, bad, naughty boy.

737
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:06,580
Naughty boy.

738
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,740
The American people already know that I'm a naughty boy.

739
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:10,680
A bad boy.

740
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,500
I'm going bad, bad, bad, bad.

741
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,860
Slapped my nasty ass.

742
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:21,420
This next classic Dr. Legume rant is from the Baltimore Devival of 2007.

743
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,440
Incidentally, he really is dead.

744
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:28,660
And I say this because there was a short time in 1995

745
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:32,440
when we thought he'd been killed in a motorcycle accident.

746
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,180
It started out as a mistake,

747
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:37,760
but he deliberately let it turn into a hoax

748
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:41,880
until all his friends were gathered for a wake in Cleveland,

749
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:46,380
which he attended in disguise, dressed as a ghost.

750
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,100
When I said,

751
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,940
if there really was a Bob, Legume would still be alive,

752
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:55,420
at that cue, he revealed himself

753
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:59,800
and berated us all for not poking him with a stick

754
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,600
to see if he really was dead.

755
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:05,900
Hence the special intro by Pisces.

756
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:12,940
Is there a Legume in the house?

757
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,660
Is there a Legume in the house?

758
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,340
Well, of course Legume is dead.

759
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,060
You know Legume is dead.

760
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,860
Legume has been dead several times.

761
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,760
But you know what? It's not a big deal.

762
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,520
You know why?

763
00:41:28,980 --> 00:41:30,320
Legumes fuck the devil.

764
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:36,280
The devil was so smitten with the ass-fucking he got from Legume

765
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:40,040
that he wears a little locket of picture of him and Legume with it.

766
00:41:40,300 --> 00:41:42,160
You know, it's really kind of creepy.

767
00:41:44,260 --> 00:41:45,720
Legume's been to hell and back

768
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,580
and probably has the STDs from the devil to prove it.

769
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:54,500
That being said, if Legume is not dead,

770
00:41:56,080 --> 00:41:58,180
I would love to see him come up here

771
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,380
and share with us his feelings on maybe being not dead

772
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,920
or maybe being dead or...

773
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:05,080
you certainly look dead.

774
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:08,140
By the way, y'all, I am scared shitless of this man.

775
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:12,060
It is taking everything in my body not to run right now.

776
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,520
In fact, you know what? Forget it. Screw it.

777
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:30,420
Sorry, it's been a while since I've been in a church.

778
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,420
I feel naked without my gas can.

779
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,720
It's a funny story.

780
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:44,660
The last time I preached in a church like this was, I guess, 1996.

781
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,140
And it was in Pittsburgh.

782
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:51,000
And I brought a shotgun with me to church.

783
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:56,980
I brought this big black Mossberg 500 shotgun in there with me.

784
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,600
And at one point during my sermon,

785
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:02,620
blew a hole in the ceiling of the church.

786
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:09,040
And there was this really hot-looking female cop in the front row.

787
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:12,120
And afterwards, I'm carrying this shotgun out

788
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,540
and she walks up to me and she says,

789
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,580
that's the most realistic prop I've ever seen.

790
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:24,740
But it's been a while since I preached.

791
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:27,560
It's been about a decade or so.

792
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,580
I hope I'm not dead.

793
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,400
I hope I'm not too rusty.

794
00:43:32,600 --> 00:43:35,080
Because I'd like to ask you all a few questions tonight.

795
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:42,260
Do you ever feel like the universe has positioned a funnel

796
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:45,360
for all of its shit over your life?

797
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:46,420
Yes!

798
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,640
All the time.

799
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:54,380
Do you feel the people around you draining your intelligence

800
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,720
as you speak to them?

801
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:56,800
Oh, yeah!

802
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,300
That's so stupid!

803
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:03,220
Does it bother you that the decisions that affect your life

804
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:07,720
are apparently being made by a pack of insidious fucktards?

805
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:08,520
Fuck them!

806
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,860
No, it's fucking positive.

807
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:10,500
Fuck them!

808
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,520
Do you ever find yourself sitting in a stoplight

809
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:16,600
in the middle of nowhere,

810
00:44:16,760 --> 00:44:18,200
in the middle of the night,

811
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,740
as minutes of your life kick away,

812
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,840
and you realize that you've become a slave

813
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:25,860
to a glorified party light?

814
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:26,440
Yeah!

815
00:44:26,440 --> 00:44:28,140
I want those kids back!

816
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:29,760
That's right, go ahead.

817
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,420
One last question.

818
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:34,000
Do you have $30?

819
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:35,740
Yes!

820
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:42,600
If you answered yes to any or all of these questions,

821
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:45,540
you can be saved.

822
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:47,380
So true.

823
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:54,240
J.R. Bob Dobbs is a spiritual GPS.

824
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:55,920
Yes!

825
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:00,720
To show you the way, the path through life,

826
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:01,900
the path to slack,

827
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:04,200
the superhighway of slack,

828
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,260
where there are no speed limits,

829
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:08,620
and there are no stoplights,

830
00:45:08,900 --> 00:45:13,400
and those insidious fucktards are just bugs on the windshield.

831
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,940
So true.

832
00:45:17,120 --> 00:45:19,320
And when you come to the end of that road,

833
00:45:20,740 --> 00:45:21,300
well...

834
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:23,340
Death.

835
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,680
When you come to the end of that road,

836
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:31,920
you don't want to wake up

837
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:37,420
in some bland bargain basement afterlife

838
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,320
that you weren't expecting.

839
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:39,820
No!

840
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,180
That would suck.

841
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,500
You don't want to end up in some

842
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:45,820
shitty third world afterlife

843
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,880
with flies crawling around on your soul.

844
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:50,300
That would be terrible.

845
00:45:50,560 --> 00:45:50,780
No!

846
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,580
Well, I'm here to tell you,

847
00:45:53,580 --> 00:45:57,320
it doesn't matter if you're pagan or Christian.

848
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:02,840
It doesn't matter if you're Jewish

849
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,680
or if you're Buddhist.

850
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,900
It doesn't matter if you're an atheist

851
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:11,040
or even a Canadian.

852
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:17,500
It doesn't matter because you tonight

853
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,120
have the opportunity

854
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:22,520
to spend your afterlife

855
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,740
in the coolest eternity

856
00:46:25,520 --> 00:46:28,580
ever devised by man nor gods.

857
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,520
I would love that.

858
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,000
I'm talking about, of course,

859
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:33,240
subgenius heaven.

860
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,500
Praise God!

861
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,100
Praise God!

862
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,360
Praise God!

863
00:46:36,620 --> 00:46:38,800
Now, you might ask,

864
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:41,180
what does subgenius heaven have

865
00:46:41,180 --> 00:46:45,460
that other national brand afterlives don't?

866
00:46:48,100 --> 00:46:48,780
Beer.

867
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,120
Beer!

868
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:54,780
Now, it's been well established

869
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:57,640
by Polish clerics and polka bands

870
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,480
that in heaven there is no beer.

871
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:01,540
But in subgenius heaven,

872
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:04,000
you have all the beer you want,

873
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:04,940
brothers and sisters.

874
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:05,700
Praise God!

875
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:07,260
Can I get a praise beer?

876
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:08,840
Praise beer!

877
00:47:11,780 --> 00:47:13,180
In subgenius heaven,

878
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,900
there are verdant fields

879
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:20,040
of the stickiest green buds of froth.

880
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:27,000
And you can just walk into the middle of the field

881
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,880
and light it on fire and stand.

882
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,980
There are rivers of the finest liquors

883
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:38,360
that you can just dive in,

884
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:39,280
swim and drink.

885
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,940
And you'll never ever get tired

886
00:47:44,940 --> 00:47:47,840
climbing crack rock mountains.

887
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,180
Praise God!

888
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:52,080
Praise God!

889
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:55,480
In subgenius heaven,

890
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:00,900
you can huff the everlasting jankum.

891
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:07,020
In subgenius heaven,

892
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,040
you can have sex with anyone

893
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:12,960
or anything you please

894
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,760
and do all of the most perverse,

895
00:48:16,820 --> 00:48:19,140
sick and twisted things

896
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,320
that your sister would never let you do to her.

897
00:48:22,540 --> 00:48:23,520
Oh no!

898
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:25,540
That's so cute!

899
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:29,140
In subgenius heaven,

900
00:48:29,380 --> 00:48:31,020
you can travel back and forth

901
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,580
between the afterlife and earth

902
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,160
in case you want to come back

903
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:36,960
to tease fat ladies and Irishmen.

904
00:48:37,900 --> 00:48:39,260
I hate Irish.

905
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:42,260
And when you return to subgenius heaven,

906
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:46,220
no one will have fucked with your stuff.

907
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,160
Yeah!

908
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:51,220
Now, national brand religions,

909
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:54,920
they ask a pretty high price

910
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:55,980
for their afterlife.

911
00:48:57,140 --> 00:48:58,640
You have to give them all your money

912
00:48:58,640 --> 00:49:02,060
or you have to go to church every Sunday

913
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:03,900
and kiss the CEO's butt.

914
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:04,800
Bullshit!

915
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,120
Some religions, hell,

916
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:12,060
they want you to strap a dynamite vest to you

917
00:49:12,060 --> 00:49:13,460
and blow yourself to shit

918
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,980
just to get to the afterlife.

919
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:16,560
That sucks!

920
00:49:17,620 --> 00:49:22,760
They don't want you to have fun here on earth

921
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,000
because it's what makes their shitty

922
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:28,860
bargain basement afterlife look good

923
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:31,440
if they can deny you the opportunity

924
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,560
of smoking and partying

925
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:35,620
and drinking and dancing

926
00:49:35,620 --> 00:49:37,000
and whoring and queering

927
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:39,120
and whatever it is that you want to do for fun.

928
00:49:39,260 --> 00:49:40,500
That's why they do that!

929
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,340
They don't want you to do that

930
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,680
because they know that when they offer you an afterlife,

931
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,540
they're not really offering you that much.

932
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:49,440
It's, uh...

933
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:55,420
It's just dime store religious pap

934
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:57,060
that they're offering you.

935
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:59,560
A boring afterlife where you're sitting around

936
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,320
scratching your ass for eternity.

937
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:05,860
Now, for an afterlife as good as subgenius heaven,

938
00:50:05,980 --> 00:50:08,780
we could easily, easily ask you

939
00:50:08,780 --> 00:50:10,720
to kill a wheelbarrow full of babies

940
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:11,980
and staple them to your head.

941
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:15,660
But the subgenius heaven,

942
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:18,200
the subgenius church only asks one thing.

943
00:50:18,420 --> 00:50:19,020
Tell us!

944
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:23,000
A single $30 donation.

945
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,580
Less than the cost

946
00:50:24,580 --> 00:50:27,420
of a single cup of coffee at Starbucks.

947
00:50:29,660 --> 00:50:31,060
Now, how can we afford

948
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:35,440
to offer an afterlife with such great features

949
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,860
at such a reasonable price?

950
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:40,180
Why, it's simple.

951
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:43,820
Because Bob loves you.

952
00:50:45,660 --> 00:50:48,120
And he's also pretty stupid.

953
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:53,660
But you, yes you, can profit from his stupidity.

954
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,180
There's a catch, though.

955
00:50:56,460 --> 00:50:57,200
No!

956
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:00,660
You have to die first.

957
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:03,460
And it's probably going to suck

958
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:06,100
really, really bad.

959
00:51:06,760 --> 00:51:09,740
But, hey, that was gonna happen anyway.

960
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,720
When cometh the day

961
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,560
that you shuck that monkey suit

962
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:17,320
that you're wearing,

963
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:18,320
Fuck that!

964
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,520
you're gonna feel awfully stupid

965
00:51:20,520 --> 00:51:23,160
if you find yourself in some trailer park afterlife

966
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:25,220
with a bunch of stupid pricks

967
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:26,620
who are only there because

968
00:51:26,620 --> 00:51:30,140
they were pre-programmed for servitude in life.

969
00:51:30,420 --> 00:51:31,020
That would suck!

970
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:37,340
Worse still, you might be reincarnated as

971
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:40,140
some unwashed morphodite

972
00:51:40,140 --> 00:51:43,700
in a prog basement blowing goats over you.

973
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,380
I would hate that!

974
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,360
I would hate that!

975
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,960
Now, you might ask,

976
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:53,380
I'm ready!

977
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:55,140
What about the flying saucers

978
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:58,700
that Reverend Stang and Bob promised would come?

979
00:51:59,040 --> 00:51:59,620
Where are they?

980
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:00,500
Where are they?

981
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:01,100
Where are they?

982
00:52:01,220 --> 00:52:02,080
Where are they?

983
00:52:02,180 --> 00:52:02,180


984
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,420
They haven't come.

985
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:04,500
Why?

986
00:52:05,940 --> 00:52:06,500
Gee!

987
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:07,620
Why?

988
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:08,920
It's been ten years.

989
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:10,120
They haven't come.

990
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,600
And there's a good chance

991
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:13,680
that they haven't come.

992
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:13,680


993
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,540
That you might not be here when they get here.

994
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:17,580
God dammit!

995
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:19,020
It's true.

996
00:52:19,020 --> 00:52:20,500
It's true, brothers and sisters.

997
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,420
But, you can have faith if you want to.

998
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,760
Old Bob never claimed to be infallible.

999
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,660
And Reverend Stang, well,

1000
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:34,720
old Reverend Stang,

1001
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,220
he got that message directly from Bob himself,

1002
00:52:37,380 --> 00:52:40,620
but back then, Reverend Stang was

1003
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,440
a little bit in there.

1004
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:46,420
He was a little bit in there with me.

1005
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:51,240
And, you know, I mean,

1006
00:52:51,240 --> 00:52:53,120
he was into all kinds of fucked up shit.

1007
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:56,080
So you can't take him at 100% on that one.

1008
00:53:01,860 --> 00:53:04,480
But you can have faith if you choose to.

1009
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:05,400
I like to.

1010
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,280
Faith is the difference between a mighty minotaur

1011
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:11,560
drinking a flagon of whiskey

1012
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,600
and fucking a hundred virgins,

1013
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:15,900
and Reverend Stang drinking sugar-free

1014
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:17,980
grape Kool-Aid in a brown fuzzy hat.

1015
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:22,900
If you're able and willing to have faith

1016
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,440
that the flying saucers will come

1017
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,260
and take you off to be a god on Plan X,

1018
00:53:27,320 --> 00:53:29,000
despite the fact that they're a decade late,

1019
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:32,280
then it won't cost you any extra

1020
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:35,280
to have a little faith in Plan B.

1021
00:53:38,060 --> 00:53:41,920
It's no coincidence that Dobbs always says,

1022
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,980
give me slack or kill me.

1023
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:49,940
He knows something.

1024
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:55,260
And even if you think this is all just utter crap,

1025
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,420
your ticket to eternal salvation

1026
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,680
also comes with a bunch of really cool shit

1027
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,760
that you can use to freak out your family and your bosses.

1028
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:08,380
And if you're lucky, they'll kill you

1029
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,100
and you'll have it made.

1030
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:15,300
And if you're real hardcore,

1031
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:18,320
you might get to go to subgenius hell.

1032
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:20,560
Subgenius hell?

1033
00:54:21,340 --> 00:54:24,660
Well, that has all the same things as subgenius heaven,

1034
00:54:24,780 --> 00:54:27,440
only there's too much of it.

1035
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,940
Thirty dollars for all that?

1036
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:37,120
It's chump change.

1037
00:54:38,980 --> 00:54:41,380
Don't be a chump.

1038
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:43,600
Good night, brothers and sisters.

1039
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:47,240
I don't know who's coming up next.

1040
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:52,400
Okay, America.

1041
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:54,020
Okay, world.

1042
00:54:54,140 --> 00:54:55,600
You are violent.

1043
00:54:55,780 --> 00:54:58,340
You are pushing all this murder on us.

1044
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,300
So here it comes right back at you.

1045
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:04,060
And we'll use murder to sell deodorant

1046
00:55:04,060 --> 00:55:06,820
so that you'll just get bored with murder.

1047
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:07,720
Right?

1048
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:10,200
I was picking on the...

1049
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,700
I was.

1050
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:12,640
I was making you suffer.

1051
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,000
Wasp or whatever you want to call it,

1052
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:18,700
see Council of Foreign Relations run corporate state government

1053
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:21,060
of the European stats Reichsmarke...

1054
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,060
This species kills Morlocks.

1055
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:29,000
I'm gonna join the Morlocks people

1056
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:32,680
that evolved themselves to live in this beautiful, perfect world.

1057
00:55:32,940 --> 00:55:35,600
I'm going to change my Euros into human feces.

1058
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,420
They don't need the light and the war.

1059
00:55:38,020 --> 00:55:40,600
They're peaceful creatures, the Morlocks are.

1060
00:55:40,620 --> 00:55:41,600
Their eyes are so tiny.

1061
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:42,820
They cannot see the light.

1062
00:55:42,840 --> 00:55:45,160
I want the world of the Morlocks to come.

1063
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,080
I want to live in the ground.

1064
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:51,140
He's listening to the Morlock in himself.

1065
00:55:51,680 --> 00:55:53,040
With Dr. Lagune.

1066
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:55,660
Yes, Dr. Lagune.

1067
00:55:55,660 --> 00:55:57,920
An original Morlock.

1068
00:55:57,940 --> 00:56:00,100
Having a Claudine Léger moment.

1069
00:56:01,040 --> 00:56:03,160
Are you fondling yourself, Doc?

1070
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:04,980
We need to know here at the other end.

1071
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:06,320
That's not a Claudine Léger moment.

1072
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,440
Actually, I'm spinning a cocoon with the silk that I pull out of my ass.

1073
00:56:11,440 --> 00:56:13,860
So you're saying you're a Spider-Man?

1074
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:16,180
Spider-Man, do whatever the hell you want.

1075
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:17,920
I have a rectal spinneret.

1076
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:22,760
A Claudine Léger moment has to include a 10-inch long kitchen knife.

1077
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:25,680
It looks like a very, very tampon string.

1078
00:56:25,780 --> 00:56:26,780
A very long tampon string.

1079
00:56:26,780 --> 00:56:27,320
And a Luger.

1080
00:56:27,920 --> 00:56:29,360
Yes, a Luger.

1081
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,340
I'm weaving an ornate cocoon out of it,

1082
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:34,920
which I will crawl into for the change, for the metamorphosis.

1083
00:56:35,480 --> 00:56:41,220
Can I rub your hard carapace when you come out, Dr. Lagune?

1084
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:41,720
May I have fun, Dr. Lagune?

1085
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,380
I rub you around your three-pronged breasts.

1086
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:48,480
Your hard carapace is fully, fully enlarged.

1087
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,200
Oh, my God, and it's glowing.

1088
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:53,720
It's amazing, but it's giving off a very, very bad odor.

1089
00:56:53,840 --> 00:56:57,220
Could you please put it back in the little case I have provided for you?

1090
00:56:57,560 --> 00:56:58,240
Thank you.

1091
00:56:59,140 --> 00:57:02,720
The object in constructing me was to prevent war.

1092
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,140
This object is a tank.

1093
00:57:05,540 --> 00:57:07,800
I will not permit war.

1094
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,500
It is wasteful and pointless.

1095
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,500
This X-Day sucks.

1096
00:57:18,440 --> 00:57:24,860
This is the absolute worst fucking X-Day in the history of fucking X-Days.

1097
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,380
And, yes, it's all my fault.

1098
00:57:30,920 --> 00:57:35,840
Oh, brothers and sisters, there are times when the butt hurt got deep.

1099
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:41,200
And it was all I could do to keep it from going to bed.

1100
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:41,200


1101
00:57:41,200 --> 00:57:43,140
I could keep Pisces afloat in it.

1102
00:57:45,820 --> 00:57:47,880
I wasn't even going to get my feet wet.

1103
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:51,980
But, yes, it was an effort.

1104
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:55,960
I had to brainwash Pisces into doing all this.

1105
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:05,540
Because I'm lazy, and I don't want to have to go to each and every one of you and give you a personal fucking brainwashing.

1106
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:08,600
There just aren't enough hours in the fucking day for that.

1107
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:11,180
Because some of these people are just crazy.

1108
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:11,180


1109
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:12,860
Some of these people are just fucking nuts.

1110
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,200
Yeah, let me tell you, brothers and sisters.

1111
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:22,260
How many people do you know who are totally fucking nuts?

1112
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,640
It's real easy to slip into the realm of nutdom.

1113
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:34,220
It's very easy to slip into that realm of nutdom, brothers and sisters.

1114
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:38,380
You see, we live in a prison of lies.

1115
00:58:39,580 --> 00:58:40,620
Mad apes.

1116
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:45,600
Crammed into boxes with our civilization dangling precariously from a spider strand of lies.

1117
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:54,700
Our collective belief systems programmed with imaginary monsters and magic bird men to keep us from going ape shit crazy.

1118
00:58:56,900 --> 00:58:59,260
Let us examine that turn of phrase.

1119
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:01,000
Ape shit crazy.

1120
00:59:02,620 --> 00:59:09,980
It's interesting that when that spider strand of lies snaps inside a person's head, that person goes ape shit crazy.

1121
00:59:09,980 --> 00:59:12,040
And it's implied that he's gone insane.

1122
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:15,520
But I put forth this proposition, brothers and sisters.

1123
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:23,440
An ape who has suddenly had his lies taken from him goes ape shit sane.

1124
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:32,220
He may appear insane to you and probably to himself.

1125
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:38,160
Or there's also the other swing where everybody else is crazy but them.

1126
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:46,940
And they may appear, like I said, because many of you are still dangling from the thread of lies.

1127
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:51,360
And so it seems like it's much more of a tragic butt hurt.

1128
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,580
You learn that there's no magic space daddy.

1129
01:00:00,160 --> 01:00:04,540
He learns that those he loves will either rape him in the ass or die.

1130
01:00:05,800 --> 01:00:09,700
He sees himself for the first time as a fragile, rotting ape.

1131
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:13,840
Whose every accomplishment will turn to dust and be forgotten.

1132
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:15,960
As will he himself.

1133
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:29,580
Money, borders, property, gods, magic, all of our convenient fictions fall before the great thread breaking scythe of big daddy death.

1134
01:00:31,780 --> 01:00:36,400
One day, we will all go ape shit in his presence.

1135
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:41,660
Nobody's biography ever has a happy ending.

1136
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,520
But what now you may ask.

1137
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:47,740
Somebody ask, what now?

1138
01:00:48,560 --> 01:00:54,980
What now you have asked, as you may, because that's what it says in my notes here.

1139
01:00:55,040 --> 01:00:56,060
What now you may ask.

1140
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,000
You see dad, I knew this shit was going to happen long before it did.

1141
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:04,600
If I think too much about these lies now.

1142
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:06,380
I may go premonitory.

1143
01:01:06,380 --> 01:01:07,240
Prematurely ape shit.

1144
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,820
Well my friends, that's why I'm here tonight.

1145
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,120
I'm not here to offer you another strand of lies.

1146
01:01:14,320 --> 01:01:15,180
No sir ma'am.

1147
01:01:15,260 --> 01:01:17,920
I'm here to offer you a hefty rope of lies.

1148
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:19,500
New and better lies.

1149
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:21,620
21st century lies.

1150
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:25,580
Oozing with hot sex and armies of killer robots from outer space.

1151
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:30,420
Designed to ensure you don't go prematurely ape shit sane.

1152
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:36,140
I know that most of you are oppressed.

1153
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:36,360
I know that most of you are oppressed.

1154
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,540
Under the yoke of conspiracy slave masters.

1155
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:45,220
And every day you dream and wish you could just scream fuck you and start killing them.

1156
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:52,500
As well as all of the other pinks who hang their steaming buckets of shit on your yoke.

1157
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:01,600
I know that day after day that dream haunts you all as the yoke gets heavier and heavier.

1158
01:02:02,180 --> 01:02:04,220
I know you cry out to the heavens.

1159
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:08,980
Will I ever have the slack I so crave?

1160
01:02:11,460 --> 01:02:13,800
Does the wolf man have a pointy red dick?

1161
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:16,740
Fuck yes he does.

1162
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:20,760
As you'll see when the saucers arrive to take us to planet X.

1163
01:02:20,920 --> 01:02:22,840
In the book of the subgenius it is written.

1164
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:27,960
The stupider it looks, the more important it probably is.

1165
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,840
Look around you brothers and sisters.

1166
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:34,080
What could be stupider?

1167
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:45,480
Than a pack of socially retarded subgeniuses listening to a tattooed fat man screaming that flying saucers are going to carry away a secret tribe of sasquatches to an outer space paradise.

1168
01:02:49,940 --> 01:02:52,400
In the book of the subgenius it is written.

1169
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:58,440
Bob makes a million dollars every time he fucks up.

1170
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:05,420
I don't see any millionaires here.

1171
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:12,620
The fact that he hasn't made a million dollars off the church of the subgenius just proves he didn't fuck up.

1172
01:03:13,160 --> 01:03:16,100
The end is nigh my yeti kin.

1173
01:03:16,940 --> 01:03:20,440
On planet X there are sex gods and goddesses.

1174
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:26,100
Triple rainbow shitting unicorns and big dick leprechauns.

1175
01:03:26,100 --> 01:03:30,420
Friendly rape bears with cotton candy chlamydia.

1176
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:32,240
Chocolate dinosaurs.

1177
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:36,180
Mermaids and mermen made of living cocaine.

1178
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:39,680
Wolf men with pointy red dicks.

1179
01:03:40,700 --> 01:03:42,640
And you can fuck them all.

1180
01:03:44,100 --> 01:03:45,580
Or kill them for fun.

1181
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:52,480
Just wait.

1182
01:03:52,480 --> 01:03:57,920
Just wait until you lay your bugging eyes on the valley of awesome titties.

1183
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:07,620
You'll shit a perfectly round turd when you see your personal yacht floating in biscuits and gravy lake.

1184
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,860
You'll cum a gallon on the faces of the suck midgets.

1185
01:04:16,660 --> 01:04:17,820
But first.

1186
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:20,960
Vengeance is yours.

1187
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:25,220
With every breath we shall hunt down our pink enemies.

1188
01:04:25,580 --> 01:04:29,800
Each day we will spill their blood till it rains down from the skies.

1189
01:04:30,240 --> 01:04:34,820
The excess ships are not just pleasure saucers and escape vessels.

1190
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:43,080
They are also an armada of attack ships loaded with the most horrible and lethal array of weapons imaginable.

1191
01:04:44,260 --> 01:04:45,380
Ion cannons.

1192
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,960
Killer wasp drones with chainsaw limbs.

1193
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:51,840
And AIDS darts.

1194
01:04:52,840 --> 01:05:00,620
Giant flying robot bears with napalm diarrhea and electrified rape batons.

1195
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,940
Flesh eating missiles.

1196
01:05:05,660 --> 01:05:07,780
Bad luck bombs.

1197
01:05:08,520 --> 01:05:16,760
You'll bust a gut laughing as the Westboro Baptist Church gets crop dusted with queer gas.

1198
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:21,960
Yes.

1199
01:05:22,040 --> 01:05:26,000
All this and more awaits us when Bob's promise rings true.

1200
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:28,700
And when it does, the very sky will crack open.

1201
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:31,540
And all will nail and gnash their teeth.

1202
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:33,920
Because they know the time has come.

1203
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:36,060
And they will look to the skies.

1204
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:39,240
And they will see the face of Dobbs looking back.

1205
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,640
And on that day, they will reap it.

1206
01:05:50,940 --> 01:06:01,580
Thank you, Dr. Katahdin Lagume, for 26 years of killer rants, brilliant concepts, hair-raising stunts, and slack.

1207
01:06:01,900 --> 01:06:05,560
That rant was from the 14X Day drill in 2007.

1208
01:06:06,280 --> 01:06:11,880
Next week, we'll have another hour of Lagume preaching and radio memories, too.

1209
01:06:12,120 --> 01:06:19,940
In the meantime, you might take a look at subgenius.com, especially the devivals of yore, or past devivals.

1210
01:06:19,940 --> 01:06:30,260
Starting in the 90s, because those are full of detailed reports on the various crazy stunts and situations he helped us create in real life.

1211
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:31,940
With lots of photos.

1212
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:38,080
There's also some good videos of his rants on my YouTube channel called Rev Stag.

1213
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:42,020
And there's also a Christmas twofer special going on.

1214
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:48,620
And Dr. Lagume's ghost would surely encourage you to take this chance to get right with Bob.

1215
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:49,920
And get some good stuff.

1216
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,080
And somebody else right, too.

1217
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,700
That's subgenius.com.

1218
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:56,020
Praise Bob.
