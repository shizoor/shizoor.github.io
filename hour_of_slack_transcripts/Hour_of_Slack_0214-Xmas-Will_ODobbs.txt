Ah, White Christmas.
You know, it reminds me, I don't know if you heard this or not,
but supposedly last week, Bing Crosby's youngest boy
put a gun to his head and blew his brains out.
That song just happened to remind me of that.
I understand Bing, the derbingle,
was kind of an orator.
He was an abusive father.
He was into strictness with his children.
You know, he was...
Boy, don't make me get the belt out now.
Make me beat you black and blue now.
I don't want to be doing that.
It has nothing to do with anything at all
with what to do with what this show is about tonight.
And the show tonight is about Christmas.
A subgenius Christmas.
And we're going to be getting to it in just a minute.
If you have any questions about Christmas
or...
for that matter, the Church of the Subgenius
and its avatar of Slack, J.R. Bob Dobbs,
feel free to call the radio station here tonight
at 823-7490
and we'll sit around and yak about Bob or something.
So, uh...
see if the cassette decks are working any better
than the turntables here.
Hold on, please.
The Subgenius Radio Ministry.
All Slack.
All Slack.
One, two, Santa's coming for you.
Three, four, you better lock your door.
Five, six, grab a crucifix.

Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!

Oh, so nice to hear Reverend Yukon Jack's Christmas themes again from his kitty cat singing to you, dear friends.
Yes, this is, uh, listen, for those of you doubtful about the hour of slack, stay tuned because I'm going to be playing a Christmas carol so horrible, so anti-human, so absolutely, I mean, believe me, you want a tape of the song, the Christmas carol, that I'm, recorded right here in Dallas, by six sick minds, friends, that I'm going to play about halfway into the show, about 9.30, I guess.
Uh, please do stay tuned and keep those recorders running because it's a Christmas show, it's a combination of old Christmas shows, but it's also got a lot of new Christmas because Christmas is fun! Yes, fun! We're having fun, aren't we, Will?
Fun!
And especially the horrible, horrible, horrible hymn, and the Christmas carol is what it is that will come up. Dear, dear friends, it's so purty.
Everybody worried about that Tommy Bond, but no one worried about the day my Lord shall come, but he'll hit like an atom bomb when he comes, when he comes.
Well, well, in 1945...
The atomic bomb became alive. In 1949, the USA got very wise. They bombed out a country across the line. Had an atom bomb of the very same kind. People got worried all over the land, just like the people got in Japan. But God told Elijah he'd send down fire, send down fire...
Ching, no, no, no. You see these television screens? I'll turn on number one. What do you see?
The White House, the Christmas tree on the lawn.
And here's number two.
Now, what do you see?
I'm not sure. Looks like, yeah, a missile at a rocket site.
Very good. That rocket, by the way, is ready for immediate launching and carries a payload of five nuclear warheads, each 100 times as powerful as the Hiroshima bomb.
But what has this got to do with...
Patience, young man. Patience. And now, screen number three.
Another rocket.
And four. And five. And six.
There you are. The whole picture.
Five multiple-head rockets.
All tied to the controls in the war room of the Pentagon and targeted on our enemies.
But the only person authorized to push the button is...
Yes?
The President of the United States.
Precisely.
But we're not at war. He's not about to push that button.
Quite right. Not that button. And not knowingly. But there are buttons and buttons.
I still don't...
Like the button that will turn on the lights on that day.
That beautiful Christmas tree.
On the White House lawn?
Right.
You mean to say that button is tied into the rocket launch system you just showed me?
Now you're getting it. It's tied in by a remote control circuit I secretly installed.
And when the President pushes the button that lights the tree...
Good Lord.
For a brief moment, the lights will go on. And then a bomb concealed in one of the tree ornaments will detonate,
destroying everyone in the immediate area.
Including the President?
Especially the President.
And simultaneously, five beautiful rockets will soar like avenging angels through the night sky.
And when they reach their targets, they will light up the whole world.
Now the passion dissolving and cleansing flame of divine love through this room, building, city...
Even dove nods, even dobbed by...
And through the minds of all beings...
Let's penetrate the sacred radiation.
With your fiery incendiary missiles of mercy,
burn out the hate and normalcy which has sought to subdue our church and our abnormality.
Sure, let's go in.
Purify them with your cleansing radioactive breath till nothing human exists.
And now...
The snow-carrying duck flew off into the air and charged into a million energy-efficient particles
that spread across the entire universe just like their show used to.
And everyone is worried...
My lord about the atomic bomb.
No one is worried, об этом вором
...about the Day my Lord shall come
but he'll hit...
and when he comes...
When he comes...

Back we go.
Oh, dear friends, this is Magic Mose.
What is it? What is this?
Say, do we have any druids in the audience?
Well, hi, yeah, this one's for you.
Magic Mose and his royal rockers here.
Have yourselves a groovy little solstice.
Mithras won his fight.
From now on, the days are longer than the nights.
Yeah, have yourselves a groovy little solstice.
Nosh out on druid food.
Yeah, make little pigs of yourselves.
Then we'll all dance naked in a fair shoe.
If you are a dazzling urbanite,
a smug suburbanite,
hey, that's cool.
You don't have to lead a boring country life
to groove on natural life.
As a rule,
someday soon
we'll all dance nude together
if utility rates allow.
You know, those funky Boston Edison guys, you know.
Until then,
we'll don our ritual robes and bow.
To have ourselves a groovy little solstice now.
Take it away, guys.
Oh, yeah, all you pagans out there
ought to get into this special Christmas show
here on the Hour of Slack.
This is Magic Mose and his royal rockers.
So, y'all have a good time.


You having a good time this evening, huh?
I sure am.
Aren't you?
Yeah.
Are they putting boots in the drinks tonight, huh?
Mm-hmm.
Oh, yeah.
Well, remember, folks,
the more you drink, the better we sound.
Yeah.
The better I feel.
The more you drink.
Praise Bob.
Oh, it may be witchcraft.
The royal rockers, ladies and gentlemen.
Aren't they wonderful?
But it's wonderful.
It's wonderful.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Absolutely.
The boys thank you.
Thank you.
All right, thank you.
Oh, we love you.
Hey, we're swinging now.
Yeah.
It is turnover.
The time of the year when all things sell,
the end of the year sale.
Oh, yeah.
So, come and get it, everyone,
and just buy our products.
Now, are we, is Christmas,
I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus
or his death when they nailed him?
Well, that,
that's the ancient, ancient subgenie,
but the present subgenie,
try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now
and sell everything to the pigs.
Oh, yes.
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.
And it was something else in between there,
but before it was,
after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season,
it was something else,
but I think they started a war over it.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, friends, we've got our own special,
special Christmas carol that we're going to play
that's, that we're inventing as we go right now.

Well, friends, what do you think?
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here?
Or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob?
The Santai Bob, as he's been referred to in some early prescriptures.
It's so separate. It's so separate. It's so separate. It's so separate.
New from Tonga.
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob.
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.
Shut up, pink boy.
No way. I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien tool.
Bob Dobbs comes with rockets, pipe, head launcher, jainer device,

You hear it here.
But you feel it there.
Skeletor figure, Castle Grayskull and Thunder Punch He-Man figure each sold separately.
You put the castle together.
With He-Man over there, Grayskull will be mine.
Like I said, bone face.

Sure, son. All of us moms have TVs, so we know that polyester hoes are just chock-full of conspiracy genetic coding and administrative byproducts.
That's right, Mom. One serving of polyester hoes can turn your blue-collar children into what appears to be a bag of pink pus stuffed into a white shirt and tie.
And remember, there's a whole dead executive in every can of Chunky Style Polyester Hoes.
You have lost your reward. You shall enter heaven as a servant without a single soul to your credit.
It's unfair. It's so unfair. I've worked so hard for the kingdom all these years. It's unfair that I should lose all my credits now.

January 3rd, 1970.
But when the righteous turneth away from his righteousness, and committeth iniquity, and doeth according to all the abominations that the wicked man doeth, shall he live?
All his righteousness that he hath done shall not be mentioned. In his trespass that he hath trespassed, and in his sin that he hath sinned, in them shall he die.
This simply means that if you backslide, turn away from God, all the rewards that you've accumulated shall be lost.
And if you do not, you shall be
You mean you aren't going to church again today?
Baby, don't bother me. You know there's some on the day off. I don't have to live in church to be saved.
Dana, if you aren't careful, you're going to miss out with the Lord completely.
Come on, Kim.
Well, my son, you heard the word.
I think we're all going to miss out on the Lord.
You were warned.
Were you so foolish as you think you could outwit the law of God?
No, we actually are not.
You have returned and have been saved as of our...
See, friends, here's the thing.
When they told us that we were damned and we're going to go to hell, you know, what else could we do but start a church?
Ah, yes.
But the glory and the splendor that could have...
Switch over.
We're going to some...
What have we got here on turntable one, I think?
Throughout the ceaseless ages of eternity is an awful price to pay.
It is an awful price to pay.
Mom, Buck's calling you.
And we do...
We're going to seriously address this issue.
But in the meantime, we have the problem of who is the Santa Bob?
Were there any readings here on the Santa Bob?
Didn't you have I'm a Bob on the show last week?
No.
We had a show before and we had to pay...
Yeah, that's right.
That's right.
We did have the I'm a Bob on the show last week.
It's a...
It's a Bob and a Euro Bob.
Santa Bob and Maria.
But, you know, we ought to talk a little bit about where Bob's and I'm a Bob's tonight, Reverend Stang.
I can sense a little bit of that coming on Red Room Stang.
The where Bob's and I'm a...
Those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.
And they go shuffling through the...
The snow on their nameless, hideous errands.
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float in through the keyhole.
Oh, friends, it's tough.
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.
You gotta send your money to the Santa Bob.
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids...
That Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.
Can you believe that?
They asked...
The kids were asking if their parents...
Maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.
And the mom said, no, no, he won't because he bills us.
We can't afford that.
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.
Yeah, what kind of a Christmas season is this where Santa Claus is starting to bill you?
And the delivery.
Can you imagine the delivery?
The cost of bringing that stuff up from the North Pole?
That's going to be added on, too, friends.
Even the Gimme Bob's sort of pale into comparison with that.
Yeah.
Well, friends, we've got to play a public service cartridge here.
It says on the log.
I hope you're enjoying the music.
But when we come back, we're going to play part one of our collection of Christmas music.
So, genius style.
We've got the Santa's on a Diet by Zug's Rift.
Santa Claus is Coming to Rape Your Wife.
by Mechanical Sterility.
Mommy?
And the Manson Family Christmas.
Mom?
So, here it be, folks.
Santa's on a Diet.
Now he has to eat instead of those stupid candy canes.
It all started when he accidentally sat on one of his elves.

His famous white beard was long enough to cover his tiny penis, which had gone soft in the cold shower.
Everyone had to leave the steam room, so Santa would have room to sit down.
Some idiot threw him a medicine ball, but it bounced off his belly and knocked down the wall like the Battle of Gettysburg and the Battle of the Bulge.
But when he got home, nobody recognized him. Instead of a chimney, he could fit through a keyhole like a skeleton key.
And this one, dear friends, is Santa Claus is Coming to Rape Your Wife by a band called Mechanical.
The singer, I think, is Reverend M. Schaefer of the Church of the Subgenius. Listen to this beautiful, beautiful song.
The music is a little bit like a traditional music, but it's a little bit more than that.

But, uh, it's a little bit more than a traditional music.
Oh, one, sorry about what we said just a few minutes ago. No offense. And don't tape anything you hear, okay? Don't tape anything.

Oh, yes, dear friends.
That's a problem with Reverend Stang.
He just stops in the middle of a sentence like that sometimes.
And he often starts up.
Ho, ho, ho!
Ho, ho, ho!
Merry Christmas!
Mrs. Claus!
Oh, yes, dear friends.
Christmas.
The season of turnover
when the shelves must be cleared.
I can't get that call right now, dear friends.
You know, I got, I got,
after all these friendly calls,
I got one call from some,
somebody who, who said,
what are y'all, the usual thing,
the usual question.
What are y'all trying to do?
And I go,
we're trying to give you some slack, okay?
You know, they go, who's Bob?
I said, well, give me your address
and I'll send you some information.
Or whatever, you know,
I'll give the number at the end of the broadcast.
And they, uh,
and, and this person, you know,
I knew there was something that they weren't saying.
And finally, he goes,
well, I just hope that,
it was something like,
I just hope that, you know,
you can get right with Jesus
or something like that.
And just hung up.
He hung up.
That was the key point.
He said he didn't want to hear
what I had to say back about that
because, you know, see,
a subgenius has so much faith
that,
that he not only can accept
somebody making fun of Bob,
stomping on a picture of Bob,
he'll do it himself.
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.
Bob is such a good friend
that he can insult Bob.
Now, we subgeni,
I hate to get on my soapbox
in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,
but we subgeni may be bad,
but our way of bad is holy,
is holy compared to the evil
of so, not all,
by any means,
but so many American fundamentalist,
charismatic evangelicals,
et cetera, in general.
Of course,
they and their corresponding types
in Iran, Russia, Libya,
South Africa, et cetera,
if you ask me,
are actually the ace
up the devil's sleeve.
Wolves in sheep's clothing, friends,
just like Jesus warned about.
I, we're,
Jesus and Bob, like we say,
our old drinking buddies,
got nothing against Jesus.
It's just his fan club.
And now, we aren't saying that Bob
is the ace up God's,
he's more like the smear on God's handkerchief,
just like you or me.
But the uptight rival cults,
they don't think God has a handkerchief.
Uh-uh, no,
because God's perfect.
He doesn't even sneeze.
We're made in his image,
except that we have all these nasty parts
attached to us,
and we have to go in the secret room,
the bathroom,
to do awful things.
But God, oh, he's clean and pure,
according to them.
Oh, and he's male,
but he doesn't excrete juices.
He doesn't sweat and smelly stuff
out of him like we do,
because we sin.
Oh, yeah, we all sin.
We're bad.
We're worthless.
We're no good to God
unless we sign a contract with his agent.
Well, friend, Jesus himself,
he spouted just about as many great punchlines
as Bob, probably more.
But, and this is true,
this is historical fact,
the very early mainstream Christian church
methodically censored about half
of the existing gospels about Jesus.
And this, I'm not kidding,
you can go to any real bookstore
and pick up the censored gospels
that they finally found years later.
They took out the parts
where Jesus specifically said
that every person had equal access
to the Lord,
and that you didn't need no preacher
between you and him.
That, in fact, was probably his main point,
now lost in antiquity,
that you were the son or daughter of God
just as much as Jesus was,
or Bob, see?
But that's too humanistic
for the consumerist.
Listen, this is very, very important
because every second switching
any matter of sources



perspective on the gospel,
you should just look straight
into your heart.

Baby, I want to talk to you for this Christmas.
Because Christmas holds a lot of memories for me.
Baby, I've had a lot of hard times at Christmastime.
I can remember me and my brother when I was about six years old.
We hung our stockings up over the mantelpiece and the health department made us take them down.
Baby, me and my brother wore tennis shoes so long.
Now let me tell you how long we wore them.
We wore tennis shoes Indian summer, Easter, Thanksgiving.
Thanksgiving, Halloween day, New Year's and Christmas.
Baby, we wore our tennis shoes so long till we wore them out up to the name on the ankle.
When we got ready to lay down, we didn't take them off.
All we had to do was fold them back, baby.
I remember my father well, you know.
My father used to wake up every morning with a headache.
He used to have, you know what caused it then?
He used to put a...
stocking cap on his head and put a knock light in front of it.
Daddy wake up with that bumping headache.
And he said, the kid said, my head's hurting so bad.
He said, I don't know what Santa's going to get y'all for Christmas, but he's going to bring you something.
So Daddy took that old rifle and went outside and shot up in the air and come back inside and told us the biggest lie I ever heard.
He said, kid, Santa just committed suicide.

and I wanted to thank you for coming out to Dobstown.

I wanted to show you the...
Oh, look at these little scamps, and to think these used to be slackless children.
What did you kids say?
Oh, yes.
That's so darling.
Does that warm my Bob Glander or what?
Yeah, hey, would you like to use one of these kids?
Yeah, yeah, I...
Warm it up a little more? They're available.
Yeah, uh...
A discount for our...
Our subscribers, uh, our church family subscribers
can adopt one of these little scamps for a mere, oh, a couple thousand,
on top of your usual annual fee, and...
That's right, put them to work.
Yeah.
Take them home, put them to work.
Ugh.
They've been trained, and they'll do all sorts of tricks.
They've been trained to slack off.
Just try to get work out of some of these little guys.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Print Bob!
And the X-Men!
On the twelfth day of Christmas, my true love gave to me
Twelve kids that dreamt of love and magic mushrooms,
Ten of them...



Nine yoddy buttons,
Nine caps of dropping,
Eight spoons of smorgasbord,
Seven whites of buzzing,
Six joints of smorgasbord,
Five alleles,
Four grams of hash,
Three pounds of grass,
Two hundred mills,
And a tab of pure, whole,
Unshined LSD!
One day, the rabbit woke up and realized he wanted a hamburger.
Boy!
Said the rabbit to himself.
A hamburger would sure hit the spot right now.
But, having never had a hamburger,
The rabbit was at a loss as to where one could be found.
I know.
He said.
I'll ask my old friend.
The chestnut tree.
Ap!
You.
From Tonka.
Now you're in my evil clutches, Bob.
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal.
Shut up,umuzikی!
No way, I'll never sell out to the conspiracy.
Cus a little of my rocket pipe alien tool?

I love him. I adore him. My breath, my sunshine.
Then all sorts of serious problems in the Church of the Subgenius,
many of which include trying to find the right equipment in the radio station,
with so many confusing issues at hand, including whether or not the Santa did actually die at the hands of the cavalry
that day on the Mount of Skulls, or whether the over-modulation can be helped at some time in the far future.
So, friends, this is a song about...
Oh, I see, I see, I can control that he comes in and out.
I can control that he comes in and out of here.
We can now control the hiss.
That means that their minds can likewise be controlled by subliminal messages planted in the hiss that goes out with this show.
Stay there.
Please stay there.
I'll be right back.
Remember, we're commanding, not asking.
So be firm.
Don't keep quiet.
Don't keep quiet.
Don't keep quiet.
Don't keep quiet.
Don't keep quiet.
Don't keep quiet.
Don't keep quiet.
Don't keep quiet.
Don't keep quiet.
Don't keep quiet.
Don't keep quiet.
Don't keep quiet.
you've heard of it out of New Jersey.
Toilet Suck is a fantastic cultural artifact.
And what we're playing right now, friends,
is an album by this fellow.
It says,
The irritating sounds heard on this recording
are not intended to be digested as reenactments of actual events.
Sounds based on personal activity.
Monsoon familiar mechanized calf Jesus.
And it is copyrighted.
The name of this tune is
The Manson Family Christmas.
The Manson Family Christmas
It's a game, it's always been a game
Shortly after Shady and I
Got new words she do enjoy
Creepy crawlies let down
We have to let love happen
Charlie is our love
We are Charlie's love
It's our one
It's all happening now
Listen to that beautiful
Charlie Manson Family Christmas.
Yes.
You know, that was, those were
different kind of family values, I think, in those days.
But who says the 60s can't live again here in the 80s?
And now, your local multinational corporation presents
some energy-saving holiday tips from Mr. Abernathy.
Hello.
Hello.
Your local multinational corporation
has sent you a message.
Send me to this remote point in Australia
to prove a point.
Conservation can be dangerous.
In this remote aboriginal village
just outside of Sydney, Australia,
the natives were told by their government
to slow down in their consumption
of gasoline and fossil fuels.
Unfortunately, the files
in the government energy office
on this town were lost.
So, nobody bothered to tell them
when it was okay to go back
to normal energy use.
Sadly enough, this town has become
the victim of what we call an energy surplus.
And the natives have been forced to convert
many of their dishwashers, lawn mowers, and refrigerators
into these homemade, energy-hungry,
miniature racing guards.
Boys and girls in the village between the ages of 14 and 20
must stay behind the wheels of these primitive, high-speed,
and dangerous machines for up to 90 hours at a stretch,
just so their village can receive the next fuel shipment
from their local multinational distributor.
And we'll keep on shipping it on our way.
The
carbon monoxide, the silent winter killer, lurks everywhere.
So, if you have a gas stove,
oil burner, or open flame,
make sure all the doors and windows in the room
are tightly sealed so that none of that nasty carbon monoxide
can sneak in.
Thanks, and happy holidays.
This is Mr. Abernathy signing off from your town to you.
Scott, you made your choice.
You rejected my word, you rejected me.
And to your eternal soul.
You have found that only could you afford to give to God
that which was his, but you could not afford to do otherwise.
The Senate still stands.
From deep into outer darkness, where there is wailing and gnashing of teeth.
Sir, please, give me just one more chance, sir.
I don't want to go to hell, sir!
No, no, no!
I have been found.

I have been found.


Let go of my God of hell!
No!
...as reliable as he could be.
And the children saved who could laugh and play just the same as you and me.
The talebearer will be at the judgment.
I suspect that here will be a special place in hell for such beings.
David the Psalmist said in Psalms 50 and 1 and 3,
Lord, who may abide in thy tabernacle,
who may dwell on thy holy mountain,
the man of blameless life,
who does that which is right and speaks the truth from his heart,
who has no malice on his tongue,
who never wrongs a plan and tells no lies,
who never steps forward on the road to peace.
Thank you.
There will be those who have destroyed the lives and reputation of others.
These Gospers will be cast.
Into the lowest, darkest pit.
I'll be turning.
They're going to be cast.
Oh, the next dependence.
Into the pit.
Mommy?
Oh.
Why do my feet hurt so bad, Mommy?
Um.
Pastor Naked?
I mean, Dr. DeBrogfran?
If you need to do your public service messages,
this is a good time to do it.
We can, we can, uh.
Oh, oh, we got a phone call.
Yep.
Oh.
No.
They wanted to know if we could do the, uh,
mention the curse of Neegie over the air,
but we're not allowed to mention the name of Neegie.
No, whatever.
We really shouldn't talk about Neegie over the air
because he's a demon.
You know, for every Bob particle, there is a Neegie particle,
and for every Santa Claus particle,
there's a Bill that comes in the mail.
No, don't fall for it.
For wherever you find Bob, you must also find Neegie.
Neegie.






That's true.
There's a dark side to the cult and to the Santa Bob.
You know, friends, because if you better watch out,
you better not cry,
you better not, uh,
You can't hide from Santa Claus.
You can't hide from Santa Claus.
That's right, friends.
You just better not.
Whatever you do, don't do it.
You haven't told him about jingle farking bells yet.
No.
Jingle farking bells, jingle farking bells,
jingle jingle any day.
Oh, what gosh darned fun it is to ride
in an old Corvair with the top down in the dead of winter.
Oh, it's another lovely Christmas hamper.
Friends, try to imagine
somewhere in the snowy north,
the Santa Bob trudging mindlessly through the Himalayan snows,
driven by strange forces to complete his nameless,
errant, and he may show up at your house.
My friend, if you've been a bad subgenius or a halfway subgenius,
or if we keep getting tangled up in these other shows
and having strange microphone situations.
Oh, hell swami?
I was wondering, I didn't mean to cut off your, uh,
your, uh, hymnal there.
I didn't mean to interfere with your freedom of religion or anything.
Well, I know, Dr. Stang, that you wouldn't have in your heart to do something as,
uh, despicable as that.
No, I wonder what happens if I push this, though.
It's, it's supposed to close the gateway that'll keep those other shows out.
Hold it.
Easy it was to dip on the floor.
Oh, yes, dear friends.
Voices.
Huh?
The sky.
And you shall see.
Friends, we're once again attempting to do our Christmas show in one channel only.
Is that a mic?
I guess if we turn this mic up all the way to, uh,
the star that you remain.
We've, this is, I think, friends, will be the only show,
uh, where you'll hear Bob and the Dylantones,
lovely version of, uh, White Christmas.
Friends, this is, this is Bob and his band, the Dylantones.
I think you should enjoy this.

Praise Bob.
His promise rings true
for a while.
I'm dreaming
of a white Christmas
with every Christmas
card I write.
May your days be
merry and bright.
And may all
your Christmases
all your Christmases
all your Christmases
all your Christmases
all your
Christmases
be
white.
May your days be
merry and bright.
