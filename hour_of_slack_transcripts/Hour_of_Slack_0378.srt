1
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:03,440
Fire! Fire! Fire!

2
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:06,900
Fire! Fire! Fire!

3
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:09,840
Well, it's halftime.

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:11,740
God's exciting game, dear friends.

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,360
And you bet.

6
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,980
This is the All-American Football Crusade.

7
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:16,940
Coming to you this week from the convenient

8
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,560
Karate Baptist Chapel of the Bulls.

9
00:00:19,580 --> 00:00:21,760
Built right down close to the freeway.

10
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,540
Because God loves all you

11
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:25,080
safe drivers best.

12
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:27,480
Yes, friends, this is the mighty

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,780
Reverend Bob Tackle.

14
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,220
Fans asking, what happens when you're

15
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,440
shaking inside to go wide?

16
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:34,720
When you go out on a pattern and get overthrown?

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,080
When it's man-to-man defense and you

18
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,960
anticipate the snap? What a rush!

19
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:40,800
Look out! Another quick penalty.

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,020
Another personal foul. An elbow

21
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,120
is caught and you see it. Is it sudden death

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,860
or sudden victory?

23
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:49,160
Well, friends,

24
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:51,560
the dual isolation can slow you down.

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:52,680
But you know,

26
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,500
the other day a guy once played ball with Notre Dame.

27
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:57,200
He's a pretty powerful man

28
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,280
in state politics now.

29
00:00:58,780 --> 00:00:59,060
And the ball is not just a ball,

30
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,060


31
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,820
football with real life.

32
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,720
It's a game you can feel a clean hatred

33
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,740
for your opponent, he said.

34
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,700
It's a clean hatred since it's only

35
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,060
symbolic in a jersey.

36
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:10,120
Well, it's almost time out down on the field now.

37
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,440
And you know, he's watching with you.

38
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,840
He's the number one fan.

39
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,740
And whatever happens, he's enjoying it

40
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:16,240
because he's hot dog

41
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,180
and not the other way around.

42
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:19,560
There's no score yet.

43
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,560
It's your ball, dear friends.

44
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,160
Don't give it back.

45
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:26,940
You've been listening to the All-American Football Crusade

46
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,760
with Reverend Bob Tackle.

47
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:30,520
And the game just concluded.

48
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,500
Oral Roberts outscored

49
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:34,760
Chelsea Daly 11-13.

50
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:36,640
.

51
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:36,640

64
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:43,800


65
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:43,840
.

66
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:43,900
.

67
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:43,920

83
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:46,900


84
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:46,900


85
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:46,900


86
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,060
.

87
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,060


88
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:49,060


89

.

96
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:31,340
I must not fear. Fear is the mind killer. Fear is the little death which brings me.

97
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:53,220
Bob, it's a Bob world after all. It's a Bob world after all. It's a Bob world after all.

98
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:57,160
It's a Bob, E, Bob world.

99
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:00,860
Let's do this.

100
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:06,200
Subgenius Radio Ministry, hour of slack.

101
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:15,820
I want to make diversity of the forms open to my words.

102
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:23,040
You that divide and multiply it, hear my sounds.

103
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:29,980
I make yield league to you, ancient associates.

104
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,080
And fellow wanderers.

105
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:37,220
You that move the heart in fur and scale.

106
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,540
I join with you, you that sing bright and subtle.

107
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,440
Making shapes that my throat cannot tell.

108
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,680
He is Bob.

109
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:55,540
Eager for fun.

110
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,220
He wears a smile.

111
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,960
E.B.M.

112
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


113
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


114
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


115
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


116
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


117
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


118
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


119
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


120
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


121
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


122
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


123
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


124
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


125
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


126
00:03:59,960 --> 00:03:59,960


127
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,840
Ready to run.

128
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,040
I want you to put your hands on the TV.

129
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,860
Finally there's an end to your life.

130
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:14,660
Though this is your end.

131
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,520
Hopefully you will pass the army,

132
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:21,540
I won't be put down for my sake.

133
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,700
E,B.M.

134
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:24,700


135
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,100
I take applied NAUётся,

136
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:26,460


137
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:26,460


138
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:26,580
I not only take applied NAUpedo andACH thatcan,

139
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:26,580


140
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:26,640
Also, my teeth cannot cred sini.

141
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,220


142
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,220


143
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:27,220


144
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,000
I'll put up a other euphoric eyeball in a's bag,

145
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,000


146
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:28,200
I will complete that Adjust your Io and other internal ór?

147
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:30,520
This is Baldwin.

148
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,460
Welcome to the ground.

149
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,820
I'm not connected.

150
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,260
Bob, are you leaving?

151
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,860
I don't believe in this stupid thing.

152
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,040
I'm not going to leave.

153
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:42,260
I'm not going to leave.

154
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,640
Do not try this on your own.

155
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,360
It is extremely dangerous.

156
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:29,840
I'm not going to leave.

157
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:39,240
I'm not going to leave.

158
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,780
I'm not going to leave.

159
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,960
I'm not going to leave.

160
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:11,260
I'm not going to leave.

161
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,340
I'm not going to leave.

162
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,720
I'm not going to leave.

163
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,780
I'm not going to leave.

164
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,180
I'm not going to leave.

165
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,380
I'm not going to leave.

166
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:29,540
I'm not going to leave.

167
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,620
I'm not going to leave.

168
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,640
I'm not going to leave.

169
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:35,700
I'm not going to leave.

170
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:38,200
I'm not going to leave.

171
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:47,200
I'm not going to leave.

172
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,980
I'm not going to leave.

173
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,240
Somebody crashed my party

174
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,500
and stole my cat.

175
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,560
While all the revelers

176
00:10:59,560 --> 00:10:59,960
sang a reverir.

177
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:06,660
old Lang Syne, this kid came uninvited, the little brat, and took away that cherished cat of mine.

178
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:14,940
The year before it wasn't any better, for then was perpetrated this foul crime. A party crasher

179
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:22,240
stole my favorite sweater. What's worse is I was in it at the time. And how could I forget the year

180
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:28,980
before when ten hell's angels sporting black tattoos unceremoniously broke down the door,

181
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:36,260
went to the kitchen, and drank all the booze? But my next party will be safe and fun,

182
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:44,000
for next time I shall not tell anyone. You must make a friend of horror. But through the miracle

183
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:50,260
of modern radio, we've invited some of our friends from the eerie coast to put on our radio shorts.

184
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,280
The horror.

185
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,140
The horror.

186
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,960
Yes, they owe us a few.

187
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:03,560
We owe them a favor, or we owe them one, so they accept it, or we accept it, or something. So, uh,

188
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:08,160
tonight, radio shorts may be a bit baggy with our one-size-fits-all special presentation,

189
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:16,360
True to Life Fictional Adventures, with Lonesome Cowboy Dave, country music's least known and least

190
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:22,320
loved country song stylist and abused substance abuser, his holistic Indian guide, Psychopath

191
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:28,960
Finder, and his idiot savant, Moron Psycho, who's been a great friend of mine since I was a kid.

192
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:35,340
I should have been a pair of ragged claws, uh, scuttling across floors of silent seas.

193
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,140
And a very special guest appearance with the Reverend Ivan Stang.

194
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,500
He's a great man. I'm a little man. I'm a little man. He's a great man.

195
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:48,920
Our story takes place, as it usually does, from a mobile home precariously parked alongside a toxic swamp.

196
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:51,340
It is November 8th, 1992.

197
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:58,780
No, no, no, no way. It's January, uh, January something. 1993. Remember New Year's Eve? You drank so much,

198
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:01,440
you went sunbathing in the Waldo Tunnel, and then...

199
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:07,000
Uh, well, yes, but this is make-believe. It can be any time. It can be any time.

200
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,040
Like Quantum Leap. Cool.

201
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:11,200
Uh, yes. Well, uh, radio shorts.

202
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,960
Come on, baby, take a chance with us.

203
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,580
Oh, I used to be...

204
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,280
a dandy, all dressed up from tip to toe.

205
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,560
My clothes, they were the finest, even if I do say so.

206
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:39,940
But now I've changed my style, and it really suits me so.

207
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,360
I hang around in radio shorts and have nowhere to go.

208
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:49,200
So take back your knickerbockers, petticoats, long johns, bloomers, and briefs,

209
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:53,140
bikinis, pantaloons, boxer shorts, or even a cut-fit.

210
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:57,460
Cause now I've got my radio shorts, I really love them so.

211
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,620
Please listen.

212
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:01,840
Listen very closely, now we're going to start the show.

213
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,100
Let's join Lonesome, Psycho, and Scabby at their RV near the Toxic Swamp

214
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:22,440
as they listen to Reverend Stang on the Hour of Slack.

215
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:28,600
We return now with the Reverend Ivan,

216
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:28,760
and the Reverend Stang on the Hour of Slack.

217
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:32,340
Reverend Stang's final message of resire, panic, and acceptance.

218
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:36,180
Oh, yes, dear friends, enemies, and everyone in between.

219
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,520
You know, a lot of people have asked me,

220
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:42,180
how can I go about accruing slack?

221
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:46,120
How can I be a nuclear subgenius?

222
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,560
How can devivalation fit in with my rumba lessons?

223
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,740
People want answers, but listen to this now,

224
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,280
and maybe you'll learn something.

225
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,800
Why give answers?

226
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:58,740
When you give answers, that just leads to more questions.

227
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,180
Well, the answer's, stop here.

228
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,460
I won't fall into their trap.

229
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,900
Who are they?

230
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:08,240
You know, the you-know-whos.

231
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:11,760
They are the people beyond the puppeteer.

232
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:16,440
All I know is, if you want to get something, you have to give something.

233
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:20,080
And while there are no true guarantees in life,

234
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:23,920
I know of a giving you could give

235
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,080
that would help you all on your quest for what Bob is all about.

236
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:28,740
What?

237
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,780
And that is your vote.

238
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:32,100
Get out and vote.

239
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,700
Vote Republican.

240
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:34,700
That's right.

241
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:41,000
Voting a straight Republican ticket enhances your chances to go into trances.

242
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:44,020
Now, I must be going, dear friends.

243
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:46,440
The limo from limbo is awaiting.

244
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,220
Did you hear that, engine valves?

245
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,360
Am I losing my mind or what?

246
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:57,000
Did I just hear the Reverend Ivan Stang say to vote Republican?

247
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,740
What the flock, man?

248
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:03,640
I can't believe old Ivan would stink and try to help them Republicans.

249
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:07,260
Something stinks around here, like rotten fish in Denmark or something.

250
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,860
Me know what stinks.

251
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,780
When last time changed socks?

252
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:13,180
Being clean, good for mental health.

253
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,700
What do you mean?

254
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,040
I just put them on last Christmas.

255
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,780
And Fleming, wait, what's going on with this subgenius guy?

256
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,640
He was supposed to be politically neutral, and now we find out he...

257
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:26,060
Ivan's a Bushman and Bob Dobbs is Ross Perot.

258
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,600
Ugh, Perot.

259
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,060
Perot.

260
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,080
Perot.

261
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:28,740
Perot.

262
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:28,740


263
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:28,740


264
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:28,740


265
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:28,740


266
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:28,740


267
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:28,740


268
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:28,740


269
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:28,740


270
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:28,740


271
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:28,740


272
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,040
Perot.

273
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,740
Perot.

274
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,900
Perot.

275
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:44,560
Perot.

276
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:44,620
Perot.

277
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,040
Perot.

278
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,620
Perot.

279
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:46,020
Perot.

280
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:46,900
Perot.

281
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:49,520
Perhot.

282
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,120
Perhot.

283
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:50,160
Perhot.

284
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:50,760
Perhot.

285
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:50,780


286
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:50,800


287
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:50,800


288
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:50,800


289
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:50,800


290
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:50,800


291
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:50,800


292
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:50,800


293
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:50,800


294
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:50,800


295
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:50,800


296
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:50,800


297
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:50,820


298
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:50,820


299
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:50,820


300
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:50,820


301
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:50,820


302
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:50,820


303
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:50,820


304
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:50,820


305
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:50,820


306
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:50,920


307
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:51,060
Perhot.

308
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,060


309
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,060


310
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,060


311
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,060


312
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,060


313
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,060


314
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:52,740
Perhot.

315
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:55,740
Perhot.

316
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,800
I'm just going to have to talk to Scabby.

317
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,940
He's the only person around here who makes any sense.

318
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:05,820
Dave, super glue my left nostril on again.

319
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,920
Hey, Dave.

320
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:09,420
Right, yeah, right.

321
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,200
Yeah, sure, sure.

322
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,180
That's it, okay.

323
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,640
I'll have to talk to myself.

324
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:17,500
I'm the only person smart enough around here to understand what the hell I'm talking about anyway.

325
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,040
What's up with Stang?

326
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,620
Did someone get to him?

327
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,940
Or did he just shell out?

328
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,660
Well, how the hell do I know?

329
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:24,640
What am I, a psychic?

330
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
I'm having awful touches tonight, aren't I?

331
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:27,860
Yeah, so?

332
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:29,080
Yeah, so this.

333
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,000
As I reiterate, how could Stang do this?

334
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,000
Or was he forced into it?

335
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,640
Dave, where are my bowling ball nipple rings?

336
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,420
I can't find them.

337
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:40,800
You're wearing them, Scabby.

338
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,760
Oh, thanks, Dave.

339
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,200
Let's listen to this subgenius tape again.

340
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:46,320
I record it all.

341
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,560
This time we're going to play it backwards.

342
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,640
You know, the secret messaging stuff.

343
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,660
Like Pat Robertson said, there were secret messages in everything.

344
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:54,620
All kinds.

345
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,040
All kinds of recordings.

346
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,920
Let's see if there's a secret message on this recording, man.

347
00:17:57,940 --> 00:17:58,640
I gotta find out.

348
00:17:59,100 --> 00:17:59,460
Yeah.

349
00:17:59,560 --> 00:17:59,560


350
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,500
Hey, there's it.

351
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,600
Here, I'm the kill-by-pirate.

352
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,300
Here's not said that.

353
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:07,600
Well, if the dispassar could have get you to assemble,

354
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,400
then we'd have us meet down there.

355
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,440
Listeny.

356
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,360
Yeah, listen.

357
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,340
I am listening.

358
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:12,940
Oh, shit.

359
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,700
Yeah, I'm listening.

360
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,500
Here, you're worried again, didn't you?

361
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:16,620
I didn't hear nothing.

362
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:17,100
Yeah.

363
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,680
You talking to me?

364
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:19,380
You mean me?

365
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:20,680
You must be talking to me.

366
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,540
I'm the only person here.

367
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,660
Yeah, me hear something.

368
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,120
It says,

369
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:25,040
Script sucks.

370
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:25,660
Script sucks.

371
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:27,900
No, no, listen.

372
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,500
Listen.

373
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,800
He's saying something.

374
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,580
He's saying...

375
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,040
He's saying DNA level C.

376
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,620
Can you hear it?

377
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:35,800
Listen.

378
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:38,620
Yeah, yeah.

379
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:40,840
That's it.

380
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:41,960
Listen.

381
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:44,180
Listen.

382
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:46,640
Oh, my God.

383
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,320
What the hell does it all mean?

384
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,180
DNA level C.

385
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,100
Don't you remember?

386
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:53,760
Last time, Reverend Stang,

387
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:54,300
on our show,

388
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,220
he said Cleveland was DNA level C

389
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,020
spelled backwards.

390
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,400
What that mean?

391
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,120
Me not know.

392
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,480
I know maybe.

393
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,240
There's a DNA building

394
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,120
near the Abnormal

395
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,340
to design new authority building.

396
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,380
That's where I go

397
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:09,200
to get my chromosomes

398
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,720
broken down and vivisected.

399
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:12,740
I'll take you there.

400
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,100
I've got an appointment today.

401
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,440
No possible connection.

402
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,520
A-sector pathfinder.

403
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:18,540
Engine cleaner.

404
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,340
See, see, see.

405
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,300
There's something amiss

406
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:20,940
with this setup.

407
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:21,780
I knew it.

408
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,540
This Reverend Stang is a ringer.

409
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,500
And the only way

410
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,700
we're gonna find out for true

411
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,740
what the hell is for true

412
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,600
is go to his DNA building,

413
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,180
level C,

414
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,300
and scope it out.

415
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:30,780
And...

416
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,960
Oh, maybe right, chemo sappy.

417
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:33,880
Hemingway,

418
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:34,700
me do anything

419
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,880
to move this script along.

420
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:37,880
Let's mount our pinto, men.

421
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,280
You too, Dave.

422
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,340
We'll be right back

423
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,360
after these messages.

424
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,160
Well, I, for one,

425
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,920
I'm just glad that Christmas is over.

426
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:50,020
It's such a rat race.

427
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:50,680
Oh, I know.

428
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:51,880
Shopping for everyone

429
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:53,040
is such a headache.

430
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,800
And it's gotten so expensive.

431
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:56,180
Except, you know,

432
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,060
I bought a couple,

433
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,240
a bunch of those,

434
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
those funny sets

435
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,100
of hand-carved nesting dolls

436
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,380
of former Soviet leaders

437
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:02,920
from Russia.

438
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,340
They were really cheap.

439
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,160
Yeah, I know.

440
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:06,140
In fact,

441
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:07,400
that's how I solved

442
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,180
all my Christmas

443
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,260
gift-giving problems.

444
00:20:09,660 --> 00:20:10,660
You mean gifts

445
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,060
from the former Soviet Union?

446
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:12,540
Yep.

447
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,440
It's amazing

448
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,040
how far your dollar will go

449
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,000
when you buy Russian.

450
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,980
For instance,

451
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,420
I was able to pick up

452
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,160
a dozen of those

453
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,320
Soviet Army watches

454
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,600
for 15 bucks.

455
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:22,520
Really?

456
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:23,880
A dozen watches

457
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:24,840
for 15 dollars?

458
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:25,500
That's great.

459
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,220
Hey, that's not the half of it.

460
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,300
I bought one of those

461
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,600
Raskolnikov portable color TVs

462
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,320
for only 35 dollars.

463
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,100
Wow.

464
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,360
Yeah, 32-inch screen

465
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,640
on heavy-duty casters.

466
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,380
No remote,

467
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,640
but for 35 bucks,

468
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,440
who's complaining?

469
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,200
No kidding.

470
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,480
Then I picked up

471
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,600
a couple of next-to-new

472
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,860
KGB staff cars

473
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,560
for 75 dollars a piece.

474
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:46,880
I talked them down

475
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,380
from 100.

476
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:48,860
Gosh.

477
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,720
Lots of options, too.

478
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,740
Uh, what else?

479
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,520
Oh, yeah.

480
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,020
I got a couple of

481
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:53,740
I got a really nice

482
00:20:53,740 --> 00:20:55,360
30-unit, 60-year-old

483
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,040
apartment building

484
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,360
for 450 dollars.

485
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,000
I had out-haggle

486
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,840
this really aggressive

487
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,840
Slovenian guy.

488
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:02,200
He wanted 10,000,

489
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,340
but it was pretty easy

490
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,580
to get him down to my price

491
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,240
when I told him

492
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,720
I'd throw in a case of camels.

493
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:07,940
Camel cigarette?

494
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,660
Oh, yeah.

495
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,420
They're really valuable there.

496
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,100
These ex-military guys

497
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,180
really go for them.

498
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:13,960
In fact,

499
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,960
that's what helped me

500
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,380
swing the deal on the subs.

501
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,120
Subs?

502
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,820
You have to get out of the boat.

503
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,720
You mean submarines?

504
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:19,340
Sure.

505
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,340
They're having blue light specials

506
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,700
on all the military hardware.

507
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,480
Now, I had wanted to get

508
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:24,940
one of the new

509
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,720
Phantom-class

510
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:27,020
deep-water cruisers,

511
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:27,340
you know,

512
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,580
with the sonar evasion,

513
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,980
but it bumped the price

514
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:31,080
up another 50 bucks,

515
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,560
so I decided to settle

516
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:33,140
for one of the

517
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,200
Demon-class models.

518
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:35,360
They were more within

519
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,620
my price range, you know.

520
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:37,200
Oh, sure.

521
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,040
You have to stick

522
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:38,600
to your budget.

523
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:39,600
Yeah, and I didn't have

524
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,780
to blow it all on the subs

525
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,020
since it was only 1,200.

526
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,580
Need some paint

527
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,000
and a couple gallons of caulk,

528
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,780
but otherwise,

529
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,920
it's in mint condition.

530
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,120
Nukes and all.

531
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,340
Nukes?

532
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:50,320
You mean...

533
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,760
But where I really scored

534
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,020
was on the MiG-22.

535
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,020


536
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,020


537
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:53,020


538
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:54,520
They're practically

539
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,300
giving them away.

540
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,360
In fact,

541
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,080
they were running

542
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,320
a buy-three-get-one-free sale.

543
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,460
But, you know,

544
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:01,440
the cockpits

545
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,260
are kind of cramped,

546
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,080
and it's all that old

547
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,540
vacuum-tube technology,

548
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:05,920
and I don't know

549
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,420
how to fly.

550
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,300
I mean,

551
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,300
I thought the kids

552
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:09,320
could use it as a fort

553
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:09,760
in the backyard.

554
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:10,940
You know,

555
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:11,560
I just couldn't see

556
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:12,600
buying more than two,

557
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:13,780
and especially since

558
00:22:13,780 --> 00:22:14,620
they wouldn't budge

559
00:22:14,620 --> 00:22:16,680
on the price below 750 bucks,

560
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,080
and they had disarmed them,

561
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,780
so I figured two was plenty.

562
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:20,800
Wow.

563
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,340
Roll over, roll over.

564
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,720
Goodbye fighter

565
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,960
fighting all the time.

566
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,960
Yes, bad dog, beware,

567
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,120
or you'll wind up

568
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,800
tender, crunchy, juicy meat

569
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:37,340
on my barbecue grill.

570
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,460
Hi, folks.

571
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,220
This is Tiger Man Solitaire,

572
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,600
bon vivant connoisseur

573
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:43,560
and champion prize fighter.

574
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,920
But you know me best

575
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,960
for my world-famous

576
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,200
Tiger Man Solitaire

577

open pit bowl barbecue sauce.

578
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:52,400
Yes, Tiger Man Solitaire

for 35 years.

582
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:57,800
But now,

583
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:58,960
as a community service,

584
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,540
I'm helping clean up

585
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,020
the neighborhood.

586
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,240
Take a bite out

587
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,020
of criminal dogs

588
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,620
with my New Orleans-style

589
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:06,680
blackened filet

590
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,420
or Cajun-flavored sauce,

591
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:10,660
my St. Louis sweet and sour,

592
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,260
or my Chicago smoky savory.

593
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,400
Tiger Man Solitaire's

594
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,060

meat tenderizing system

596
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,660
turned any tough dog gristle

597
00:23:20,660 --> 00:23:21,860
into mouthwatering treats.

598
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
So don't worry about

599
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:24,780
that nasty neighborhood dog.

600
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,440
If you can't beat him,

601
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,160
eat him.

602
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:28,780
Tell me about me

603
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,860
and that cornbread duck.

604
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,020
Well, just don't leave it

605
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:31,580
burning, man.

606
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:33,000
I got to run.

607
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,700
Don't forget.

608
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,480

Not available in Blink's.

614
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,660
Keep it to yourself.

615
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,740
Hello, ladies.

616
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,240
I'm Bernie Furman

617
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,620
of Furman the Furrier,

618
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,380
and I'm here to tell you

619
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:53,600
I'm his father, Ive.

620
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,680
Friends, the Furman's family

621
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,880
has been in furs for 45 years.

622
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,060
It's 1944.

623
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:02,300
And as my dad always used to say,

624
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,240
Ladies, don't wait

625
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:05,520
till there's a nip in the air

626
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,360
for that look of

627
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,420
decade in elegance.

628
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,640
Come now to Furman the Furrier.

629
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,300
Don't wait for Club Baby Seal

630
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,840
or Beheaded Young Otter,

631
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,120
Sable, Silver Fox,

632
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,320
Mink, or Ehrman.

633
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,320
Mink, Schmink, Foxy Schmoxes,

634
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,340
Ehrman, Verman,

635
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:21,480
we got exotics.

636
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:22,360
Only in the Furs.

637
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:23,540
Only five black rhinos

638
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,260
left in the world?

639
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,820
We got four skins.

640
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,640
Oh, you ain't got no four-skinner.

641
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,440
Shut up, Jerome.

642
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,380
Looking for ivory buttons,

643
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,940
spadges, brooches, or pins?

644
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,940
We got the elephant's graveyard.

645
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,240
You want real warmth and comfort?

646
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:38,080
Go to the Army-Navy store.

647
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,380
You want the look of

648
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,260
decade in elegance?

649
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,660
Come to Furman the Furrier.

650
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,520
And remember,

651
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,060
if it's going extinct,

652
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,480
we got your mink.

653
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,480
If it's endangered,

654
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:47,900
we'll arrange it.

655
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,300
That's Furman the Furrier,

656
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:50,940
corner 6th Street in Kill Mammal,

657
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:52,280
Seapop Run, New Jersey,

658
00:24:52,280 --> 00:24:53,420
repeat address.

659
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,340
Don't just repeat.

660
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,440
That's Furman the Furrier,

661
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,080
corner 6th Street in Kill Mammal,

662
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,320
Seapop Run, New Jersey.

663
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:00,500
Can I do it?

664
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,860
I'd like a word with you.

665
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:12,980
Excuse me,

666
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,420
do you have any grape of pawn?

667
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:15,620
Yes, you,

668
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:16,760
Mr. and Ms.

669
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:17,940
Decadent Yuppie American.

670
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,800
Are you one of a minority

671
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,180
in control of your life?

672
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,000
You know,

673
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:22,880
I'm rich.

674
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:24,480
Well, if you are,

675
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:25,720
you should drink the coffee

676
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:26,220
that says,

677
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:27,520
I'm well-to-do,

678
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,320
and I don't care about you.

679
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,940
Drink Waster's Choice.

680
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,920
Waster's Choice is made

681
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,960
from chosen choice coffee beans

682
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:35,560
from the fields

683
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:37,240
of Colombian slave labor camps,

684
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,060
controlled by right-wing elements

685
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:39,800
of their secret

686
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,160
governmental police force,

687
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,740
exploiting the poor

688
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,080
for the exporting of the rich.

689
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:45,880
It takes a lot of money

690
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,240
to keep those police in uniform,

691
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:48,800
those slaves in command.

692
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,640
That's why Waster's Choice

693
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,820
is so expensive.

694
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,460
But what do you care?

695
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:54,580
You've got it.

696
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,380
So spend it for you

697
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,840
and your kind's better tomorrow.

698
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,460
Waster's Choice is easy to fix.

699
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,480
Just add eight heaping tablespoons

700
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:04,220
of freeze-dried Waster's Choice

701
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,340
to some boiled Perrier

702
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:06,300
and stir.

703
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,260
Take one taste

704
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:09,400
and chuck it.

705
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,220
It's awful.

706
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,300
But you feel awful good

707
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,400
about your bank account

708
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,700
and political affairs abroad.

709
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,300
Waster's Choice,

710
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,260
the extreme right-wing taste

711
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,820
for extreme right-wing people.

712
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,320
Yes, sir.

713
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:22,800
Hello.

714
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,940
I'm a bit confused here.

715
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,240
Normally, I would be doing

716
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,540
my most infamously renowned

717
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:31,860
Hello Art segment

718
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,900
of the show,

719
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,740
but apparently

720
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:37,600
the producers lost a poker game

721
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,860
over the holidays,

722
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,920
and yes, sir,

723
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,960
it appears that the

724
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,040
Reverend Stang

725
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,600
isn't quite himself,

726
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,480
and well,

727
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,800
who is?

728
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:52,300
Anyway, I wonder if he can draw.

729
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:53,720
But anyway,

730
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,560
oh, that's probably one of the producers,

731
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:57,700
but never mind that.

732
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,660
Scabby Days, who is a drawing,

733
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:02,160
and Psychopath Finder,

734
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,940
who will draw,

735
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:05,980
hopefully, they're figuring all this out.

736
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:08,660
But back to the adventures,

737
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,760
and of course, I'll be back next time

738
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:13,180
with tips on making faux food

739
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,900
and, oh, yes,

740
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,240
don't throw away

741
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:18,140
all the wrapping paper

742
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,360
from your holidays.

743
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,780
See you next time.

744
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,720
I'll be showing you

745
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,100
how to make ties

746
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,320
for next year's gift giving.

747
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,540
That's all for now.

748
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:29,680
Back to your shorts

749
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:31,120
with the Stang,

750
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,020
Stang, Stang.

751
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,300
The Horror.

752
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,220
The Horror.

753
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,540
He's a great man.

754
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,900
Oh, Stangy, Stangy, baby,

755
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:47,360
my hero sandwich.

756
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:48,580
Something ain't right.

757
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,560
He was my last vestige of hope.

758
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:53,300
Yeah, underground media, my canards.

759
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:55,360
It's like saying army intelligence.

760
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:57,060
Mutual exclusion of terms.

761
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,880
Stang's been gotten to it.

762
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,680
I know.

763
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,020
He's been gotten to it.

764
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,560
They got him.

765
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:02,640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

766
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,420
We'll see.

767
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,780
There's the Abner Mall,

768
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,960
and there's the DNA building

769
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,840
behind a mile of bad road.

770
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,300
Oh, it's going to be heap tricky.

771
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,980
Lucky for everyone concerned,

772
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,940
me bringing visibility omelet

773
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,740
and a darn some great, great,

774
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,740
not so great, great grand farmer,

775
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:20,640
two elks,

776
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:21,060
four play,

777
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:23,440
who use invisible omelet religiously.

778
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:25,560
I'm a student of balanced American history.

779
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,980
Wasn't two elks, four play,

780
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,260
shot dead, buck naked

781
00:28:28,260 --> 00:28:30,360
after running through a cavalry post,

782
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:32,320
after being caught in a lady shower?

783
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,080
Oh, yeah, lucky shot, get him,

784
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,580
but him still invisible at times.

785
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,340
A hundred lucky shots?

786
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:39,020
Well, if you don't believe in magic,

787
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,100
Emily, that won't work anyway.

788
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:43,540
Park behind Club Foot Locker at Abner Mall.

789
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:44,980
Okay, good.

790
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:46,840
Now I'll have to climb

791
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,060
200-foot electrified barbed wire fence.

792
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,340
Good.

793
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,240
Now I'll walk through football field of landmines.

794
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,120
Good.

795
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,620
Now cross pit loaded with extinct P.O. Tyrannosaurus rexes.

796
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:02,360
Okay, good.

797
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:05,620
Let them see, try that on TV on shoestring budget.

798
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,080
Okay, here we are, DNA building.

799
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,500
Wow, looky there.

800
00:29:09,660 --> 00:29:11,440
A helix-shaped spiral staircase.

801
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,300
We can just engineer our basic black-blue jeans up there

802
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:17,500
and we'll be able to see what the hay's going on.

803
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:18,240
Dang, man.

804
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,460
Oh, me hope this no wild goose step,

805
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:20,640
Chase.

806
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:25,440
Uh-oh, uh-oh, I'm picking up a radio signal

807
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,500
from one of my fillings.

808
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,420
I hate this when this happens.

809
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:31,020
My teeth are becoming radio wave broadcasters.

810
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:41,740
At last I have control of your radio tubes.

811
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:43,280
Uh, and I do too.

812
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:44,380
Good.

813
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,760
This is Rand the Black.

814
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:47,280
And this is Stimson J. Cat

815
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,880
of the Ren and Stimpy Show.

816
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,440
And you're listening to the...

817
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:51,480
The Hour of Slack.

818
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:53,120
Keep listening, you idiot!

819
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:54,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

820
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,500
Else I shall deal you!

821
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,780
Wow, yeah, we'll be right back to, uh,

822
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:05,720
the horrible and terrifying adventures

823
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:08,480
of Lonesome Cowboy Dave, uh, just momentarily,

824
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:13,880
as, uh, we jump into, uh, Show Side number two.

825
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:17,700
From right here at Show Side number one.

826
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:18,760
Thank you.

827
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,160
Now, you're listening to Show Side number two.

828
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,600
And don't forget to subscribe to the channel.

829
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:42,600


830
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,380
You'll be the first to know when this video is up.

831
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:43,380


832
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:46,340
Uh, I'm out.

833
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:46,580
Bye, everybody.

834
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:46,840
Oh, hey.

835
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:48,480
You know, I thought you were a little more

836
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:48,480


837
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:48,480


838
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:48,480


839
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:48,780
I'm in the show.

840
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:48,900
You can't have me on a mission.

841
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,960
I'm in the show.

842
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:49,960


843
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:49,960


844
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:49,960


845
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:49,960


846
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:49,960


847
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,240
I'm in the show.

848
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,420


849
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,420


850
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,420


851
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,420


852
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,420


853
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,420


854
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,420


855
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,420


856
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:50,420


857
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,980
but the you-know-whos.

858
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,240
Oh, I can hear it.

859
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,000
Can you hear it, Lutzen?

860
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:55,900
I can hear that.

861
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:57,720
Yeah, I can hear it, man.

862
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,300
Slapstick.

863
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:04,120
Knee slapping, side splitting,

864
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:05,840
rib splitting, gut busting.

865
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,680
Laugh, I thought I'd die.

866
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:11,840
I think all this is a crock.

867
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,960
I don't think anything's gonna happen.

868
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,680
I don't think there's any real differences here

869
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,900
that I'm fed up with.

870
00:31:18,060 --> 00:31:20,340
It's piping hot and it tastes real good.

871
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,940
Throw out your hands,

872
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:25,980
take out your push.

873
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,120
Hands on your hips,

874
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,220
give them a push.

875
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,960
You'll be surprised you're doing

876
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,980
the French mistake.

877
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:31,460
Voila!

878
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,220
You-know-whos.

879
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,540
Oh, I can hear it.

880
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,320
Can you hear it, Lutzen?

881
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,180
I can hear that.

882
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,980
Yeah, I can hear it, man.

883
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:41,300
You've got to save me

884
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:43,700
and save the planetarium.

885
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,160
Hurry, they're trying to bomb me.

886
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:46,880
Bomb me.

887
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,120
What?

888
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:47,740
What?

889
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,820
Oh, man.

890
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,560
Oh, no.

891
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:51,760
Oh, no.

892
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:53,900
Here, now, break it up.

893
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,240
Here, now, now, break it up, you boys.

894
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:58,880
What are you three doing?

895
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,640
No more than two people can congregate together.

896
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,140
This part of the state's under martial law.

897
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:05,600
Now, break it up before I call

898
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,180
50 armed bacon sandwiches.

899
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,620
Oh, listen, orificer.

900
00:32:09,900 --> 00:32:11,180
This free country's still

901
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:12,560
we American citizens.

902
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:14,420
What?

903
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:14,820
What?

904
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,480
Hey, hey.

905
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,380
Except for Dave.

906
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,720
Him's still waiting for green card,

907
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,080
but it's coming in mail, I'm sure.

908
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:22,180
America this.

909
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:22,800
Over the goat.

910
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:23,680
That's it.

911
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,660
You guys are through.

912
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,820
Say your prayers.

913
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,200
Eat your tax dollars at work.

914
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,920
Lead your political stooges.

915
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:31,340
Woo!

916
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:32,160
Woo!

917
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:33,300
Woo!

918
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,480
Wait, wait, wait.

919
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,560
Don't shoot us, armed and Gandhi.

920
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,060
It's me.

921
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,280
It's Scabby.

922
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,580
It's not you, me boy.

923
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:41,600
Yeah, it's me.

924
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:43,540
How are you tonight, Corporal Punishment?

925
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:44,060
Oh.

926
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:45,260
Just a little edgy.

927
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,840
Seen some mighty spooky things

928
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,820
are in and around the shop here.

929
00:32:50,040 --> 00:32:51,660
Oh, what are you doing here

930
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,680
this time of day?

931
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,040
They're gonna straighten out my nose hairs

932
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,580
with a genetic generic spinal tap tonight.

933
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:58,120
Mmm.

934
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:00,760
Oh, these two are my government-appointed

935
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:01,840
doctors right here.

936
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:03,820
That's right.

937
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,340
I'm Dr. Schlazmup.

938
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,920
And I am Dr. Neurosurgery.

939
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,580
Oh, so doctors in loincloths

940
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:12,240
and cowboy hats, is it?

941
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:13,500
Yeah, yeah, you see,

942
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:14,300
we're side.

943
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,340
And as a male dance review,

944
00:33:15,580 --> 00:33:17,600
you know, we're a little slow on cash,

945
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,200
so we shake our booties

946
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,260
for lusty middle-aged women.

947
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:22,380
Oh, I know what you mean.

948
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,160
Times are tough.

949
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,800
I used to unclothe myself

950
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,100
at the old folks' home,

951
00:33:26,180 --> 00:33:26,960
Bailey Acres,

952
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,920
to make ends meet.

953
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:29,120
Huh, you're okay.

954
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:30,560
Move along now, boys.

955
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:30,940
Thanks, pal.

956
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:31,860
Say, Scabby,

957
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:32,900
on your way through the shop,

958
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,200
could you stop at the pharmacy

959
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,820
and get me those special pills?

960
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,740
You know, the ones that make me normal.

961
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:38,560
Okay.

962
00:33:38,780 --> 00:33:39,780
Sure, got ya.

963
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,360
Prozac and Xanax.

964
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:42,320
Uh-oh.

965
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,140
I'm picking up another message.

966
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:44,900
From my teeth.

967
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:45,220
Save me.

968
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:45,600
Hurry.

969
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:46,580
Save me.

970
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,760
Take my cat out.

971
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,100
Wash the car.

972
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,140
Call my agent.

973
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:50,920
Save me.

974
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,240
Is staying part of a conspiracy

975
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,020
to cheat the FCC

976
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:56,960
by broadcasting from teeth?

977
00:33:57,320 --> 00:33:58,400
We'll find out

978
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,040
after these impotent worms.

979
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:01,500
If you can keep your head

980
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,460
when all about you're losing,

981
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,520
there's a blaming it on you

982
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:04,260
if you can trust yourself.

983
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,120
You'll remember what happened

984
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,040
before we were so rudely interrupted.

985
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,000
Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

986
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:11,620
the Psychopath Finder,

987
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,600
and Scabby Days

988
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,800
have set out to find

989
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:14,400
if the...

990
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,860
The Reverend Stang has sold out

991
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,580
or is being coerced

992
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:18,320
by the Republicans.

993
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:19,960
They've perforated

994
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,520
the DNA building level C

995
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:22,380
weird government

996
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,820
political mutation factory

997
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:25,200
and discovered a room

998
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,320
full of Stang clones.

999
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,320
He's a great man.

1000
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:28,680
To find the right one

1001
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:29,780
true Reverend,

1002
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,800
they've decided to hold

1003
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:32,500
a casting call and audition.

1004
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:34,060
Okay.

1005
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:35,100
All right.

1006
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:36,520
I mean...

1007
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:37,320
Next.

1008
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:38,540
Okay, now,

1009
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,600
imagine you're the Jewish tailor

1010
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,040
Ivan Stangstein.

1011
00:34:43,060 --> 00:34:43,700
Slack!

1012
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:44,300
Slack!

1013
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:44,980
You want slack?

1014
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,320
You want more slack?

1015
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:47,780
Look, I've already done

1016
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:48,940
two alterations.

1017
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,740
Any more will cost you extra.

1018
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,800
Besides, I can only take in

1019
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,600
so much slack.

1020
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:55,320
By the way,

1021
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,340
you like slack.

1022
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,600
You'll love my slacks.

1023
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:58,860
I got all kinds of slacks.

1024
00:34:58,880 --> 00:34:59,520
All colors.

1025
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,160
Cheap, cheap.

1026
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,380
Don't call us.

1027
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:01,980
We'll call you.

1028
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:03,280
That wasn't a real Ivan.

1029
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:04,060
Next.

1030
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:05,240
Okay, uh...

1031
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
Okay, uh...

1032
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,040
Ivan over there,

1033
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,760
give me a Captain Biscum's

1034
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:09,400
police pirate

1035
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,740
with severe brain damage

1036
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:11,760
and syphilis,

1037
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,360
Reverend Stang.

1038
00:35:12,540 --> 00:35:13,420
Uh, uh...

1039
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:14,900
Slack.

1040
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,440
You'll get slack,

1041
00:35:16,580 --> 00:35:17,120
all right.

1042
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,820
Right before I'll hang you

1043
00:35:18,820 --> 00:35:19,820
from the yard arms,

1044
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,340
I'll give you a little slack

1045
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,880
on the rope, me buckos

1046
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,560
and buckets.

1047
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,560
Lonesome, you're wearing

1048
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:27,620
lip rouge again.

1049
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,340
Oh, here come the dykes.

1050
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:29,820
Crack.

1051
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:30,580
Bally want some crack?

1052
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,160
Crack.

1053
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:31,980
Bally want some crack?

1054
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:32,900
Next.

1055
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:34,140
You.

1056
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:35,380
Hey, I want a Mexican

1057
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,000
slack wrap.

1058
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,560
Are this Reverend Stang?

1059
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:38,640
He was close.

1060
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:39,600
Boom, chick.

1061
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:40,540
Boom, chick.

1062
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:41,480
Boom, chick.

1063
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,380
Boom, chick.

1064
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:42,980
Boom, chick.

1065
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:43,080
Boom, chick.

1066
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:43,900
If you're on your back,

1067
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:44,900
I'll cut you some slack.

1068
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,960
If you need some jack,

1069
00:35:46,100 --> 00:35:47,080
I'll cut you some slack.

1070
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:48,480
If you need a half-wheeler slack,

1071
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,940
I'll cut you some slack.

1072
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,020
And if you're whack on crack,

1073
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,540
don't cut it.

1074
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,940
Next, next, next, next.

1075
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:57,660
Look, you lonesome.

1076
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,060
We finally whittled down

1077
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,720
our auditioners

1078
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:00,600
down to one more.

1079
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,920
God in him,

1080
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:04,760
it has to be the real Stangy.

1081
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,620
It's gotta be the real Stangy.

1082
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,740
Give me a question

1083
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:08,580
only the true, real,

1084
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:09,700
real, true blue Stangy baby

1085
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:10,460
could answer.

1086
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,160
Oh, Sagebrush Sigmund,

1087
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:12,980
that's a right.

1088
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:13,640
Roger Maris,

1089
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,020
oh, possible true Ivan,

1090
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:16,640
what is the universal conflict

1091
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,740
between good and evil

1092
00:36:17,740 --> 00:36:18,980
in regards to the concept

1093
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,220
of Bob Dobbs being

1094
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:21,220
two with the universe?

1095
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,700
Boy, am I glad

1096
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:24,720
you asked me that question,

1097
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:24,980
brother,

1098
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:25,940
because I can tell you

1099
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:26,380
here and now

1100
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:27,400
that Bob Dobbs

1101
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,920
is not only all for one

1102
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,500
and the one for us,

1103
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:32,520
all but unequivocally

1104
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:33,180
the male burner

1105
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,840
behind all that we perceive

1106
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,940
as to what is

1107
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,040
or isn't

1108
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,620
freedom

1109
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:39,140
in this country.

1110
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:40,600
Can you dig it?

1111
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,660
He's a great man.

1112
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,800
And furthermore,

1113
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,960
furthermore to end

1114
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,780
this flimsy plotline,

1115
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:48,560
Dave, my friend,

1116
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,460
you're not a Judas.

1117
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:51,660
I'm a little man.

1118
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:51,960
I'm a...

1119
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:52,860
He would have been a doubter.

1120
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:54,600
For it was not I

1121
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:56,500
who bade my followers

1122
00:36:56,500 --> 00:36:57,640
to vote Republican,

1123
00:36:58,280 --> 00:36:59,600
but a cruel clone

1124
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:01,300
concocted by your

1125
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:03,020
federal tax dollars

1126
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,360
to further spread

1127
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:04,920
this depression

1128
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,280
of alternative thoughts

1129
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,000
and solutions.

1130
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,580
Had you not saved me,

1131
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,040
what other fiendish plot

1132
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,640
would have happened?

1133
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,820
That's cruel eggs indeed.

1134
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,180
The pantomime stangs

1135
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,900
on every station in America

1136
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:19,640
spewing lies

1137
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:21,260
and counter lies.

1138
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,660
My friends,

1139
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:24,960
I and my legion

1140
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,780
under Bob

1141
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,660
owe you all

1142
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,340
a debt of gratitude.

1143
00:37:28,740 --> 00:37:29,660
Oh, how can I

1144
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,000
ever repay you?

1145
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:33,460
I thought you'd never ask.

1146
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:34,520
You see,

1147
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,340
we got 109 episodes

1148
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,400

00:37:39,420 --> 00:37:40,260
and them guys out

1151
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,520
in San Francisco.

1152
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:41,620
And I thought you'd never ask.

1153
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,320
I thought you'd never ask.

1154
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,320


1155
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:42,840
On KSF,

1156
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,440
something like that.

1157
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,300
And see,

1158
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,320

1159
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,540

1160
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,160
and funny stuff like that.

1161
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:49,320
Oh, yeah, right.

1162
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:50,340
See, and maybe you could

1163
00:37:50,340 --> 00:37:51,220
like play some of our

1164
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,360
funny, funny parodies

1165
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,440
of life and pre-apocalyptic

1166
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,860
industrial devolution

1167
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:56,480
on your show.

1168
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:57,820
Well, now,

1169
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,920
I'll tell you what I'll do.

1170
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,900
I'll do that.

1171
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,580
Well, that and more.

1172
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,960
I'll play this whole

1173
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,320
bizarre, disgusting episode

1174
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,440
to my entire

1175
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,560
worldwide audience.

1176
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,120
How's that?

1177
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,260
If you give me the type scores.

1178
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,240
That's great.

1179
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:11,620
Just give me the type scores.

1180
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:16,560
It's great, Ivan, but could you lend me a fast 500 bucks, you know, till the recession clears up?

1181
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:19,320
Yeah, well, I'm kind of hanging short, too, man.

1182
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:23,840
After all, you know, we saved your life from the cloners and stuff.

1183
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:26,360
Okay, now, you guys will take a check?

1184
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,920
I don't know.

1185
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,180
Hey, my check's good.

1186
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,700
Now, what do you think you're talking to?

1187
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,720
Now, listen, you guys, really pull and tighten up that slack, don't you?

1188
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:38,340
Now, don't you forget to pull in that slack while on X day.

1189
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:42,400
X day, your soul will be laid bare.

1190
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:47,520
You will be sucking them damn church air canisters till they're all run out of soul.

1191
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,360
You'll be going, oh, give me some more soul, Bob.

1192
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,580
If only I had some more soul in there.

1193
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,580
I've learned this a good song.

1194
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:07,360
I didn't see any myth at all.

1195
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:15,280
I don't know.

1196
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,340
Do you know who's in command here?

1197
00:39:26,780 --> 00:39:32,260
The part of Princess Leonardo was performed by Shakespeare's and the Money Funny,

1198
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:36,460
and the part of Reverend Ivan Stank was played by Les Miserables,

1199
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:37,900
which is no longer showing.

1200
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:38,320
Thank you.

1201
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:44,940
And the part of Psychopath Finder was played by I.K. Murley, the orgasm thief,

1202
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,140
and the part of Lonesome Cowboy Dave was played alone.

1203
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:52,480
The part of Scabby Days was played by, well, if it was played.

1204
00:39:52,660 --> 00:40:01,360
And thanks to West from the West, and a whole lot of other people that don't make no difference anyway.

1205
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:08,200
And I say to you, I say to you, I say to you, I say to you, I say to you, I say to you, I say to you,

1206
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:13,760
I say to you, I say to you, I say to you, I say to you, I say to you, I say to you, I say to you.

1207
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,240
Well, thanks for putting us on.

1208
00:40:16,300 --> 00:40:19,380
This has been your Radio Shorts with Wes.

1209
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,960
Do you know who's in command here?

1210
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,220
Jenkins, Lauren.

1211
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,680
Never get out of the boat.

1212
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:24,880
Nelson, Kyle.

1213
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:30,140

1225
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:57,940
a dog, John Isham, Ellen, and

1226
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,900
of course, everybody else in their

1227
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:01,840
radio shorts. Thanks for putting us on.

1228
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:04,300
Oh, and next week, we are preempted

1229
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:05,800
for basketball. That's hoops.

1230
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,580
Hey, hoops, man! B-ball!

1231
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,960
Geek basket! Go Dons!

1232
00:41:10,060 --> 00:41:11,000
Go Dons!

1233
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:13,320
With extreme prejudice. Terminate

1234
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,920
with extreme prejudice.

1235
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:21,800
Let's stop at this ranch here.

1236
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,720
Looks like a pleasant place.

1237
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:24,600
Maybe we could...

1238
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:27,180
Look at the...

1239
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,320
There's some people riding out.

1240
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:30,340
They're on horses.

1241
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:36,660
I think it is the nearest sheriff.

1242
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,960
Uh-oh.

1243
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:38,180
I think it is the nearest sheriff.

1244
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:38,180


1245
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,180
I don't like the way he's slapping that big club

1246
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,220
in the pot of sand.

1247
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,120
I don't like that skinny little

1248
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:46,000
redneck that's got the giant gun

1249
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,120
next to him. And the cattle prod in his

1250
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:50,180
other hand. And that little boy wearing

1251
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,880
a clad bike. That guy's half fish.

1252
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,900
He's got a noose with 13 knots.

1253
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,180
I don't think us northern liberals

1254
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:00,100
should have come down to this little southern

1255
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,840
town guy.

1256
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:06,100
Well, I guess we're just gonna march right into that

1257
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,880
Mayberry lunch counter then, huh?

1258
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,540
That's right. Have some rhubarb pie.

1259
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,600
Be served.

1260
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:12,020
Boy, cut my hair, huh?

1261
00:42:13,040 --> 00:42:14,540
Freeze! All right. Hold it right there.

1262
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,140
You're under arrest. Okay, spread them.

1263
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,680
Get your hands up there. Okay, now you.

1264
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,540

00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,820
You have the right to one telephone call.

1270

All right, take him away.

1291

Yeah! Okay.

1292
00:43:37,860 --> 00:43:41,360
Excuse me, you with the dreadlocks, would you put your hands in the air, please?

1293
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,720
Uh, yes, sir.

1294
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:46,240
All right, just move away from the car. Move away from the car, please.

Uh, yeah, but that, uh, I...

1296

Just move away from the car, please.

1297
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,100
But Mr. Car will miss me.

1298
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:53,520
Turn around slowly.

1299
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,680
Oh, okay, I'll...

1300
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,380
Turn around slowly, thank you. Keep your hands in the air.

1301
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,860
Thank you. Just an routine check, Eric.

1302
00:44:00,440 --> 00:44:01,160
Okay, now...

1303
00:44:01,580 --> 00:44:01,980
Oh!

1304
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:05,360
Officer, that's...

1305
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:07,700
That's uncalled for.

1306
00:44:07,860 --> 00:44:11,780
Hey, just keep your hands in the air, pal. Now, reach, stretch the ankle.

1307
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:13,140
Oh!

1308
00:44:14,220 --> 00:44:15,780
That's cheating. I couldn't do it for you.

1309
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,660
I want to call the precinct, ma'am. Welcome on down here.

1310
00:44:18,660 --> 00:44:21,800
Oh, yes, bring them all over. Bring the whole precinct.

1311
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,520
All those that give a drill, all that one-night-long assault,

1312
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:26,880
you gotta call 10-4 on 9-0-1-8.

Hey, you weasel little rat, get off the air!

1316
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,380
Air, air!

1317
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,760
Look at that skulking little vermin.

1318
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:43,360
He's an example of the worst scum that ever walked the earth,

1319
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,700
the criminal cast.

1320
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:48,760
Look at that strange doliosophallic skull,

1321
00:44:49,060 --> 00:44:50,480
the narrow-set eyes,

1322
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:52,600
the quivering rabbit-like chin,

1323
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:55,560
ever moist with a veneer of spittle,

1324
00:44:55,740 --> 00:44:57,960
the long, cadaverous, twitching hands,

1325
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,680
the clashing, badly coordinated suit, vest, and tie combination,

1326
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:05,160
the Ralph Lauren polo shirt

1327
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:08,300
with the tiny, engraved polo ponies,

1328
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:11,360
and last but not least, that disgusting, syphilitic wart

1329
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:13,720
right in the center of his inflamed nose.

1330
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:16,300
It looked like a cat scratched him across the forehead,

1331
00:45:16,460 --> 00:45:17,880
and it seemed like a good idea,

1332
00:45:17,980 --> 00:45:20,340
so I brought out Cappy and I let him have it.

1333
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,200
This man's been scratched by a cat over a hundred times.

1334
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,440
Call an ambulance.

1335
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:32,580
Here comes the dog patrol, and not a moment too soon.

1336
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,700
Another bulldog drumming adventure.

1337
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:44,040
Out of the fog comes one relentless man

1338
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,700
with his underthrust jaw ready to bite out a chunk of crime.

1339
00:45:49,700 --> 00:45:54,260
We have a Gen 15 at B711 at 12 to 34.

1340
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:55,180
Be there.

1341
00:45:55,300 --> 00:46:00,240
And we have the store attendant bending over

1342
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,820
and grabbing his ankles, and we're photographing the area.

1343
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:05,140
Four-throwing, and he's got a gun.

1344
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:05,140


1345
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:05,140


1346
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:05,140


1347
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:05,140


1348
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:05,140


1349
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,760
We're talking to the kitty now.

1350
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:09,780
Trying to find out from the kitty just what happened.

1351
00:46:14,340 --> 00:46:15,060
Standby, Ralph.

1352
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:15,840
Standby, Ralph.

1353
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:19,680
Can you get stuff in control?

1354
00:46:23,960 --> 00:46:24,780
Standby, over.

1355
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,220
Maybe Sheriff can explain all of this.

1356
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:34,000
Yeah, after the suspect's been over,

1357
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:36,960
we'll put the log over the wall into the rectum.

1358
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,180
Okay, now pull out the...

1359
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:39,220
Oh, no, that's not how it goes.

1360
00:46:39,260 --> 00:46:40,260
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1361
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:41,020
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1362
00:46:41,020 --> 00:46:41,580
That's not showing.

1363
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,060
Not right.

1364
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:42,960
No, no, no, no, no.

1365
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,560
No, no, no, no, no.

1366
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:44,540
So we've got to...

1367
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,400
Hello, I'm here.

1368
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,560
Hi, this is General Fordell.

1369
00:46:48,980 --> 00:46:49,440
Oh, no!

1370
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,580
Oops, it seems that our caller fell down.

1371
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:58,560
We'll return you to Night of the President after these messages.

1372
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,180
That's...

1373
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:01,220
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1374
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:01,640
Okay, wait.

1375
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:02,300
Hold on, wait.

1376
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,220
That's Digby, the biggest president in the world.

1377
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:07,000
Okay, well...

1378
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:11,120
And that was former President Gerald R. Ford,

1379
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,580
who took a tumble off his golf course, a cart...

1380
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,740
I thought that was Chevy Chase.

1381
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:15,640
Oh, Chevy Chase.

1382
00:47:15,780 --> 00:47:16,160
Oh, sorry.

1383
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:16,840
You think it was?

1384
00:47:17,080 --> 00:47:18,300
Oh, it was so funny when they did it.

1385
00:47:18,300 --> 00:47:18,660
Oh, well.

1386
00:47:18,980 --> 00:47:21,100
It was funny, those were the days, I'll tell you.

1387
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:21,540
Yeah.

1388
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:24,060
Yeah, it could have been so fun, but...

1389
00:47:24,060 --> 00:47:27,500
In a related story, a freakish accident on the set of

1390
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,420
The Karate Kid 4, The Final Beginning,

1391
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,800
took the lives of Hollywood's entire Brat Pack actors.

1392
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,060
Among the dead were counted Ally Sheedy, Emilio Estevez,

1393
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,940
Judd Nelson, Corey Haim, River Phoenix, Mary Stewart Masterson...

1394
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,440
It's the same news every week.

1395
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,780
...Jarren Reeves, John Friar, Molly Ringwald...

1396
00:47:42,780 --> 00:47:45,180
It's the same group of people dying.

1397
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:46,600
Most of all, the same crash.

1398
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:48,860
The same...

1399
00:47:48,860 --> 00:47:50,080
Oh, that would have been actually...

1400
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:52,060
Oh, what...

1401
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,400
Oh, now you're showing that kiddie porn again.

1402
00:47:55,760 --> 00:48:00,360
Ah, well, you see, the tragic trade in kiddie porn

1403
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,780
was one of the basic needs of the movie.

1404
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,360
We've heard the news stories of the past year,

1405
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:08,660
but we didn't seem to be able to interest the electorate

1406
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:11,760
in previous news stories of the recent past life.

1407
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,300
But we happen to think, confidentially,

1408
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,000
just between you and me...

1409
00:48:16,780 --> 00:48:18,420
Yeah, that's right, folks.

1410
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:21,660
Down at subgenius hell or heaven, as the case may be.

1411
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,620
A judge in Santa Ana, Orange County

1412
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:29,880
levied a $58 fine against a driver for a mortuary transport service

1413
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,600
who failed to convince the court

1414
00:48:31,600 --> 00:48:36,020
that four frozen cadavers in his van were legal carpool passengers.

1415
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:36,940
Oh, yum yum.

1416
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,600
In a related story, a 10-year-old Tucson, Arizona boy

1417
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,180
stole his mother's car and drove it 65 miles an hour

1418
00:48:44,180 --> 00:48:47,080
to the Mexican border where he tried to sell it.

1419
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:51,660
Yes, safe sex is for everyone, even necrophiliacs.

1420
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:55,300
And the safest of all sex is the church of the subgenius.

1421
00:48:55,940 --> 00:48:59,960
Doctors at Torquemada General Hospital in Balaponga, California,

1422
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:01,580
a suburb of Los Angeles...

1423
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:01,860
...in the San Luis County,

1424
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,480
announced that the removal of septic ichor

1425
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,540
from the minuscule brain of the 40th President of the United States,

1426
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:10,180
Ronald Wilson Reagan, was, quote,

1427
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,960
a screaming mad bitch and cool, droovadelic,

1428
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,800
nidokino-egogo success, unquote,

1429
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:18,280
according to an official spokesperson

1430
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,640
who spoke only upon the condition of complete anonymity.

1431
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:24,900
As a subdural hematoma caused by President Reagan

1432
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:27,240
being thrown by a bucking syphilitic horse

1433
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,260
in Death Valley days of July,

1434
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:32,480
dictated the fluid it collected underneath the dura,

1435
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,480
a membrane that covers the brain inside the scar.

1436
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:39,980
A hematoma is a pool of blood as in a bruise.

1437
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:43,380
The blood it collected on the top of the unkillable President's brain,

1438
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,440
causing the former President to operate from the left or liberal side of the brain.

1439
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:51,280
Before the operation, Reagan had advocated unilateral disarmament,

1440
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,260
nudism, the Equal Rights Amendment, eating oat bran,

1441
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,200
giving in to communism, legalizing all drugs,

1442
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,820
and turning the country upside down,

1443
00:49:58,820 --> 00:50:02,240
scraping the crap off it and giving it back to the Indians.

1444
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,320
President George Bush tried unsuccessfully to contact

1445
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:08,880
the former chief executive from his command post aboard Air Force One,

1446
00:50:09,060 --> 00:50:11,820
but was impotent to abort Reagan's tirade.

1447
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:15,780
Former television evangelist Jim Baker was transferred Friday

1448
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,920
to a federal prison here to serve a 45-year sentence

1449
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:21,160
for fraud, conspiracy, and unmanly unbecoming crime.

1450
00:50:21,160 --> 00:50:23,560
He'll be teaching dancing down there in the special management.

1451
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:28,120
Police kept jeering onlookers away from the entrance to the Federal Medical Center

1452
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:32,360
when a van brought the disgusting Baker to prison just before high noon.

1453
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:33,140
I just want to know when the vehicle was for the, uh...

1454
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:36,560
I mean, what is it that you can slip to somebody that makes them

1455
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:41,500
put their head under the couch and curl up in a fetal position?

1456
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,540
According to the prison's information office,

1457
00:50:43,820 --> 00:50:47,460
Baker had been held in Alabama since October 24th,

1458
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,440
when a judge in Charlotte, North Carolina,

1459
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:53,460
sentenced him to 450 years and fined him $500 million

1460
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:58,000
for defrauding his PTL followers and wearing designer glasses.

1461
00:50:58,120 --> 00:51:01,380
Unless his appeal is successful, authorities have said

1462
00:51:01,380 --> 00:51:06,320
Baker will serve at least 200 years before being eligible for execution.

1463
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,520
At the medium security prison in Rochester,

1464
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:14,860
Baker will be placed in a 300-degree oven and roasted to a golden brown.

1465
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:18,560
He will stay in a room without bars or alcoholic beverages

1466
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:22,500
and have access to basketball courts, a baseball field,

1467
00:51:22,840 --> 00:51:26,600
polo practice, intermediate swimming, developmental activities...

1468
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:27,760
It's just better that way.

1469
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:29,460
...in prison.

1470
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,060
Ladies and gentlemen, we interrupt this program

1471
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,980
to bring you a live, extemporaneous interview with the Reverend Jim Baker.

1472
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:40,060
Whoa! No, we don't!

1473
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:45,760
Uh, dear friends, wonderful little bits of, uh,

1474
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:51,040
the KPFA subgenius show that is the, uh,

1475
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:54,980
more than an hour, less than a show

1476
00:51:55,940 --> 00:51:58,100
done in Berkeley there by the, uh,

1477
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:58,100


1478
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,040
Dr. Howell Robbins.

1479
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:03,460
Howell and Dr. Howell and, uh, Puzzling Evidence.

1480
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,920
Engineering and muttering there in the background.

1481
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:12,720
And, uh, I've got this lovely little cover tune here that,

1482
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,780
uh, the Rudy Schwartz Project did.

1483
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:19,880
Our friends, uh, Rudy Schwartz Project in Austin.

1484
00:52:20,820 --> 00:52:23,100
And, uh, Joe Newman there.

1485
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:26,660
Some of you may recognize the wonderful Max Fleischer cartoon

1486
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:28,080
that this piece is from.

1487
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:34,940
Scariest, scariest damn cartoon I ever saw in my life, friends.

1488
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:38,260

Now beware, have a care, you're just filled with air

1508
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:28,520
A single pin would rip your skin, and the pincushion man in the forest there

Always have a pin at hand
