What is it about the human psyche that enjoys being scared?
Animals flee from frightening situations, but humans pay to relish them.
Freddy films go from endless sequels to television series,
while Stephen King books become bestsellers overnight.
But of all the media available, only one utilizes the very atmosphere most creatures automatically fear.
Total darkness.
That medium is radio.
And if you think Freddy or Stephen King are scary,
you ain't heard nothing yet.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
So long, folks!
Isn't it funny how something can seem big or old or slow
until something else comes along that's bigger or older or slower?
There's a big name for that.
We call it the subgenius powerhouse.
What?
The subgenius powerhouse.

But if that's old, what does that make Grandpa?
Incredibly huge, with incredible desires for love and vengeance.
From beyond space, it came.
An unspeakable terror so horrible, no man who saw it lived to tell another.
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
Now, Judge Barker, it's time for my revenge.
For all those months I spent in prison, I've been a coward.
And I'm not in jail because of you.
No, no, that gun.
Stay where you are, Judge, and don't move.
This gun is absolutely silent.
It merely shoots a tiny needle of my own special design.
This special poison on this needle will stretch your lips in death
into the famous trademark of the subgenius powerhouse.
What?
Ha ha ha ha ha.
That's right, Judge.
Beg me, please.
Now, this is what I want you all to do.
If you got faults, defects, or shortcomings, you know, like arthritis, rheumatism, or migraines,
whatever part of your body it is, I want you to lay it on your radio.
Let the vibes flow through.
Funk not only moves, it can remove.
Dig?
The desired effect is what you get when you improve your interplanetary funkmanship.
Sir Lollipop Man.
Chocolate-coated, freaking habit form.
Doing it to you in 3D.
So groovy that I dig me.
Once upon a time called now.
Somebody say, is there funk after death?
I say it's 7-up.
Yeah.
Key Funk!
Bop!
Bop-bop.
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop.
Bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop-bop.
Ha!
Yes, dear friends, welcome to one more hour of slack.
You never know when it's going to be your last.
I swear I never thought I'd make it to this far in the week.
Last week I mentioned I'd been up working till midnight every night.
This week it's more like 2 in the morning.
The life of a film cutter, friends.
Oh, actually it's glamorous and high paying.
By the way, before I go any deeper into the show, those of you who pledged your $60, and
hoped to get a subgenius videotape, arise in the mail.
Well you will pretty soon.
Let me explain what we've done here.
Rather than try to make home dupes of them, as we had been planning with Will O'Dobbs'
decks.
Bob said no.
He said to go ahead and spend lots and lots of money and have them done more professionally.
And we should be getting those in about a week.
And we will mail them out to those of you who have actually sent in your pledged checks.
And that was actually most of you.
Praise Bob.
You know, it's amazing that the subgenius listening audience is one of the more honest
audience groups among the various KNOA and categories of shows.
It sure doesn't make sense.
But the fact that it doesn't make sense is what sort of makes it make sense.
Same thing goes for the church newsletter.
We're just about to mail it.
As a matter of fact, Will O'Dobbs and I will probably be up for the rest of the night doing that.
But if you need information about the show.
Or how to get more slack.
Or how to know that man J.R. Bob Dobbs a little better.
That mighty salesman.
That living avatar of slack.
Why, you can call the station here.
And tonight's show, actually, we've got, seeing as how all I've been doing is trying to get
the magazine and the videotape.
I just don't know.
I just blew off doing the show.
I started putting this show together at 7 o'clock.
Fortunately, puzzling evidence, Dr. Howell, Gary Gbrogfran, Erp, and others started putting
it together months ago in Berkeley for the KPFA broadcast out there.
So I've got a whole lot of new wondrous show that dare not speak its punchline coming up.
As well as some brand new Father Joe, some mighty, mighty inspirational preaching from Father Joe Mama.
Two sermons here.
Time Share Religion and Bob's Reign of Terror.
Oh, yes.
The Harvest.

Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
I knew that somebody was stealing out of that case.
That's why last night I rigged up this alarm.
If anybody touches that door without pushing the hidden button, the alarm goes off.
Tom, I'm disappointed to know that you're the one who has been stealing from me.
But honest, Mr. Carson, it wasn't me.
I caught you.
I know, but it wasn't me.
This is the first time.
We caught them, and it was us.
And yes, we did.
It's the Puzzling Evidence Show here on the air with our background sound effects people.
Let's resume show, eh?
They caught little Timmy.
They caught him.
They caught that child.
And they burned his little britches off.
That's right.
They caught him because he didn't stand tall for what he believed in.
And then little Jimmy became an astronaut and sailed high over everybody.
There he goes, circling around our planet at an incredible rate of speed.

A weak thumb of this collar.
Ah, wee!
Ah, wee!
Ah, ah.

Out of the...
Ah!
Oh, that is my favorite song for sure.
Oh, we're out of that Belfast battle zone.
Slave driver drove his tank into his reserved parking spot and stepped out looking like
Margaret Thatcher.
The war was on.
Ah.
The keys on the typewriter had sharpened.
points that kept sticking into our fingers. The dictating equipment started asking us questions,
and our beepers sent electric shocks just through our body like a cattle prod. Out in the warehouse,
the trucks kept banging into the docks, not even thinking about stopping. Oh, our frail bodies
were strapped to the chairs, and our chairs were chained to the desks. Our pleas for justice
were ignored, and the end seemed near. But we busted our Margaret Thatcher slave driver's
little bitty book. We've judged out of their brick fortress. The streets are our
hours because it's Friday! Friday! Friday!
Friday!
Come on, Billy. Who cares if it's Friday? Just have one little hot dog, that's all.
Now, what's the matter?
What's the matter?
Oh, the telemetry's coming in now.
Um, readings are coming off the, uh, start here.
A mighty hot dog is our lord.
Start?
Steaming hot dog.
Oh, he's not.
A mighty slice of Hong Kong-style...
As painful as the burning embers from Bob's pipe poured over the loins at the moment of ecstasy.
So...
Oh, that's very painful when you do that right in my ears. I wish you wouldn't do that.
It really hurts.
Hey, uh, is Gary there?
No.
Oh, okay.
Your microphone really must be strong.
If he was there, I would ask him if he had heard the new oink-a-boink-a, uh...
Who lives where?
Oh, what do you, uh, what do you mean?
By interjecting all these...
I'm trying to get a bead on what you're saying, son, so I can...
Well, it's clear as the azure sky of deepest summer. What are you talking about?
Well, it may be clear to you where you are, but it's not always possible to hear you clearly through the phantasmagoric bulbarage of...
Well, why do you always turn the collars down, huh? Why do you always talk over the collars and turn them down?
Because I can't always hear the collars. And, of course, you've got to keep the show constantly gibbering, squeaking, and babbling.
Oh, okay, here we go.
Oh, the elevator. The service elevator. It started. Somebody's in the building. It must be that maniac.
I'm just going to clean up this collar. The fragments here left him on the floor.
Do you realize that if Nelson Mangelt... I can't even say his name right now.
He's out there in the desert digging in the gold, gold ground.
That's right. He's free now, but if he had actually committed a real crime, he'd still be in jail.
Oh, I don't know about that.
So I suggest we trick him into trying to steal a candy bar.
You mean like, like from Mr. What's-His-Name's store?
Yeah.
Uh, Billy, Billy.
Why did you think you could steal from Mr. Gunderson's store?
Hey, uh...
Billy and Nelson Mandela were in the candy store.
Oh, I caught you.
No, come on, let's just say it.
Tell it to the judge.
Tell it to the judge.
Now, and you know what he told that judge. Yes, you know.
You know, but we can't say it on the air because of FCC standards and practices.
Federal Communications Commission Regulation Number 976304-D.
Which state?
The State Tribunal and his Partyedenaras.


Anyone who uses a bad word on the radio has to rum the gauntlet of Iroquois Warriors
right after the show.
And here they are now.
The cultured sci fi, Iroquois Warriors, you warm up by playing a little classical piano
R Beethoику.
before sticking horrid, poisoned sticks into your flesh.
Chris gee, this is和.
Yeah, I do it all the time. It's a way of staying awake and keeping abreast of time.
You'd have to stick a stick in me to get me to listen to this show.
Well, some people like it, like this caller here,
who's trying to reach us from the Piero del Fuego.
Hello, you're on the air.
And so little Johnny Valjean was knocked off to prison
to spend 19 years twirling in the hot sun in back-breaking agony.
Well, it was good for him.
It gave him moral character exercise.
That's what made this country great.
What's the point?
The point?
Well, it's those needles sticking out of your flesh, you foolish person.
I always do that.
It's my Cenobite heritage.
Cenobite, eh?
Yes, we're Cenobites from Pinheadville, hell.
You see, these pins give us an incredible amount of agony,
and they're stuck in every decisive place to create never-ending waves of pain.
Stop needling us and get to the point.
Well, that is the point.
Oh, look what happened.
He got too near the reactor core.
These callers don't even know how to approach the subgenius show.
A little flea.
Flaming fleck of phlegm in the dying, entropic superstructure of the cosmos.
Oh, you mean this closet here?
Whoa, that's a good one, Gary.
Now I suggest you close that monster closet
before we're attacked by unthinkable things that might come easing out at any time.
Oh, here they come, slithering.
Get back!
Oh, no, it's the tambourine people.
And the march of the things now is...
Now, this is a beautiful float.
It's the Thing Society, and those are the Thingettes,
and they're beautiful.
Beautiful, abbreviated uniforms, waving and winking at the crowd now.
And they're throwing what appears to be candy of some kind,
because look at those kids go to scoop it up.
Those are candied Thing Baby eggs, Hal.
Have one.
Oh, thanks.
You sure you don't want it yourself?
No, no, I had one.
Well, I'll try it.
Just one is enough to...
Oh, it's pretty good.
It's kind of like, yeah, peanut butter,
and a little bit like mummy dust.
Yeah, but wait till you try to go wee-wee.
It'll smell bad.
It's like ale and white.
It's my mouth.
It's like, oh, powerful candy.
Mummy dust.
He could tell right away.
Oh, powerful candy.
Oh, powerful mummy dust.
And so Hal shrank down to a little three-inch radio personality.
It hurts.
Don't worry, we'll get it back before the end of the show.
It's all in the radio wrist here.
Guys, get these spiders out of here.
Oh, it's just a 10-pound cooking spider from where he sees it.
Hey.
Okay, let's drive the show around real fast.
Please help me.
Help me.
I'm sorry.
Help me, please.
We've got the anecdote here in the trunk.
Come on, that's Drag Race.
Oh, and that must be an elephant's trunk.
Cool, cool.
It was like being a hell's angel
When I sang this song for the first time
I go up to my home
With my little girl
That I made for a singer
This is the swinging love corpses, dear friend.
Oh, Electron
We're there
And that was when we didn't wear any underwear
We thought it was cool
To be hanging free in the breeze
And me and Electron would go riding
With the hell's angel
On the weekend
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.













Fundamental love is hard to get away from

And we went to the Academy
To study philosophy and get associate in psychology
As well as the heart poetry
And the tradition of unifying vision

and the pro-pig-toy-oim-together.
Oh, you know my name, I'm...
I'm...
wiping my mouth and lighting a cigarette
while picking up a new teach-me.
It's over the hill with Angel on the weekend.
We're reading together on over-flow skid row.
I've got the noise and drama from this,
and it's a little bit like translation, so...
The voice of the news,
it's electric,
electric,
electric,
despite the static.
The voice of the news,
it's electric,

The voice of the news,

But he was a Hell's Angel on the weekend.
He had a ring in his hair,
and a bald in his clothes,
and he peed on his clothes,
and his sister's hose,
while she was wearing them.
He cared no,
because he was a Hell's Angel on the weekend.
I remember those times
when I used to ride with my pal, Electron.
Because we're
Hell's Angels on the weekend.
And Electron,
Electron really sucks around the hour.
Me and Kathy went out together.
With Johnny and Electron.
We was riding fast.
By the way, my name is Pro-Dot.
Electron,
remember the hands called Kevin.
We'll see you tomorrow.
A weird song there, dear friends.
Dr. Philodrummon and the swinging love corpses.
Yeah, it's not that funny.
It was a dark time
in the history of the Empire.
The Renubium space pirates
had attacked the peaceful moon of Organda 1,
and the space spitters
were circling the planet,
ready to drop mushroom bombs to see what happened.
They were trying to subjugate
the populace of four-armed teddy bears
with big friendly eyes.
Let's join the princess and her stupid companion,
the robot rodent, Ratface,
as they decant out of their silver tubes
for another adventure.
Our possible guests,
two nice girls.
Two nice girls?
So where, where, where, where are the girls?
And so, birth control is here,
out here in the high Pacific.
Look, they put a drawing by me
in the start of the list of people.
The drawing of everybody.
Here in a little stark fist of whatever.
I know a certain stang said I was in the issue,
but I've looked and looked and I'm nowhere in it
except for this one tiny little drippy drawing.
Oh, that's not true, Dr. Howell.
Or maybe it is, I can't remember.
Maybe it was the stuff we haven't printed yet.
But it don't matter none,
because Father Joe Mama's gonna tell you
exactly what's going on.
I know you.
What?
It depends again on breaking the records over radio.
No kidding.
Rock music, Blairs!
Not for long.
Hello, friends, and welcome.
You know, there comes a time in everyone's life
when they have to ask themselves this simple question.
Why?
Why?
Why?
Now, most religions will answer that question
with another question, why not?
But we at the Church of the Subgenius believe
you deserve a better answer to your lifelong quest
than just the same question turned around
and thrown in your face.
We just so happen to believe your pursuit of truth
is relevant, is worthwhile, and is important.
Granted, we don't pretend to know all the answers,
but we damn sure plan to find out.
In the meantime, we promise to help you search for the truth
without fear of the consequences.
Why?
Because we like it.
Because we like you.
And because if you're like us, you'll like us.
Because we're not afraid to consider our own validity.
We're not scared to look in the mirror, see what we saw,
take out the saw, cut the mirror in half,
two-ass make a hole, climb in the hole,
and pull it in on after us.
Because we're not frightened by our own inner selves.
Nor are we worried that we're not going to measure up to our own standards.
Hell, we are the standard by which everyone else is measured.
We're the bastards in the class by ourselves
who constantly throw off the curve,
why should we worry?
We're not afraid of the answers,
because we're the only ones who can prove whether the answers are right or wrong.
We encourage doubt and disbelievers.
We don't burn heretics, we herald them.
That's why we're the first church to pay taxes.
We want to be examined by the IRS.
Now how many churches do you know want that?
Not a one, because they're all chickens.
They've all got something to hide.
Not us.
Here at the Church of the Subgenius,
the better you look, the closer we look.
That's why we're also the first and only church to offer timeshare religion.
That's right, timeshare religion.
You try it, you like it, you buy it.
Why do we take that chance, you ask?
Because religion is too important to lead the chance.
Like when, where, and by whom you were born.
Because let's face it, that's what determines the religious destiny of 99% of the people on this planet.
If you're born in a Moslem village by Moslem parents, you're gonna be Moslem.
If you're born in a Hindu village by Hindu parents, you're gonna be Hindu.
So supernaturally, if you're born in a voodoo village by voodoo parents, who do you do?
Voodoo, of course.
It's that simple, sad to say.
You need a carton of salvation, you go to the nearest convenience store.
But don't you think that when your soul is on the line for all eternity,
it's worth your while to show up?
After all, they can't all have the best deal now.
And they know it.
That's why they get so nervous when someone starts asking questions.
Do you know what most religions do to you when you start asking questions?
Why, they kill you, of course.
Because death destroys the comparison shopper.
Execution eliminates the educated.
And when those intelligent but trouble-making few slowly burn away at the stake,
not only do they stop asking questions, but so does everyone else.
And yet, after centuries of purges, the subgenius gene still survives.
We've released our seed everywhere and we're still growing.
While every other religion has enjoyed a blood fest and slaughtered its less than enthusiastic membership,
the Church of the Subgenius stands alone as the only church never to have hurt its own or anyone else's followers.
Granted, we may have assassinated our own leader, but we were just beating the conspiracy to the punch.
The fact remains that you're safe with us, and our record proves it.
Try us. Take Bob for a test drive.
There's no obligation and no salesman will call, because you're calling him.
Afterwards, you can try any other religion you want, and if you're not completely satisfied, we'll return your soul in full.
Do you know any other religion that makes that offer?
No siree! Most of them try to make you feel guilty just for thinking about it.
Or if you do leave, they'll send you straight to hell or make you drink sex.
Or if you can't be yourself or even survive a Holy Grail government, or if you simply don't care for being an idol,
ask them to return your soul and see what happens.
If you're lucky, they'll only laugh at you, but not Bob.
No siree, Bob will laugh with you, all the way to the bank, because he knows, he knows you'll be back.
That's how he can go and afford to give you a triple your money back guarantee.
If you're not completely satisfied for any reason, triple your money, double your damnation, and all of your soul and slack back!
back. So go ahead,
compare. You'll see
why Bob's best and why the smart
subgenius shopper says, if you
buy it but it's broken, take it back.
Jack, herein is the word of
Bob. Praise Bob.
Amen. Oh, thank you so
much, Father Joe Mama out of
Stanford. And, uh, I think there's something
Yep. This is the kind of thing
he plays. Raise your hand and recite after

uh yeah see you there mom
i guess i i think not a bit not a bit no it influenced me it kept me awake through long
and fitful nights of slumberless torture well maybe maybe that we should all quit the church
of reedies caller you'll see it'll be all right and then like a horrible light blasting and
burning my brain the caller now what about it well what have you got to say for yourself
the one listener here on the air and the one person
more people in the studio than are actually listening to the show we hope
you
know i don't that might we know that's not true unfortunately on the other hand when
are we would we be lucky if we're broadcasting now there's only a few people listening but
we're actually broadcasting we can use the secret information find out how many people
they don't understand it's many more than you care to hurt us hell but they're so they're
so blocked in there they want to see us well why don't you open our minds how why don't
you open our third nostril and i'll make one more attempt here grab those example of synchronicity
in action you think you're going to be able to see us you're going to be able to see us
always
this is now whatever time it is so early in the morning but in fact it's weeks later
it's in texas and it's at three o'clock in the afternoon when a huge crowd is hearing this show
hearing your meaningless utterances actually it's nine o'clock at night well that's where it goes
you know a scary thing happened to me today i was just entering my apartment and a guy like a
process server stepped up to me and said are you real name and i said uh why yes and he said well i have nothing to say this intended as aметhe или المکةور في يوضح الر strokesم الم plötzlich آ我不 أنت ثم أنت







have a little something for you from wolf realty and he handed me a little white envelope oh so
you don't find this interesting well i won't tell you the punchline but if you see a shopping cart
going down the street full of plastic dinosaurs followed by a rather sad and shabby looking chap
then you'll know who that person is true story that uh i exaggerated it was a 20 buck rent increase
that was the ball yeah yeah yeah yeah but you have to pay the whole 20 don't you because no i don't
in fact we don't even have to pay that because a weird rebate has been uh levied by the department
of demonology and infernal complications there they go now demolishing that old tax structure
to make way for the new revised reagan revolution income tax this is amazing yes i've got them all
confused here on the show now they're ruling around the rent is raised sticking right out and
the apron has been raised to be more but the rebate almost covers it and after that it's
every 20
20 years and still though i mean it was like being hurt by a processor you know that was a scary
moment he said are you here yeah yeah sure i'm and he said well i have something when it's called
thank the goddesses you have returned two weeks without subgenius is too much to ask
you understand it's like the process what would you like this week and now for today's reading
just as the extreme of pain meets sensual pleasure and the extreme of perversion borders
on mystical energy so too the extreme of banality allows us to catch a glimpse of the sublime
but i don't know anything about zontar
and i'm not going to tell you what the step beyond the church of the subgenius might be
hang on a second because i don't know and you don't know
and even though i'm not going to tell you what the subgenius is i'm not going to tell you what the subgenius is
but this this might tell you something that might help you decide for yourself
that piece of paper just might be the thing that saves your life in the next war

there is even more than 10 million people drinking water basically even water is fruits for the sake of god
the universal panacea itself.
And you can get that piece of paper

from Bob.
Yeah, I'm going to have to give that number again.
I have to.
Bob said it.
Actually, the way it goes,
Bob sold it.
I smoked it.

And as I said,
it's just,
oh, the world is too much with me lately, dear friends.
And I've been working,
working too hard.
I think you can hear it probably in my voice.
But,
I could.
I always bring,
when I come to the show,
I always bring these reading materials
in case none of the tape decks
and none of the record players work.
I always bring something to read.
I've got something here
that I could read
about violence in the 14th century
in Europe.
Violence as it was seen by my ancestors.

And, well, heck,
I wasn't going to read it,
but I've just decided I will.
Then I can slack off.
This is from
Barbara Tuckman's book,
A Distant Mirror
of the Calamitous 14th Century.
And it was,
In England,
coroner's rolls showed manslaughter
far ahead of accident
as cause of death.
And more often than not,
the offender escaped punishment
by obtaining,
benefit of clergy
through bribes
or the right connections.
Just like nowadays.
If life was filled with bodily harm,
literature reflected it.
One of Latour's,
Latour Landry,
this is my Tom Landry's ancestor.
One of Latour Landry's cautionary tales
for his daughters
tells of a lady who ran off with a monk
and upon being found in bed with him
by her brothers,
they,
quote,
took a knife
and cut away the monk's stones
and threw them in the lady's face
and made her eat them
and afterwards tied both monk and lady
in a sack with heavy rocks
and cast them into a river
and drowned them.
I don't know how they would cut away
his lucky crystal.
Violence was official
as well as individual.
Torture was authorized by the church
and regularly used to uncover heresy
by the Inquisition.
The tortures and punishments of civil justice
customarily cut off hands and ears,
racked,
burned,
flayed,
and pulled apart people's bodies.
In everyday life,
passers-by saw some criminal
flogged with a knotted rope
or chained upright in an iron collar.
They passed corpses hanging on the gibbet
and decapitated heads.
And,
quartered bodies impaled on stakes
on the city walls.
In every church,
they saw pictures of saints
undergoing varieties
of atrocious martyrdom
by arrows,
spears,
fire,
cut-off breasts,
usually dripping blood.
The crucifixion
with its nails,
spears,
thorns,
whips,
and more dripping blood
was inescapable.
Blood and cruelty
were ubiquitous in Christian art.
Indeed,
essential to it,
for Christ became Redeemer
and the saints sanctified
only through suffering violence
at the hands of their fellow men.
And, of course,
you old-time subgeniuses
know that we've certainly
learned from that example
and picked up some of their wonderful hints,
such as what I'm doing right now.
In village games,
players with hands tied behind them
competed to kill a cat
nailed to a pole.
They were forced to jump off a post
by battering it to death
with their heads,
at the risk of cheeks ripped open
or eyes scratched out
by the frantic animal's claws.
Trumpets enhanced the excitement.
Or, a pig enclosed in a wide pen
was chased by men with clubs
to the laughter of spectators
as he ran squealing from the blows
until beaten lifeless.
Accustomed in their own lives
to physical hardship,


medieval men and women
were not necessarily repelled
by the spectacle of pain,
but rather enjoyed it.
The citizens of Mons bought,
bought a condemned criminal
from a neighboring town
so that they should have the pleasure
of seeing him quartered.
It may be that the untender
medieval infancy produced adults
who valued others
no more than they had been
being valued by the people.

They valued in their own formative years.
And you know, times just haven't changed
all that much, have they dear friends?
And I think Father Joe Mama
has something to say about that.
Uh huh.
Hello friends, and welcome.
The sermon tonight is entitled
Bob's Reign of Terror.
And it is called Bob's Reign of Terror
for a very good reason.
For the first time in a long time
I've been talking about this
because there's a storm a-coming.
A storm bigger than a million
hurricane mobs put together.
The clouds have been forming for years.
Vapor from a sea of wrath
created by years of tears.
Years of tears of sorrow.
Years of tears of anger.
Years of tears of frustration
at the human race.
And when I say human race,
I'm not just talking about thy neighbor.
I'm talking about you.
Yes, you and your neighbor.
And the storm of genius
is not good enough that you
read the bauble every night.
It's not good enough that you donate
your piddly little cheap Charlie love offering.
Bob demands the same respect
from everyone on your block.
That means you, your neighbor,
and your neighbor's neighbor.
And it's your job to convert them.
Cause there's a storm a-coming friends.
Now since the central message of Bob is slack
I'm not gonna remind you that you're running out of time.
You know it.
Bob knows it and the exes who at this very moment traveling towards the earth at the speed of light know it and when they arrive
Friends and they start their whole scale death and demolition derby
They're not gonna have time to separate single homes from the rest of the block
You better play it safe and save your whole damn town or state or country or better yet planet
Bob said the meat shall inherit the burnout remains of a radioactive earth now if you're meek
You better be ready for your inheritance cuz there's a storm of coming friends. Are you meek?
Oh, are you unique?
Give yourself the simple test friends
When was the last time you spoke Bob's word to a stranger?
When was the last time you witnessed on to Bob when was the last time you embarrassed yourself for Bob? Oh, he's heard them all
He's heard all those excuses before you were too busy. You forgot you were scared
Well, maybe just maybe Bob will give the same excuse come next day. Perhaps just perhaps he'll be too busy
To save you from the killdozers or maybe he'll forget about you when the automated soul suckers come cruising down your street
Then again, he might just be too scared to admit to those anorexic aliens that you and he not only look the same
But taste the same especially when skewered and grilled over an open flame with onions peppers and just a touch of lime
Oh, yes friends
You better stick out your neck for Bob if you want him to stick out his neck for you cuz there's a storm
Coming friends. I ask you again
When was the last time you turned to a stranger said I know the secret of slack
Let me share it with you
When was the last time you risked your oh so important conspiracy image and tried to save another conspiracy dupe from internal death?
Damnation and never-ending torture Bob gave his life so that you could live not once but twice and maybe even thrice
That's better than any other leading brand. Is it asking too much for you to sacrifice just a little bit of slack back?
I think not because there's a story
I'm a coming friends if we could all just convert ten fellow humanoids and they in turn could convert ten more
We could pass on Bob's message the world over and saving in time
And who can deny the goodness of Bob's word who once haven't heard about salvation?
Bob's love Bob's second chance could possibly turn their back on Bob slack
You can make a difference, but you must start now because there's a storm coming friends the excess are coming
The comes are coming Bob's Ark was space for two of each couple is it coming from another space sooner than you think
Do you have a reservation?
Does your neighbor have his and whatever? What are this puny polluted planet? It wasn't such a bad place
Wasn't it just filling with wrong crowd?
Will it be spared or shall it be purged by fire?
Ravaged by radiation and drowned in a flood of fallout all of the above all from above all at the same time
Yes
They can't
Do it they have the technology and the sense of humor to make it happen the excess can make it rain fire
And then when nothing is left by the smoldering ash of a planet that once was Bob's tears will come pouring down
To stay about the dying embers and return the earth to its primeval state
But wait there in the mud was that a movement could it be the beginning of a new subgenius strain
The start of an evolutionary process that might once again result in a superior race of mutants
ones that are a little more appreciative of Bob and his overlords ones that could stop the pinks and
normals from over infesting the planet until the utter and total sterilization became the only sane alternative
Must it come to this dear friends?
Or can we nip it in the bud if we can we must and if we trust we shall but we must trust now
Because there's a
Storm coming I can feel the wind brothers and sisters and once that wind starts blowing only one power can break wind like that
Bob Dobbs we played on to you. Give us a second chance
Let us go forth and spread your word. Let us go forth and testify and witness and
Bob I'm in
and
praise
father Joe mama wonderful wonderful
I'd say as far as I'm concerned the greatest current acting subgenius preacher
Yes, indeed dear friends, what
Is there any escape from the North?
Oh God

Our
Father
Speaking

when they were just a cartoon company.
Back when the pioneers drove their Conestoga scooters
from fish to grass.
And they set out in the desert
at the ship of the desert, see?
By wagon chains and prospectors
hallucinating on weird alkaloids.
I had a barbarian's apron.
I seen the good ones and the bad ones.
Hey, ever been bit by a dead bee?
I wonder if there's really froth in these rocks.
Well, we're ready to find out.
Let's smoke them.
Oh, you're really stoned on these rocks.
Yeah, we're really rocking out on these stones.
They're magic!
Wow, it made the collar disappear.
Somebody help him, please.
Oh, that's better.
That's the first microsecond of explosion before you're born.
Yes, from nanosecond to nanosecond, the show continues.
Now, there's...
There's a listener that has never heard this show,
about to tune the station, the KPFA.
I'm afraid that's past name.
What side of ourselves are we to present to this person?
Let's present the rear end of the show,
the backside of the brain, as we call it.
The two divided cerebral hemispheres,
the buttocks area of the brain...
Not the honey brain!
...or the corpus gluteus,
is the area devoted to thoughts of strange confusions...
That's the Freedy's brain.
...and misdirections.
Not the Freedy brain!
Here we see is the source of all error,
superstition, credulity, and fanaticism.
And this is, coincidentally enough,
the subgenius show area of the brain.
The APFA.
Oh, no!
844-425.
Yeah, that's it, 844-425.
But if you're listening to K-O-N-N-O-N...
She'd have...
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
This is getting out of control.
No wonder woman there should call in every week
and have a column of her own here on the show.
She could just call in with her poetry.
Yeah, and we could have a marshmallow roast,
and a weenie roast,
and a rough roast,
and a rib roast.
Yeah, so consider yourself a permanent guest here on The Wire.
On the celebrity roast channel.
Oh, there's Hong Kong style.


What about Baby Napfeline?
That's going to be a real problem.
Baby Napfeline, you know,
I was kind of afraid he'd be lurking outside the show
when Earp was trying to get in,
and, well, you know what might happen.
I hear a pounding at the door.
I think it was Camphlagus Flambigia.
I run down the stairs,
and instead of Camphlagus Flambigia,
it would be Baby Napfeline.
Oh, phew, phew.
It wasn't anybody.
Okay, here we go.
All right, here we go.
That was a close one.
Don't even talk about it.
I would mess around.
Oh, there he is.
Oh, baby, that's it.
I'm just hallucinating.
It couldn't be.
Baby, don't get a little cigarette near that car.
Nurse, bring me another martini.
I'll just put the window down.
Let's just make a comic about it.
Yeah, that's it.
That's what all the other famous sun babies do.
They make comics out of stuff.
There's no one on the wing.
There's no Baby Napfeline out there.
Oh, no, it's not you, caller.
Yes, don't put it.
I heard Tetra hijacked.
Oh, look, he just put it into the sketch.
Oh, no, no, it's the captain of the plane.
You see, he's experiencing the motorway.
I've been here before.
It'll really happen.
It's real.
What page are you on, Hal?
Well, can you talk about it?
I'm on that Yogi Bear.
Yogi Bear?
Oh, I see.
Okay, I'm caught up with you guys.
Go ahead.
Look out!
Shooting a drug.
And the average bird.
We're going to start a club up for us.
Lonely subgenius men.
It's called the Geek Patrol.
And anyone who wants to join can send a self-addressed staffed envelope to us here at KPFA.
And we will send you the instructions on exactly what to do.
You're a hondrel.
Here they come.
Insert tab A and slot B.
See, it's easy.
That's the paper cutout method of sexual reproduction.
I got a hondrel by the handle.
And it's true.
I got Jesus by the tail.
Whee!
It's scary.
Jesus' tail is one of those scary things, man.
I'm losing weight and looking rather pale.
It's plain to see that I've got Jesus by the tail.
Ew.
Well, let him go.
He's cute.
He looks like...
Jesus looks like a little brine shrimp, pal.
I didn't know Jesus could be naked.
Look, I'm improvising.
Stop being so critical.
I'm trying to take off on this little brine shrimp.
Oh, it's a little puppet.
Oh, I see, I see.
It's briny.
Oh, I see.
We call him Briny Jesus, the savior of the deep.
That's right.
Even though he's only tiny and about to be eaten by the nearest fish...
Here in these tidy tide pools, the Jesus brine shrimp propagates in unusual numbers,
only to be gobbled up by the ferocious devil fish.
Uh-oh.
The bottom of the pond.
Anything to do with it?
Well, because it's their world.
Don't you know that nine out of ten major American industrial figures...
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear it.
I don't want to hear it.
Okay.
After all, these industrial figures are debatable.
And they are assemblable, like those over five years of age.
And there goes one right now.
That person hung up on us faster than he could have gotten on KGO.
So...
They probably...
Do you ever listen to KGO?






Do you ever listen to KGO at this time of night?
They've got this really kind of nasty English super liberal guy on.
The new thing.
Super liberal?
Oh, he's ultra liberal, but he's like real nasty, though.
It's like, you stupid, jerky, conservative...
Very patronizing right, isn't he?
No, no.
Let's not offend the callers.
So you could be listening to him right now.
Or us.
Hello, caller.
Hi, Bob.
Oh, no.
Worst he could have done.
Yeah.
Oh, I've offended all your callers.
I'll see.
There are no other callers.
So you've only offended yourself.
You've offended the other callers.
Calling from the bottom of the cow.
Offensive elevator now.
We'll lower you into the offensive pit.
Now into the puddle of effluvians we will go here.
Puddling effluvians is made possible by a grant from the Motorhead Corporation.
Who are the Chubby Corporation?
Anger, envy, and gluttony.
We are.
Who's calling us?
Now you're the Chubby Corporation.
Let's go over that again.
You say you saw some sort of hamster?
Let's go over that again with a lawnmower.
Well, I don't mind.
I'm using the lawnmower to chew my way through this sludge of uncertainty to the truth, the bone of the truth.
You know, they say the closer to the bone, the sweeter the meat.
And soon you'll be seeing the marrow of the matter.
Oh, oh, oh.
Oh, my God.
It figures.
Those guys on that show, they're always trying to surprise me.
Now what do I do?
Five minutes left.
Well, I could do like some subgenius shows.
It's like three records.
It's like three records at once.
And the music here.
Let's see.
And a Vietnamese cassette.
Wow, man.
This is like slack.
It's creative.
Cool.
Actually, that isn't bad.
It's not very good either.
Oh, that's better.
I'm going to go ahead and give that box number one more time.
I know you really want me to.
I know that almost all of you just can't get enough of that subgenius post office box number 140306 in Dallas, Texas.
Dear friends, 75214 for free information on how much the rest of the information will actually cost you.
And it's a bummer.
I'm going to go ahead and get it.
But we do have to roll or crawl or flop hideously flopping out of here like Lovecraft monsters to make way for upcoming show, Kathy's Potluck.
And why you never know what she's going to be playing.
But I predict.
Your own weight will be controlled by.
A vending machine for 10 cents worth of radaric rays.
I predict.
Embalming by radar where the body is turned to indestructible stone.
The body will be placed in a fiberglass casket which does not corrode, rot or burn.
Your great, great, great, great grandchildren will be able to look upon your countenance and see how handsome you really were.
However, I predict.
If you wish a sacred cremation, your ashes can be placed in a small warhead missile.
And fired into outer space where you would essentially and eternally continue your journey.
I predict within 10 years you will live in a push button world and you will even have a maid controlled by automation who is never sick, always cleans perfectly and never misplaces anything.
Always on time, never talks back, never gets fresh with your husband and will love your children.
Yeah.
Well, yeah, that was Rosie from the Jetsons, as Kathy just said here.
And we don't see two minutes.
No, it's not long enough to play a song.
The song I was going to play was one of the there's only one or two good songs off the new Oingo Boingo album.
What a disappointment, man.
It's like every their first album only had one bad song.
Second album had two bad songs.
Third album had three bad songs.
And that's gotten to the point now.
It's like the.
Ninth album.
And they're almost all bad songs.
I'm really, really disappointed.
And it comes at a time when we found out that that our hero, our erstwhile hero, Mr.
Mr.
Elfman was actually admired subgenius, but was, well, too busy to write back.
And, well, friends, as some of you may know by now, that does happen, although not necessarily coming with fame and fortune.
In fact, it generally tends to come with infamy and extreme poverty.
Thank you.
I noticed in all the comics.
Oh, well, no, that the lawnmower had ran over a toad.
You see that?
Oh, that explains it.
Yeah.
Well, that's a reprint of all the previous former life in a toad.
The power.
I always ask him, hey, would you rather be famous, happy or me?
The latest incident of a rash of law.
He wants to be me.
Yeah.
Well, if that lawnmower gives you a rash.
Just get rid of it, son.
Get a nice girl somewhere, you know, and go to a Christian youth meetings and, you know, you might meet somebody.
Or use the Wilkinson sword lawnmower.
It works a little better.
I see.
Oh, I see.
Very quick.
It does feel a little icy in the morning.
The handle sticks to your skin before you rev up the motor and start running over those green lawns, bellowing out subgenius silt at the top of your lungs.
That's how hyperclinians got stuck.
I got it.
Ouch.
It was the original lawn boy of the airwaves.
Yes, puzzling.
Maybe you better clean a little dust ball off the needle of that evidentiometer.
You see, it all started back when we decided to bring the Bay Area a show that it needed.
A show called...
Fruit Loop.
No, no, no.
That's a different show.
A show called the whatever it is now.
Oh, the Galingi Hour.
Yeah, right.
Well, we thought that the public was ready for Galingi and his friends.
His...
Little dog, his girlfriend, his kindly old lovable uncle.
Nobody knew what to do.
And, you know, get their microphones turned on.
And now, look, incredible spin-offs, cartoon shows, the Broadway musicals still running, the movie.
It is amazing.
The clubhouses, the franchises, the restaurants, all from the one inspiration of Teenage Mutant Ninja Galingis.
Yeah, amazing.
Teenage Unwed Mutant Turtles.
Yeah.
I can't say it.
Teenage Unwed Pregnant Mutant Turtles.
Yeah, you just did.
And look what happened.
There it is.
You weaken our reality that way.
And look, even the callers are responding.
You've hit someone's sore spot all right, mister.
I sure hope so.
I hope you're happy.
I poked at him long enough with this stick.
Yeah, hit his tennis elbow, his funny bone.
Listen to that pained laughter.
I hear the toad croaking at the bottom of the sound well.
It's still connected.
We've got a problem here on the air.
The toad, the power mower cough, chewed and clipped at the leg with a kind of hobbling hop has got to the gall.
And there that chopped up toad cries his heart out.
How many cries?
Because there's a lot of toad there.
Does it croak, grunt, or roll?
The rare original heart blood flows flat on the earth when you hide.
I used to have some flowing, flat toad here.
The wrench kept my anus, Barry.
Oh, that's the same old.
Aunt Bertha always did that.
Till his batrachian eye turns towards the sun.
It's a mystic monotone.
