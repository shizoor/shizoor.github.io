1
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:15,120
Brochures, menus, business cards, annual reports, t-shirts, mugs, advertising.

2
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,100
Is your company overwhelmed by its in-house graphic needs?

3
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,180
Then why not send it to the outhouse?

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:25,920
Yes.

5
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,420
Yes.

6
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:31,360
Outhouse graphics can do many eye-catching graphics.

7
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:35,320
In fact, we have hundreds to choose from.

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,820
And no job is too boring or repetitive for us.

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,600
At outhouse graphics, the customer is always right.

10
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,840
No opinionated designers on our staff.

11
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,440
And our state-of-the-art copy equipment can save you time,

12
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,620
and money, with that fast and efficient look.

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,120
You want it when?

14
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:02,220
Ha!

15
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:04,140
You'll have it.

16
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:08,960
If you can't do it in-house, send it to the outhouse.

17
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:14,240
Outhouse graphics has over 20 colors to choose from.

18
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:21,300
With paper stock ranging from Xerox white to many shades of off-white.

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:25,900
We use the finest Helvetica typefaces available.

20
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:25,900


21
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:25,900


22
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:25,900


23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,020
And we know the meaning of a straight line.

24
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:36,040
Our designs will fit you to a T-square.

25
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,800
Outhouse graphics from ScamArts.

26
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,760
I'm lifting off the top.

27
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:47,340
Okay.

28
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,640
And the music is being sounded now as the top is lifted from the head.

29
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,580
And the presidential autopsy begins here.

30
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,900
Once again, candy being inspected every single day.

31
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,620
And the show is being recorded.

32
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,800
I am attempting to disarm the timing mechanism.

33
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,460
Here at 4 a.m. at the timing mechanism of its own time.

34
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:06,260
We will take out the small explosive device from Kennedy's brain.

35
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,220
Yeah, I'm going to start the videotape to Byron here soon, so.

36
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,860
I'm removing the cerebral cortex.

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,980
Okay, cut through dura matter.

38
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,260
Into anti-dura matter.

39
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,200
Our newest, zaniest, knock-your-socks-off collection yet.

40
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,780
So switch off your computer and save yourself.

41
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:49,780


42
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:49,780


43
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:49,780


44
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:49,780


45
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:49,780


46
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:50,080


47
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,280
You know Printardaft also knows

48
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,280


49
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,920
like Uma and Backlory.

50
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,340
Brandish the erect palace.

51
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,200
What? Give it to me.

52
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:47,700
Y'all doing okay?

53
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,300
Any, uh...

54
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,260
Any Beatles fans in here tonight?

55
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,340
Beatles fans?

56
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,340
We got a great old song for you. It's called Daytripper.

57
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:08,640
It's called China Grove.

58
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,820
Any Doobie Brothers fans out there?

59
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,260
Doobie Brothers? We have a great old song. It's called China Grove.

60
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,280
That's right!

61
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,160
We just disappeared.

62
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,240
Don't you dare look.

63
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,240


64
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:55,720
Den medidas

65
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:55,720


66
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:55,820
That's right!

67
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:55,900


68
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:55,900


69
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:55,900


70
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:55,900


71
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,080
chicken procedures.

72
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,460
One, two, three!

73
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,980
A time when the old standards

74
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,100
have crumbled as if hit by history's

75
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:08,900
greatest tidal wave of filth and

76
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,960
perversion and sexual promiscuity

77
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,720
undreamed of even

78
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:13,900
five years ago.

79
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,340
Nothing is sacred,

80
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,780
and the profane is sold in the open

81
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,320
marketplaces of our cities.

82
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,860
Men and women dance naked

83
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,900
before the high altars of some of our

84
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,880
once great churches,

85
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,020
while the stately hymns of Christendom

86
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,880
are replaced by the

87
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,620
staccato beat of the jungle rhythms

88
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:35,140
and the occult incantations

89
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,660
of the jellyhead generation.

90
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:42,320
And now,

91
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,520
the Self Genius

92
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,160
Hour of

93
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,560
Swatch!

94
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,480
I don't care.

95
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,120
I don't care what length I go to anymore.

96
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,420
All is fair and all that.

97
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:57,260
Something sick.

98
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,940
Something sordid, vicious, and

99
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,680
depraved.

100
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,540
I was going to count the anal

101
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:06,120
and nipple references on the

102
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,060
last episode to see if we pulled

103
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,000
as many funny boners as possible,

104
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,120
meaning bad fogs

105
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,020
passes of soft mark

106
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,680
humans. Did we?

107
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,680
Yes.

108
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,680
I like that.

109
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:21,120
Oh well.

110
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,200
Father, forgive them.

111
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,360
They don't know.

112
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:27,080
What did I do?

113
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,520
What did I do?

114
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,060
What did I do?

115
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:29,060


116
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,700
An even more ominous development

117
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:33,960
in supernatural money emerged

118
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,680
in the late 18th century

119
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,820
when wholesale tampering with

120
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:39,280
God's magnetic laws

121
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:42,080
became a European craze.

122
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,420
The culprit

123
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,540
was the luminous Franz Mesmer,

124
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:50,020
who claimed to have discovered

125
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,700
the principles of what he called

126
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,280
animal magnetism.

127
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,740
Steeped in the doctrines

128
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,280
of Rosicrucianism,

129
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,500
the satanic cult which continues

130
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,740
to thrive in the United States today,

131
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,280
Mesmer claimed astrology

132
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,080
guided the body's systems

133
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:10,600
and that magnetized metals

134
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,520
could be used to cure illness.

135
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,040
What this devil worshipper

136
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,120
actually did was just disrupt

137
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,580
the soul's dual polarity and

138
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:31,020
concurrently affect the balancing magnetisms

139
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,340
of all human life.

140
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:34,980
Interestingly,

141
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,800
Mesmer and his followers,

142
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,580
the magnetopaths,

143
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,320
are considered the founders

144
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:43,820
of modern hypnosis and psychiatry.

145
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:47,160
Both of these schools also tamper

146
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,960
with affairs best left in divine hands.

147
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:53,340
The most famous of these schools

148
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:53,340


149
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:53,340


150
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,720
The Perfect Enlightenment.

151
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,940
Yes, you promised me a mint

152
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,680
a long time ago.

153
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,740
Mints for everyone!

154
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,500
Your own consciousness,

155
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,460
shining, void, and inseparable

156
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:06,740
from the great body of radiance.

157
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:07,860
What the hell is that?

158
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:10,940
It has no birth nor death.

159
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,760
What do they call it?

160
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,780
It is the immutable light,

161
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:17,900
which the Tibetans call

162
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:18,740
Bob.

163
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:19,920
Bob Bob.

164
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,100
Bob Bob.

165
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,580
Bob.

166
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,040
Bob.

167
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:22,580
Bob Bob.

168
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,400
Bob Bob.

169
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:23,540
Bob Bob.

170
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,180
Bob Bob.

171
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:24,180


172
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:27,340
Satisfy them of the sinful

173
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,120
of their basis,

174
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,520
and if they motionless outlive

175
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,560
in their hopeful use,

176
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:34,080
O allow the utterance

177
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:34,800
of thine retain

178
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,140
on erring inequity.

179
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,200
Clamor in their bravery.

180
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,580
Drive them to dive

181
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:42,040
their defense of fight

182
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,540
from their scare aid

183
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,140
in the day of conflict.

184
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:48,060
No one knows at this time

185
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,840
where Lee Harold Oswald is.

186
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:50,680
Having sex,

187
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:51,660
You're having sex.

188
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,120
Yeah.

189
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:58,220
It's just in that Lee Harvey Oswald was caught having sex in the movie theater in Dallas, Texas.

190
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:05,500
We confirm Lee Harvey Oswald was just nabbed having sex in a darkened movie theater in Dallas, Texas.

191
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,360
We now rejoin our scheduled broadcasters.

192
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,260
Ned, get a job out of show business.

193
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,180
You can't.

194
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,960
We're all sodomized.

195
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,640
You know what I mean?

196
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,700
In this sport, we're all made to line up and bend over and squeal like a pig.

197
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:23,880
You better let me in the centerfold, mister, or I'm going to make you bend over with me in that thing of yours.

198
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:27,540
I'm going to be holding a man and a shaved sow.

199
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:29,900
I have a career as a flobert.

200
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,600
I'm willing to shave a sow.

201
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:39,080
I'm willing to shave three sows and slap my mammy ten times and dump you in the river to boot of it.

202
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:39,540
What?

203
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,440
They don't like it when you shave their nipples.

204
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,100
You've got to avoid the nipples.

205
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,500
I think it would probably be painful, but in my case, I'm used to it.

206
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,680
They get tough and leathery when you do it.

207
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,580
But if you cover them with honey, then you can shave right over them.

208
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,460
You practice, you get perfect.

209
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,680
Like Jesus Christ.

210
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:56,560
Cover them with honey and they don't get hurt.

211
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,420
Well, they also taste better, too.

212
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,600
But I can't move my neck that far.

213
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,360
But that's what I'm going to do.

214
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:05,620
I'm going to shave a pig and I'm going to get in the centerfold.

215
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,080
And you can be in it with me, Dave.

216
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:07,900
I'm inviting you.

217
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:16,780
Well, I guess then I might as well take your salivary and your savory steaks and pies

218
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:18,580
and throw them in a bowl.

219
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:20,740
I'm going to have to shave them up a little.

220
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,680
I think this free association has gone too far.

221
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,100
Let's see.

222
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:25,440
Hi.

223
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,320
Yeah, no kidding.

224
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,920
Well, we got rid of the buzz.

225
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,740
Yes, there was a buzz.

226
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,740
It was trying to stop the show.

227
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,440
But I think we've got it under control now.

228
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,100
Yes, there's evil forces out there at all times,

229
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:46,380
some of whom have been on the air for the last ten minutes.

230
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,240
You just heard.

231
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:58,560
A little bit of Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Chaz on Brain Rot Theater on WESB in Cleveland,

232
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,680
where those tapes come from.

233
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:11,400
All mixed up and mom mixed up with the KPFA Berkeley subgenius show with Dr. Howell and Puzzling Evidence

234
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,640
tied up with Reagan's Polyp.

235
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,340
That's Sterno's new band.

236
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,000
In that band, they do.

237
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:27,640
In a given concert, they'll do 40 cover versions of Day Tripper, all exactly the same.

238
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:31,880
Most painful band ever.

239
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:35,540
Oh, but actually, there's more pain coming up.

240
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:41,140
This will be a bad show, dear friends, because we're being bad tonight.

241
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:46,640
Before I forget, I should mention also we heard from Lou Minotti.

242
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,520
Plan for.

243
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:49,400
Chaos.

244
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:53,080
Discussion about the Illuminati.

245
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,400
The Funky Bardos doing that thing.

246
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,620
And, uh, what else?

247
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,480
Reverend Ficus Strangulensis.

248
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,740
Okay, give me some slack.

249
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,720
All right, all right.

250
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:06,260
All right, all right.

251
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:14,580
And we got a new Rudy Schwartz project album in the mail just the other day from Reverend Joe Newman.

252
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,080
And he's got a song on here called Yodeling Satan.

253
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,360
I told you we're gonna be sort of bad tonight.

254
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,900
Um, and, uh, this kind of gets us started off.

255
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:32,160
This particular Rudy Schwartz album has, uh, quite a bit of, uh, liner notes.

256
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,360
And I'm gonna read you the liner notes about Yodeling Satan.

257
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:43,040
Yodeling Satan, this particular song, it's also the name of the album, is designed to get a rise out of idiots.

258
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,640
Beverly LaHaye of the Concerned Women for America.

259
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:58,620
A coalition of right-wing psychopaths has been quoted as saying that 40,000 to 60,000 ritual murders are committed each year by satanic cults.

260
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:08,000
Similar unsubstantiated nonsense is frequently repeated by certain police officers, quote, therapists, unquote, feminists, and journalists.

261
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:12,020
All apparently with very limited critical thinking skills.

262
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:17,800
Uh, not coincidentally, many of them have something to gain by perpetuating the myth.

263
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,320
Of satanic murders.

264
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:29,140
The normal murder estimate, I mean the satanic murder estimates by these people, exceed the FBI's normal murder count by approximately a factor of two.

265
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:34,420
To which Beverly responds that most murders go unreported.

266
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:40,760
No one has ever produced a shred of evidence that Satan exists, yet most Americans believe it anyway.

267
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:48,020
The FBI has been unable to uncover any evidence of satanic ritual murders and has written it off as a folk myth.

268
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:55,900
Despite this, police departments all over the country are jumping on the bandwagon, obviously sensing new funding opportunities.

269
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:04,300
Sick jerks like Jeff Dahmer are commonly lumped in with Satanism to lend an air of false legitimacy to the claims.

270
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:15,540
Fortunately, the ritual satanic murder abuse story is the lead in for the local, oh fortunately, excuse me, this print moves around on the page.

271
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,060
The closest fact similar to this is that the original story is a fake.

272
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,060


273
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,060


274
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:18,060


275
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,720
Families to Satan can be found within the fundamentalist Christian movement.

276
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:31,220
The next time you see a ritual satanic murder abuse story as the lead in for the local news, call the station and ask them to produce physical evidence for their story.

277
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:35,140
Other than spray painted graffiti near the local heavy metal club.

278
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,580
They won't have any.

279
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:48,040
This would all be funny if it weren't for the fact that people have had their doors kicked down in the middle of the night by ignorant redneck cops looking for members of the great Satanists.

280
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:48,040


281
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:53,860
The McCarthy era and the Salem witch trials come to mind.

282
00:14:54,040 --> 00:15:05,780
Meanwhile, real Satanists are at home reading Mindless Drivel by Anton LaVey and wasting their lives just like members of any other stupid religion.

283
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:24,920
Well at least their prayers are heard and are drugged up.

284
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,140
requk

285
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,240
Well, as soon as a他mes subversion of confidentiality is released from the book, he'll make his next sermon called the

286
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:41,300
Let the Right Be Known

287
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:43,420
The Nein qualified mobsters of the media will be able to find evidence that emphasises the ditch packing methods in human life.

288
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:43,700
Let the statement out because�

289
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:12,640
taste the blood on satan's claw dance a chicken crimson bra

00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:38,460
well there's a big light shining in the coconut grove where satan used to watch

294
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:42,300
the barney miller show syndicated television puts him in the

295
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:42,500
mood

296
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:50,500
hoping a pagoda just might get nude satan gets an erection staring at a pagoda's butt

297
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:55,820
meat and poultry by the pack extra servings bring them back

298
00:16:55,820 --> 00:17:01,240
ain't no need to raise a fuss just yodel your way to that flaky crust

299
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,100
to stop

300
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,000
to stop

301
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:09,000


302
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,780
Hopped a

In the mirror while his eyeball twitchs around

309
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:48,480
Let's watch Sammy's eyeball twitch

310
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,900
Don't bother asking if it's greasy or red

311
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,600
Or if he's got pointy horns stuck in his head

312
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,240
All you need to prove it is

313
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:18,460
A pointy horn is a pointy horn

314
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,960
Satan only happens if your tater's all sick

315
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,060
Hey Satan

316
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,480
Satan

317
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,560
He works better than guilt from your mind

318
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:32,540
Taste the blood on Satan's claw

319
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,860
Oh yes, dear friends

320
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:42,320
A little bit of the great reverend Joe Newman

321
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,220
Rudy Schwartz project

322
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,320
Yodeling Satan

323
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:46,940
And uh

324
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,020
Yeah

325
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,440
Yeah

326
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:48,440


327
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,140
Yes indeed

328
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,180
Jesus Christ

329
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,460
There's always been racism in the church

330
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,520
And Father

331
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:58,800
There's racism everywhere

332
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:01,300
Even what about Father Augustine

333
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,940
The leader in the 1500s

334
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,020
When the church controlled the entire world

335
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:08,160
Yes, say Augustine

336
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,500
He was a black man from the northern part of Africa

337
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:16,260
And he felt that the Jews should only be kept alive

338
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,920
Because they lived

339
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:23,500
As a testimony to having brutalized Jesus Christ

340
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,280
And for that reason only

341
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,460
He believed that they should not all be wiped out

342
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,900
And mass genocide

343
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:33,600
Yes, that's the only reason he was a racist

344
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,980
He was a racist

345
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,640
And then later on the church tried to hide his identity

346
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,720
Just because he was born in Africa

347
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,200
Is that not right Father Grace

348
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,880
That's true and it's disgusting

349
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,860
It's an atrocity of nature

350
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,500
This is terrible!

351
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:50,160
Now we must correct the ways of the church

352
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,620
And that's why the church of the new faith

353
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:56,360
Is the church of Jesus Christ

354
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,000
And it is the only church of Jesus Christ

355
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:01,600
Satan!

356
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,760
Satan is taking over the world

357
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:06,300
Satan is the disgust of the world

358
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,140
Of the children of the world

359
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:10,020
And Satan will kill you!

360
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:16,040
You are listening to

361
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,480
The Church of the New Faith

23450

369
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,860
We're trying to build one big

370
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,960
Happy Christian family here

371
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,500
The stronger we get

372
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:40,980
And the more we unite

373
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:45,560
The more likely it is that we can beat Satan

374
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,440
Back into hell

375
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:47,460
And the more we unite

376
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:47,460


377
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:47,460


378
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:47,620
Into hell!

379
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,040
For Satan is growing in force

380
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,480
He's all around us

381
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,660
He's everywhere

382
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:54,600
We've shown it to you

383
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,700
That we must join together

384
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,560
And fight!

385
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,600
So send money now

386
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,500
Join the Christian family

387
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:04,560
Join the Christian army

388
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:08,720
That will topple and smite Satan into hell

389
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,320
Yes send money

390
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:13,440
And get our new tape

391
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,080
Satanism

392
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:17,240
And here you score

393
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:17,840
The rules

394
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:20,500
And racism

395
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,380
And the delectable

396
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,700
Dilemma of the Bible

397
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:29,880
Here is some more racism in the Bible

398
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,580
And God told us

399
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,280
You can't do better

400
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,300
The sky is falling

401
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,260
And you're not dreaming

402
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,500
It's just the passions

403
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,000
Of your

404
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:48,800
Inner self

405
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:50,740
Escaping

406
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:53,020
I hate

407
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:55,220
Now let's check your

408
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,340
Hearing

409
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:59,120
What's wrong

410
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,340
With my hearing

411
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,000
Yeah I know something

412
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,140
Well just what is it?

413
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,880
Who robbed him I know who it was

414
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:16,060
Yeah

415
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,540
I guess it was me

416
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:19,700
The

417
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:19,700


418
00:22:39,380 --> 00:22:39,900
The

419
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,540
The

420
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:40,740
The

421
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:41,120
The

422
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:41,380
The

423
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:41,380


424
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:41,460
The

425
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:41,660
The

426
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:41,660


427
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:41,660


428
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:41,660


429
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,160
The the

430
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,180
The The

431
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,180


432
00:22:56,180 --> 00:22:56,180


433
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:00,060
The Big

434
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,300
The The

435
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:00,880
Jiang

436
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:09,420
Come and live

437
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,360
to deliver back beyond space

438
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,640
a part of a mating

439
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,660
a most magnificent mating

440
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:28,600
to take back to where she came from

441
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,920
mankind, womankind, specimens

442
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:35,340
specimens

443
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,660
and it's the only hope really

444
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:44,000
for mankind, womankind, for hybrids

445
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:52,620
because the only, the only, the only possibility

446
00:23:52,620 --> 00:24:00,480
on this planet of escaping otherwise is to die

447
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,680
all done

448
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:09,260
moments will be lost in time

449
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,080
friend

450
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:16,740
will you listen to a selfish and unfaithful son?

451
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:29,720
will you listen to a faithful unselfish preacher?

452
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:34,640
friends, you are listening to the subgenius radio ministry

453
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,120
the hour of slacks

454
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:38,360
it may sound insane to you

455
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:41,480
but it's only because you're just not used to it yet

456
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,580
and before I get to the half hour point

457
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,440
I wanted to play

458
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,660
I told you we were going to be bad tonight

459
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,540
I got a tape in the mail

460
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:50,640
from Ricky Rocket

461
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:55,240
it was a band called Big Poo Generator

462
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,440
yes, you heard me right

463
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,320
Big Poo Generator

464
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,040
is the name of the band

465
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:04,000
the name of the album is Big Poo Release

466
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,580
and it has songs on it such as

467
00:25:07,580 --> 00:25:09,440
well, Rear Entry Pants

468
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,980
Toilet for Two

469
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:14,200
two versions of My Poo

470
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,440
Lesbians They're Okay

471
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:19,080
and I Poo

472
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,940
and this particular song

473
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:23,340
is called

474
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,540
Mr. Poo

475
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,600
Mr. Poo

476
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:38,000
He's in you

477
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,880
Mr. Poo

478
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,640
He's in you

479
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:52,240
Mr. Poo

480
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,160
Spirit is the cool white wind

481
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:03,240
Spirit is the cool

All people need your cool

00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,940
I am

486
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,220
made of

487
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,160
Poo

488
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,540
You are eating my bread

489
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:26,140
You are eating my food

490
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:29,240
I'm in good spirits

491
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,860
I'm in good spirits

492
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,380
My cold blood tightens

493
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:33,220
My blood tightens

494
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:33,220

00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,440

Oh, unbelievable.

Quite a surprise.

Big pooh generator.

00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,760
Mr. Poo.

523
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:15,380
From Champaign, Illinois.

524
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:19,860
Ricky Rocket, whatever that thing may be.

525
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,180
The Premier Edition.

526
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:26,340
The most comprehensive, award winning motion picture sound effects collection available.

527
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,360
It speaks for itself.

528
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:03,640
Taxi!

529
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,500
Get them now before the police come.

530
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:21,640
T-minus five, four...

531
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:23,200
Hey, come here.

532
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,000
...three, two...

533
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,120
...one.

Ignition.

535
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,400
Liftoff.

536
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,500
Yes, thank you.

537
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,460
Oh, give me five.

538
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,520
I'm a lovely lady, happy to rot.

539
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,120
Hello, and welcome to our second tale on Brain Rot Radio Theatre.

540
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:01,380
Again, our story features America's most neurotic substance abuser,

541
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,780
and worst country singer, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

542
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:11,360
and his faceless Indian medicine man and psychiatrist, Psychopath Finder,

543
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,580
and their accident-prone ward and retarded musical sidekick, Scabby Days.

544
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:22,600
Our special guest star is Reverend Ivan Stang of the Church of the Subgenius.

545
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:27,740
We find our antiheroes at home in their RV parked near the toxic swamp.

546
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,260
The Reverend Stang has come all the way from Dallas

547
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:35,720
to Cleveland just to undergo psychotherapy with Psychopath Finder.

548
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,400
Stang is a total emotional wreck.

549
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:46,920
So there you have it, Psychopath Finder,

550
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,240
keeping the radio show on the air,

551
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,100
doing the devivals and working on the book,

552
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,980
and all the while this rip-off artist, Bob Beans,

553
00:32:56,100 --> 00:33:00,380
keeps releasing albums and saying he started the Church of the Subgenius.

554
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,100
This is too much! I'm cracking up!

555
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:06,300
Drop the vial of antidote pudding!

556
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,120
The bat wouldn't retract!

557
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:13,320
Look, man, I need your fabled Native American medicine

558
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:19,200
to regain spiritual balance and internal harmony and all that kind of stuff.

559
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:20,040
Oh, no.

560
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:24,420
There, there. Relax, old ref boy.

561
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:29,800
Have a little Psychopath Finder 7 herb and 3 cheese smoking mixture.

562
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,120
Available through proper cable channels for only $29.95.

563
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,100
Guaranteed to make you cheesy.

564
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:38,100
And give insight into personal problems.

565
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:40,160
Here, you smoke them!

566
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,800
Oh, okay, uh...

567
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:50,740
Stang, care for some tender sweet chicken bladder strips while you trip Reverend?

568
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:53,640
Oh, uh, well, sure, sure, Dave.

569
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,140
Hey, Psychopath Finder, what does this have to do with my therapy?

570
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,620
Dave, please, leave patients alone.

571
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,960
Me trying to conduct therapy session here, I've been really upset.

572
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,140
He don't mind, right, Stangy? We're such big fans.

573
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:13,600
Yeah, yeah, big, huge electric fans.

574
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:16,080
Pulsating in the hot neon light.

575
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:19,880
I think T.S. Idiot said that, or Wendy Carlos Williams.

576
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:23,800
Listen, you two, either pipe down or you'll have to leave the room.

577
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:25,520
I'm trying to conduct a therapy session.

578
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,840
Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho.

579
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,600
That's some pretty strong smoking mixture there.

580
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:37,320
Ah, yes, soon you will become lucid and speak freely about what troubles you.

581
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:42,460
Well, this hang dog bust accentuating brassiere is chafing my nipples.

582
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:45,720
No, no, no, let's focus on problem with career.

583
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:51,300
This Canadian Mountie boot, Bob Beans, why is this hurting you?

584
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,400
This guy's totally without scruples.

585
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:58,740
He releases this stupid blithering material under the name of church.

586
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:01,560
He says he started the church.

587
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:07,140
He even conned Negative Land into believing that the stuff they recorded for him is authorized.

588
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:09,680
It's, I don't know, the squids are dying.

589
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:11,540
Very squished.

590
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,140
Here, I got some scruples you can have or use.

591
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,060
You could have them or use them.

592
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,540
You could scrape my nipples, too.

593
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,260
Just sign my earmuffs, please.

594
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:21,160
Please sign them.

595
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:27,740
Hey, Ivan, baby, you gotta hear this song I've been writing for the last five years about the followers of Jehovah One called,

596
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,680
called, Beat Me to a Pulpit.

597
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:31,160
I'm praying for some pain.

598
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:35,600
Oh, beat me to a pulpit, I am praying for some pain.

599
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:39,400
I ain't got religion, I got a damaged brain.

600
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,860
If I had a dollar for every lick in that I...

601
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,400
Ow.

602
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,180
Oh!

603
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,460
Oh, my head.

604
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:51,500
Why'd you hit me on the head with my guitar, psychic poodle fondler?

605
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:52,820
You two out.

606
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,420
Beverly stinks.

607
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:57,140
Come all the way from Texas to smoke cured.

608
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:59,180
My parental mythology.

609
00:35:59,620 --> 00:35:59,880
Leave.

610
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:00,820
Go another room.

611
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:03,620
Yeah, I'll live with that.

612
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,680
I can live with that, you guys.

613
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:06,420
Oh, gosh.

614
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:09,660
If the vaunted aristocrat of the undergroom says so.

615
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,400
But you gotta hear my songs when I finish.

616
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,320
When we finish...

617
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:13,820
Split now!

618
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,540
Split!

619
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:22,060
And then you could autocrap my drool and snot and crush the earmuffs and hernia trusses and eye socket controllers and all the...

620
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:22,700
Leave now!

621
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,100
You love my songs.

622
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,120
Okay.

623
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,020
Okay.

624
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,720
We're unimportant.

625
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,460
But maybe we can listen through the hole in the wall.

626
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:40,060
Yeah, that whore still carries fond memories and tiny bits of my brain tissue.

627
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:41,760
Good.

628
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:43,040
We alone now.

629
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,960
Tell Motorcycle Mama all about problems.

630
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:51,340
Oh, God.

631
00:36:51,560 --> 00:36:53,940
Sometimes I wish the guy was dead.

632
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:56,080
Don't have the cash to pay for the car.

633
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,080


634
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,080


635
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,080


636
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,080


637
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,080


638
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:56,660
I wish I could sue him.

639
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:59,520
I'm so mad I don't know what to do.

640
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:00,580
The squid or the...

641
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:01,720
Oh, there, there.

642
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:02,960
Let it all out.

643
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,020
Let it all out.

644
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,720
Oh, no, not all.

645
00:37:07,780 --> 00:37:10,980
No need to urinate freely on expensive Navajo shrug shag.

646
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:12,360
Oh, okay.

647
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:14,840
Boy, I'm mad, psycho.

648
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:18,400
This guy's the son of some big media geek.

649
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:22,360
It's like the silver spoons against the tin cups, pal.

650
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:24,300
The same as it's always been.

651
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:25,980
In the normal consumer.

652
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,060


653
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,060


654
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,060


655
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:26,060


656
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,080
The conspiracy world.

657
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:29,900
Revenge.

658
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:33,560
If only, maybe we could use the Mooney skinners on him.

659
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,240
I'd like to take the big red stress.

660
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,080
Did you hear that, Scabby?

661
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,520
That K-neck or imposter is ruining our hero's life.

662
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:47,580
The word of Bob Dobbs, the one true or false Christian messiah, spat on so unseemly like

663
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:47,900
he...

664
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:51,480
Bob Dobbs is listening in heaven where everything's fine.

665
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,760
We should get out a big fat gun and shoot Bob Beans.

666
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,040
In his big fat gun.

667
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:57,260
That darn particle butt.

668
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,200
Why, oh why, oh why?

669
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,500
Why am I crying, Dave?

670
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:01,500
Where am I?

671
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,580
Hey, Scabby, wait a minute.

672
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:04,940
You hit on it.

673
00:38:05,020 --> 00:38:05,780
What a hot dare.

674
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:09,340
What a media-engineered cult-like idea for the 90s.

675
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:11,600
You're brilliant, you idiot savon garbage.

676
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,580
We'll assassinate Bob Beans.

677
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:15,820
Or kidnap him.

678
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:19,720
Until he confesses the sordid truth of his miserable chicanery.

679
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:20,860
Scabby.

680
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,200
Huh?

681
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:25,060
You still got that plastic explosive you made for the last movement of your Peaceford

682
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:28,520
Pace for 12 out-of-tune violins which all simultaneously blow up?

683
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,180
Yeah.

684
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,980
Nobody wants to play it.

685
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:34,640
Can't find anyone to do the gig except your Ford-fired serenade.

686
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,700
Great, great.

687
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,640
You get the gel-ignite bomb violin thing, and I'll get my guitar.

688
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:41,120
We'll thumb to Toronto.

689
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,160
Walk across Lake Eridiculous.

690
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:44,500
We'll be heroes, man.

691
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:47,020
Here's exploding violin.

692
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,460
So I play it, yeah.

693
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,460
No, no, no.

694
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,600
Don't play that thing yet.

695
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:51,640
Don't play it.

696
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:55,020
Not until the last act of Bob the Slob Beans gets his.

697
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:57,960
Better leave Psychopath Finder a note.

698
00:38:58,660 --> 00:38:59,960
I'll leave him a G-note.

699
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:02,840
Shh.

700
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:04,360
Now be very quiet.

701
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:06,780
I'm going to slide out the window.

702
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:14,920
Oh, wow.

703
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,620
I feel great now.

704
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:20,240
I'm rid of all that blasted anger and hatred.

705
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,620
I feel great.

706
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,140
Oh, totally released.

707
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:28,060
One with Bob Dobbs.

708
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:30,420
Yes, yes.

709
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,360
Indian Transplantal Therapy do much to reduce hostility.

710
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,520
You will function normally now.

711
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,620
Until you need more inexpensive patented herbal therapy.

712
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:47,080
Hey, could I maybe cop a bag of that to take back to the land of Dealey Plaza?

713
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,120
Sure.

714
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,420
What do you want, a quarter?

715
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:50,560
Yeah, what is it?

716
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:51,540
Like $60?

717
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,560
No, no, no.

718
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,220
$29.95 for you, oh great white chief of airwaves.

719
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:57,900
It's an honor to do business with you.

720
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:58,620
Oh, man.

721
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,240
I can't believe I felt so hateful.

722
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:06,640
As if all the ugly archons of Jehovah One had had me by my very flunads.

723
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:08,080
Oh, man.

724
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,740
I actually fantasized about killing the guy.

725
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:12,660
Oh, well.

726
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,480
Life's still beautiful.

727
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,300
Well, if it ever, ever was.

728
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,140
Okay.

729
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,620
Since our therapy over now,

730
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,520
let me call boys back into a room.

731
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:25,400
They so anxious to rap and jam with their hero and schmooze with you.

732
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:25,800
Yeah.

733
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:26,720
And Dave.

734
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,260
Yeah.

735
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:28,080
Scabby.

736
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,240
Yeah.

737
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:29,080
We finished.

738
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:31,900
Come back in and irritate Staggy.

739
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:32,920
Yeah.

740
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,020
Oh, boys.

741
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:36,820
What in the hell?

742
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,740
Well, let me go look.

743
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,540
Where are they?

744
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:41,680
Oh, no.

745
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,280
They leave note.

746
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:44,220
G note.

747
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,200
I wish they would leave C note.

748
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:51,140
Using special schematic powers,

749
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,460
me able to divine contents.

750
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,560
Oh, no.

751
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:55,220
It's say.

752
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,060
Don't stop us.

753
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,860
Me and Scabby's heading for Ontario to kill Bob the beans.

754
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,100
Or kidnap him until he's dead.

755
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:04,800
Or confessionals his sinfuls.

756
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,140
We believe that in some pitiful way,

757
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:08,920
this will endear us to Staggy.

758
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,120
And he will play my songs.

759
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,900
I thought divine was dead.

760
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:19,040
Remember in female trouble when he put the poodle between his legs?

761
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:21,000
Or was that flamingos?

762
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,340
Nevermind John Waters' film course.

763
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:25,660
We got to find Dave.

764
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,800
Believe me, this guy is nuts.

765
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:30,600
He might not have the heart to kill Bob Beans,

766
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,520
but he's sure to screw something up.

767
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:34,160
And Scabby, cripes.

768
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,560
He causes nuclear power plants accidents just with his mind.

769
00:41:37,840 --> 00:41:38,740
Oh, yeah, right.

770
00:41:39,100 --> 00:41:40,780
I was feeling so peaceful.

771
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:44,340
I forgot what's going on.

772
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,860
And so in great haste,

773
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,120
Psycho Pathfinder and Reverend Stang pursued crazy plans,

774
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:56,960
Cowboy Dave and Scabby the decomposing composer, but it was too late for thanks

775
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:02,360
to the miracle of electromagnetic radio waves, Dave and Scabby had already been

776
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,780
transmitted down the Queens Highway into the heart of Dun Tun Girardeau, eh?

777
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:16,480
Hey, hey, hey Sport, is this the home studio of Bob Beans? Well, sure better be, eh?

778
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,660
After all this crap on the radio about the Church of the Sub sandwich and

779
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:23,340
whatnot, eh? You'll find Bob Beans right behind that false front there.

780
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:31,400
See? There's the false front right there. Good, because we want to kill him with this exploding violin.

781
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:35,480
Be my guest, if he's Francophone or Sikh, he'll probably only get 30 days, eh?

782
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:46,520
Who is it? Who's there? Knock, knock! Who's there? This is stage cam radio.

783
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,420
Oh, oh, oh.

784
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,180
Hey, is Bob Beans behind this false front in here?

785
00:42:53,460 --> 00:43:01,060
Come in. Now, Mr. Beans is with Brian Mulrooney right now, but oops, there he is.

786
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:09,040
Oh, thank you, Monsieur Sub Sandwiches. Former Prime Minister, I just want to say what a grand pleasure it was to work with you.

787
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:19,240
Daddy and John Majors and George Bush send their lovey. Just keep on conning the public and ripping off the real Church of the Subtrainings and by gum, we'll do whatever the hell we please, eh?

788
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:19,640
By gum, we'll do whatever the hell we please, eh?

789
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:19,640


790
00:43:19,660 --> 00:43:24,980
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Brian Mulrooney, wasn't you a famous goalie for the Nordiques or Maple Leafs or something?

791
00:43:25,900 --> 00:43:30,060
I'm afraid I can't answer that question, eh? I've got to get the puck out of here.

792
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,180
Next! Who are you and what do you want, eh?

793
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:40,560
Hey, you're Bob Beans. I'm watching Cow-Paw Dave and this here's Scabby, my violinist.

794
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:48,380
We got this band called Positive Land and we hear you are one true Church of the Subgenius and apostle of slack.

795
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,960
Where am I?

796
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:55,120
Yeah, we're volunteering our services, man. It teaches you about slack, old profit for profit.

797
00:43:55,420 --> 00:44:09,220
Oh, slack, eh? Well, come on in then. You've come to the right man, eh? Slack, well, slack's all about geodesic domes and cars that burn chicken dung, eh? That's what it's all about, eh? Come into my office.

798
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:18,340
So, you want to make an album, eh? Well, there's no money in it, but you'll be helping the Church of the Subgenius.

799
00:44:19,780 --> 00:44:22,200
No, we want to kidnap you.

800
00:44:22,340 --> 00:44:24,660
Or kill you, whichever comes first.

801
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:33,960
Now, listen, I'm a sensible man, eh? I've got a mistress and 300 Swiss-backed Landry seems to feed. Don't do anything rash, eh?

802
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:37,840
Eh, make fun of my rash, will ya? If you do that, we're going to rape you, too.

803
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:39,140
Wait, wait, wait, take it easy.

804
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:39,820
I don't know, man.

805
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:41,300
You're a squirrel like a pig.

806
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:47,840
Hey, stop pelvic thrusting on that fiddle, Scabby. It might go off. Just climb out the window, Deans, or whatever Beans.

807
00:44:47,840 --> 00:44:52,720
And whatever your name is. And onto the, into that waiting van we electromagnetically parked.

808
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:54,580
That's it. Slow and easy.

809
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:16,340
And so, they drove Beans all the way to Kitchener or Waterloo or some other God-forbidden place.

810
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,220
And rented a motel room.

811
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:26,780
There, they would force Beans to confess his sinful crimes or get a chance to hear Scabby's exploding violin masterpiece.

812
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,180
Meanwhile, Psycho Pathfinder's shamanistic seven senses were working overtime.

813
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,360
And he located Lonesome and Scabby without a problem.

814
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:43,360
Uh, uh, uh, uh, there it is. Motel me dream about. Me pull in. Me sure they they are there.

815
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:46,320
Oh, do we have to do this, Psycho Pathfinder?

816
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:50,360
I've been smoking your herbal mixture since we crossed the Peace Bridge.

817
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:54,660
And I'm grooving, man. Hey, does this stuff cause nasal tumors?

818
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:59,420
Ah, and there, room number seven just come into my mind just like in dream.

819
00:45:59,720 --> 00:46:06,640
Hey, lay off Herbin. Come help me. Me put window next to ear and use supersonic shamanistic hearing.

820
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:11,520
Oh, no, Nancy and, uh, my, my Maggie. Come on over here now.

821
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,220
Oh, I...

822
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,520
Oh, oh, oh.

823
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,000
Uh-oh.

824
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:20,960
Wrong room. Wrong room. Wrong room. Wrong room.

825
00:46:21,220 --> 00:46:23,440
Oh, oh, oh, oh, no, no. Come on. Let's stay, man.

826
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,460
Oh, come on. They must be in ski room six.

827
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:34,560
Okay, Beans. Okay, Beans. Okay, Beans. This is your last chance to recant your lies.

828
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,280
I'm gonna start singing again.

829
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:40,240
Oh, no. Anything but that, eh?

830
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:44,500
Dave! Scabby! Unhand that man!

831
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:51,200
We can't cut off his hands until we rape him with this canister of holy air.

832
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:56,240
Available only from Z-Day and the Real, Real, Real Church of the Subgenius for only $29,999.

833
00:46:57,700 --> 00:47:05,060
Boyles, please. For Bob Dobbs' sake. I mean, let him go. So he crapped on honesty in the name of slack.

834
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:11,960
He knew not what he doo-dooed. I mean, at least he was a sinner. Cut him some slack.

835
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,500
But if we let him go, he'll just do it.

836
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,620
He'll do it all over again.

837
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:17,560
That's what I mean.

838
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:24,040
Oh, no, no, no. Please untie me. I swear I'll somehow try to come up with my own ideas and concepts.

839
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,860
It'll be hard, but I'll try. I swear, eh?

840
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:35,980
Only if the holy Reverend Stang listens to Dave's songs and autobiographicals when I sing Blind Dog's Body.

841
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:37,620
What? Where am I?

842
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:44,700
Oh, yes. Dear friends, just let him go. Just as you are letting go.

843
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:45,400
Letting go.

844
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:49,300
Hey, that's from Don't Crush That Bozo and me and my entrenching tool.

845
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:56,020
Oh, thank you. I won't let you down. I've already got an idea for an original project.

846
00:47:56,360 --> 00:48:05,620
I know. I'll call it Fire Sign Theater. Well, thanks again. And now I'm going to steal your van. Bye, suckers.

847
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:08,080
Wait, wait. What are you doing?

848
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:14,420
I can't believe it. How do you like that?

849
00:48:14,420 --> 00:48:19,940
We freed this guy for life and he's already stealing again. What monstrous vermin.

850
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:26,480
That's from The Metamorphic Folkers by Franz Kaka. Or was it Pushkin and the Ethiopians?

851
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:36,820
Well, when Pushkin come to shove, me always say, slack gives and takes away. Amen, my little subgenie.

852
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:42,220
Yeah, ain't it mysterious how Bob works? Just now we can all ride back together.

853
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,580
And I can listen to my songs.

854
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:47,420
Uh, psycho, I'm going to need some more of that herb, man.

855
00:48:47,480 --> 00:48:49,260
Okay, let me start rolling now.

856
00:48:49,680 --> 00:48:52,360
Hey, Scabby, what'd you do with your violin?

857
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,300
Huh? I don't know where it is. Maybe I, uh...

858
00:49:04,100 --> 00:49:10,040
Oh, boy, this cart works great. Hey, a violin case. Maybe there's some drugs in it, eh?

859
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:16,040
And maybe I can sell it as a genuine religious artifact to the Church of the Subgenius, eh? Maybe I can...

860
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:17,120
Coo-hah!

861
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:37,640
Hello, you're on cross-country checkup. What do you think about this Bob Bean's head-blown-up thing there?

862
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:40,020
You think it's somehow, it's kind of a rip-off of, uh...

863
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:42,140
another head of some kind blown off, or what do you think, eh?

864
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:47,520
Am I on the...am I on the radio now?

865
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,780
Ah, yes, dear friends, and you are on the radio...

866
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:03,820
with...

867
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:08,360
well, with the Church of the Subgenius...

868
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:10,000
tonight, playing...

869
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,920
this little episode from Brain Rot Theatre.

870
00:50:14,180 --> 00:50:20,200
Starring Lonesome Cowboy Dave, Scabby Days, Psychopath Finder,

871
00:50:21,020 --> 00:50:27,500
and a special extra-female voice of Princess We Are Dole,

872
00:50:27,820 --> 00:50:32,680
the queen of all, all the UFOs.

873
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:39,360
Ah, yes, and I know that so many out there are wondering, what is this?

874
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:43,080
This...this so-called Church of the Subgenius.

875
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:48,100
And friends, yes, it's true, you do need to understand.

876
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:55,120
You only need to understand the basic concepts, three simple things.

877
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:02,300
J.R. Bob Dobbs, who has come to bring slack.

878
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,200
Slack, dear friends, something for nothing to the mutants,

879
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,100
the abnormals, and the misfits,

880
00:51:10,220 --> 00:51:17,180
those whose slack has been robbed away by the conspiracy of the normals.

881
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:23,420
And, uh, you can learn a great deal more from our books...

882
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:25,920
by writing.

883
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,660

885
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:39,380

887
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,500
from post office box 1-4-0-3-0-6.

888
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,740
You've heard your favorite Bible stories on cassette, the radio, and CD.

889
00:51:54,200 --> 00:52:00,080
Yes, the mindless lies of Jehovah One are everywhere, easy to find,

890
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,720
even by small children and animals.

891
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:07,180
But did you know that the stories of the life of Jehovah One,

892
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,120
the life of Bob Dobbs,

893
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:12,040
are now available on a limited collector's edition?

894
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:13,300
That's right.

895
00:52:13,420 --> 00:52:19,940
Now you and your distended family can hear the words and exploits of Bob Dobbs

896
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:25,380
in your home or breeding lounge without tedious reading or videotape viewing.

897
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:31,400
Hear these immortal words of slack, only $29.95 cash check or plastic memory implant.

898
00:52:32,700 --> 00:52:35,620
I am surrounded by the bats of corruption.

899
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:40,080
Oh, first Connie of my loins, kindly lend us the tantric power

900
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:42,820
to fornicate these bats into a radioactive stupor.

901
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:45,440
Or these inspiring messages.

902
00:52:46,060 --> 00:52:51,020
Your nipples are swollen, the true mark of a deal-making messiah.

903
00:52:51,300 --> 00:52:59,260
How do you explain that you are three, three, three great candy bars in one sick socket?

904
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:01,760
The heavenly music is cued.

905
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:05,600
I am not the messiah, but the father of an obscure race of several gods.

906
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,660
Bob Genie, who will someday take what they need.

907
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:15,180
And so on until you're literally sick of comforting passages like these.

908
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:20,060
This veil I wear is not for you, Bob Dobbs,

909
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:23,840
but someone with a bod and even more head.

910
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:28,880
Connie, I know what this promotion means to you, but I don't care what you were in the past.

911
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:34,500
As long as you help me beat this loan payment rap, the skip tracers are tanning my cosmic gloins.

912
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:35,580
All right.

913
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:36,880
But just a quickie.

914
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,680
That's not all.

915
00:53:38,880 --> 00:53:42,960
Act now and receive free of charge the illuminating tales of retribution

916
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:50,560
as Bob Dobbs, the one true prophet of slack, impales and defecates upon the falsie prophets for profit,

917
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:55,600
turning their ugly beans into shafts of pure light beer.

918
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:56,940
Order today.

919
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,160
Before Z-Day, it's too late.

920
00:53:59,380 --> 00:54:03,120
Only $29.95 to an address of your choice.

921
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:04,180
Act immediately.

922
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:09,280
And get this limited edition instant expanding breast syndrome prevention kit.

923
00:54:09,540 --> 00:54:17,380
Guaranteed to educate and confuse the followers of false eyelash wearing profiteers as they climb the Red Runs.

924
00:54:18,740 --> 00:54:22,940
Dallas, Texas 75214.

925
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,820
Once again, that's post office box 140306.

926
00:54:29,100 --> 00:54:32,180
Dallas, Texas 75214.

927
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:40,500
And just ask for everything, dear friend.

928
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,980
I'm David Fishman.

929
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:46,940
See you next time.

930
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:47,240
Bye.

931
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:53,880
I'm David Fishman.

932
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,680
Yes, yes.

933
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:02,160
And he is a good friend.

934
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


935
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


936
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


937
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


938
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


939
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


940
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


941
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


942
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


943
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


944
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


945
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


946
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


947
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


948
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


949
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:02,160


950
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,800
And he'll tell you about it for $20.

951
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:07,500
That's really bringing the excitement of a very historic moment

952
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:11,040
right into the home where it can be enjoyed over and over again.

953
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:13,380
Parlez-vous français?

954
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:13,840
Parlez-vous français?

955
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:16,640
Il n'y a pas que la grippe qui se donne

956
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:20,160
La rougeole ou les oreillons

957
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:22,800
Hooray, compagnons!

958
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,640
You can record my jock looking at a joint if you like.

959
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:31,940
It's called temple mandibular joint dysfunction, bud.

960
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,860
I've learned how to make it play.

961
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,180
My tongue's a pin and ready writer.

962
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,360
Did God write a book?

963
00:55:38,820 --> 00:55:42,300
Does God want to talk about his son according to a book?

964
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:44,880
Well, why does God then think about his son?

965
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:47,320
Thou art fairer than the children of men.

966
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,600
Well, if that's what God thinks,

967
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,540
although Isaiah 53 says that when we see him there's no beauty which is desiring him,

968
00:55:53,620 --> 00:55:56,720
God nevertheless says he's fairer than the children of men.

969
00:55:57,360 --> 00:55:57,800
Why?

970
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,080
The FBI's elite hostage rescue team had been called into this.

971
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:05,520
And these are people who deal with the ending of situations,

972
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:09,000
often much more volatile situations, frankly, than what we're looking at now.

973
00:56:10,880 --> 00:56:11,660
Cousin evidence?

974
00:56:12,220 --> 00:56:12,500
Yeah.

975
00:56:13,080 --> 00:56:16,000
Yeah, I really like you on the show.

976
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,820
But what happened to Dr. Howell?

977
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,100
What'd you do with him?

978
00:56:23,780 --> 00:56:24,300
Nothing.

979
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:25,240
Oh, nothing.

980
00:56:25,980 --> 00:56:27,920
Well, I can't hear him.

981
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,740
Dr. Howell.

982
00:56:31,740 --> 00:56:36,160
Dr. Howell outwore his usefulness to the subgenius race and, of course, was...

983
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:43,420
Well, his body's now being used as a giant old-timey bathtub at the subgenius dude ranch in Irving.

984
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,500
Oh, well, that makes sense.

985
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,440
He'll be back in a couple of weeks.

986
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,380
Oh, well, that makes sense.

987
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:51,720
He'll be back.

988
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,380
He'll be back in a couple of weeks.

989
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,400
He'll be back in a couple of weeks.

990
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:58,760
He'll be back.

991
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,140
I was just curious.

992
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:04,660
The new and improved Howell will be back soon.

993
00:57:04,980 --> 00:57:12,400
Every molecule of his body improved and made better for you, the listener.

994
00:57:13,720 --> 00:57:14,360
Oh, boy.

995
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:17,800
And we have a special...

996
00:57:17,800 --> 00:57:23,720
We have a special time here now where we talk about our unremembered memories.

997
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,520
Does anybody care?

998
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,020
Is anybody listening now?

999
00:57:27,320 --> 00:57:28,280
What's wrong?

1000
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:29,820
You can't be afraid of anything.

1001
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:31,720
If you feel...

1002
00:57:31,740 --> 00:57:34,200
You are not properly sedated, call...

1003
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:34,800
Immediately.

1004
00:57:35,820 --> 00:57:41,400
Failure to do so may result in prosecution for criminal drug evasion.

1005
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:47,860
We now take you live to an interview with President Wellman at his retreat in Dougie Punkport, California,

1006
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:52,820
on the connection between the Colombian drug cartel and Wayne Newton's estranged brother, Harvey...

1007
00:57:52,820 --> 00:57:56,320
Huey, who was found recently gunned down in Oakland, California.

1008
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,180
Mr. President?

1009
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:58,780
Mr. President.

1010
00:57:59,580 --> 00:58:01,620
Apparently, President Wellman has stepped out for just a moment.

1011
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,660
He'll get back to you after this message.

1012
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:13,520
Um, no, we don't have enough time to do that whole rant.

1013
00:58:13,860 --> 00:58:14,460
Darn it.

1014
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,120
It's a nice little rant.

1015
00:58:16,420 --> 00:58:17,700
We'll just have to do this.

1016
00:58:18,260 --> 00:58:18,700
Night.

1017
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:21,160
Tears.

1018
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:24,700
Rain.

1019
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,080
I push the mercy button.

1020
00:58:27,980 --> 00:58:29,320
I'll do when you fall.

1021
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:30,660
Time.

1022
00:58:31,740 --> 00:58:32,320
To die.

1023
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:35,100
My God.

1024
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,000
My God.

1025
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,920
Why have you forgotten me?

1026
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:40,600
Oh, God.

1027
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:44,240
Dear Dr. Animal, my pooper worm, I'll call him Petey,

1028
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:47,300
eats like nothing else.

1029
00:58:47,820 --> 00:58:51,520
Last night, in a feeding frenzy, he chomped a hole through my intestinal wall.

1030
00:58:51,780 --> 00:58:52,740
What should I do?

1031
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:57,460
Signed, Henry the Herdiated Herbivorous Hermaphrodite.

1032
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,040
Dear Herb,

1033
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,540
Your little worm may squirm,

1034
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:04,380
when a certain germ was introduced through his derm.

1035
00:59:04,820 --> 00:59:06,200
That's the thing to do.

1036
00:59:06,600 --> 00:59:12,660
Inject a small amount of virulent virus through this little fellow's epithelial wall.

1037
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:13,160
Ah!

1038
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,060
Then he'll die and fester in there,

1039
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:21,140
and you'll have to send Fester, the performing hamster, up your colon in order to retrieve that little goner.

1040
00:59:21,240 --> 00:59:24,240
Then you can go to the general wing of the general hospital,

1041
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:27,440
where people are generally used to removing hamsters and other objects.

1042
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:30,760
And after that, you'll be home free, scot-free,

1043
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:31,260
Yeehaw!

1044
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:33,420
The true dialectic of subgenial understanding.

1045
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,260
We hope this answers your question.

1046
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:38,960
Do you like my headphones, Dave? Aren't they so, like, trendy?

1047
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:41,120
I wish I could see your headphones. I would like them.

1048
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:42,980
They are pretty. They're very pretty.

1049
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:45,020
What color are they? Are they black?

1050
00:59:45,020 --> 00:59:46,520
Oh, they're black with red.

1051
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:47,480
Black headphones.

1052
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:53,920
Black headphones with a red thing going over the top, kind of like a stellar nimbus thing going...

1053
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:55,200
Yeah, stellar nimbus.

1054
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,460
...around his head, as if he was like a little baby.

1055
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,000
They're very high-tech looking.

1056
00:59:58,160 --> 00:59:59,860
Chazus. Chazus Christ.

1057
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,200
They look like headphones that...

1058
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:02,460
...George Jetson would wear.

1059
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:07,640
No, you look Christ-like tonight, Chaz. You look like Christ with big, weird, like, you know, techno ears.

1060
01:00:08,760 --> 01:00:10,060
Oh, yeah, smarter!

1061
01:00:11,260 --> 01:00:17,360
Well, God made man, but he used a monster to do it.

1062
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:20,000
Hates in the plan.

1063
01:00:21,420 --> 01:00:23,700
Oh, I need to prove it.

1064
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:29,620
I can walk like an ape, talk like an ape, do what monkeys do.

1065
01:00:30,120 --> 01:00:31,240
Well, God made man. But he used a monster to do it.

1066
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:31,240


1067
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:35,500
Oh, God made man. But a monkey supplies the group.

1068
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:51,180
The jim-jam jumpin' jive makes you hep hep on the mellow side.

1069
01:00:51,820 --> 01:00:54,220
Skiddle-a boo skiddle-a dee-bel-a dee-bel-a dee-bel-a dee-bel-a.

1070
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,380
Going, going, going, going, ya-da-da.

1071
01:00:56,620 --> 01:00:58,740
Now, I told you about the jumpin' jive.

1072
01:00:59,080 --> 01:01:00,500
Jim-jam jumpin' jive.

1073
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:00,500


1074
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:01,140
Jim-jam jumpin' jive. The jumpin' jive.

1075
01:01:01,140 --> 01:01:01,220
Jim-jam jumpin' jive. The jumpin' jive.

1076
01:01:01,240 --> 01:01:03,740
