1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,100
Uh, well, we're still at the X-Day Drill.

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,020
We decided not to leave.

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:14,840
Your brothers from out of space

4
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,140
are coming with advanced knowledge

5
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:25,240
to help human race!

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,760
Bob will save all true believers, though, in 1998, right?

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,200
Actually, Bob, you better hope that Bob does some wheeling and dealing

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,900
for your soul come 1998.

9
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,020
He is the salesman of the universe here to make sure that Earth

10
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,940
and your soul does not get sold to the robot mutilators.

11
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,320
At least for not too low a price.

12
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,460
So you better read that book with all three eyes

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:58,240
or however many you have left.

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,940
And, uh...

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,820
Leave the driving to Bob.

16
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,820
That's right. You do the walking, let Bob do the talking.

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,580
Who are these men from Planet X, children?

18
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,620
What is waiting there for me?

19
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,080
Bob.

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:25,600
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry

21
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,980
Hour of Slack

22
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:29,800
sponsored by

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,620
the Church of the Subgenius.

24
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,480
I love you.

25
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:34,560
I love you.

26
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:34,560


27
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,420
Friend, the Elder Gods have been sleeping,

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,320
but they're waking up.

29
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:40,560
And you gotta find that word of Bob before it's too late.

30
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:43,520
Before 1998, July 5th, the end of the world,

31
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,260
the end of time as we know it.

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,900
When the very...

33
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:48,460
The very...

34
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:50,240
The score is racked up.

35
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,340
The score is racked up, and it's the time of the half time.

36
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,080
Yes, sir.

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:55,700
We just won't have a chance.

38
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,340
They'll be able to have their ways with us.

39
00:01:57,340 --> 00:01:59,980
You've heard about the smallpox blankets in the Indianapolis?

40
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,540
Indians, you know.

41
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,500
Well, this is gonna be technological viral infectational

42
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:08,440
of an entire planet with means of doing things,

43
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:12,260
means of destruction, means of alteration of genetic patterns,

44
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:15,580
means of controlling people's minds that we don't even...

45
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,400
To us, it's magic.

46
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,860
Any significantly advanced form of science becomes magic.

47
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,240
If that smoke comes out of Bob's pipe no more,

48
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,580
then we shall be reduced to that can of warm beer

49
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,040
under the bed of a hungover Elder God at 1130,

50
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,180
on a Sunday morning.

51
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:34,160
Bob is here to make sure that instead of it being the end of the world,

52
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:37,500
it's the end of their world, and the new...

53
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:37,960
Oh, yeah!

54
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,000
The new Jerusalem.

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,900
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

56
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:42,460
The new Jerusalem where slack begins.

57
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:45,560
Yes, the streets will be paved with slack.

58
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,260
Slack will drop gently from the sky.

59
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,000
Slack will ooze out of the pores of the faithful.

60
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,480
The tribulation money will fall from the flying saucers.

61
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,660
Yes, and we'll all be floating around

62
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:58,760
with those little green rays coming out of our feet.

63
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,040
That's why we tell...

64
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,220
We have slack.

65
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,220
That's why we tell the public to throw their money away.

66
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,100
It's no good.

67
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,040
It's going to be...

68
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,000
Currency's just going to be flying down from flying saucers

69
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:08,820
in a few years anyway.

70
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:09,300
Or give it to Bob.

71
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:09,700
Or give it to Bob.

72
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,260
You give it to Bob while it's still good.

73
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,040
You cash in that money while it's still good.

74
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,460
What do you mean?

75
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,780
Because they're going to be...

76
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,420
See, people are just going to be bringing all their money to Bob

77
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:19,400
when the end of the world is upon us.

78
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,220
It's going to be too late because money won't be worth anything.

79
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:21,780
When those tribulation times come down,

80
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,220
that subgenius pamphlet, especially if you've got a white copy.

81
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,460
Now, if you've got a white copy and a brown copy,

82
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,080
it's a little bit of difference.

83
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,180
But they're both worth more than a bundle of thousand dollar

84
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,140
treasury bills a foot high.

85
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:36,980
There will be people trading paragraphs of that pamphlet

86
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:39,520
for boxcars full of food.

87
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,800
You think it will replace currency.

88
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:46,420
Bob will replace drugs, religion, rock music, and everything

89
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:50,640
in a great paradise of unrestrained sales,

90
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:54,100
unrestrained slack and sex.

91
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:56,200
And if you have any drug users in your audience,

92
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,060
you should note that the book of the subgenius

93
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:00,300
we found in a test that was conducted in Austin recently,

94
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,340
that if adulterated street drugs are thrown on top of the cover,

95
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,880
all of the non-narcotic qualities are completely erased

96
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,620
and indicated as negative and destroyed.

97
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,240
All impurities are removed,

98
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:16,980
giving you that 1% of pure that you paid for

99
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,980
out of whatever it was that you...

100
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,980
By the way...

101
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,160
That's better than pyramid power.

102
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,820
Yes, much better than pyramid power.

103
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,620
I'd like to say those...

104
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,480
Because it's in a plane rather than going to a point.

105
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,100
...of the subgenius. That's it.

106
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,340
Book of the subgenius.

107
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,640
Bob the fellow everyone knows.

108
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:34,720
Bob.

109
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:35,580
Bob!

110
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:37,040
Bob!

111
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,240
Yes, Bob.

112
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:41,760
Say, man, that is one strange dude.

113
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:42,980
Who is it?

114
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:43,520
Bob!

115
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,460
One strange dude.

116
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,820
I think Bob is just a guy with a pipe.

117
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,240
Oh, that's crazy talk.

118
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,620
But friends, you know our critics have some people worrying

119
00:04:54,620 --> 00:04:58,500
now and then that the church might become corrupt.

120
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,820
The church of the subgenius might become corrupted

121
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:05,840
by the conspiracy and there'd have to be a replacement for it.

122
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,400
Well, hey, hey, hey.

123
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:12,460
Well, friends, I tell you, we don't have to worry about that.

124
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,620
Because the true church, the true church of the subgenius

125
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,540
is going to be up in the saucers.

126
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,600
Ah, the pinks won't have to worry about even seeing the subgenius.

127
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:29,280
There'll be all kinds of cheap cults and spinoffs left behind,

128
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:35,980
just like the cargo cults among the last mutated remnants of humanity.

129
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,220
And also there'll be subgeniuses left behind,

130
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:46,740
the subgeniuses who didn't think they really needed that $20 membership card.

131
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:49,340
Did we just have a power failure?

132
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,220
I believe we did.

133
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:51,600
Ahem.

134
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,580
Yeah, those who, uh,

135
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:54,580


136
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,360
as I was saying,

137
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,740
excuse me, friends, we're having serious, strange poltergeist effects

138
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,740
in here as the lights flicker on and off.

139
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:07,440
Yeah, anyway, there'll be some subgeniuses left behind,

140
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:12,020
the ones who didn't think they needed that $20 membership card.

141
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,720
The ones who tattooed Bob's face all over their whole bodies.

142
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,900
The ones who put, they might have put Bob on national TV.

143
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,100
Or they might have donated their whole estate to us, but they never sent.

144
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,440
They never sent their $20.

145
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:33,540
Now, it might be confusing a bit to those left behind after the rupture,

146
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:37,420
because the rupture happens for different people in different ways.

147
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,460
A lot of subgeniuses, when they undergo the rupture,

148
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,920
watch, the people standing around and back on Earth,

149
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,420
it looks like a burning monk or spontaneous combustion.

150
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:51,960
They just burst into flames and scream and scream.

151
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,560
It's the most horrible, painful-looking thing in the world.

152
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:58,540
But of course, that, friends, that's just the image.

153
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,760
That's just sort of the hologram, the body being left behind.

154
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:02,820
Just the shell.

155
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:07,420
Because on next day, when you are ruptured, no matter how it looks, you know,

156
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:12,100
your youthful, perfect body is being recreated

157
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,160
on the vessels of the sex goddesses.

158
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,280
And a thousand clones of kitten on TV dot are gonna...

159
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,820
Well, I...

160
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:25,560
Friends, when you get on that escape vessel,

161
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,360
every person you ever had a crush on since elementary school

162
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:35,300
is gonna be there ready to have sex with you.

163
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,620
Either that or else, simulacra of those people.

164
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,040
It might as well be the same, because the sex goddesses, you see,

165
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,900
can change their form completely and totally.

166
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,640
First, you'll...

167
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:48,740
There'll be the...

168
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,940
Say, the girl you had a crush on in first date,

169
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,480
or the girl you had a crush on in second grade.

170
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,700
Well, now she's at a perfect...

171
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,840
She's perfect and healthy at age 25, of course, you know.

172
00:07:57,920 --> 00:08:00,180
And when she leaves,

173
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,980
why, in walks the girl you had a crush on in second grade.

174
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,460
Or here's that boy you had a crush on when you were 13,

175
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,940
and he almost kissed you, but now he's gonna do it.

176
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,920
And he's still wearing the same clothes that he did at the prom.

177
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:18,840
Or that milkman or babysitter that you lusted after.

178
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,740
They'll all be there.

179
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,800
The sex goddesses tap your mind.

180
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,540
It's not really people.

181
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,940
It's part of the muam system,

182
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:33,160
a biomorphic toy that conforms to the fleshly configurations

183
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:36,820
to satisfy any kind of lust you might have.

184
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,760
And they can pre-guess what you're about to think, friends.

185
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,140
They can sense a desire percolating up in your mind,

186
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,180
and just, for instance, just a few seconds before you think of it,

187
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:49,720
that zap comic that you're...

188
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,740
you always wanted to read a second time,

189
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,380
what just happens to be over there in the pile?

190
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,700
And you, and you look back and you think,

191
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,580
man, this is, this is great.

192
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,040
If only I had a frop stick.

193
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,740
Well, here's a frop stick.

194
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,820
Because muam and the biomorphs and the sex goddesses

195
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,600
can anticipate your every wish.

196
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,860
They can whiff a desire coming on.

197
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:15,040
And you'll think, now, if I could just, um,

198
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,720
meet up with that, that haughty librarian at that one college I went to,

199
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,200
while I'm reading this comic.

200
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,300
And sure enough, in she comes through the door.

201
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,080
Well, if only she'd dance, you think.

202
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,900
Oh, if only she had a small whip.

203
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,360
And it happens, as you think about it,

204
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,340
and there's no limit, no limit at all.

205
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,300
And, oh, if only she'd give me a ham sandwich first.

206
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,560
Ah, yes, now I'm...

207
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,140
And you'll sit there and think to yourself,

208
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,520
you know, I can't believe there was a time

209
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:48,320
when I wondered if it was worth the 20 bucks.

210
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:52,120
Sitting there eating the hell out of that ham sandwich,

211
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:55,220
getting a scarf job from that biomorph,

212
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,760
watching widescreen color TV Elvis movies,

213
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,820
and thinking, how could I ever have wondered?

214
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,680
How could I ever have doubted Bob for a second?

215
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,220
And to think of poor Bubba,

216
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,460
my brother Bubba back there on Earth,

217
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,120
the guy that said, hell, send them $20?

218
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,700
That's just what they want you to do.

219
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,180
I'll pump gas for $2.38 an hour the rest of my life

220
00:10:19,180 --> 00:10:22,160
before I'd send a dollar to that damn sub-gum church.

221
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:22,760
Oh, yeah.

222
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:27,740
Well, it's hard times for Bubba now, friends.

223
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,860
Yeah, just when you're thinking about old Bubba,

224
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,100
the one that didn't want to join the church,

225
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:37,560
well, the TV on the escape vessel in front of you lights up,

226
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,920
and there's this shot of Bubba down there

227
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,840
eating a rotten rat and hiding from the death machines

228
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,100
that the rogue pinks made from the stolen womb, Paul.

229
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:52,500
And he'll, Bubba will be down there muttering to himself,

230
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,780
oh, how could I do it?

231
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,860
I was so stupid.

232
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:59,320
I could have been saved, but no, I didn't send my $20.

233
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:01,780
Oh, God, here comes another rogue beast.

234
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:06,260
And here I am in this pestering pile of rat waste

235
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:09,040
and dead people and stripped bare skulls.

236
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,780
If only I could die.

237
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,420
If only I could die.

238
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:13,200
But I can't.

239
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,340
I can't.

240
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:18,580
Why, if only Bob was here now, I'd give him my $20.

241
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,160
I'd give him $40.

242
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,860
I'd give you everything I own, Bob, please.

243
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:28,940
Well, friends, that just shows how much they trusted Bob.

244
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:34,220
They didn't trust Bob Dobbs, didn't trust him $20 worth.

245
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,300
Okay, fine, fine, no skin off our teeth.

246
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,800
Pay lip service, wear that Bob T-shirt, be real hip.

247
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:44,900
But when those saucers come,

248
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,140
well, you're either on the bus

249
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:54,060
or you're off the bus, as those great proto-subgeni used to say.

250
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,600
And the dumbest nerd could get on the bus for $20.

251
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:59,760
Well, actually, those $20 don't count.

252
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:02,940
Their souls go into the cylinders that we trade for.

253
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:06,580
But they should be proud that their souls, such as they are,

254
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,980
at least made it possible for their betters

255
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:13,040
to ride the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

256
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:17,760
And there'll be an orientation film that they'll show you

257
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:18,840
when they're ruptured up.

258
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,340
You know, because otherwise it might be kind of confusing.

259
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:26,600
This orientation film is kind of projected into your head.

260
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,440
It's introduced by Princess We Are Doe,

261
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,320
queen of all the UFOs,

262
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,580
who's sort of this half-naked Flash Gordon slash Viking Brunhilde

263
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,720
with metal pointed breastplates and a horned helmet

264
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,340
and all this UFO insignia.

265
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:47,920
And she is the masteress of the path of least resistance.

266
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,480
And she narrates this film.

267
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,080
And it's like, you will hear and obey.

268
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,180
Take off your clothes.

269
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,340
And you can either watch the orientation film

270
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:03,780
or you can watch the live broadcast of X-Day

271
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:11,180
or you can just go back to having your fun

272
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,040
with the different simulacra.

273
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,220
And sex goddesses and so forth.

274
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:20,360
And of course your sweetheart's going to be doing the same thing too.

275
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,040
But because it's on those spaceships,

276
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,880
inside the escape vessels,

277
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,800
there's no time and no sense of jealousy.

278
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:34,260
You'll always...

279
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:38,420
It's like there's no sense of possessiveness

280
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:43,020
because in that no zone of the society,

281
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:43,020


282
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:46,200
there's no time and no sense of jealousy.

283
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,480
And you don't need to be grasping anymore

284
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,520
like you did on Earth.

285
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:54,140
The overwhelming feeling that you get on the escape vessels is like,

286
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:58,540
wow, the best part is it lasts as long as I want it to.

287
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,000
And I can take forever.

288
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,740
I'm immortal for now.

289
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,360
And I don't have the urge to grab this and keep it

290
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,000
so I can run somewhere else to grab some other thing.

291
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:12,240
I don't have to kill or defeat another monkey man

292
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,580
to hang on to these big round soft things.

293
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:20,260
I'll have plenty of time to get to those other big soft round things.

294
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,160
More than I could ever use.

295
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,760
My pipe overfloweth.

296
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:31,180
And the big round soft things shall follow me through the land of Dobbs

297
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:35,160
and I will dwell in the cleft in between forever.

298
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,860
It's like, oh, how were your multiple partners today, dear?

299
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:40,920
Oh?

300
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,520
Big and round and soft.

301
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,040
Ah, yes.

302
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,000
And there's, but people ask so many questions.

303
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:54,260
They say, well, Reverend Stang, is there just one giant saucer

304
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,000
or is it a bunch of regional saucers, you know,

305
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,200
like an East Coast saucer and a West Coast saucer?

306
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,940
No, there's a million kinds of saucers, friends,

307
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,640
but it's like virtual reality.

308
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:08,180
Once you're inside one of them, you might as well be in all of them.

309
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:09,640
You might as well be on Planet X.

310
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,340
You're not in normal space.

311
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:14,520
You can sort of phase to the other saucers

312
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:17,400
or find your friends telepathically.

313
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:21,020
You can go, oh, I think I'll go to the Chinese saucer today

314
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:23,800
or I'll go to the gay and lesbian saucer.

315
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,300
Gee, I always wanted to try being a lesbian female.

316
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,960
But meanwhile, those who are left behind,

317
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:32,600
which is 99% of the population

318
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:35,560
and probably 90% of the subgeniuses,

319
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,800
all those who didn't sin,

320
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,620
they're 29.

321
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:41,660
They're not going to miss out on the next day.

322
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,460
You know, come to think of it, I never sent.

323
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:46,860
Technically, I mean, I've spent a lot of my own money on the church,

324
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,320
but I never sent my $20 in for a membership.

325
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,760
Dr. Drummond never did.

326
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,220
Palmer Vredes never did.

327
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,780
Puzzling Evidence never did.

328
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:56,980
Sterno never did.

329
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,500
And, you know, friends, it won't matter what you did for Bob.

330
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,680
What'll matter is whether you sent that for that membership card.

331
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,140
I guess I'm going to have to get around to that.

332
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,680
Well, I got plenty of time, plenty of time till next day.

333
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:11,880
Oh, hell, that's 1998.

334
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,540
We got all the time in the world.

335
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:19,640
There will be one big escape vessel just for the doctors, for the hierarchy.

336
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:26,860
And I can just see Byron and Gordon and some of those other people up there going,

337
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,620
hey, you know, we ought to go down and say Vyvan and Philo

338
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,080
and all those who never got around to sending the $20.

339
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:37,440
And then they'll go, well, we'll get around to it.

340
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:46,280
We're not sure where the escape vessels of the sex goddesses go, dear friends.

341
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,660
As far as I can tell, they probably just fly around.

342
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,940
But I'm going to go, I'm going to get off of this for right now.

343
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:53,780
We'll go to an old hymn.

344
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,140
This is a lovely old subgen...

345
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:56,760
And I do mean old.

346
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,740
This is like from 1981.

347
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:02,900
Old subgenius hymn by someone we only know as Doug No. 4.

348
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,280
Oh, yes.

349
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:12,140
Please, pop, you can't kill me.

350
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:15,760
I want to die for God.

351
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,960
I want to die in holy, holy breath.

352
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:24,080
The bank boys and the nobles.

353
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:31,160
If we have to, if we have to, pop, it makes them die.

354
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:35,020
And we'll all come back home.

355
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,120
And we'll all come back home.

356
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:43,240
And we'll all come back home.

357
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,200
Oh, yes.

358
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:53,800
What a wonderful, wonderful tune.

359
00:17:54,000 --> 00:18:01,100
There from the good, the good, good reverend Doug No. 4,

360
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,840
who got scared by the church of the subgenius very shortly after doing that very song.

361
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,100
And, well, he got scared, too, but he didn't think much of it.

362
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,100


363
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,100


364
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,860
We never heard from him again.

365
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,460
And for all I know, he might be listening to this show going,

366
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,700
where's my royalties?

367
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:20,920
But he's not going to lack for royalties, dear friends,

368
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,880
because he'll be on those saucers.

369
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,920
And I hope that you will, too.

370
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,000
I hope you'll join us there on that lovely day.

371
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:32,300
And to make sure that you do,

372
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,680
let's go through some of these things to double-check just before X-Day.

373
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,100
There'll be more of this in our upcoming book, Revelation X.

374
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,780
This is where a lot of these notes are coming from, by the way, friends.

375
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:49,140
From a research session between myself and Dr. G. Gordon Gordon

376
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:55,100
in conference with that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

377
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,260
Yes, sort of a teleconference that we were on.

378
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,520
Praise this modern-day technology.

379
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,940
That way we didn't have to be in the same room with Bob.

380
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,040
Don't you see? It's a dream.

381
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:05,500
But anyway.

382
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:15,660
I mean, you don't want to miss your chance to be on the escape vessels of the sex goddesses on X-Day.

383
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,680
You don't want to end up down on Earth being fried.

384
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:24,840
So make sure that you have a real Subgenius Ministers card on you at all times.

385
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:26,780
Now, you never know. X-Day might come early.

386
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,640
So keep it with you.

387
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:31,420
Subgeniuses often lose those in the wash.

388
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:33,480
We get a lot of mail from people saying that.

389
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,120
I washed my membership card. Can I have another one?

390
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:39,940
And you don't want that to happen just before X-Day, friends.

391
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,960
So if you have members who have lost their cards,

392
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:46,400
but who are paid up and on the master disk of souls,

393
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:49,060
because we can tell. You can't fool us.

394
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,960
We'll give you a free replacement card from the Dallas headquarters anytime,

395
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,820
free of charges, by sending your self-addressed stamped envelopeness as members only

396
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,400
to Bob.

397
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:05,300
And we'll be giving that post office box number soon in the broadcast.

398
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:11,060
P.O. Box 1403-06, Dallas, Texas 75214 is what I'll be telling you.

399
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:13,920
But, ah, X-Day.

400
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,240
You know, on X-Day, for those down below on Earth,

401
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:22,200
you know, it'll be a little different than it would be up in the escape vessels of the sex goddesses.

402
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,780
They'll look up while they're trying to put their clothes out.

403
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:30,720
There'll be this huge eyeball in the sky,

404
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:36,440
this giant pyramid-shaped light form with a big eye that just,

405
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,800
covers the whole sky.

406
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:42,440
And it's filming for the escape vessel screens.

407
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,980
Ah yes, when we can watch what's going on down there,

408
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,860
we can watch any part of it we want.

409
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:50,340
And we can also leave messages,

410
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,400
because the big eye projects sort of billboards,

411
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:59,060
holographic billboards from horizon to horizon that say things like,

412
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,660
smile, you know, welcome to your stupid life.

413
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:06,520
You're being seen live on the escape vessels,

414
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:07,720
of the sex goddess screens,

415
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:12,740
where the subgeniuses are now partying, you dumb idiots.

416
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:19,180
I mean, a big billboard stretching all across the planet in all languages saying,

417
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:21,880
fools, we're having a great time.

418
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,080
And the subgeniuses can take turns broadcasting personal statements.

419
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:32,120
So, you know, this horrible pink evil person will be down there,

420
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,320
ah, fighting the Robeast.

421
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,280
And suddenly there's this, ah,

422
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,100
voice will ring out, hey, Mrs. Darden,

423
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:43,240
I was in your 1959 fifth grade class, remember me?

424
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:46,720
Steve Wilcox, ha ha, I'm up here, you're down there, ha!

425
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:51,120
Or, ah, like pain radio coming to you, Mr. Shaughnessy, the principal.

426
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:53,000
Remember when you expelled me?

427
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,740
How do you like the pain, huh?

428
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,540
And, ah, you know, you get back at anybody,

429
00:21:57,660 --> 00:22:00,460
oh, you laughed at me in junior high, Max.

430
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:03,040
You put me upside down into a trash can.

431
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,260
You and your jock friends, you aren't laughing quite so much.

432
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,800
You're laughing so hard now, are you?

433
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:13,660
And there'll be little holographic ghost-like things,

434
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,120
green slime type ghost sort of things.

435
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:20,900
Millions of little 3-D Jane-ers flying around, taunting,

436
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:23,240
and saying, you should've spent your $20,

437
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,440
should've spent your $20, oh, friends, friends,

438
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,300
oh, praise Bob, praise Bob, praise Bob, it's gonna be so,

439
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:35,520
but, you know, and so we find that the world isn't really to be destroyed,

440
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,580
it's that the humans, it, what happens is the humans are given all this alien technology

441
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:43,560
and they screw everything up.

442
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,500
They've got a miracle machine there, this womb thing that could do anything they want,

443
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:52,680
but nobody pays any attention to it at first because, ah,

444
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,000
they don't know what its capabilities are and it's real cautious about revealing itself too fast.

445
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:05,260
And they don't know that this fungus that's growing around them could fulfill their wildest desires,

446
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:09,780
because they don't believe it can, because they don't have any wild desires,

447
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,560
because they didn't think to ask.

448
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:19,560
And people will be down there in the ruins begging us with their last potato

449
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,860
to preach and deliver unto them the word of Dobbs,

450
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,840
because it's the only thing that'll save them.

451
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,200
Subgenius artifacts, like old copies of the book of the subgenius,

452
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:33,720
or illegal bootleg tapes of this radio show,

453
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,220
original pamphlet number ones, even an old Dobbs head,

454
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,620
it'll be worth a boxcar full of canned peaches, friends,

455
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:46,840
because the luck shell, the luck shell that we've always claimed was around our various products

456
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:50,100
that you thought we were only kidding about, now that's real.

457
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:56,740
And it will become visible on X day, a glow that's visible even in daylight.

458
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:03,280
Any given page of the printed word of Bob will be not only of practical use as lamps in the dark,

459
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:03,700
but more than anything, it will be a light.

460
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:08,840
More importantly, there'll be unthinkably valuable religious treasures, dear friends,

461
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,760
the most valuable things on the whole planet.

462
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:16,500
Because you're safer if you have that, if you've got a copy of the show with you.

463
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,160
It tips your luck playing.

464
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:24,380
It helps a whole lot against radiation and landslides and brain worms

465
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:28,400
and noise demons and nerve runners and all that.

466
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,360
It isn't nearly like having a membership card, but it's a lot better than having nothing.

467
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:39,160
Because friends, your faith, your faith in Bob will be all you have left on that day.

468
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:42,260
And he'll know whether you believed in him.

469
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,780
Wotan will know.

470
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,820
And he will come.

471
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:49,000
He will come to judge.

472
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,280
Gentlemen, the situation at this time is so serious that it's the worst in human history.

473
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,800
The fate of the entire Earth is in our hands.

474
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:03,300
Every hour we are getting news that our factories and our refineries and schools

475
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:05,680
are being attacked with rays of an unknown origin.

476
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,800
They haven't been analyzed so far.

477
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,320
Thousands of people are dead.

478
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:13,640
The attacks are not coming from outer space, our scientists say.

479
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:16,580
And certain monsters have been seen that appear to come from before the Ice Age,

480
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,800
long before the history of mankind.

481
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:18,780
They have to be stopped.

482
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,500
Professor, I know you've been in this book-line study for many years.

483
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,780
You know more about them than we do.

484
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,520
Tell us, what should we do?

485
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,520
Hmm.

486
00:25:28,720 --> 00:25:30,500
Don't go up there at night.

487
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,700
Stay in the sunlight.

488
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,460
Keep yourself safe and secure.

489
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:40,540
And in the daylight, we'll draw you out of there.

490
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:44,220
You've got to use all your power to knock them out.

491
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:46,740
All your power, believe me.

492
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:46,780
Laser guns?

493
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,120
Laser guns.

494
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,620
Not only laser guns, but your crew.

495
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,580
Get them up there and knock them out.

496
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,060
And when you knock them out, bring them home safely.

497
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,940
But we're going to have trouble with the launch pad.

498
00:25:59,080 --> 00:26:02,460
Well, the launch will be all right as soon as I can get there.

499
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:07,740
We know we've been behind it for years.

500
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:13,300
It's been my research staff that came up with the initial evidence.

501
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:18,400
Dr. Moore, can your staff come up with a weapon to stop the Nazi hell creatures in time?

502
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,960
I can't say for sure.

503
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:29,980
But with luck, the Zoological provide us with the answers.

504
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,100
Amen.

505
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,080
Is he a captain?

506
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,800
What is he?

507
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:43,020
And he's looking at me.

508
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,740
And I say, no.

509
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:47,060
I have to shake my head.

510
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,200
This isn't true.

511
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,280
This can't be true.

512
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,400
And he's still there.

513
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,360
And I look up and down the road.

514
00:26:56,660 --> 00:27:02,680
And I think, can't somebody come along and tell me that this isn't them?

515
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,160
It's there.

516
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,740
But it's there.

517
00:27:07,680 --> 00:27:07,860
Why?

518
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,380
What do they want?

519
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:11,880
What do they want?

520
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:17,300
Is the UFO mystery truly a scientific water gate?

521
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:20,520
An incredible and dangerous cover-up?

522
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:27,180
Understanding of the UFO may be beyond our science and political system.

523
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:30,020
...twisted them to fit the Nazi ideology.

524
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:31,080
Thank you.

525
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:39,360
And Bob, by the way, is running for Big Brother or Universal Overlord or County Clerk in 1984.

526
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:40,640
Yeah, that's right.

527
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,240
He knows he's not going to win Big Brother.

528
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:46,320
It's just to plant the seeds in the minds of the people.

529
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:56,000
Bob either wants to be County Clerk or Over God of all reality in 1984.

530
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:59,120
As Alistair Crowley once said,

531
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,140
If I can't be God, I'm not going to play.

532
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,980
This ain't no video game church.

533
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,380
It ain't no church of bingo.

534
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,740
It's a church of Bob.

535
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,440
It's a Bob Rogers church.

536
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,680
I don't see what the hell's going on here.

537
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,460
What the hell?

538
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,940
Did you know that heaven, Christian heaven is hotter than the Christian hell?

539
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,180
Yes, the Christian heaven is hotter.

540
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:18,420
That's because there are seven suns out of seven.

541
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,960
And the subgenius hell is fine.

542
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:21,900
Oh yeah, all your friends will be down there.

543
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:29,100
Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, I must admit I know very little at this time.

544
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:29,100


545
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:35,180
The princess is a creature of antiquity, ten million years at least in age.

546
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:40,260
And the monsters are mutants of creatures that roamed the earth before the ice age.

547
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:44,160
It is likely that a super race of humans existed sometime in the past also.

548
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:49,900
And somehow all of them, humans and creatures, went into hibernation far underground where they survived.

549
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,860
They are intelligent.

550
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:54,320
They are smarter than the most up-to-date supercomputers.

551
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,460
We cannot underestimate them.

552
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,100
They're not emotional.

553
00:28:57,140 --> 00:28:58,740
Angels don't have any emotion.

554
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:00,840
They're not

555
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:00,840


556
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:04,880
they don't just gaze in музыces.

557
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:04,900
They Haven't trained for that.

558
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:10,920
The meteors of some generous beings located within the of the hugeunt распpy was totally

559
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:10,920


560
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,560
don't bother with6

561
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:33,720
a stop to allow their house pets the leisure of relieving themselves outside of the spacecraft.

562
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:44,300
Certainly a few of these animals of amusement managed to break away from their masters

563
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,840
and somehow managed to survive on this planet.

564
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:54,700
If this is so, evidence of them must exist somewhere.

565
00:29:56,040 --> 00:30:02,220
I believe that evidence has already been uncovered and widely publicized of these animals.

566
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:06,280
The animals were probably the Yeti.

567
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:11,840
The Yeti's crossbred with human beings and the human beings as a result of that are...

568
00:30:12,460 --> 00:30:17,820
Basically the subgenius has the biological heritage of the Yeti.

569
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:19,120
The Yeti is the Yetensin or the Yeti.

570
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:24,320
Basically out of the mountains of China, although there's a few that live in the mountains of California,

571
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:29,580
they seem to be a mountain forest people that are...

572
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:36,340
Well, they're hairy only in their most pure state, but in sort of a mongrelized Yetensin such as myself,

573
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:43,780
only certain parts sprout hair. However, I have hair in unusual patches of my body, which is why I wear overalls.

574
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:50,840
The little lands are hollow and empty inside,

575
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:58,180
and inside dwell demons who move faster than thy light and speak faster than thy air carries sound,

576
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:04,920
and which wield the secret tools and anvils of the sciences which I have forbidden thee.

577
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:10,720
And these demons come among thy leaders all swathed in black and tempt them.

578
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:17,120
If the right people aren't there to meet the men from planet X, the Xs,

579
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:19,040
we call them men, sure, they look like men.

580
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:20,040
They can look like rocks.

581
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:22,100
They can look like eight-tentacled,

582
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,700
30-foot-tall monsters.

583
00:31:24,660 --> 00:31:26,900
Whatever is the requirement of the human

584
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:31,280
that they're possessing or talking to,

585
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,780
1998 is going to get here.

586
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,260
We'll all wake up July 4th, 7 o'clock in the morning,

587
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,060
or July 5th, pardon me, July 5th, 7 o'clock in the morning,

588
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,220
hangovers from the 4th of July,

589
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,800
and nothing will ever be the same again.

590
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,380
The planet will no longer belong to the humans

591
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,700
or the subgeniuses.

592
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,620
And that is why it is so crucial

593
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,080
that the subgeniuses be in those positions of power,

594
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,340
be at the coordinates, the landing strips,

595
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,760
when that angelic host does descend,

596
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,880
when the second, third, and fourth comings

597
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,020
occur during this period.

598
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,680
We...

599
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:15,380
You...

600
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:17,100
I know...

601
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,280
I know that you understand.

602
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,460
I know that you understand.

603
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,280
And I know that you'll be with us on that day,

604
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,000
that fateful day, X-Day, 1998.

605
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,180
Bob will be on television.

606
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,240
He'll talk to us.

607
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:34,300
He'll give a speech that will move billions,

608
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,380
not millions, but billions to tears,

609
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,160
and it'll work out okay.

610
00:32:38,460 --> 00:32:40,420
The world will end just right

611
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:42,900
and keep going in the new way,

612
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,060
the way of Bob.

613
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:46,380
Everyone will be subgeniuses.

614
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,460
Except us.

615
00:32:47,940 --> 00:32:49,820
You mentioned that the...

616
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,080
the...

617
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:56,760
advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures

618
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,000
from inside the hollow Earth

619
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,640
are conspiring to take over the whole planet.

620
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:05,100
Yeah, we read about that in a pamphlet that was handed to us.

621
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:05,720
Oh, you did?

622
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,920
Uh-huh. And Bob confirmed it.

623
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:09,920
And there's only... there's only one...

624
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:14,780
only one organization that could possibly stop them.

625
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:16,360
They're the men from Planet Earth,

626
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,140
and they'll be arriving in 1998.

627
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:21,840
And after... after the Tribulation money starts to fall

628
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:24,560
from the chariots and the angels in the sky

629
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:26,560
and coming up out of the ground

630
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:30,180
and spewing out of the back of them car exhaust pipes

631
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:31,440
and just magic everywhere,

632
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:34,800
and them Tribulation times will be tearing those...

633
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:38,520
those... those bad, evil, demonic people up,

634
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:41,320
and they'll be the subgenius people.

635
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,100
I think we should bring up...

636
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,560
That is Hitler's gem.

637
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,380
I'm waiting for the UFO

638
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:52,180
I'm waiting for the UFO

639
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:56,240
I'm waiting for the UFO

640
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,220
I'm waiting for the UFO

641
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:03,720
I'm waiting for the UFO

642
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,920
I don't know if you ever tried, but it's from his phone.

643
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:08,520
But if we yell through it real loud,

644
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:10,420
we might be able to contact home base.

645
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,120
If we can get back to the home planet.

646
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,160
Remember, folks, which takes us...

647
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,900
to a planet of non-mortals

648
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,360
who are eons advanced in their civilization.

649
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,380
Our program is Other Worlds.

650
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:26,600
Another movie that's swept America

651
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,660
is one entitled

652
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:32,180
The Encounters of the Third Degree.

653
00:34:33,220 --> 00:34:34,400
May I tell you this?

654
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:39,060
I'm not so sure what UFOs are.

655
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:40,260
I don't know if I believe them or not.

656
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:43,800
The New Zealand Air Force was on alert recently

657
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,940
because of the UFOs appearing

658
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,340
over that nation.

659
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,460
Someone said,

660
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:50,740
do you believe in flying saucers?

661
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,420
I said, of course.

662
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:52,140
I'm a married man.

663
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,880
If you don't get that now,

664
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:57,740
you may in the morning over the breakfast table.

665
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:01,200
You say, what about UFOs?

666
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,580
I don't want to delve into that,

667
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:04,560
but I want to give you something that blesses my heart.

668
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:07,840
I know there is life in the universe.

669
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:09,360
Why?

670
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:12,180
Because evil spirits,

671
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,320
demonic spirits,

672
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,620
fill the universe.

673
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,240
The cultists,

674
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,620
full of superstition and mysticism.

675
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:18,340
We're scientists.

676
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:19,820
We've got laser beams

677
00:35:19,820 --> 00:35:21,640
shaped like vampires

678
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:23,940
with glow-in-the-dark brains.

679
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,800
I've seen a vision, ma'am.

680
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,620
So play your cards right.

681
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:37,940
Yes.

682
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,120
All you deaf ears down there.

683
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,080
Heads up.

684
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:41,900
Look out below.

685
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,600
There will be plenty of distractions

686
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,960
to take their minds off the real problem.

687
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,220
As the time of P draws to its violent close.

688
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,020
For instance,

689
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:49,660
beware!

690
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,100
The fake God Junior,

691
00:35:51,340 --> 00:35:52,040
the anti-Bob,

692
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,020
will come before long.

693
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,440
Bullets cannot stop him.

694
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,460
He's one of the deceptively human-looking

695
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:58,600
advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures

696
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,920
from beneath the hollow earth.

697
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,460
Parasites of the Elder Gods.

698
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,500
But most people will think he's the second coming.

699
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:09,000
And his alien hiney will be kissed all the way

700
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,020
to world dictatorship and beyond.

701
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:14,360
And if the true messiah were to show up at that time,

702
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:15,940
everyone would just know that he's the one who's going to kill you.

703
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:18,500
And the only way to know with the bottom of their core programming

704
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:22,580
that he's the antichrist because he'll cuss and spit

705
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,620
and take the Lord's name in vain

706
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:28,520
and hang out with whores and bulldigers and dope addicts and cops.

707
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,080
Another down home sort.

708
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,000
This is a warning.

709
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:33,160
Danger, danger, you poor devils.

710
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:35,740
Things are more mixed up than you ever dreamed.

711
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,840
What was up is down.

712
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,320
The priorities are all screwy.

713
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:42,360
You're fretting if your hair looks okay

714
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,500
while some new kind of bladder cancer is bursting out

715
00:36:45,500 --> 00:36:47,040
the front of your designer jeans.

716
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:48,880
Yes, this is bad talk.

717
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:51,020
Nobody will listen to anything else.

718
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:55,520
You won't look at TV unless body parts or cars are jiggling or crashing on it.

719
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:59,480
You won't taste your food unless it has some nerve drug in it.

720
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:02,600
You haven't used your other senses since you were five.

721
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:05,280
And you sure as hell won't stop what you're doing

722
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:10,640
until someone much bigger, much stronger, and much, much more

723
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,940
self-assured makes you stop.

724
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:15,120
And you'll thank him for it.

725
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:19,240
And then just before you fry in a flash of radioactive hindsight,

726
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:23,320
you'll realize that he stopped you from doing the wrong thing.

727
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:27,600
Good God, what in the name of sweet screaming Jesus

728
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,420
is this world coming to?

729
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,800
People bitch.

730
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:31,860
People gripe.

731
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,780
This is a sign of the end times.

732
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:35,460
That's a sign of the end times.

733
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,180
When you should all be hollering, it's all a sign of the end times.

734
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:44,800
What, brothers and sisters, will happen to this heritage?

735
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:47,540
On July 5th, 1998?

736
00:37:48,880 --> 00:37:51,300
Would anyone like to take a guess what's going to happen to this

737
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,660
heritage when the saucers come?

738
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,560
He will be on the escape vessels on July 5th, 1998.

739
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:03,160
He will be on those saucers with the sex goddesses

740
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:07,860
because he paid his $30 subgenius membership fee.

741
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,740
He had his membership card in the church.

742
00:38:10,940 --> 00:38:14,920
And even if you were to go out today and turn your back on Bob's

743
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:16,140
because you've never heard any of this.

744
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:19,380
Even if you were to go out tomorrow and get a job,

745
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:23,100
maybe even as president of the United States or a cop somewhere ripping

746
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:26,020
apart people's cars searching for dope, you would still

747
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:29,360
be able to get on the pleasure saucers as long as you

748
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,340
had that subgenius membership card, as long as you paid

749
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:34,840
for that subgenius membership card.

750
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,220
Can you say the same?

751
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:42,160
Can you say that you're going to be on those escape vessels on July 5th?

752
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,560
Do you think you're going to squeak by just

753
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:45,760
because you're cool?

754
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,560
Do you think coolness is going to get you onto those space vessels?

755
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:59,660
Well, what are you going to do on X day when suddenly all your paid in full subgenius buddies

756
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:01,440
disappear?

757
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:09,940
Many people would say, well, I'm not going to join up with the church of the subgenius.

758
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,900
The church of the subgenius is an organization of non-joiners.

759
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:14,540


760
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,160
So I'm not going to join.

761
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,440
Well, I got a surprise for you folks.

762
00:39:18,740 --> 00:39:21,520
You're not going to be joining us on X day either.

763
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:26,520
And X day, you have no idea what's awaiting you all on X day.

764
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:37,840
True slack, true slack is like better than getting gang sucked by a horde of horny, buxom,

765
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:44,280
Nordic Valkyries while eating a big juicy T-bone steak.

766
00:39:44,840 --> 00:39:45,900
On your birthday.

767
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:55,760
But X day, X day makes slack seem like you're wearing a helmet with a padlock chin strap.

768
00:39:58,080 --> 00:39:58,760
That's right.

769
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:04,160
By comparison, X day is going to make any slack you have seem like nothing.

770
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:11,820
Now you might think, well, I'm not going to spend any money on this church of the subgenius.

771
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:14,040
I'm not going to spend any money on this.

772
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,520
I got better.

773
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:15,600
I got better things to do with my $30.

774
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:20,380
I can go out and buy a Hootie and the Blowfish CD or something with that money.

775
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:27,200
And I can sit at home and I can listen to my Hootie and the Blowfish CD over and over

776
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,500
and over again.

777
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:36,080
And I can sit back and just jam and have me a good time listening to my CD player.

778
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:39,540
Because you like music so much.

779
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:42,520
Well on X day.

780
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:46,420
That CD player is going to melt into a pile of slag.

781
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,220
That's right.

782
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:54,800
All your cheap pink entertainment devices are going to be destroyed in the fires of

783
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:56,440
the X-est invasion.

784
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,500
There will be no music then.

785
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:07,340
The only music there will be will be the screams of the dying.

786
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:12,500
You may not like the sound of this type of music.

787
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:12,500


788
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:18,740
But we subgeniuses will damn well be dancing to the tune.

789
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,180
So what can you do?

790
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,800
You can join up with the church of the subgenius.

791
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,620
Or you'll be singing in the choir.

792
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,940
That's right brothers and sisters.

793
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:37,620
You'll be singing along with all that screaming and pain.

794
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,840
And all that horrible moaning and wailing.

795
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,500
And praying.

796
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:42,500


797
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:49,700
You know when I was in Chicago last night I was down in the dressing room getting ready

798
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,880
to go up here and preach to the folks out there.

799
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:55,160
And a cockroach was crawling across the table.

800
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:59,420
And I took out my ink pen and I was kind of poking it along.

801
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:04,320
And it'd run and go across the table and I'd reach over and poke it the other way.

802
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,180
And I'd watch it run.

803
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:09,960
And I'd sit there and watch the little things that got so frustrated.

804
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,480
And then I took out my cigarette light.

805
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:12,480


806
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:15,740
And I started singeing around his antennas.

807
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:21,340
And then I reached around behind him and started burning off his wings.

808
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,480
And he flipped over and his little legs were kicking and screaming.

809
00:42:24,700 --> 00:42:26,360
And flying around in the air.

810
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:33,900
On next day, if you don't have a membership card, you're going to pray.

811
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,680
You're going to wish that you were that cockroach.

812
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:42,120
That's right, you will wish you were that cockroach on next day.

813
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:42,480
And I'll be back with more of that.

814
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:45,400
You'll wish that you could just be tortured for a little while.

815
00:42:45,580 --> 00:42:52,000
And then put out of your misery in a burst of flame by some sadistic sub-genius preacher.

816
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,660
But we're not going to make it that easy on you.

817
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:56,720
No.

818
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,820
Brothers and sisters, the river is rising.

819
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,880
And you're going to drown.

820
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:11,440
Tonight, I am offering you a personal flotation device.

821
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,300
To keep your head above this rising river.

822
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:17,720
I'm offering you a personal flotation device.

823
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:21,240
In the form of this man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

824
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:26,920
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

825
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:31,100
The time has come nigh for you tonight.

826
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:34,620
It is no accident that you are all here.

827
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:41,220
You all have been chosen to receive this message.

828
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:45,320
You have been chosen because the water is rising up.

829
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,920
And it's just about to rise over your heads.

830
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:50,580
And we're going to throw you this flotation device.

831
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:53,240
And you can either grab onto it and live.

832
00:43:53,620 --> 00:43:55,520
Or you can pass it on by.

833
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,340
And you're going to go down like yesterday's sh**.

834
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:04,740
It's no accident.

835
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:09,160
You must join the church of the sub-genius or die.

836
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:13,660
You'll be damn glad that you joined.

837
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,760
You will be damn glad that you spent that pitiful $30.

838
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,540
I really don't want to see all of you die.

839
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,940
Some of you I do.

840
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,480
But I don't want to see all of you die.

841
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,300
We are here to help you.

842
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,320
We are your friends.

843
00:44:36,140 --> 00:44:37,360
You must know.

844
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,720
Can't you feel?

845
00:44:38,720 --> 00:44:40,520
By looking at this man Bob.

846
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:43,280
How much he loves you.

847
00:44:43,940 --> 00:44:46,620
Don't you realize how much Bob loves you?

848
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,440
He loves you so much.

849
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:56,280
That he's willing to offer you a chance to have your every perverse desire be brought to life.

850
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:03,140
Your every sick sexual fantasy shall be made flesh before you.

851
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,160
Trust us.

852
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,440
Trust Bob.

853
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:11,420
Amen.

854
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:17,100
Maybe some of you still aren't willing to accept Bob into your lives.

855
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:19,460
Perhaps you need some proof.

856
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,820
Perhaps Bob.

857
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:27,240
Perhaps my main man J.R. Bob Dobbs here.

858
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:29,580
Will give me the power.

859
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:34,460
The power to heal some lucky member of the audience tonight.

860
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:40,980
Is there anybody here that needs to be healed of some horrible sickness?

861
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,580
Oh, wait.

862
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,540
We have a man here waving his hands.

863
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,120
Come on up here brother.

864
00:45:47,260 --> 00:45:47,980
Come on up here.

865
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:52,560
Come on up here brother.

866
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:53,420
Let me help you.

867
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,540
Good evening brother.

868
00:45:55,800 --> 00:45:56,580
What's your name?

869
00:45:56,840 --> 00:45:57,800
My name is Eric.

870
00:45:58,220 --> 00:45:58,740
Eric.

871
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,220
And what brought you here tonight Eric?

872
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,860
What brought you here tonight?

873
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:08,080
My crippled right leg.

874
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:10,820
Your crippled right leg brought you here tonight.

875
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:12,820
Well Bob.

876
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:16,740
Bob's going to give me the power to heal you of your maladies.

877
00:46:17,180 --> 00:46:20,700
Bob's telling me that you have a problem in your leg.

878
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:26,100
Bob's telling me you have a tumor in your leg that you need healed.

879
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:26,640
Is this true?

880
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:32,180
And Bob told me that you had a terrible heart condition brother.

881
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:33,280
Is this true?

882
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:35,480
It's true?

883
00:46:37,140 --> 00:46:40,480
And Bob tells me that you have bursitis in your shoulder.

884
00:46:41,780 --> 00:46:43,140
Am I right?

885
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,220
Have you got bursitis in your shoulder?

886
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,680
He has bursitis in his shoulder.

887
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:49,040
He has many maladies.

888
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,940
But Bob is also telling me you've been having problems with your liver.

889
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,520
Is that true?

890
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:57,620
And that you've been having a problem with sexual dysfunction.

891
00:46:57,960 --> 00:46:58,720
Is that true?

892
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:00,360
Yes.

893
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:02,800
It's true.

894
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,260
He's suffering.

895
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:03,260


896
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:03,260


897
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:03,260


898
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:03,260


899
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:03,260


900
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:03,260


901
00:47:03,260 --> 00:47:04,980
He's suffering from an obstruction.

902
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:09,280
Is it true that you're having some problem with your bowels?

903
00:47:11,180 --> 00:47:11,700
Yes.

904
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:12,460
Yes.

905
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:17,360
And Bob also told me that you have a problem with really bad acne on your ass.

906
00:47:17,620 --> 00:47:18,280
Is it true?

907
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:19,900
It's all over.

908
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,140
It's sad.

909
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:24,660
And that all the women call you pizza butt.

910
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,500
Is that true?

911
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,160
What women?

912
00:47:28,860 --> 00:47:29,900
That's so sad.

913
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:32,420
A man with sexual dysfunction.

914
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,880
And a pizza butt who can't get a woman.

915
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,760
Bob is saying that you need to be healed of these maladies.

916
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:41,840
Bob is saying that you've had a problem with your throat too.

917
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,340
And your ears.

918
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:47,120
And the glands in your armpits.

919
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,500
And your left index finger.

920
00:47:50,380 --> 00:47:52,080
And your right middle finger.

921
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:54,940
The one that keeps getting stiff every time a police car goes by.

922
00:47:55,180 --> 00:47:55,940
Is this true brother?

923
00:47:56,180 --> 00:47:57,260
This is the truth.

924
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,720
Well brother.

925
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:01,120
Tonight we're going to heal you.

926
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,420
We're going to heal you brother.

927
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:04,780
Oh yes.

928
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:10,100
Brother Bevilacqua is going to come up here to help me out with his healing.

929
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:17,040
Sometimes the power gets in me and it's so strong that I burn out the wires and actually accidentally kill the person I'm trying to heal.

930
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:18,180
But brother.

931
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,960
We're going to heal you or kill you.

932
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,860
We're going to take care of your leg.

933
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,380
We're going to take care of your arm.

934
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,240
We're going to take care of your brain tumor.

935
00:48:25,560 --> 00:48:30,040
We're going to take care of your sorry little limp and your packed up butt hole.

936
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:32,760
We're going to take care of your angina pectoris.

937
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,680
We're going to take care of your swollen glands.

938
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:39,560
We're going to take care of that middle finger that sticks up on your right hand whenever a policeman comes by.

939
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:43,520
And make it so the middle finger on your left hand gets stiff when policemen go by too.

940
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:45,400
Brother.

941
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,480
I'm going to lay my hands on you and heal you.

942
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:49,920
Beheal.

943
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:51,800
Oh my god.

944
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:52,600
Woo.

945
00:48:53,340 --> 00:48:53,780
Woo.

946
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:57,860
Brothers he isn't going to be needing this anymore.

947
00:48:58,580 --> 00:48:59,020
Yeehaw.

948
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,180
Come on up brother.

949
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:01,660
Come on up.

950
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,000
How are you feeling now?

951
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,340
How are you feeling now?

952
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,040
I'm feeling amazing.

953
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:15,440
Now go on out and find yourself a woman in this crowd and see if you can make your dysfunctional organs work.

954
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,340
But I've got total faith that Bob is going to do this for you.

955
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,740
I've got total faith that Bob is going to do this for you.

956
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:25,640
Yes brothers and sisters.

957
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,880
You've seen the miracle.

958
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:29,360
You've seen the miracles tonight.

959
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,000
You've seen the healings and the inflictions of pain.

960
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,660
I see my brother here is actually over here carousing with a woman now.

961
00:49:37,840 --> 00:49:41,060
Who's not looking at him as if he were a disgusting squid.

962
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:43,000
Oh look at that.

963
00:49:43,060 --> 00:49:44,080
He's getting some action.

964
00:49:44,420 --> 00:49:50,060
And Bob promises all of you all the action you'll ever need.

965
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:51,520
All the action you'll ever want.

966
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:54,060
And more.

967
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,240
Two and a half feet long.

968
00:49:58,300 --> 00:49:58,780
Side.

969
00:49:58,780 --> 00:49:59,380
Solid aluminum.

970
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:06,220
The orifices are going to be stretching.

971
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,440
The heads are going to be collapsing.

972
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,040
And brothers and sisters.

973
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,020
I'm not going to use any lubricant.

974
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,700
Oh yes.

975
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,040
I have but one thing left to say to you all.

976
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:27,940
The supermarket.

977
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:30,060
Has run out of food.

978
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:33,420
The highway out of town is jammed up.

979
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:34,480
Gridlock.

980
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,800
The doctor's dead.

981
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:40,040
There's a meteor heading for your town.

982
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:43,760
And J.R. Bob Dobbs.

983
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:48,520
Is sitting at the wheel of the last train out of town.

984
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:51,900
Brothers. Sisters.

985
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:55,160
You've got to get on that train.

986
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,160
Because when you come right down to it.

987
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:01,500
You either got to ride that train.

988
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,900
Or you're going to get tied to the tracks.

989
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:07,740
Remember.

990
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:10,340
It is far better.

991
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:12,600
To be a speeding car.

992
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:16,360
Than it is to be a blind man crossing.

993
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:18,440
Against the light.

994
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,800
Amen brothers and sisters.

995
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:26,520
Can I get an amen?

996
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:27,460
Amen.

997
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,380
Can I get a hallelujah?

998
00:51:29,900 --> 00:51:30,380
Hallelujah.

999
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,920
What do you all want tonight brothers and sisters?

1000
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:34,760
Fire.

1001
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:36,880
What do you want?

1002
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:37,840
Fire.

1003
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:39,520
Brothers and sisters.

1004
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,760
I need you to say it again.

1005
00:51:40,820 --> 00:51:42,200
But I need you to say it loud enough.

1006
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,100
That the exes that are on their way here.

1007
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,500
Will hear you.

1008
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:48,960
And they're going to crank up the radio.

1009
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,640
And roll down the windows on their spaceship.

1010
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,180
And they're going to light up a big fat frop stick.

1011
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:55,800
And smile.

1012
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,980
And they're going to be coming down.

1013
00:51:58,460 --> 00:52:00,880
And you got to let them know that you're all waiting for them.

1014
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,400
So what is it that you want brothers and sisters?

1015
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:04,500
Slack.

1016
00:52:06,540 --> 00:52:07,940
Yes brothers and sisters.

1017
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,500
Slack.

1018
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,700
Oh yes.

1019
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,140
And who is going to give you this slack?

1020
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:13,220
Bob.

1021
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:16,920
Brothers and sisters.

1022
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:17,840
The train's leaving.

1023
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:21,540
And a lot of you guys are on the right track.

1024
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:23,820
Praise Bob.

1025
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:25,100
Praise Bob.

1026
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:25,980
Praise Bob.

1027
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:27,560
Thank you very much.

1028
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,100
One.

1029
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,100
Two.

1030
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:31,360
Three.

1031
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,060
Four.

1032
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:32,980
Five.

1033
00:52:34,200 --> 00:52:35,400
Six.

1034
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:35,440
Seven.

1035
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:35,440


1036
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:35,540


1037
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:36,120


1038
00:52:36,120 --> 00:52:36,120


1039
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:37,780
Twelve.

1040
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,100
Thirteen.

1041
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:39,600
Thirteen.

1042
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,640
Four.

1043
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:42,220
Four.

1044
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:42,260
Five.

1045
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:42,260


1046
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:42,260


1047
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:42,260


1048
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,060
Four.

1049
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:43,960
Four.

1050
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:44,620
Five.

1051
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:46,980
Four.

1052
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:50,600
Four.

1053
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,420
Five.

1054
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:54,420
One.

1055
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:00,380
Two.

1056
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:00,480


1057
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:00,480


1058
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:02,060
Four.

1059
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:02,060


1060
00:53:02,320 --> 00:53:02,420
Four.

1061
00:53:02,420 --> 00:53:02,420


1062
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:02,960
Four.

1063
00:53:03,380 --> 00:53:03,560
Four.

1064
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:04,760
Five.

1065
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:05,700
Four.

1066
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:05,700


1067
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,380
Four.

1068
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:06,660
Five.

1069
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:06,660


1070
00:53:06,660 --> 00:53:06,780
Four.

1071
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:06,820
Five.

1072
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:09,040
Fear.

1073
00:53:16,020 --> 00:53:16,640
Four.

1074
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:16,840


1075
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:16,860


1076
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:17,180
Four.

1077
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:17,480
Five.

1078
00:53:17,940 --> 00:53:18,560
Four.

1079
00:53:19,120 --> 00:53:19,120


1080
00:53:19,380 --> 00:53:19,520
Four.

1081
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:20,060


1082
00:53:20,500 --> 00:53:21,100
Four.

1083
00:53:21,100 --> 00:53:26,900
normals, friends, yes, yes, but Bob's men are moving on this planet, oh, that planetary alignment that

1084
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:32,460
came up, the Jupiter effect, oh, I'm now sure that may, that, that may have caused earthquakes and

1085
00:53:32,460 --> 00:53:39,200
volcanoes and the earth to tilt on its axis, and men will, in the end times to come, men will gnash

1086
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:45,160
their brains and think backwards, dead Christians will come up from their graves shambling and

1087
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:50,260
rotten like not of the living dead, but through it all, helping to profit from it all, is that one

1088
00:53:50,260 --> 00:53:55,480
mighty link between heaven and earth, that Bob, oh, yeah, I can see it now, the miracle of the Bob

1089
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:00,820
world is unfolding, they're wading up to their knees in blood, dear friends, but it's the blood

1090
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:09,420
of the baptism of a mighty fist face of Bob, that face that can pile through eight foot thick

1091
00:54:09,420 --> 00:54:16,980
titanium steel conspiracy fork knock stores with that mighty pipe, oh, he ain't from another planet,

1092
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,960
he ain't something we have to bow down and kiss to,

1093
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:25,700
he's a man, oh, well, you can pull Bob's leg and he'll laugh right along with you, because Bob,

1094
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:30,440
he's been a fool just like you and me, Bob's been a pathetic fool, and I tell you what,

1095
00:54:30,580 --> 00:54:37,680
that J.R. Bob Dobbs will be a fool again, he's a fool today, he's a fool tomorrow, because he's

1096
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:43,020
the same Bob, he's always the same Bob, and he's working for you and me, but it's that foolishness

1097
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:48,340
that has kept man from being satisfied with his lot, that has kept man building his great

1098
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:50,240
gas-powered automobile engine, and he's been a fool, and he's been a fool, and he's been a fool,

1099
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:57,220
and he's been a fool, and he's been a fool, and he's been a fool, and he's been a fool,

1100
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:00,040
and he's been a fool, and he's been a fool, and he's been a fool, and he's been a fool,

1101
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,040


1102
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,040


1103
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:00,040


1104
00:55:00,040 --> 00:55:06,860
and he's been a fool, and he's been a fool, дол

1105
00:55:06,860 --> 00:55:09,120
and he's been a fool, Bowl

1106
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,380
and he's been a fool, little Simone,

1107
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:13,180
and he's been a fool, little Simone, for a guy who's gonna have a result tonight,

1108
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:17,680
but he's just gonna find love, because the electing's gonna be like hisShowy.

1109
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:20,240
And he's gonna find love, and he's gonna find love, and he's gonna

1110
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:22,480
Poor and broke, we may be drunk and neurotic,

1111
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,720
but we've got Bob and they hate!

1112
00:55:24,940 --> 00:55:26,700
And for that, we can hate them!

1113
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,720
Hate them! Hate them!

1114
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,360
And that's the power that we have, and they don't have.

1115
00:55:31,660 --> 00:55:34,980
Oh, they got plenty of that diddly kind of hate.

1116
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:36,620
Oh, I hate President Reagan.

1117
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,540
Oh, I hate my job.

1118
00:55:38,740 --> 00:55:39,920
I hate myself.

1119
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:42,420
That's the sick hate, friends.

1120
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:43,800
That ain't no kind of hate at all.

1121
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,040
We got that all-inclusive kind of hate, that hate essence,

1122
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:52,000
and it's the love of the hate that allows us to put up with just about anything.

1123
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,540
So we can do something about it,

1124
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:57,180
because the Bob hate is indistinguishable from the Bob love.

1125
00:55:57,260 --> 00:55:58,580
It's what keeps him on his toes.

1126
00:55:58,740 --> 00:56:01,120
Bob is the aware man, the natural man.

1127
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:03,720
He can be walking along humming to himself, playing pocket pool,

1128
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:05,460
but the inner Bob is aware.

1129
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:09,180
He can hear a fly sniff on a mountain far away,

1130
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:12,040
and he can go up to that fly and look that fly in the eye and say,

1131
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:16,440
Son, I'd like to sell you a big old mound of waste byproducts

1132
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,680
from physical organisms.

1133
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:20,440
And that fly will give his wings to Bob.

1134
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:24,040
Bob is aware, and that's how he can sell to these inferior creatures.

1135
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,040
And that fly, he's going to be a better fly for it.

1136
00:56:27,100 --> 00:56:30,360
All those other flies, they're flitting from pile to pile.

1137
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:34,540
They see him just sitting there without any wings on that big old mound of Bob.

1138
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,860
And they may laugh now, but winter goes by, summer goes by.

1139
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,540
All those other flies starve, but that little Bob fly,

1140
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,340
he's still sitting there on that pile, a-munching away and a-munching away.

1141
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,260
And that pile does not change.

1142
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:49,260
Because Bob, my friends, does not change.

1143
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,460
Oh, he changes his mind.

1144
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:53,320
He might suddenly change all the doctrine in the whole church

1145
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,460
right in the middle of a ritual to teach us all an important lesson.

1146
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:59,240
But, oh, my friend, Bob Dobbs does not change.

1147
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:00,980
Hold that name on the tip of your tongue.

1148
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:01,420
Bob.

1149
00:57:01,540 --> 00:57:03,500
There's a B on either side, opposite poles.

1150
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,620
That's the lesson right there.

1151
00:57:04,760 --> 00:57:06,120
Flip it over on your tongue.

1152
00:57:06,320 --> 00:57:07,200
Say it front way.

1153
00:57:07,260 --> 00:57:07,900
Say it backwards.

1154
00:57:08,060 --> 00:57:08,860
Say it upside down.

1155
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:09,620
And what does it say?

1156
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,880
It says Bob.

1157
00:57:11,060 --> 00:57:12,980
Because Bob does not change.

1158
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,680
His promise rings true.

1159
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:16,420
But if you ain't been there,

1160
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,860
if you ain't been sprinkled in the blood of the head,

1161
00:57:18,020 --> 00:57:21,100
if you ain't been washed in the waste byproducts of Bob,

1162
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:22,900
how are you going to get saved?

1163
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:25,420
You can go to that party Saturday night,

1164
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:27,360
but you've got to be wearing Bob's shadow.

1165
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,560
And you can drink beer.

1166
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:30,600
You've just got to get Bob drunk, too.

1167
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:31,900
And what about Wanda?

1168
00:57:32,120 --> 00:57:35,100
Oh, you're going to have to give Wanda over to Bob.

1169
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,580
That shouldn't be any problem.

1170
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,860
Because Wanda, she found out from Bob how to get to heaven.

1171
00:57:39,980 --> 00:57:40,740
Sit down, boy.

1172
00:57:40,980 --> 00:57:42,620
Because, friends, if you're wondering,

1173
00:57:43,820 --> 00:57:44,840
Bob can love.

1174
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:47,580
Bob can love.

1175
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,200
Radio job.

1176
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,180
I didn't set foot in a church for three years.

1177
00:58:00,740 --> 00:58:03,120
I was just fed up to here with it.

1178
00:58:04,780 --> 00:58:08,540
After working as an announcer at stations in several cities,

1179
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:10,060
I finally got to Hollywood.

1180
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:12,580
I was offered four jobs,

1181
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,960
and I took one with a major network.

1182
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,420
In 1947,

1183
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,640
I made a business trip to Cincinnati.

1184
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,580
And it was just about then that the Kenneth Arnold sighting

1185
00:58:25,580 --> 00:58:28,180
of the so-called flying saucers hit the headlines.

1186
00:58:29,580 --> 00:58:31,460
And it caused a lot of conversation.

1187
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,000
I notice you keep looking out the window.

1188
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:39,860
You wouldn't be looking for these flying saucers, would you?

1189
00:58:40,120 --> 00:58:41,600
Well, as a matter of fact, yes.

1190
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,620
You don't think it's just some kind of a publicity stunt, then, huh?

1191
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,200
No.

1192
00:58:46,420 --> 00:58:46,500
No.

1193
00:58:47,420 --> 00:58:50,140
It's reasonable to suppose that there's life on other planets.

1194
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,800
Maybe I ought to start looking for flying saucers, too.

1195
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,520
If they do come from another planet, how will we know?

1196
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:01,720
Listen, when the occupants condescend to tell us, that's when.

1197
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:11,840
Good God!

1198
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:12,940
Good God!

1199
00:59:13,140 --> 00:59:14,060
Good God!

1200
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:15,020
Good God!

1201
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,060
Good God!

1202
00:59:16,620 --> 00:59:17,340
Good God!

1203
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:19,420
Good God!

1204
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,080
Now, Bob, you're getting to be a pretty big fella.

1205
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:22,340
Yes, sir.

1206
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:25,820
Maybe this is a good idea, a chance for us to have a little talk.

1207
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:26,620
Why, sure, Dad.

1208
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:27,120
What's cooking?

1209
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,200
Uh, remember the last time we talked about this old body of ours, Bob?

1210
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:34,780
Yeah.

1211
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,140
Yeah, I remember, Dad.

1212
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:36,540
No.

1213
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:38,540
Oh, here's a match.

1214
00:59:38,620 --> 00:59:39,560
Your pipe's gone out again.

1215
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:40,380
Well, thanks.

1216
00:59:41,060 --> 00:59:45,920
But when a doctor speaks of the male organ, he, well, he calls it a...

1217
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:52,680
When a man and a woman are married, Bob, they love each other very much.

1218
00:59:53,800 --> 01:00:04,360
And in, in showing their love, their instinct is to embrace each other as if, well, as if to try to become the one person God intended them to be.

1219
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:06,780
They're the, the sperm, as the doctors call it.

1220
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:09,440
Oh, is that the seed that helps make a new baby?

1221
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:11,720
No, no, Bob.

1222
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:15,760
Well, what I'm talking about now is the fluid.

1223
01:00:15,760 --> 01:00:19,160
The fluid that contains the, formed in two little sacks beneath the...

1224
01:00:19,160 --> 01:00:21,360
And now, here are my predictions.

1225
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,620
Listen.

1226
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:23,760
Listen carefully.

1227
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:29,220
Join me in knowing the headlines of tomorrow today.

1228
01:00:29,860 --> 01:00:33,220
I'm not gonna judge you.

1229
01:00:33,260 --> 01:00:36,780
But I'll see you do that when I'm judging you.

1230
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:44,520
I predict public executions will be shown on television sponsored by your local gas company.

1231
01:00:45,860 --> 01:00:50,400
Securing the faith that the future is filled with good things for you and yours.

1232
01:00:50,720 --> 01:00:55,200
I predict that LSD, marijuana, and speed can change your sex.

1233
01:00:56,120 --> 01:01:00,720
Listen now to the headlines you will be reading in the coming prediction period.

1234
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,880
School built on sweet potato pie.

1235
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,120
Gee, that's a headline.

1236
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:15,740
If it were possible to spray small doses of LSD from an helicopter into a plane,

1237
01:01:15,740 --> 01:01:20,600
into the air, people would soon quieten and not be hurt.

1238
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,960
She is a cutie, isn't she?

1239
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:25,680
What a girl.

1240
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:28,060
Right on campus as part of getting high.

1241
01:01:28,260 --> 01:01:30,320
I mean, getting a higher education.

1242
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,160
Which is just wonderful in any language.

1243
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,140
Here's Bobby.

1244
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:42,420
LSD is running its mad course, with babies now being born hideously deformed from women

1245
01:01:42,420 --> 01:01:45,720
whose chromosomes are permanently damaged by this drug, and the effects of it on the

1246
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:45,720


1247
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,440
The LSD is a chemical weapon, which was invented originally by the chemical warfare branch

1248
01:01:49,440 --> 01:01:54,220
of the United States Army as a vicious weapon to be used against an enemy.

1249
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:59,920
Here you see the heroic robots, the Levees, who defended San Francisco against the daftly

1250
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:00,220
attack.

1251
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:05,200
All right, I've seen enough.

1252
01:02:05,660 --> 01:02:08,160
Well, you know, who knows what could happen here.

1253
01:02:08,340 --> 01:02:13,980
Bob got to Reagan in time and saved him, and President Bush is, we think he's going to

1254
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,060
be getting better soon.

1255
01:02:15,060 --> 01:02:19,060
1983 will be seen in the first televised executions.

1256
01:02:19,620 --> 01:02:21,980
Don't you mean the clone of President Bush?

1257
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:25,400
Well, that goes without saying.

1258
01:02:25,620 --> 01:02:27,600
I don't expect him to believe that.

1259
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:30,520
We can't ask, we can't ask Tony.

1260
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:32,960
They have entire clone farms there in Argentina.

1261
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:39,480
Basically all our world leaders and politicians are only clones of their original selves,

1262
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:45,040
their original brains taken out and replaced by the original.

1263
01:02:49,380 --> 01:02:51,820
They're not the ones that work at convenience stores.

1264
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,760
It's right over my right.

1265
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:03,420
What is it?

1266
01:03:05,640 --> 01:03:07,560
I gotta get out of here.

1267
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:08,980
This won't trouble you.

1268
01:03:09,020 --> 01:03:09,540
Go on.

1269
01:03:09,800 --> 01:03:11,380
You're remembering everything now.

1270
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:15,020
And I try to maintain it.

1271
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,020


1272
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,020


1273
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,020


1274
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,020


1275
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,020


1276
01:03:15,020 --> 01:03:15,340
I'm in control.

1277
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,720
So Betty cannot tell that I am scared.

1278
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:20,720
Oh, I'm so scared.

1279
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:21,760
Go on.

1280
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:23,020
This won't hurt you.

1281
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:23,900
Experience it.

1282
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:25,000
It won't harm you now.

1283
01:03:28,000 --> 01:03:29,420
I gotta get my gun.

1284
01:03:29,660 --> 01:03:30,920
I gotta get my gun.

1285
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:32,540
I gotta get out of here.

1286
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,420
I gotta get my gun.

1287
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:35,380
I gotta get my gun.

1288
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:36,460
I can't.

1289
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:37,680
I can't.

1290
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:38,140
I can't.

1291
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:38,480
I can't.

1292
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:39,160
I gotta get my gun.

1293
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:39,660
I can't.

1294
01:03:39,740 --> 01:03:39,860
I gotta get my gun.

1295
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:39,860


1296
01:03:39,860 --> 01:03:40,880
They're not emotional.

1297
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,520
Angels don't have any emotions.

1298
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:48,680
The princess is a creature of antiquity, 10 million years at least in age.

1299
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:56,420
