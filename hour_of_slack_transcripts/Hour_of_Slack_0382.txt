I've got a beautiful state here.
You just won't feel anything from this point on.
In the way of working on your mouth or any other part of your body that you might work with.
You just won't feel anything from this point on.
Just stay relaxed like that. Make sure at all times that your muscles won't work.
And you just won't feel a thing.
I've got a beautiful state here.
You just won't feel anything from this point on.
I just want you to tell me just how good you feel.
I like this.
So, I suppose I'll show you how to get loose all over, relax all over so that you don't feel anything. Would you like that?
Yes, I would like that.
All right. Take a good long deep breath.
And then gentlemen, you could make a test and you would find that she has complete anesthesia.
Does she ever.
She said she doesn't want Joe to fly into the moon.
Not so slow.
She proved she can fly.
She isfree from all the stress and anxiety.


Oh.
Your child.
He is weak.
Oh!
It's Okay.
Father means all good things to those who wait.
I did.
Tottened your nipples, didn't I?
Love your suit.
People will say we're in love.
That was good.
Your histograms are showing, Doctor.
What does he do with this?
Madness.
Tell me his name, Doctor.
Precious!
Are you up there?
Precious?
Darling, how are you all right?
And you don't know what pain is!
Was she a great big fat person?
Yes, she was a big girl, sir.
I'm having an old famine for dinner.
We just cut off our girlfriend with a chainsaw.
No, we didn't.
That's right.
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
Who's laughing now?
I'm not laughing!

Gotcha, didn't I, you little sucker?
This is not a toy.

So, we suggest that you turn off any device not appropriate to your lifestyle.

Sub cathvari.

you are now in full control of your subcaفي hours of

So, have a good time.

We have assumed control.
Yes, we always assume control.
And we have it.
May we assume control of you?
Ah, but what about this man?
Oh!
Not the killer king, the master, loading.
Oh, a mother of the mainly hyena!
Ah, that's an accident!
What about your sister?
Me too.
And nobody knows that he will kill us!
I had to hunt pretty hard to find any good drugs.
No, no, no.
And it's what I want to talk to you about this evening.
I am honest, convincing, and highly erroneous.
Let's face it, my hunt hasn't deteriorated.
It deteriorated in its implementation.
This led to my failure.
Much has been said about my management style.
But I can tell you, I've put in long hours for the nation's benefit,
creating troubles or tragedies, sketchy reports, erroneous statements,
thousands of documents, secret bank accounts, and diverted funds,
so that those can be available to me on a continuing basis.
I've been a victim of the
Why do those subgeniuses keep making fun of poor President Reagan?
You ever wonder that?
Poor man's been out of office for longer than some of our listeners have been alive.
That's probably not true.
And yet, to this day,
people still like to cut up and edit and make him sound like a senile old thot.
And while we all know that's not the case,
well, before that,
a little bit from Silence of the Lambs,
but also a little bit from our good friend Ash,
the hero of Evil Dead 2,
and the Army of Darkness,
which we've seen twice already.
It's so good.
It's...
I tell you,
it's the best Three Stooges movie I've seen in a long time.
And I hope you'll see it, too, before it goes on its way.
Tonight's show,
it's looking like it's going to be another subgenius American music party.
I'm just about convinced of it.
And...
Laura.
So stay tuned.
Before we get...
Well, no, I guess we'll get started now.
No.
No, no, no.
Announcements or cards or anything to play with.
There's nothing to stop us from starting the Hour of Slack right now with...
an old favorite.
Thank you.
Welcome to our final segment of the Song sans Trauma.
It's a big one from the Gayle醒 Life,
and we've it with Keith Brown,

Hello to...

Bye.
And of course that was the fine, fine song, Hurdy Gurdy Man by Donovan,
performed by those certain surfers of which you've no doubt heard.
And now...
If you don't love me anymore, she will now often postulate,
if you did, you would give me one now and again,
so that I would not have to rely on that rancid Pakistani for my orgasms.
I will give you one after you have got me my supper,
I now usually scream, but not before,
as you understand making her bang contingent on the arrival of my supper.
Taste of bologna, Tony, everybody eats when they come to my house.
Do you like cherries?
Well, as a matter of fact, yes, I do. I like cherries.
I got a message for you.
Kill your television.
What do you mean it's not in the computer?
I want you to eat.



Oy, you little prometjag Typ, put your pants in and ...
I'm gonna kiss you.
Are you on fire?
He gave leave for two minutes.
He fucking fucking negatives ultimately.
I wear the dog control that never raises and rips.
The princess squeezes, drapes you on the door and putting kiss.
But when you be wearing them, I am not leaving you.
The flesh will not be tearing, but the tail will be my own.
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.
This one's warm and balcony and this one's warm and floor.
When the senator's decapitating the residential wall.
All men's senators splashing in the mud.
Talks are having someone screaming in the mud.
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.
Now it's raining and it's pouring on the hill of junior glory.
The constable is swinging from the chains.
For the dead there is no story, no memory, no blame.
The shop blew and tomorrow it's the same.
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.
In the Colosseum, call the back to see him.
In the Colosseum tonight.
Back slowly, I can see him.
Boys and women digging into the favorite mud.
The dark horse and the great glory to the jailer in the wind.
It's always much more sporting when there's families and kids.
The madness of the crowd is in the campus.
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.
No justice here, no liberty, no reason to complain.
And no cause to take the sweetest taste of blood.
And greetings from the nation.
And they shake their hands in time.
They're taking their own patients.
The vultures take their hide.
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.
In the Colosseum, in the Colosseum, in the Colosseum tonight.
In the Colosseum, tonight.
And I'm gonna ask the power and the joy of the power of the living King of Kings.
And a lot of you here, you spot mind and musical people say,
King of Kings, there must be Elvis.
No, I'm gonna ask for the power, I'm gonna ask for the glory.
I'm gonna now tell you a story.
I'm gonna drive out the demons' friends.
I'm gonna ask you to help this madness end.
Come on, Franklin, have a story.
Come on now, share the glory.
Do you feel the power?
Come on, put out the negativity.
Come on, let's do this.
I'm gonna ask the power and the joy of the living King of Kings.


The lies all green and buzzing,
They give a dream of despair.
Prisoners grumble and kiss their clothes,
And scratch their married hair.
A tiny little light from a window,
A hundred yards away.
It's all they ever get to know
About the regular life in the day.
And it stinks so bad,
The stones been choking,
And the wicked ladies' thoughts.
In the room where the giant fire of a work suit,
The torture never stops.
The torture never stops.
The torture,
The torture,

The torture never stops.
The torture never stops.
Slime and rot and rats and snuff,
And vomit on the floor.
Ooh!
Fifty ugly-looking soldiers, man,
Fifty ugly-looking soldiers, man,
Holding spears by the iron door.
Ooh!
The knives and spikes and guns and the likes,
And every tool of pain.
A sinister little midget,
With a bucket in her mouth,
A sinister little midget,
With a bucket in her mouth,
A sinister little midget,
With a bucket in her mouth.
Where the blood goes down the drain.
And it stinks so bad,
The stones been choking,
And the wicked ladies' thoughts.
In the room where the giant fire of a work suit,
The torture never stops.
The torture never stops.
The torture,
The torture,
The torture never stops.

Life's already buzzing
And it's catching up the burst.
An evil Grimstein is steaming big
In the chamber right near there.
He eats the snuff,
And the chatter's first.
The loins and groins are soonded,
To disperse
His carvings start
His well-behaved
His hands and jaws
All their fingers
All men be
All men be
All men be
All men be
They will be
I'm the sound of the year
in the wind
In the wind
I'm the sound of the year
in the wind
In the wind
I'm locked up in the dark
We're done, Bob.
I wanna buy the cave paintings, Bob.
I'm gonna build a diamond.
A diamond.
First.
So.
And it stinks so bad.
It's cold, it's been choking.
It's been destroyed.
In the night of the iron sausage.
Where the torture never stops.
The torture never stops.
The torture.
The torture.
The torture never stops.
And speaking of torture, how about this other song?
No, I wish we could.
That track goes on to feature Mr. Zappa
performing a version of Lonesome Couch.
Cowboy Bert.
With new lyrics relating to Mr.
I think we could safely call him Mr.
Jimmy Swaggart now.
And just not that kind of a show yet.
And I can't help it.
There's nothing I can do about that.
Everywhere else no one talks about Jong Ultra.
Speaking now is the idea of Morningstar's

First.
Yes.
Are you with me?
All right, today is Wednesday.
How do you do, Mr. Jeff?
And Jerry, good to have just us on.
No delays.
Impossible.
Well, remember that I can't say late tonight.
No excuses.
No delays.
Let's send him a personalized letter.
Slowly.
I'll write a new paragraph for our standard one.
Then I'll have to retie him a whole new letter.
The work is really piling up today.
I can't win.
This takes time.
Too much time.
We're getting behind.
I've been on the phone all morning trying to get the figures verbally.
I can't help you at all.
Sorry.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.
Why not?
I don't know.
I just can't.
I simply can't.
Mm-hmm.
I can't do it.
I can't do it.



I can't do it.
There's something special when you smile.
I am sick and deranged.
Can I bring my friend to tea?
I've got a weird heart.
Can I put the tube in the baby's head?
Where's my liquid paper?
Put your face in the pool.
You can't get part.
I'm a writer, and I drink a lot of coffee.
So I want my coffee to have that rich, full-bodied flavor.
My wife knows this.
Now, I'd never hit my wife or lock her in the onion cellar if she didn't make a perfect cup of coffee.
But she knows that I demand that true coffee taste.
And that's why I only allow one brand in our house.
Better coffee than this, there isn't.
I'm putting another pot of coffee on the sink.
No, the stove.
I'm putting another pot of coffee on the sink.
I'm putting another pot of coffee on the sink.
Okay, we're going to talk about the king, but, you know, I've got a question first.
Maybe you guys can help me with this question.
And you know, it's the king of what?
I don't know.
The king of what?
I don't know.
I don't know either.
Well, if he was a king, he must have been king of something important, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah.
He must have been king of something important.
But the king of what?
King of kings.
You think so?
Well.
caring is pretty important
you think he could have been the king of caring?
he could have been the king of happiness
you think so? I don't know, well
he didn't care very much about anything except being king
so he must not have been king of that
but you think maybe he was king of happiness?
maybe
well, I don't know, maybe so
uh
but you know, he really wasn't very happy
so he must not have been king of that
he must not have been king of happiness
so I don't know
he was king of something but king of what?
I don't know
I don't know
I don't know
uh
His goodness
Watch out





I don't wanna be a tyrant
or a stater
No, I don't wanna be a man
for life ain't the kind you want
No, no
Baby, let me be
around you
every night
Run your fingers
through my hair
and pull me real tight
Oh, let me be
around you
Yo, Jetty Bear
You're dead
Oh, I don't wanna be a tiger
for those tigers play to rock
You know I don't wanna be a lion
for life ain't the kind you want
I just want to be
your Jetty Bear
Oh, yeah
Put a chain around my neck
Believe me
Anywhere
Just let me be
your Jetty Bear
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah






I know how it works
But it's my choice
Get it
I know

Don't be afraid
ever
Don't even even think
when you're gonna need me
teddy bear.

Hello?
Hello?
Welcome back.
Welcome back to the Trevor and 오늠 Societal,
and the next episode of encoursing platforms.
The
smiles to be pasted on over the panic, the glances to be interpreted, and worst, the conversation.
Be this good, I never grow tired of, and that's important because after I put in a long day at the typewriter, I look forward to that special time of evening when all the children are in bed, and I sit with my wife, and I have that one last cup of the day.
Here are six more cups of coffee.
Oh, I dropped them.
Oh, here's one that didn't break.
That's not a cup of coffee.
Not coffee?
Cup of coffee?
That's an ashtray, dear. Now hand me the coffee.
Here.
That's not the coffee. That's a baby's block.
No, to your left. No, to your other left. No.
Here's coffee.
No, that's a magazine.
Three hundred!
Three hundred women in three hours told me, boy, forget the flowers.
I was just wondering, do they have blood banks in England?
No.
But they have a Liverpool.
I'm going to the hospital.
Oh, no.
Hey, Charlie, for a filth! If you don't get down, I'm going to touch you with a ribbon.
No!
You've got to burp, Charlie. It's the only way.
Hello, people. This is the Reverend. Now, I know that many of you are not blessed with perfect vision.
That explains why you're listening to this filth instead of reading a good book.
I wonder what my credit rating is.
It is exactly what you make it.
Hmm.
If I pay all these bills, I'm going to be a rich man.

If I don't pay all these bills, what do we live on?
What would happen, I wonder, if I, well, if I just didn't pay?
That's no solution.
Welcome to the club, Jim.
I've just got to have it.
Have more.
I've just got to have it.
And enjoy more.
If this baby ever leaves.
Have more.
I've just got to have it.
And enjoy more.
I've just got to have it.
Have more.
I've just got to have it.
And enjoy more.
Tempting, isn't it?
But if you're careless, see what happens.



There's still a responsibility.
The baby needs only a few more steps, decide whether your bill goes out otherwise.
There you are.
You've only got 25 days up for this Step Resources CPA Training.
or maybe up to the last one.

You just can't change it.
You only have a few.
