00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,740
Thank you.

2
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:07,220
Thank you.

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,420
Thank you.

4
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,300
Thank you.

5
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,700
Thank you.

6
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,840
Thank you.

7
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:41,380
Thank you.

8
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,940
Thank you.

9
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,880
Thank you.

10
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,160
Thank you.

11
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,020
Thank you.

12
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,820
Thank you.

13
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:30,480
Thank you.

14
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,720
Thank you.

15
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,620
Thank you.

16
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,380
It's sad to say

17
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:07,980
That the steering wheel went fast

18
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,140
The road carries us away

19
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,420
You know, dear friends,

20
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:21,360
there's nothing like being strapped

21
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:25,020
by a big strapping woman

22
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,100
using her big red

23
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,780

33
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:50,900
a

34
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:55,420
Dobbs had enough you dull and thick-headed lads to man the barricades

35
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:57,880
and it was an easy time for a revolution

36
00:09:57,880 --> 00:09:58,280
you

37
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:25,820

47
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,780
yeah

48
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Excuse the man, I was really big a party

49
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,700
I did it on the roof, cause I'm dancing with

50
00:10:55,700 --> 00:11:02,500
Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention please?

51
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:07,640
When we leave this area in a moment, be sure to take along all your belongings

52
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,060
Including your imagination

53
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,540
Kill Bob!

54
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,980
I know what you want

55
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,880
You wanna kill me

56
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,320
What about slack?

57
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,220
That's your key phrase

58
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,860
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it

59
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,720
And now, the self genius

60
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,120
Our own slack

61
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:47,240
Slack

62
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:47,340
Slack

63
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:47,620
Slack

64
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,480
Slack

65
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,500
Slack

66
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:55,640
Slack

67
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:56,900
Slack

68
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:58,660
Slack

69
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,620
Slack

70
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,300
Years ago, I started out broke, washing dishes

71
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,420
And got promoted to be a busboy to support 10 brothers and sisters and a mom and a dad

72
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,580
Things are different now

73
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,700
I credit the whole thing to

74
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,360
Bob

75
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,440
B

76
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,260
O

77
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:17,120
B

78
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:25,020
B-O-B, B-O-B, B-O-B, B-O-B.

79
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,560
Well, I know you're not used to seeing me without my partner, Bob.

80
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,580
Bob is in jail, and he's doing quite well.

81
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,760
Been to the Betty Ford Clinic, he's different now, but they actually...

82
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,020
Imagine that, you kill your whole family just because the devil tells you, you know?

83
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,140
Then afterwards you go back to the devil, you go, yes, devil, I did as you instructed.

84
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,700
I killed my family, and then I chopped them up and put them in a duffel bag.

85
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:44,720
Here they are in a duffel bag.

86
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,000
I'll be burying them tonight in the shallow grave by the side of the railroad track.

87
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,400
As you have commanded, oh, Lord, host of the hoary netherworld.

88
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,340
Then the devil pulls off a mask.

89
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,040
It's me, Bob!

90
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,820
Bob works in a mysterious way.

91
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,380
Here, tell us a spirit-filled revival.

92
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:14,580
It wouldn't exist.

93
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:15,900
The stage looks like this.

94
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,560
Blood, broken cameras.

95
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:25,800
Man, if I really wanted to do time control, I'd smash my radio show here.

96
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,900
Oh, and there goes the radio show.

97
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:39,420
But that's okay, because, uh, welcome, dear friends.

98
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:42,280
This is Hour of Slack number eight.

99
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,440
The sub-inspect was the tactics genius.

100
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:45,680
The convention ends.

101
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:45,960
Sh-

102
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:52,960
On and off the road for Bob.

103
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:58,860
We forgot why we came here.

104
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:04,580
We have quit all of our jobs.

105
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:10,480
Like a headlight, I didn't care.

106
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:14,620
He has lit the stage.

107
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,140
He's a great guy.

108
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:22,260
And he's smiling at us now.

109
00:14:24,020 --> 00:14:28,460
On and off the road, here's Bob.

110
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,780
He's our bull god.

111
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:36,020
We are his town.

112
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:38,900
We are his town.

113
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,260
That hurt, Bob.

114
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,480
Bob, where are you?

115
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,240
Stop it, Bob.

116
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:44,860
Please.

117
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:44,860


118
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,260
Please.

119
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:47,780
Bob?

120
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:47,780


121
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:47,780


122
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:54,600
Now, I was trying to think what my specific testimonial would be, because I have so many of them in my life.

123
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,100
I was acquainted with Bob in 1981, thanks to an article in Weirdo Magazine.

124
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:09,900
And then in 1982, I made the mistake of actually going to the Church of the Subgenius Convention in Chicago as a reporter for my radio station.

125
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,520
And, uh, well, I like to say it's just that I've never looked back.

126
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:22,120
But the single greatest thing that happened perhaps in our lives, my daughters and mine, this is my daughter Sylvia, and Reverend Bleepo Abernathy, incidentally.

127
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:22,400
Yeah!

128
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,760
Hey, Bleepo!

129
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:26,220
Of the, uh, of the, uh, well, you know, anyway.

130
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:32,220
Uh, so, uh, we were having some trouble getting my daughter toilet trained, you know?

131
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:32,940
I mean, frankly.

132
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:34,620
I mean, she was doing real good.

133
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,820
She was doing all right with her diapers and stuff, but we really wanted to get her interested in the potty.

134
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:41,960
We kept putting the potty out, and everyone knew about it.

135
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:42,540
You know?

136
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:46,120
And it was like, we just kind of tried to keep saying, hey, it's the potty.

137
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:47,420
It's just like Mommy and Daddy is, hey.

138
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,420
And she just wasn't interested.

139
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:56,900
And finally after, you know, it was one of those days when, like, we went through, like, a whole bunch of them and stuff, a whole bunch of diapers and stuff.

140
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:04,300
Uh, I, I, I, the potty was sitting there, and she was, she was lying around without a diaper.

141
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:05,680
We were trying to encourage her to use it.

142
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:11,660
And just out of sheer desperation, out of just something to do to remind me that there was something better in life than this.

143
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:12,500
.

144
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:16,040
I put on the subgenius video on the TV.

145
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,640
And my daughter immediately looked up at the TV.

146
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,460
She had never seen it before, because it's usually the sort of thing I put on after hours, you know.

147
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:30,580
And she looked up, and I'd never really talked to her about Bob, because, you know, there's a lot of funny things in our house.

148
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,820
And it's sort of like Bob is just sort of one of them.

149
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,160
We don't have any, like, Bob posters.

150
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,700
We're not that obsessive about it.

151
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,380
He's just sort of a background icon.

152
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:37,920
Anyway.

153
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,260
.

154
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,520
Anyway, we, we, we put him on the TV.

155
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,840
And my daughter looked up, and she said, Bob.

156
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:45,880
.

157
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:54,880
And, and then she, she, she immediately ran over to the potty and sat down and went, ah.

158
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:55,620
.

159
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,340
And that was it.

160
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,020
From then on, it was like, time to go to the potty?

161
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,000
She said, put on Bob.

162
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:03,500
And we did.

163
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:07,320
And, and, and so just parents, if you need the potty train, that's the best potty train around.

164
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:08,960
Anyway, Sylvia, I'm sorry.

165
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:09,960
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

166
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:10,480
.

167
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,700
You want to say Bob?

168
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:12,960
Say Bob.

169
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,040
Oh, she's tired.

170
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,540
Sorry.

171
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,380
Anyway.

172
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:17,500
Help me somebody.

173
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:18,160
Praise Bob.

174
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:18,680
.

175
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:23,500
And that toilet training videotape is available for only $40.

176
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,640
Praise Reverend Bleepo Abernathy.

177
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:29,120
For those of you who are regular Hour of Slack listeners, that's him.

178
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:30,720
He's the guy who says.

179
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:31,820
.

180
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:37,120
And now, the subgenius, our Slack.

181
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:38,100
.

182
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:38,620
.

183
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:38,620


184
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:38,620


185
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:38,620


186
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:38,620


187
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:38,620


188
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:38,620


189
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:38,620


190
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,440
.

191
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:39,440


192
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:39,520
.

193
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:39,760
.

194
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:39,820

199
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,440
.

200
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:44,440


201
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,560
Yes dear friends, well, I guess it's time to do credits.

202
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,440
Little bit of credits.

203
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:58,420
The first song that you heard, the sort of cosmic song, those who came before was from

204
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,760
Peter Stensel.

205
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:04,600
He's now in California but used to be with ZXQ Universe, which we may or may not hear

206
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,220
later on tonight.

207
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,020
We get a lot of great tapes from them.

208
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:10,080
They're a comedy outfit in Minneapolis.

209
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:10,460
.

210
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:20,460
comedy you'll see and then the the new hymn on and off the road to bob by the dobstown bleeding

211
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:28,780
sore castrated boys choir led by reverend bleepo abernathy who you also heard there just then

212
00:18:28,780 --> 00:18:33,240
the attention off of p for a little while right herein is the birth of the psychic overload

213
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:39,680
technique of brain inversion pioneered by master control now begin volume inversion control

214
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:46,060
programming all you need is a simple light source a light bulb may be a bit too bright a candle it

00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:50,280
has been found through repeated experimentation is the best well this amazing view of your own

216
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:57,460
gray matter why is it so odd that the eye bulbs that the occupiers go back lying only a few

217
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:04,600
inches away from the human brain itself under most conditions to view this astounding repertory of

218
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:09,500
all human knowledge and experience that's neat it's it's mine it's cool it's after

219
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:09,660
you've seen the video and you've seen the video and you've seen the video and you've seen the

220
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,100
initial até

221
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:10,100

party

223
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,540
state

224
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,360
of this

225
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,200
pres поч coffin

226
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:14,840
about

227
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,060
a bitch

228
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:38,000
it is your brain which all the 산

229
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,620
лег

230
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:48,320
So everything that you think that you feel takes your poor brain to finally make it real.

231
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,240
Your poor, old, beat-up, stupid brain.

232
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:54,660
Well, it may seem old, stupid, and beat-up, and it might even be, but it's the only one you've got.

233
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:57,100
When I hold the candle like this, you can see a patch back here.

234
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,440
Somebody patch this thing.

235
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:58,840
Stop it.

236
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,920
You're fouling up the experiment.

237
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:00,960
You're not supposed to do that.

238
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:08,780
First of all, in order to achieve the mystic simplicity, you have to hike for 70 miles into the remote wilderness.

239
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,220
I did that.

240
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,820
And find a hermit's cabin.

241
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,620
I did that.

242
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:13,200
And no hermit can be there.

243
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,120
If there is, you have to bump him off or something.

244
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,400
So, you know, you're there all alone in the remote woods.

245
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,620
Have you ever seen a hermit crab?

246
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:21,860
Have you ever seen a crabby hermit?

247
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,520
For the secular audience, have you ever seen a hermit crab in a crabby hermit's cabin?

248
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,680
Put away that hermit's hermit's record.

249
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,280
I'm trying to do something here.

250
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:38,120
Now, when the full darkness of the night overcomes you, when the clouds obscure the moon,

251
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,060
and the stars...

252
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,600
The stars are hidden under a blanket of mucoid cloud.

253
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:46,860
Then and only then you experience the true darkness necessary to see your own brain.

254
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,060
Or you could try it in a cave.

255
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:54,780
We are going to play the Herman Herman's record back and see what subliminal messages are hidden within the ground.

256
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:54,860


257
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:56,900
Kill mommy.

258
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:57,840
Kill mommy.

259
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:58,740
Kill mommy.

260
00:20:58,840 --> 00:20:59,420
Kill mommy.

261
00:20:59,480 --> 00:20:59,940
Kill mommy.

262
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,320
Kill mommy.

263
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:00,860
Kill mommy.

264
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,700
That's what kids are for.

265
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:09,040
If you listen to this subliminal trash, you are guaranteeing yourself a minor...

266
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:12,120
...experience here to unheard of in the United States of America.

267
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,180
Such things should not be allowed in our modern-a-go-go society.

268
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:19,280
And which anybody that can press plastic can influence the mindless millions.

269
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:25,740
This is a crime against humanity and should not be tolerated under any such circumstances.

270
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:31,220
Well, you know, there's always a lot of religious and silly opposition to any great idea,

271
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,600
but this is something that's so simple, so human, so all-embracing,

272
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:38,640
that it can't really be suppressed even by the solens of this self...

273
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,040
...important radio program.

274
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:42,340
You mean to tell me even if Super Thing comes, we...

275
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,960
...this radio program continues?

276
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,740
Well, I...

277
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:49,900
You know, that was the word of the assassinated Nen's master, Nenslo.

278
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,020
Whom we must always...

279
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,820
We're showing him here on the slide, you can see on, uh, Monitor X.

280
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,620
Here's Nenslo opening the...

281
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,140
...men...

282
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,320
...the Nenta Life Stance...

283
00:21:58,320 --> 00:21:59,180
No, Third Eye, I see.

284
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:02,060
I've waited for years for an electrical storm of this magnitude.

285
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,320
The fury of the elements in combination shall electrify my creation and bring it to shambling light.

286
00:22:09,220 --> 00:22:10,080
Oh, there goes the...

287
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,020
You clumsy fool!

288
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,380
Oh!

289
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:12,660
...the front of, uh, your place, Hal.

290
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,200
My tibia!

291
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:15,840
You don't empty that spittoon on my operating table.

292
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:17,960
Nobody can hang onto the table.

293
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:22,740
Now, take that belly bandeau off my cigar and light me up another Havana Panatella.

294
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,160
While I relate the tale I call...

295
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:30,100
...Too Much Fun in the Sun, or Sun-Tan Timmy.

296
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,920
Meanwhile, back in the control center...

297
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,300
Yeah, Sun-Tan Timmy was someone who a lot of people didn't appreciate.

298
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:35,040
Sun-Tan Timmy.

299
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:38,880
But I had an ex-garden gene in my mind that told me a thing or two about how...

300
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,440
...how humans actually operate.

301
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:46,100
...how he was actually from Mars, the red planet, millions of miles from the Earth.

302
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:49,780
They always made fun of the way that my bangs hang out all the way over my forehead.

303
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,560
But what they didn't know was underneath my bangs I have a third eye.

304
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,180
And I also have eyes in the back of my head.

305
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:00,680
If they only knew the F-E-X-P-E-X-P-X-X-

306
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:04,940
Whatever that word is that means that you got powers far beyond that of mortal men.

307
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,620
Hey, why don't you get a regulation haircut, huh?

308
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,820
Well, excuse me.

309
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,000
I gotta go take an E-S-P.

310
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,620
Oh, yeah, let's see a giant.

311
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,520
Earthly dogs and cats hated Little Timmy.

312
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:22,240
They knew, as unseeing adults and even as un-contemporaries didn't, that he was not of this Earth.

313
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,500
Yeah, well, I didn't care for them much either.

314
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,380
And more than a poodle or two...

315
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:27,520
Little Timmy, would you...

316
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,720
...spooted spontaneous flames because they didn't look at me the right way.

317
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:31,000
Not Little Pee-Pee, no, no!

318
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,700
I can assure you that.

319
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:36,340
And you know, I don't care very much for teachers that give me a lot of homework either.

320
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,180
Little Timmy, why haven't you...

321
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:38,880


322
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:44,460
And then there was that one or two foster parents that didn't quite give me quite enough allowance.

323
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:45,260
Come here, Timmy, I...

324
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,500
Oh!

325
00:23:46,260 --> 00:23:47,120
It's okay, Timmy.

326
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,200
You're real good.

327
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,520
You're real good, Timmy.

328
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:49,880
Real good.

329
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:52,680
And then there was that patrolman that tried to tell me I'd run away from home.

330
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,180
Now, now, what is all this, young man?

331
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,780
I think you'd better come with me down to the juvenile...

332
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:56,780


333
00:23:57,300 --> 00:23:57,660
Ah!

334
00:23:59,540 --> 00:23:59,900
Yeah.

335
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,840
And then they had the nerve to call me spoiled.

336
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:05,160
Well, let me tell you a thing or two.

337
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:06,280
He didn't smell too good, either.

338
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,580
You know once he was spoiled.

339
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:07,920
Spoiled, yeah.

340
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:08,600
Where was he at birthday?

341
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,380
When we needed him to discipline little Timmy and bring him into line with the rest of the nation.

342
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:12,700
Timmy, wake up.

343
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,840
You're having a nightmare.

344
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,400
There's no place like...

345
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:15,780
It's all a dream.

346
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,080
...the cellar.

347
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:17,340
Ah!

348
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:22,480
Mommy, I thought I told you never to wake me up when I'm asleep.

349
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:23,220
Oh, my.

350
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,020
I didn't...

351
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:33,060
We will continue with the adventures of Timmy after this important station announcement.

352
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,260
That's Timmy!

353
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,180
No, Timmy!

354
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,520
You're listening to KCSU, Stafford.

355
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:39,980
Another exciting line of images...

356
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:40,000
No, you're not.

357
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,220
You're listening to KUAN.

358
00:24:41,220 --> 00:24:41,900
No, you're not.

359
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:42,860
...to the kind of your brain.

360
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,000
Patent protected.

361
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,120
Yo, Mama, you're listening to the subgenius show.

362
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,600
Pocket-a-pocket-a-queep, pocket-a-pocket-a-queep.

363
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:50,120
Hey, brother man.

364
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:51,360
What is happening?

365
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,240
Or what is it?

366
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,000
No, what it is...

367
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,580
Far out, dude.

368
00:24:55,020 --> 00:25:01,640
It's time for some psychedelic, rock-a-groovadelic moments on the sexiest, hippest, weirdest,

369
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,280
wildest, wiggiest, and wackiest show on the air.

370
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,620
Indeed, what Tim was experiencing was the eye of the hurricane.

371
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:08,500
This is the eye of the hurricane.

372
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:08,640
This is it.

373
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:13,880
So, if you haven't taken the necessary precautions, you have just a few minutes left to do so.

374
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,900
Stay calm.

375
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,680
No need to panic.

376
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,500
But, uh, be sensible.

377
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,880
Make common sense, uh, moves and...

378
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:22,840
Who is it?

379
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:24,200
J.R.

380
00:25:24,220 --> 00:25:24,620
Dobbs?

381
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,500
Who is this?

382
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,320
J.R.

383
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:29,800
Dobbs?

384
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,340
And who, who do you need?

385
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:33,580
Uh, Reverend Stang?

386
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,380
Um...

387
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:36,660
Uh, I'm...

388
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:38,440
I'm...

389
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,440


390
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,440


391
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,440


392
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,440


393
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,440


394
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,440


395
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,440


396
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,440


397
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:38,440


398
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,840
Poor Xander.

399
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,820
Reverend Stang doesn't want to talk to you right now.

400
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,440
Yeah, no kidding.

401
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:47,520
Um...

402
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,660
Yes, dear friends.

403
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,120
Okay, I've got to do some real tape juggling here.

404
00:25:52,540 --> 00:25:53,060
Uh...

405
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:54,680
First off, first off.

406
00:25:56,280 --> 00:26:03,540
Long stretch of, uh, amazingness there was, uh, from the original Subgenius show, KPFA,

407
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:07,960
or actually KCSU, I think that one was, Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence.

408
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,280
Father Joe Mama sounding a little bit like Boojie Boy.

409
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,820
But then there's these phone calls.

410
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:19,300
Now, being sacred scribe as I am,

411
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:22,940
it has its perks and its benefits and kickbacks and so forth,

412
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,380
but it also has its drawbacks.

413
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,620
And one of the worst drawbacks is the telephone,

414
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:30,220
the horror that goes on on the phone.

415
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,180
Sometimes the phone won't quit ringing,

416
00:26:34,180 --> 00:26:39,440
and sometimes it's not prank calls, it's crank calls.

417
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,860
We do get calls from crazy people.

418
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:46,100
And you just heard a little recording of my son picking up,

419
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,440
catching one of those calls.

420
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:51,220
Notice the guy said he was J.R. Dobbs.

421
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:54,060
Just don't worry about it, you know.

422
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,580
He's like, you know, it's just, you know,

423
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:03,000
going on about the hydra and fight teams and stuff.

424
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:07,940
Yeah, that's the fun thing.

425
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:11,360
So, friends, you've had your lesson now.

426
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,940
That's how not to impress the subgenius foundation.

427
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:17,640
Don't call us up telling you you're the Lord.

428
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:19,440
Prove it!

429
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,800
Knows all, smells all.

430
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:23,400
Though I am dead, I am now reborn.

431
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,040
Can whiff read a stench at 30 paces.

432
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,220
What's that meaty smell?

433
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:31,440
He can taste you through his pipe.

434
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:34,120
Then the distance between the left and right speakers

435
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:34,160
is the distance between the left and right speakers.

436
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:34,800
There's no difference.

437
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,620
When you stand at this position, you will observe...

438
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:40,900
Bob knows who is true and who is untrue.

439
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,740
And who is pink!

440
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,460
Somewhat more...

441
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,660
Oh, my gosh, you're in the spotlight!

442
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:49,220
The spotlight of Bob! His third eye's just opening up!

443
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:51,500
Somewhat more terrifying than Santa Claus,

444
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:54,220
all the more serious because he packs heat.

445
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:57,780
Bob is kind of like Santa Claus with a twist.

446
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,340
Kind of like Santa Claus with a mean evil streak.

447
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:01,880
I'm so sorry.

448
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,820
Would you like to go out on a date with me?

449
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:05,020
Sanctuary!

450
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,160
Sanctuary!

451
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:07,880
Quasimodo!

452
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:10,180
25 next month!

453
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:11,540
Coming!

454
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:12,800
Notre Dame!

455
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,900
Call me Notre Dame 624.

456
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,480
Brian, we've been trying to save your soul.

457
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,980
If anything, we may rape your mind.

458
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,780
But you guys think you're just too smart

459
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,620
because your mom and dad are supporting you

460
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,120
while you're here listening to this radio station.

461
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:26,500
What do they believe in?

462
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:26,500


463
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:26,920
What do they believe in?

464
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,640
A mysterious character named Bob.

465
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,400
Yes.

466
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,160
My mother is Jewish.

467
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,160
My father is Catholic.

468
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,380
I was brought up a Catholic,

469
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,140
but with a Jewish background.

470
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,500
When I went to confession,

471
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,100
I always brought a lawyer with me.

472
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,000
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

473
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,500
I think you know Mr. Cohen here.

474
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:43,360
I've already got airtime.

475
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:44,400
Oh, yeah?

476
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,740
I've already got airtime.

477
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,120
Yeah, why don't you say something?

478
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:47,700
I've already got airtime.

479
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:49,360
You little pink boy, shut up!

480
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:52,180
And it was hot in that bar

481
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:54,160
that the devivals were in,

482
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:56,880
so we all had to shed as many clothes as possible.

483
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:59,280
Sister Mary, Sister Terry Terry,

484
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,100
and me and many other people

485
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,280
all ended up performing in our underwear,

486
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,100
so it was visually arresting.

487
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:08,860
When I looked at the video,

488
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,780
I couldn't believe it.

489
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,340
Four babe preachers, dear friends.

490
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:16,560
It did not look like the subgenius devivals of the past.

491
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:19,240
In fact, I would venture to say

492
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,100
that the new subgeniuses

493
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,420
are getting a vastly different impression of the church

494
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:25,120
than in the old days.

495
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:30,140
Do you dare to wear your underwear on your head

496
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:33,080
as Father Joe Mama has exhorted you to?

497
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:35,580
Anyway, it was a party, dear friends.

498
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:36,160
We did abilities.

499
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:41,840
That's what the little marks represent on that God knob.

500
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:44,280
Anyway, we did what's said to do.

501
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,320
We did exactly what that man Bob said to do.

502
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,200
We had diamond cutters with shiny heads,

503
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,060
and the swinging meat Jesus was blessing us

504
00:29:54,060 --> 00:29:56,160
all the way on down the line.

505
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,760
We were, we warriors, dear friends,

506
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,060
were dancing while proudly displaying our purple hearts.

507
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,180
You might say, and that was just the guys.

508
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,180
I guess we'll see you don't ease to the show.

509
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,500
Oh, I should mention that for, you know, on the X day,

510
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,820
she shall regain her powers

511
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:19,080
and her other helmet horn light will resume blinking.

512
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:21,020
And on that day,

513
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,800
you'd better hope you're on her good side, boys.

514
00:30:24,340 --> 00:30:25,560
Oh, pretty baby.

515
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:30,680
I got the fun, I got the fun,

516
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:31,600
I got the fun for you.

517
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,580
I found the fun.

518
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:35,360
Closed my eyes and we try it again.

519
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:39,400
The song, the rhythm, the rhythm.

520
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:46,680
We practiced the song.

521
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:49,060
We practiced every more day the same way

522
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,460
every time in the best song.

523
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:18,860
We'd like to do that one first, just to get it out of the way.

524
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:44,900
We were born to this life.

525
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:50,360
We were destined to find it right.

526
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:56,040
This is her, and this is our fate.

527
00:31:56,920 --> 00:32:01,420
We're singing this song so you can hear it.

528
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:05,820
We are going to save the universe.

529
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,480
We are going to save the universe.

530
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:11,280
We are going to save the universe.

531
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,680
This time!

532
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,240
Full grown.

533
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,840
We are grown up men.

534
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,920
We are all past.

535
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:42,820
Age of reasoning.

536
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:45,500
This is our mission.

537
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,220
This is our time.

538
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,420
It's obvious.

539
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,740
Yet you still ask.

540
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:57,860
We are going to save the universe.

541
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,660
We are going to save the universe.

542
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,520
We are going to save the universe.

543
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,280
Woo!

544
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:06,460
Yeah!

545
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:06,700
Let's go!

546
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,520
Let's go!

547
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,400
Let's get to it!

548
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,680
Hey!

549
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:55,240
I'm asked if the Ferris wheel was broken.

550
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,240


551
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,240


552
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,240


553
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:55,680
Buddy, how's everyone doing there?

554
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,200
Relieve yourself.

555
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:58,200


556
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:01,580


557
00:34:18,060 --> 00:34:19,220
Don't you worry

558
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,960
Don't have no fear

559
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,720
Forget or die

560
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,560
Because the end is near

561
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:30,300
We can't fail

562
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,120
We've got the nerve

563
00:34:34,180 --> 00:34:35,640
We're in control

564
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:38,780
And we are more than a band

565
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:43,140
We are going to save the universe

566
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:45,840
We are going to save the universe

567
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,660
We are going to save the universe

568
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,980
This time!

569
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,900
In a little Ziploc baggie

570
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,100
The whole universe

571
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,440
We got it all saved

572
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,300
We have found that there are certain forms

573
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:16,700
Of a very advanced technology

574
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,020
Which involve energizing with forces

575
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:21,620
That we don't normally associate

576
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:24,440
With energizing machinery or equipment

577
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:27,060
They have found that the sudden dissipation

578
00:35:27,060 --> 00:35:29,120
Of the life force out of the human body

579
00:35:29,120 --> 00:35:30,280
Can be used to create

580
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,520
And be used for various other means

581
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:35,660
And this is part of the really big conspiracy

582
00:35:35,660 --> 00:35:36,880
That I love to hate

583
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,980
Basically you must envision the universe

584
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,200
As a food chain

585
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,780
In which different levels of energy

586
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,420
Are consumed by more advanced forms

587
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:47,740
That eat the forms below them

588
00:35:47,740 --> 00:35:50,080
Whether it's animals eating grass

589
00:35:50,080 --> 00:35:51,500
Carnivores eating meat

590
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,600
Animals merely absorbing liquids

591
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,280
But there is also a whole spectrum of energy

592
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:57,420
The psychic spectrum

593
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:00,200
Which can be used for energy forces

594
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,480
The Aztecs have found this out

595
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:04,140
The release of human life

596
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:06,640
Through massive, massive ritual sacrifice

597
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:09,060
Can provide an energy level release

598
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:10,500
That will power technology

599
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,720
That will power psychic technology

600
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:15,380
The Nazis were working on the same project

601
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:16,980
And this is the same project

602
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,800
That is even to this very day

603
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,960
Being experimented on in certain levels

604
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,300
In parts of Central America

605
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,220
In Guatemala

606
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,660
In Costa Rica

607
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:26,380
Where these guerrilla forces

608
00:36:26,380 --> 00:36:28,640
Supposedly clash with government forces

609
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,180
And bodies are left behind

610
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,480
It is not a war for land

611
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,140
It is not a war for territory

612
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,600
The universe right now

613
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,640
Is a war for energy

614
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:40,000
The energy resources of our universe

615
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:40,540
Are limited

616
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,200
The life forces are varied

617
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,880
And exist on enormously different levels

618
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,100
And I want to tell you

619
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,740
That we are about way down

620
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,320
In the bottom of the food chain

621
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:50,340
In the galaxy

622
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,360
And the things that we really should be talking about

623
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,600
Is not the cheap bullet of politics here on earth

624
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:57,020
Because it doesn't matter

625
00:36:57,580 --> 00:36:58,760
What we should be thinking about

626
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,180
Is the things that threaten us with the world

627
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:00,180


628
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,020
And the things that threaten us from the outside

629
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,960
The things that manifest themselves

630
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,420
As old flying saucers

631
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:07,000
Or supersonic Nazi hell creatures

632
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,800
Or Jim Jones

633
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:11,120
Or anything like that

634
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,460
The point is that there are a lot more scary things out there

635
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:16,260
Than George Bush

636
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,720
Or Bill Clinton

637
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:18,720
Or Ross Perot

638
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,200
Or Saddam Hussein

639
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,960
Or Bob Dobbs for that matter

640
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,120
Human anguish

641
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,320
Human anguish is a very high priced drug

642
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,280
Among the elder gods

643
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:29,840
That's right

644
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:30,040
Sidemen

645
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,480
The elder gods will pay top dollar

646
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,380
For the right quality of human anguish

647
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,700
The Naywites

648
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,780
And their humanity

649
00:37:38,780 --> 00:37:40,600

And if you can think that Alex

656
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:53,780
I know what you're talking about

657
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:59,820
And its certain a scale as you are

658
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:05,060
Down in the dock, you know where it's at

659
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,400
Throw a party, have a good time

660
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:16,460
He said his new drink was very wild

661
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:21,220
He said, side eye, open door

662
00:38:23,860 --> 00:38:27,080
See the coppers in the corner, there's dust on the floor

663
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,480
He's gonna go on the floor and have fun

664
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:38,080
It's a house, six to the bottom

665
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:43,560
The hideous house is way long

666
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,440
It's a hideous house, it's a house we call

667
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,700
Hideous house is way long

668
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:52,140
It's a hideous house, it's a house we call

669
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:57,060
It's a hideous house, it's a house we call

670
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,640
You can never leave

671
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:11,220
Things going on that you can't believe

672
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,100
To us, our house is next to Nirvana

673
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,460
All of you that don't know music, just say it

674
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,400
Yeah!

675
00:39:27,120 --> 00:39:29,680
Go on, take the joy to the world they see

676
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,120
I'll see you today, this ain't no time

677
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,060
Whoa!

678
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:40,680
Make it like it's time to leave the line

679
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:45,700
It's a hideous house, it's way long

680
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,860
It's a hideous house, it's a house we call

681
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:51,660
Hideous house, it's way long

It's a hideous house, it's a house we call

Hideous house, it's way long

684
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:00,100
It's a hideous house, it's a house we call

685
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:03,500
Hideous house, it's a hideous house

686
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:08,500
Hideous house, it's way long

687
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:08,860
Get up on the dance floor

688
00:40:11,020 --> 00:40:12,700
Hideous House

689
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:12,700


690
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:12,700


691
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:12,700


692
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:26,720
Uh-huh, Hideous House

693
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:31,600
the next song so we can enjoy your your lively antics there this audience member with a double

694
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:38,440
jointed shoulder blade wow seriously double jointed bizarre looking mutant

695
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:45,080
great dancer i never saw a shoulder blade man my before you know that's a that's kind of a new one

696
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:55,620
hey but wait a minute you need to punch that big zit you got on your back though

697
00:40:55,620 --> 00:41:00,020
this really looks bad phylo drumming it's a really nasty white one back there

698
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:06,820
ah just kidding we better get back because it will be dark soon and they mostly come at night

699
00:41:07,460 --> 00:41:13,500
mostly i need your body as a dwelling place while i am here on your earth where do you

700
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:18,680
put it you got a hollow leg it exists in almost every city and hamlet in the country

701
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:25,440
and you must stand united on this and stamp out this frightful assassin of our youth make

702
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:25,600
our people proud and we will be proud of you and we will be proud of you and we will be proud of you

703
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:25,600


704
00:41:25,620 --> 00:41:25,840
and we will be proud of you and we will be proud of you and we will be proud of you and we will be proud of you

705
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:29,580
that is only through enlightenment but this scourge can be wiped out

706
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:37,380
as charles ford said we are property and the free rent control days of the early universe are over

707
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:43,840
and what it boils down to is is this planet a paying proposition for the exes can there be

708
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:49,280
something of value otherwise should we just render it down and bob is the person who can negotiate

709
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:55,600
the difference as i said it's either a hell stuckies on some side of the intergalactic highway or a

710
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:00,840
perhaps it is a little green planet of the clocks where the souls of subgeniuses are farmed and

711
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:09,120
ecologically conserved to feed the elder gods on a rational slow basis earth farm one is what we live

712
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:15,860
on that's what the x is and that's the best that's the best scenario that's yeah that's the best

713
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:23,580
possible scenario one of the rvr's all back to the lord no doubt many of you do not believe that

714
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:25,600
these things do happen but they can be done in the future and i think that's what we need to do and

715
00:42:25,600 --> 00:42:26,580
that's what we need to do and that's what we need to do and that's what we need to do and that cannot happen to you

716
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,960
you may also believe that the facts have been exaggerated

717
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:34,420
let me tell you of something that happened right here in our own city

718
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:39,720
all my indicator lights are green watch what you're doing then he saw a flying saucer come down

719
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,480
you know like like on the tv can this be the threshold of inner space

720
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:53,400
ladies and gentlemen this is our mcdonald douglas mission control room at disneyland spaceport

721
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,500
the director of operations has been

722
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:59,440
expecting you and while we're waiting for our flight to be called he'll take a few minutes

723
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:03,320
to describe what's going on at the side post up ahead your next stop

724
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,220
please

725
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:07,500
very

enfact Mixed

727
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,040
Coverage

728
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:49,840
We negatively impact thethe politicalPLUS

729
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:49,840


730
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,660
and in the community

731
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:51,680
Humanx

732
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,740
Enoughstick

733
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:53,280
More solutions

734
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:53,280


735
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:53,780
with

736
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,080
remote

737
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,140
communications

738
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:54,160
facilities

739
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:54,200
physical

740
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:54,400
functions

741
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,140
and how to use it

742
00:43:55,140 --> 00:43:56,060
in a room with a view.

743
00:43:56,180 --> 00:43:57,280
A waffler acts stupid

744
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:58,320
and makes you feel bad.

745
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,480
She has big chance

746
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:00,560
and the deuce looks bad.

747
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:01,140
Of course,

748
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:01,780
you respect her

749
00:44:01,780 --> 00:44:02,700
and your marriage won't front.

750
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:03,960
As long as she puts out

751
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:04,900
and you come home drunk.

752
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,080
She thinks you're garbage

753
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,180
and you think she's scum.

754
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:08,100
You'll both be content

755
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:09,180
if your marriage is calm.

756
00:44:17,660 --> 00:44:19,180
You don't understand, Bob.

757
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,700
The very well-fabricated universe

758
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:22,200
that we know

759
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:23,380
might just rip open.

760
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,780
It's an elite corps.

761
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:25,560
I know we can't let

762
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,980
too many people understand, Bob.

763
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:29,780
But there is a space

764
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:31,620
on the X's saucer

765
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:33,880
for those who will study the tome.

766
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:35,760
And open your heart to Bob.

767
00:44:35,820 --> 00:44:36,580
And those that have

768
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,160
as well as your wallet.

769
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,080
There's also a space

770
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,940
on that same saucer

771
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,140
for people that do have

772
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:43,020
a regular subscription

773
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,440
to the Star Crystal removal.

774
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,500
It's a fan club

775
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,660
for people who aren't fans.

776
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:47,460
It's kind of like

777
00:44:47,460 --> 00:44:49,240
a Manchurian candidates club.

778
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,460
We also have space

779
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:53,580
for you pink boys

780
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:54,660
that do not know Bob

781
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:55,120
from Genetic.

782
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:56,720
In the hold.

783
00:44:56,940 --> 00:44:58,340
It's like a Manchurian

784
00:44:58,340 --> 00:44:59,000
candidates club.

785
00:44:59,120 --> 00:44:59,960
You know, at some point

786
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:00,900
there will be, oh,

787
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:02,800
the pain signal will come

788
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:04,380
and all the subgenie

789
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:04,840
will arise

790
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:06,200
and do their evil bidding

791
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:06,600
for Bob.

792
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,380
Yes.

793
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,540
The little quasar pulse

794
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:09,460
dialed right behind

795
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:10,420
my left ear here

796
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:12,200
is telling me

797
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,180
that no boy needs to be saved.

798
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:14,460
It's not very like

799
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,680
clocking you're under control.

800
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:16,440
That's right.

801
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:17,720
Jesus is coming back, folks.

802
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:18,840
But he's really pissed

803
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:19,360
about us

804
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,380
mailing him up on the cross.

805
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:21,960
And he's got an AK-47!

806
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:23,120
And he's firing it

807
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,740
with boxing gloves, too.

808
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,120
And he's got an AK-47.

809
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,120


810
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:25,120


811
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:26,360
He's got the burned out

812
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,180
rank corpse of Jim Jones

813
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:29,100
standing next to him

814
00:45:29,100 --> 00:45:29,740
for a captain.

815
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:30,800
We have exhumed

816
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:32,040
the body of Leonard Skinner.

817
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:33,420
Pumped up on amphetamines,

818
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,460
useless as they may be

819
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,100
on his corpse.

820
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,660
But stigmata shining

821
00:45:36,660 --> 00:45:37,740
through the boxing gloves.

822
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:38,880
Just for the festivities,

823
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:39,640
we have pumped

824
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:40,520
Jim Jones' body

825
00:45:40,520 --> 00:45:42,460
full of methamphetamines.

826
00:45:42,520 --> 00:45:42,900
Oh, Bob,

827
00:45:42,900 --> 00:45:43,400
that would be

828
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,180
the place to write.

829
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,060
Yes, step right up, folks.

830
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:46,740
Step right up

831
00:45:46,740 --> 00:45:47,540
and take a shot

832
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,320
at the planet Earth.

833
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:49,100
Look, Mommy,

834
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:50,220
what's wrong with that man?

835
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:50,540
Step right up, folks,

836
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:51,440
and take a shot

837
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,080
at the planet Earth.

838
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:52,880
How about you, son?

839
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:53,960
You look like you want to

840
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,100
you're a good shot.

841
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:55,880
Step right up here

842
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,540
and take a shot

843
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:57,280
at the planet Earth.

844
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:57,920
I'll take a shot

845
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,620
at the planet Earth.

846
00:45:58,720 --> 00:45:59,440
I'll take a shot.

847
00:45:59,460 --> 00:45:59,840
Step right up.

848
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,100
Now, just put this

849
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:02,640
atomic cannon in your hand

850
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:03,740
and step back

851
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:04,940
and pull the trigger.

852
00:46:05,100 --> 00:46:06,040
Jeez, this is like Nintendo.

853
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:07,100
What if I turn around

854
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,180
and fire it blindly

855
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:08,820
into the crowd?

856
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:09,880
Wouldn't it be

857
00:46:10,320 --> 00:46:11,200
a kind of a...

858
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:11,960
What if I take the gun

859
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:12,460
from that boy

860
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,320
and shoot this lady?

861
00:46:13,860 --> 00:46:14,660
And after...

862
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:16,940
Blam, blam!

863
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:17,560
Die, die!

864
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,180
We hope to welcome you all

865
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:23,880
tonight

866
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,100
to the fervid

867
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:26,280
celestial spoutings

868
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,080
of the inner

869
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:27,820
epochs

870
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:28,660
and clockwork

871
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:29,540
workings of the church.

872
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,520
But this task

873
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:32,480
will not be easy.

874
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,200
The fruits

875
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:35,440
of the subgenius plant

876
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:36,860
are not as cordial

877
00:46:36,860 --> 00:46:37,460
to the taste

878
00:46:37,460 --> 00:46:38,980
as others may be.

879
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:40,160
Kind of

880
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:41,720
mucilaginous paste.

881
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,900
But it's easy

882
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:44,620
to become

883
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:45,860
tangentially twisted

884
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:47,220
along precarious paths

885
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:47,940
that have nothing

886
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:48,900
to do with the straight

887
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:50,200
and true direction

888
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:50,860
of our search.

889
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,360
We are born

890
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,840
with the Dobbs nature.

891
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:56,620
Original non-sins,

892
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:57,240
you might say,

893
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,140
but its own brow

894
00:46:58,140 --> 00:46:59,080
beaten out of us

895
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,280
by relentless conspiracy

896
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,560
slavery reinforcement

897
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:02,540
from which not even

898
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:03,360
the most conscientious

899
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,460
parent can shield us.

900
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,520
You think putting

901
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,000
your child

902
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:06,780
in an expensive

903
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:07,600
private school

904
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,920
will keep the blatant

905
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:09,680
behavior modification

906
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:10,720
training of the public

907
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:11,640
schools off his or her

908
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:12,180
little back?

909
00:47:12,260 --> 00:47:13,320
What a joke!

910
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:15,040
At small private schools

911
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,240
the con simply has

912
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:17,620
more control.

913
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:19,580
At least in public school

914
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:21,020
the chaos spawned

915
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:21,800
by overcrowding

916
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,380
and drugs

917
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:23,280
and immorality

918
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,000
gives the kid

919
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,080
a chance to experience

920
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:25,900
the all-important

921
00:47:25,900 --> 00:47:27,520
juvenile delinquency

922
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:28,560
that is the closest thing

923
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:29,220
the U.S. has

924
00:47:29,220 --> 00:47:30,280
to an initiation right,

925
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:31,820
the importance of which

926
00:47:31,820 --> 00:47:32,500
has been proven

927
00:47:32,500 --> 00:47:33,380
by every primitive

928
00:47:33,380 --> 00:47:34,380
society on Earth.

929
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:37,080
The goal of any subgenius,

930
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:37,460
besides

931
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:38,620
SLACK,

932
00:47:38,820 --> 00:47:40,360
is to somehow live

933
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,220
until 1998

934
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:42,640
when he or she

935
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,400
will be changed

936
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,620
into what might as well

937
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:45,680
be a superhero

938
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:47,280
possessed of mental

939
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,160
and bodily powers

940
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:48,960
practically unknown

941
00:47:48,960 --> 00:47:50,120
to man today.

942
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,400
If you cleave to Bob

943
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:53,140
you will see

944
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,900
magic

945
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:55,200
come to pass

946
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:55,940
in your life.

947
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:57,620
You're a hero witness!

948
00:47:58,100 --> 00:47:59,980
I have a testimony!

949
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:00,560
Huh!

950
00:48:02,020 --> 00:48:03,180
Praise Bob!

951
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,320
Praise Bob!

952
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:08,060
I've been all my life

953
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:09,800
one of those dues paying

954
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,660
subgenius who paid their dues

955
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,140
by knowing what I was missing.

956
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,160
Preach it!

957
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,480
Then one day

958
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:17,760
I saw a bumper sticker

959
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,100
that Dobbs had

960
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:20,440
back in my life

961
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,460
after many years

962
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:23,400
and I put that bumper sticker

963
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:23,880
upon it

964
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:23,880


965
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:23,880


966
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:23,880


967
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:23,880


968
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:23,880


969
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:23,880


970
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:23,880


971
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:23,880


972
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:23,880


973
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:23,880


974
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,200
right in my car.

975
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,080
What's this gonna' do?

976
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:26,700
you say.

977
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,560
Well first it carried

978
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:29,500
a message to me.

979
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,800
Pull the wall

980
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,300
over your own eyes.

981
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,300
Well!

982
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:37,760
What's this going to bring?

983
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:38,900
I ask myself.

984
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,380
I tell you it

985
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,860
tilted the luck plane

986
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:45,380
right in my direction

987
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:46,560
as far as my car

988
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:47,180
was concerned.

989
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,220
Now one time

990
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:50,180
You'd say one time

991
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:51,240
I parked the car.

992
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,400
Two hours

993
00:48:53,400 --> 00:48:53,860
over the line

994
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:53,860


995
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:53,860


996
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:53,860


997
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:53,860


998
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:53,860


999
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:53,860


1000
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:58,780
do cars in front of me cars in back of me when i return i'm going i'm going to have a ticket too

1001
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:06,260
but there was bob pipe in his mouth smiling at me and no parking ticket

1002
00:49:09,860 --> 00:49:11,740
hallelujah thank you reverence

1003
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:19,260
guaranteed not to rotate your armpits hello what do subgenies believe happens after death that's

1004
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:24,020
the afterlife obviously i prefer the before life it's just one of the don't sound very excited

1005
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:29,760
yeah but you know that's all that's about it we just have the answers to every problem in the

1006
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:33,060
world you get to meet mickey mouse see look at the field look on your view monitor here you see

1007

mickey mouse dancing around well you get to meet people like that well i think brain well i think

1008
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:42,040
we answered this guy's question we do have a color waiting here on line number 660. oh my god they're

1009
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:48,880
lighting up all over the board 666 you're on the air yeah you did i see jehovah one a lot scarier

1010
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:49,240
than the other one

1011
00:49:49,260 --> 00:49:55,240
before boy i've seen jehovah one looking so scary i say 666 and he puts on these little dancing

1012
00:49:55,240 --> 00:50:00,420
bodies yeah right oh no no i'll let you be disturbed by the bodies of the show and the

1013
00:50:00,420 --> 00:50:05,420
moment that you cease and desist of the many of the ladies before you become deceased

1014
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:10,460
they can't run very fast underwater those imbeciles

1015
00:50:11,240 --> 00:50:13,360
we are swimming in treacherous waters

1016
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:17,540
that little doggy has a arm in it

1017
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:18,540
i

1018
00:50:19,260 --> 00:50:24,760
taken care to finish her injuries smoothly in order that she may not be disdained by snobs

1019
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:31,460
who look down upon all the most primordial art that's not what i meant not i must however

1020
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:38,520
all of the british people's respect for such ancient carvings which they at least cemented

1021
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:43,720
into the walls of stables and barns unlike the continentals who destroyed them because they

1022
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:49,040
were remnants of our ancestral paganism britain therefore is the possessor of the greatest antique

1023
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:54,360
antiquities of all Europe, for there the gods of our ancestry were not strangled, as in

1024
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:59,340
almost every other country in Europe. And here beneath this benighted tumulus, I have

1025
00:50:59,340 --> 00:51:04,680
found the withered ancient volume of celestial lore, which I shall use to open the gates

1026
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:05,480
to bring in...

1027
00:51:05,480 --> 00:51:05,880
No! No!

1028
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:09,540
...Yargosh Grafom from the other side of the cosmos.

1029
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:11,700
No, not Grafom! I've seen enough!

1030
00:51:11,980 --> 00:51:13,360
You got the Grafo graphics?

1031
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:14,760
Fuckin' hell!

1032
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,180
We've got Grafos coming up in a minute.

1033
00:51:16,180 --> 00:51:20,940
It's time for Grafos Jabosky, the wonderful wild world of wrestling expert that'll bring

1034
00:51:20,940 --> 00:51:22,300
you the latest in sports trivia.

1035
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:23,400
Hey, look, it's Grafos!

1036
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:23,900
Oh, terrible!

1037
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,240
Being in the United States, specifically in the cultural Siberia of California, where

1038
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:32,420
entertainment and football are the acme of spiritual interest, I have been reduced to

1039
00:51:32,420 --> 00:51:36,980
the status of an unknown and unneeded man, whereby, due to my poverty, I cannot travel,

1040
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:41,860
even to Mexico, to gather and investigate the appropriate materials personally. But

1041
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:45,640
I persist in my line of arcane scholarship and abstruse research.

1042
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:49,840
And I have found the secret behind everything.

1043
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:50,960
It's...

1044
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:52,500
Wait, that's...

1045
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:53,620
Quick, follow the secret!

1046
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:55,080
Follow the secret!

1047
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:58,980
Give this man air. He's having a stroke.

1048
00:51:59,520 --> 00:52:01,080
A stroke of bad luck, I see.

1049
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,500
Those strokes feel so good.

1050
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:08,520
Ah, don't they, though? Yes, they do.

1051
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:15,100
Well, that was some KPFA with Dr. Howell, G. Gordon Gordon, Gary Brogfran, Father Joe

1052
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:20,760
Mama, and Puzzling Evidence. Before that, Reverend David, live at Starwood. It's all

1053
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:27,220
true, too. Before that, KPFA with Dr. Howell. Before that, KHSU, the subgenius show over

1054
00:52:27,220 --> 00:52:34,620
there. Over there, the place that's not the place to write to for special free information

1055
00:52:35,340 --> 00:52:39,280
and general free information from the Church of the Subgenius. That number to write to?

1056
00:52:40,300 --> 00:52:44,180
Send a self-addressed stamped envelope if you want us to be quick about it.

1057
00:52:46,180 --> 00:53:13,280
That's Bob at Post Office Box 140306, Dallas, Texas 75214, which adds up to 23, which reminds

1058
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:13,960
me that...

1059
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:15,080
Bob.

1060
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:23,040
As Pope Bob says here in Nature's God, the Catholic wears a Catholic mask at all times.

1061
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:28,500
Just look at the Neapolitan whores with crucifixes around their necks. The Protestant also cannot

1062
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:35,780
remove the Protestant mask, et cetera. The most comic of all, the rationalist tries

1063
00:53:35,780 --> 00:53:41,640
to wear the mask of reason, even when everybody else can see he is in the grip of a furious

1064
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,140
passion.

1065
00:53:43,460 --> 00:53:45,080
There is no complete answer.

1066
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:50,620
theory of anything. The damnable habit of giving children examinations in which every question has

1067
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:56,260
a true or false answer has conditioned us to think everything in the universe is true or false.

1068
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:03,300
In experience, most things emerge out of chaos, confuse and muddle us for a while,

1069
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:09,040
and vanish into uncertainty again before we know what they were or if they're coming back.

1070
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:18,520
The world is a phalanx of maybes in which a handful of truths and falses can occasionally be found.

1071
00:54:19,980 --> 00:54:25,620
We create our masks as God allegedly made the world out of nothing.

1072
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:30,900
In both cases, the nothingness sometimes shines through.

1073
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:37,280
The function of law and theology are the same,

1074
00:54:37,300 --> 00:54:39,020
to keep the poor from being the same.

1075
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:43,200
Taking back by violence what the rich have stolen by cunning.

1076
00:54:44,540 --> 00:54:45,360
The function of law?

1077
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:51,880
The recitation of the unintelligible by the unscrupulous to empty the purses of the unwary.

1078
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:52,980
The function of theology?

1079
00:54:53,960 --> 00:55:00,100
The recitation of the incomprehensible by the unspeakable to pick the pockets of the unthinking.

1080
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:07,940
If lawyers had been present on Mount Sinai, the Ten Commandments would have 1,200 amendments

1081
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,020
all summing together.

1082
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,860
To the conclusion, the rich may ignore these rules,

1083
00:55:11,980 --> 00:55:15,480
the poor will be hanged if they violate the smallest subordinate clause.

1084
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:21,840
If carpenters had the ethics of lawyers, our chairs would all fall apart.

1085
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:26,480
If plumbers had the ethics of priests, everything would leak,

1086
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:29,340
but that would be called miraculous moisture.

1087
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:38,000
I never fully appreciated plain men who talk straight and do honest work until I built my own cabin.

1088
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:43,100
There is no law in nature and therefore no bribery or corruption.

1089
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:46,580
There are no priests there and therefore no sinners.

1090
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:55,180
A thousand miles from man and history I can see that nature is cyclical, meaningless and without morality or malice.

1091
00:55:55,420 --> 00:56:00,760
Original sin did not enter the world through disobedience but through imagination.

1092
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:04,860
It was the work of the ancient priest who wrote Genesis.

1093
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,140
Before that, men and women were innocent…

1094
00:56:08,140 --> 00:56:11,720
innocent and shameless as my friends the wolves.

1095
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:17,380
A politician is a mask with greed behind it.

1096
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:23,460
A priest is a mask with the will to power behind it.

1097
00:56:24,540 --> 00:56:26,240
The secret of political and priestly power?

1098
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:31,600
Never realize what kind or kinds of idiot you are.

1099
00:56:31,780 --> 00:56:32,920
The secret of wisdom?

1100
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:36,280
Discover every type of idiot you are, overlooking none.

1101
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:37,480
The one you overlook

1102
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:39,800
is the one that will create your major disasters.

1103
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:48,920
A merchant buys things as cheaply as possible and sells them as expensively as possible,

1104
00:56:49,020 --> 00:56:51,280
but the things have some worth or nobody would buy them.

1105
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,740
A priest sells non-existent things and extorts every penny he can get.

1106
00:56:56,820 --> 00:57:01,320
Therefore, the merchants are the more honorable profession.

1107
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:07,460
Ah, yes, dear friends, a little bit of philosophy there.

1108
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:13,620
From Nature's God, the Historical Illuminatus Chronicles, Volume 3, which is out now.

1109
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:18,960
By the way, for those of you who read the first two volumes of Pope Bob Anton Wilson,

1110
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:24,340
really, really quite entertaining and educational books.

1111
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:33,160
Most of them are not like those strange diaries of Sigismundo Selim, as the character is called.

1112
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,440
And yes, dear friends, I suppose we're slowly but surely coming to an end.

1113
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:39,840
We're almost at the end of another hour of slack.

1114
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:43,540
It's so sad that slack only lasts an hour or so.

1115
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,200
But on the other hand, I'll probably have more after I leave.

1116
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,140
Stay tuned, of course.

1117
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,620
And in the meantime, let's see, what can we take ourselves out with?

1118
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:01,120
I know!

1119
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,640
The power! The power!

1120
00:58:14,820 --> 00:58:15,300
Let's see it.

1121
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,280
That day we met my soulmate The Lord.

1122
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,280


1123
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,280


1124
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:27,400
This day and our fullness.

1125
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,560
Every daily,less thancio soul has followed every young man down.

1126
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:30,760
An anciente guill귀,hammering the U jullie,

1127
00:58:30,760 --> 00:58:36,980
отрания hiçbirimi senses,

1128
00:58:36,980 --> 00:58:37,400
ebrigas hiçbirimi senses,

1129
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:47,300
This is from the Juggernaut album.

1130
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,360
Thank you.
