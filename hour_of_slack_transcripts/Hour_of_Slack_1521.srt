00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,660
Your attention, ladies and gentlemen. Your attention, please.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:04,800
Announcing the arrival of the...

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,280
The Genius Power of...

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,800
I don't like it, Joe.

5
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:12,520
Yeah, me too.

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:14,520
We'll just have to sweat this out.

7
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:16,100
Handle whatever it is when it happens.

8
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,220
Joe, maybe if you went to him and said that you had to change your mind about Bob...

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:32,280
From PR News in Washington, I'm broke in Los Angeles and ripe for more wild hot sick face-to-face at the school.

10
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:36,900
Um, um, and, um, and so to, um, shh.

11
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:40,900
The federal government shot up 4% for the first time.

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,100
The Commerce Department says 2.9%.

13
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,660
PR News remains unresolved.

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,220
On Wall Street 22, 16889.

15
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:53,160
Near Spokas, Granston and Granston, Washington.

16
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,080
Fire spokesman Jamie Moore says this is PR News.

17
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:25,840
Speaker 2 Rada Rung gets mad.

18
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:30,860
Power the hell out of Matt Le Marchendele.

19
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:34,700
May shortly persevere.

20
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:38,860
My shorter persevere.

21
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,740
Why?

22
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,040
Should should

23
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,380
this same year?

24
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,460
Why should you persevere?

25
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,600
A little upbeat.

26
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,200
Stuff a little bit.

27
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:53,820
tastes like replaces

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:56,840
went out of my example

29
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,460
and looks like bob needed

30
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,360
work

31
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,300
but

32
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,600
of

33
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,200
that

34
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,240
I say, Poop, I think this calls for a celebration.

35
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,240
How about a game of cup and ball and a slap of pee at Mrs. Meaghan's pie shop?

36
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:37,700
Bob?

37
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:39,780
Bob.

38
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,340
Bob!

39
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,280
Bob?

40
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,120
Bob!

41
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:45,980
Bob!

42
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:46,640
Bob.

43
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,100
Bob.

44
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,120
Bob.

45
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:47,800
Bob.

46
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,040
We're a couple of fine lads together, aren't we?

47
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,360
Let's get russet and talk about girls, eh?

48
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,220
I'm gonna get you up.

49
00:03:00,460 --> 00:03:01,520
I'm gonna get you up.

50
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,960
I'm gonna get you up.

51
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:06,300
I'm gonna get you up.

52
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,500
He's Bob.

53
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,240
He's Bob.

54
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,860
He's Bob.

55
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,720
He's Bob.

56
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,200
Bob don't ever change.

57
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,500
He's Bob.

58
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,900
Bob don't ever change.

59
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,240
He's Bob.

60
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,560
Always good to Bob.

61
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:36,980
He's Bob.

62
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,320
Bob don't ever change.

63

Always good to Bob.

65
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,080
This place is one thing.

66
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:03,900
He's Bob, Bob don't ever change He's Bob, always the blue Bob

He's Bob, Bob don't ever change He's Bob, always the blue Bob

68
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:18,380
His hair is the one with the highlight That shines on the pomegranate door

69
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:23,080
That dimmers and dreams in the twilight And still he knows what it's for

70
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:32,280
He's Bob, Bob don't ever change He's Bob, always the blue Bob

His vibe is the blue Bob

73
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,640
His neck is the one with the dowel That rings on the brooch like fire

74
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:51,200
His neck is the one with the waddle In the flame in the folks desire

75
00:04:51,820 --> 00:05:00,660
He's Bob, Bob don't ever change He's Bob, Bob always the blue Bob

He's Bob, Bob , missing our

79
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:49,100
If you want to say hello to the business end of the law

80
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:53,960
Say what you want, put on a show

81
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,140
Or have a hobby

82
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,260

You don't need to make cash

89
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,520
Gather your friends, make them laugh

90
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,520

Don't really matter what you do or what you say

107
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,380
If you're hurting, it'll be the time you better run away

Don't really matter what you do or what you say

Don't really matter what you do or what you say

Pull the wool over your own eyes

120
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,260
When time's too tight

121
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:31,720
Give yourself some slack

122

That was Max Slack.

187
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:36,360
Before that, the rock song Take a Joke was by Reverend Cuttlefish, I think.

188
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,280
Before that, there was a song, well, it was Dr. Howell's song, He's Bob,

189
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:49,500
that had been remixed into something called Ibiza Sunrise on the Dance Floor,

190
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,180
Dance Floor Remix.

191
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:51,980
But I'm not sure.

192
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:52,720
Who did that?

193
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,300
It might be Brother Just Bone.

194
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,180
I really like that.

195
00:12:57,340 --> 00:13:02,340
My listener, please let us know, because we're assembling three.

196
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,320
We have just assembled three new Bob song albums.

197
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:10,200
You could say it was a triple album, but it's three albums.

198
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,100
And that one's on there.

199
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:18,660
The British Bobby Breaks was by Dr. Slackjaw.

200
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,720
The Al-Qaeda-sounding.

201
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,160
The Muslimic-sounding thing was by Reverend Ed Fred.

202
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,680
And our titles in PR News were, of course,

203
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,800
the great Fernand and Andy Lemur.

204
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,380
I'm now going to preach for about five minutes

205
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,640
from the Bobliagraphon.

206
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,220
I just turned your mic off, Princess,

207
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:49,560
on account of your holding a phone, and I don't know why.

208
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,840
Well, I'm listening to Dave.

209
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:51,560
Dave is on.

210
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:51,960
Oh, okay.

211
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,600
Well, good.

212
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:53,360
Go talk to him.

213
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:56,360
And I will talk to the listeners.

214
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,040
Of course there's an evil conspiracy of rich bastards.

215
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,000
There have always been several.

216
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:07,160
The new problem is that there might end up being only one.

217
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:12,100
It's bearable when there's several evil conspiracies of rich bastards.

218
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,440
One, though, that's scary.

219
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,280
If you've ever had a job working as a caterer or a prostitute,

220
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,600
or if otherwise had to mingle with the nobility,

221
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:27,020
even at the lowest hem of Dame Conspiracy's gown,

222
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,580
serving them drinks,

223
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,480
then you have a good idea how scary.

224
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:36,420
There is nothing more dangerous than a drunk, rich person.

225
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,740
But it's still scary only in a distant way,

226
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,280
like wars are distant.

227
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:44,380
For the lucky, anyway.

228
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,280
Oh, sure, we think, someday in the far future,

229
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,740
we'll devolve into mere work slugs for the Eloy overlords,

230
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:51,940
but obviously,

231
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,920
I'm not going to let that stop me from enjoying my computer games now.

232
00:14:56,140 --> 00:15:02,000
The trick is to not sound too crazy when you talk about the conspiracy.

233
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,840
The do-gooders who rant about it all the time almost always sound crazy.

234
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:11,440
And they're doing just what they want them to do.

235
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:17,520
Your first duty, then, as a good subgenius citizen of what was once the world,

236
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,700
is to not go crazy.

237
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,900
Or at least...

238
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,300
is to learn to act not crazy.

239
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:29,680
That way, when you're joshing about the game and the babes over beer with Bub,

240
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,500
and you mention this or that bad thing that happened,

241
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:37,820
and how some of the crazy stuff you read about it on the web doesn't seem all that crazy,

242
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:43,420
well, Bub is just a little less likely to turn you over to the thought police immediately.

243
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:51,860
Months later, when Bob himself suddenly appears looking crazed and haggard after a long absence from work,

244
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:54,240
and collars you in the parking lot, screaming,

245
00:15:54,520 --> 00:16:00,540
Did you know that AmeriCo is building concentration camps behind the mall?

246
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,000
I have a shotgun!

247
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:08,360
We must go free our fellow unemployed pot-smoking, porn-watching, working-class countrymen!

248
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,880
Or die trying!

249
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,900
He'll take you more seriously when you reply,

250
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,020
Don't get excited, dude.

251
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,160
I tried to tell you.

252
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:19,680
They won 200 years ago.

253
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,760
You can't fight people who can...

254
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,300
melt whole buildings with weapons in the sky,

255
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:27,200
advance beyond normal home hobbyist Ken.

256
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,740
You're real lucky you still have a job on the outside.

257
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,500
So quiet down.

258
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:39,220
Eject the shells from that shotgun and stop rushing headlong into their trap like an idiot.

259
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,320
And we probably shouldn't even be saying that much.

260
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:50,280
Hopefully we're not preaching to a choir that's already wearing Target-painted choir robes and tinfoil hats.

261
00:16:52,660 --> 00:17:00,280
The million nameless missions for Slack are instead best embarked upon one or two people at a time.

262
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,240
Privately, like you know what.

263
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,400
Don't act like a nut around the wrong nuts is all we're saying.

264
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:13,880
Cautious, quiet subversion is about the most effective thing most of us can do.

265
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,400
From our cubicles here in the future.

266
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:20,440
If you think you can get away with more than that, have at it!

267
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,940
Just don't try.

268
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:23,600
Drag Bob into it with you.

269
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,800
He's got much bigger fish to fry,

270
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:32,900
and doesn't need the aggravation of having to rescue amateur freedom fighters from impregnable conspiracy fortresses.

271
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:41,060
Think of all the poor, exploited bastards throughout human history upon whose backs your wealth was built.

272
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:50,300
Their sacrifice was meaningless unless you take full advantage and enjoy the living hell out of everything you have.

273
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,940
Compared to the vast, seething anthill of billions of humans since 1 million BC,

274
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:01,180
most of us are relatively as rich as any Renaissance king.

275
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:05,740
So the full, hideous irony of the situation isn't lost on us.

276
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,200
We're just not going to let it get us down.

277
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:16,760
We just got here a few decades ago, most of us, and are completely innocent of, well, most of the injustices wrought by our ancestors.

278
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,880
The conspiracy is real enough.

279
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:23,980
But the conspiracy isn't the rich guys who run things.

280
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,600
The conspiracy we're talking about is much worse!

281
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:32,420
It's the one lurking inside the mind of every single one of God's monkeys.

282
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:38,900
It's inside you, and it's inside the presidents and prime ministers' real bosses, and in everyone in between.

283
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:42,140
Bob put it in Ayn Rand.

284
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:47,820
It's how us third-order chimpanzees, as the exes might call us, got where we are.

285
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:54,520
A vast, vicious arena wherein the biggest, meanest chimpanzee wins.

286
00:18:56,180 --> 00:19:00,640
Only when we, as a race, can, like the great scientist Dr. Moreau,

287
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:06,120
root out the devil gene and rationally remake ourselves into overmen,

288
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,700
bereft of the cruel, pan-triglodyte, chimp nature,

289
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:17,800
and through scientific means force-evolve ourselves towards the ideal that we call the moral ideal,

290
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,500
the monologue of the world,

291
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,520
we can, like the bonobo chants,

292
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,820
or else, on X-Day,

293
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:30,760
only then, when the last vestige of the Hugh-Man has been replaced by the recreated Yeti,

294
00:19:30,820 --> 00:19:35,500
then shall we find true slack and freedom for all.

295
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:40,420
All that remain, anyway, hopefully including lonesome cowboy Dave.

296
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:44,860
I hope including lonesome cowboy Dave.

297
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:45,100
Hello, Dave.

298
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,520
Rudy Cazooty.

299
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,560
How the heck's it going?

300
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:49,360
How are you, man?

301
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,160
There he is.

302
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,940
I haven't spoken to you in a full week.

303
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,360
What a week full.

304
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,460
Oh, I guess you haven't heard the news, then.

305
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,360
What is the news?

306
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,940
I haven't heard it, as you said.

307
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,200
Bob's dead, man.

308
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,660
For the 15th time?

309
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:11,900
Well, yeah, it's not the first time.

310
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,460
That's the lucky thing about it.

311
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,060
Oh, Princess Wee's mic wasn't on.

312
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:16,520
There we go.

313
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,020
Now you can talk to Dave on the phone.

314
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:20,540
Yay!

315
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:23,540
Now that we have Dave on the phone, on the show.

316
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,800
When Dave's not on the show, but on the phone,

317
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:28,800
you can't talk to Dave on the phone on the show.

318
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,480
But I wasn't talking to Dave.

319
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:32,860
I was only listening to messages of Dave.

320
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:35,980
A mess of Dave.

321
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,320
A mess of messages.

322
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,920
Synchronized swimming messages are left in the dark places.

323
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,120
In the deep subconsciousness of humankind.

324
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,100
Chase.

325
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:49,440
A little time bomb, so to speak, would go off when Bob dies.

326
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,280
But I wasn't aware of this time because, well, I just wasn't.

327
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,800
Oh, she's kidding anyway?

328
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,080
Too bad.

329
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,040
I wish he was.

330
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:02,000
Well, sometimes he is.

331
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,160
Yeah.

332
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,300
Sometimes he's dead.

333
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,980
But it's hard to tell, you know?

334
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,600
He doesn't really mess with us most of the time, does he?

335
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,440
Well, I don't know.

336
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,640
There's a lot of stuff coming out of that pipe and the thing attached to the back of

337
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,860
his neck between his cranium and his cranium there.

338
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,640
Right.

339
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,520
The medulla oblongata.

340
00:21:23,860 --> 00:21:25,580
The M-O, so to speak.

341
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,320
Not the motor chaperone, but the medulla oblongata.

342
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,240
Yeah.

343
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,480
Stick an ice pick in that thing and see what happens.

344
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,380
Oh.

345
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:33,820
Go ahead.

346
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,400
Just try it.

347
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:34,480
Excuse me.

348
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:36,460
No, we shouldn't.

349
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,700
Listeners, don't try that.

350
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:40,260
Luckily, most of them don't know where.

351
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,620
No, we just did say where it is.

352
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,020
Yes.

353
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,740
Right above your collar.

354
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:50,660
Yeah, but we remind them that there's a lot of space there and a lot of places they could

355
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:56,620
miss and cause a lot of damage, so they better consult a physiognomy or anatomy bible sometime

356
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:57,020
soon.

357
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,400
Or avoid listening to the hour of slack.

358
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,220
Or a professional-

359
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,160
For their own safety.

360
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:02,740
Professional trepanator.

361
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,120
There you go.

362
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,520
Are there still those about?

363
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:10,120
We still have plenty of those in the yellow pages, do we?

364
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,000
You know, I believe that-

365
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,000


366
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,920
That there is an active trepanation society or two.

367
00:22:17,060 --> 00:22:21,900
I remember at least not more than five years ago we were reading, didn't Reverend Sinek

368
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,000
bring in a whole printout of trepanators?

369
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:25,340
Yes.

370
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,980
He was excited about it.

371
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,740
He'd never seen anything that crazy before.

372
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,800
It was fresh, new, and novel for him.

373
00:22:31,980 --> 00:22:32,580
To him, yeah.

374
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,560
We've already-

375
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:34,580
Nor did he try it himself.

376
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:41,060
I actually went to those people and had a small hole drilled, but it didn't really do

377
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,200
anything except bleed.

378
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,740
So I had it covered back up and then it plugged.

379
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:47,240
You didn't feel any-

380
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,460
You didn't feel any of the damage it might have done?

381
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,460
Your third nostril isn't a literal hole in your head.

382
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,320
It's really a gland in your foot.

383
00:22:55,900 --> 00:23:02,440
I know that sounds silly, but it is your third eye, but it's located in your foot where

384
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,140
the soul and the soul are both located.

385
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,600
Yeah.

386
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:11,700
At least we've got that together as far as apologetics and catechesis and all that stuff

387
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:11,980
is concerned.

388
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,060
I think we've covered that thoroughly.

389
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:21,040
It's soul with S-O-L-E combined with E-S-O-U-L makes a mighty meaty pocket sandwich if you

390
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:22,520
have the time to sniff it up.

391
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:27,520
That's what Bob eats and that's what he's trading to the X-ists, the men from Planet

392
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:28,780
X for the Earth.

393
00:23:30,820 --> 00:23:33,840
I've heard they can find them where they hail from.

394
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,880
What, Planet X?

395
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:36,700
Yeah.

396
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:40,580
Well, there's a kook Planet X and then there's the real Planet X.

397
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:42,180
When did they come out?

398
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:46,100
When other people who are not subgeniuses talk about Planet X, they're talking about

399
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:51,280
the Earth-like planet that is always just the opposite side of our planet from the sun.

400
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:53,160
That's why we can't see it.

401
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:58,540
That's where the false aliens come from because there's not really a planet there.

402
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:06,420
Planet X is a planet where the X-ists originally evolved, but it's not in this solar system.

403
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:10,520
We don't know for sure if it's in the Milky Way galaxy.

404
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:13,020
You know, that's the one thing about X-Day.

405
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:16,280
Everybody's going, we're going to go off in our space saucers.

406
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:17,420
Where?

407
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,020
Where exactly are we going?

408
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,840
Planet X?

409
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,540
It doesn't actually say that.

410
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:26,180
It says the men from Planet X are going to give us escape saucers.

411
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,480
It doesn't say where they're going to take us.

412
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:30,620
True enough.

413
00:24:30,620 --> 00:24:36,660
Nor are they very specific about what form they're going to take us off the Earth in.

414
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,380
Yeah.

415
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,500
I mean, we're promised new planets.

416
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:40,800
We're going to have new bodies.

417
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:46,460
Well, does that mean you're really a brain in a jar that thinks you have a cool new body?

418
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:49,040
Yeah, much like in the brain that would not die.

419
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:58,640
You could just spend a lot of time in that place there, bubbling and jerking around and never coming up with any visceral physical experiences.

420
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,540
Well, no, the brain that would not die still had a head around it.

421
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,520
You're thinking of Donovan's brain or Nancy Reagan's brain?

422
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:08,020
Ah, Donovan's brain, yes.

423
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,480
Nancy Reagan's brain.

424
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:09,660
No.

425
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,020
Nancy Reagan's brain.

426
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,840
Which the third version of that starred Nancy Reagan.

427
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:15,680
Ah.

428
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,420
Who was Nancy, what's her name, Davis then.

429
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,420
Back then.

430
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:28,880
Yeah, and she did the little shots with the lingerie, the naughty nighties, stuff like that.

431
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:40,480
You know, she was not traditionally beautiful as an actress, and there are a lot of rather unflattering rumors about how she managed to even get to the top.

432
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:50,140
Let's get into B pictures, with her rather plain looks, but apparently she was good at, well, some types of acting, let us say.

433
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:56,940
Yeah, to providing some certain services to other actors and producers especially.

434
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:06,680
Right, that's, well, those are the kind of nasty things that people make up about people who get famous, partly because that's how some people get famous.

435
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:12,180
Yeah, it's true.

436
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,320
Poor Nancy.

437
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,100
Yeah, poor Nancy indeed.

438
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:24,040
And then she was also addicted to all kinds of cosmeals and prosthetic devices and drugs and so forth.

439
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,720
Well, and astrology.

440
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,940
I just thought she was addicted to astrology.

441
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,780
Well, that's right.

442
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:31,880
It was Nancy Ford.

443
00:26:32,180 --> 00:26:35,220
It was George Ford's prerequisite grandpapa.

444
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,180
Right, Ford's center.

445
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:39,340
Where you go to rehabilitate.

446
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,440
The Betty Ford Clinic.

447
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:48,020
The rich go to like a real posh place to come off and the rest of us have to go to prison.

448
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:49,700
That's not fair, Steve.

449
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:57,620
A writer friend of mine told me that Stephen King and his agent went to the Betty Ford Clinic

450
00:26:57,620 --> 00:27:03,460
because they'd gotten a little bit too rich too fast and spent it on you-know-what.

451
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,560
What?

452
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,840
I thought they were using it as material for their upcoming sagas.

453
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,620
They don't need to.

454
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:13,140
All they have to do is turn on the news.

455
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:18,020
Stephen King himself said recently, hey, hey, what?

456
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,840
Presidential primary?

457
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,340
I'm the one who's supposed to be writing horror stories.

458
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:28,400
Well, now what about Betty Flounce, who was part of the agronomics sector?

459
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,000
I forget which part.

460
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,460
No, I think you mean Edna Flan, not Betty Flounce.

461
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,740
Not Betty Flounce.

462
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,500
Edna Flan.

463
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,140
I'm easy to see.

464
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,640
It's easy to see.

465
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:42,240
I get those confused, especially if your eyes are crossed and you're reading from the wrong paper upside down.

466
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:44,540
But, yeah, I got you now, man.

467
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,220
I know what you mean.

468
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,280
Hey, I thought...

469
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:48,840
She's not even nearly dead yet, is she?

470
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:50,480
She's still almost dead.

471
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,500
What difference does it make?

472
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:58,400
Really, if you're named after a Hispanic pudding, you know...

473
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,840
No, Edna Flan is still around.

474
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,440
She's the scourge of the Church of the Subgenius.

475
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,040
Nobody even knows who she is.

476
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:06,340
Stop.

477
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:06,920
I can't believe it.

478
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:16,220
Reverend Skull really is like the main guy that keeps track of her kook activities.

479
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:22,880
Speaking of kook activities, we got a letter about us in the mail.

480
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:23,120
A letter?

481
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,680
Yeah, this listener, I don't know if I should say his name on the air.

482
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,280
We'll just call him Reverend Matt.

483
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,480
He did a couple of really unusual things.

484
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,820
He sent...

485
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,780
A check in the mail.

486
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:39,940
Good, man.

487
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,300
Instead of using the internet.

488
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:47,020
Somebody else also sent me, from China, sent me a 100 yuan note.

489
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:51,140
By the way, if the Chinese listener or person is...

490
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,760
That's not going to do it, man.

491
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,300
That does not...

492
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,400
No, we can't go and spend 100...

493
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:57,640
Even if it's renminbi.

494
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,640
Even if it's tourist money, we still can't spend it here.

495
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:05,180
I could take it to the bank and have them change it into 50 bucks or something.

496
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:06,140
But...

497
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,720
No, no, you're supposed to do that.

498
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,240
Anyway, thanks for the donation.

499
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:17,100
Meanwhile, this other person, Reverend Matt here, who is in our listening distance,

500
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:23,200
he says that long, long ago, back in February, he says,

501
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:27,540
I partook in my first ever hour of slack on WCSB.

502
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,580
I must tell you, it far exceeded my expectations.

503
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,640
He must have had really low ones.

504
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,260
Don't get excited.

505
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,400
Common expectations, which are way low.

506
00:29:39,660 --> 00:29:40,660
Now, you'll like this, Dave.

507
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:44,000
Having been a fan of college radio for some time,

508
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:47,920
I've always been curious as to the nature of this program, as well as your organization.

509
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:51,320
I fondly remember your cahoot...

510
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:54,380
No, your cohort, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

511
00:29:54,500 --> 00:30:00,820
from his Wayne Stead All Night days, circa 1989.

512
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,260
Wow.

513
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,300
Which I don't remember.

514
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:04,160
Wow.

515
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,560
I don't remember your days in 1989.

516
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,760
Nor mine.

517
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:08,300
Yes, sir.

518
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:13,140
Well, I was actually ESOing, but I would appear frequently on Wayne Stead's All Night

519
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,540
because he was all night, and that was back in the days when

520
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:21,900
the refrigerator back there at the old WCSB was full of beverages,

521
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,520
and there were lots of ashtrays everywhere,

522
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:29,020
and people sleeping on couches because the show was in three hours.

523
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,240
Yes, they don't do that stuff anymore.

524
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,360
No, there's cameras in all the stations now.

525
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:35,560
They can't even rocket away at KPFA.

526
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,580
Okay.

527
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,760
They can't even go poopoo without somebody watching.

528
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,420
That's right.

529
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,860
There's cameras everywhere.

530
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:49,020
Did you hear most recently about the FBI's private, or not private, but the FBI's Air Force?

531
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:50,000
Oh, yes.

532
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:55,380
Apparently, they've got hundreds of airplanes flying around and other synoptic remotes and

533
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:59,740
other kinds of objects that fly through the air, checking everything out all the time.

534
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,960
And they're just finding out about it now, and they say,

535
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,180
Whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not doing anything.

536
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,280
We're not bugging anybody.

537
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:05,900
We're just...

538
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:07,720
Well, the reason you're just finding...

539
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:07,860
Keep an eye on stuff.

540
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:10,760
We weren't supposed to find out about it at all.

541
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:15,580
And if they were doing their job as secret cops, we never would have found out about it.

542
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,880
For that matter, did you hear that they...

543
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,600
Well, what they're saying...

544
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,980
Who knows what the real story behind this is.

545
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:33,640
They are saying that the Chinese, most likely, hacked the U.S. government servers,

546
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,640
computer servers.

547
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:40,200
And got the information on pretty much everybody employed by the government,

548
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,080
which I guess includes all taxpayers.

549
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:42,820
I don't know.

550
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,320
What?

551
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:47,820
The Chinese hacked the government and got into a bunch of stuff.

552
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,780
Or maybe it was the Russians, or maybe...

553
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,580
Who knows?

554
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,340
Maybe it was the NSA, and they had to blame somebody.

555
00:31:55,240 --> 00:32:02,380
But the funny thing is, even Fox News' cyber guy had to admit,

556
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,660
maybe Hillary had a good idea having her own...

557
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:07,020
...private email server.

558
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,420
Seeing as how that didn't get hacked, and everything else did.

559
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:17,500
But let's not go any further there, because I haven't finished this letter here, Dave.

560
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,380
Okay, okay.

561
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,840
And I know that you want me to finish it, because it was about you.

562
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,560
Yeah, yeah, man.

563
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,740
He says, what a fine era that was.

564
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:35,100
The philosophy of the church seems to be in lockstep with my own views of organized religion,

565
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:35,640
as well as...

566
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,240
...as well as politics.

567
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:43,980
I thoroughly savored not only those overdubbed George Bush speeches as heard on the May 15th hour.

568
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,960
It's like, oh, those must have been really old.

569
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,520
Yeah.

570
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:48,860
But PR news as well.

571
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:53,920
And, oh, and he liked hearing about the salt mines, because he spent a lot of time in the salt mines,

572
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:56,040
the real salt mines under Lake Erie.

573
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,380
Wow.

574
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:04,280
He says, I can tell you firsthand, there is no shortage of salt or cigarettes, or slack, for that matter.

575
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:07,980
And he says that he...

576
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:17,120
I just imagined a big room down underneath the earth with, like, walls all white and stalactites and slag mites of salt permeating everything,

577
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:20,040
and a whole bunch of cigarette butts on the floor.

578
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,080
Well, why not?

579
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,080
Oh, man, I'm glad I saw that in my mind.

580
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:28,900
Well, don't leave out the columns of salt that they leave in place so the whole roof doesn't cave in on it.

581
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:29,920
Those are important.

582
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:30,700
Yes.

583
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,780
Oh, this guy mentions, he says,

584
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:35,520
By my own admission, I have personally attained slack in the...

585
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,000
Mines.

586
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:43,140
By stealing away down the secluded, musty corridors to indulge in golf cart-powered naps.

587
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:44,780
Whoa.

588
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:56,340
And those mines are huge, so, you know, you could go off into a dark corner, I suppose, and nap, or whatever.

589
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:05,540
And did you know that those same places, those same salt mines, have made protrusions in an area, kind of,

590
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:08,300
close to where we was originally from before she...

591
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,800
this planet, or not...

592
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,580
before the planetary exercise and stuff like that.

593
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:20,500
There's all kinds of salt licks pointing up out of the ground, and they go real deep, and then they go back under the lake, and then...

594
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,700
Ah, never mind.

595
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:22,840
Salt licks.

596
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:27,080
These gigantic salt licks could only be seen as such from the air.

597
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:29,260
So why did the Peruvians erect them?

598
00:34:29,620 --> 00:34:35,560
Obviously, there must have been gigantic space cows coming and licking the vast salt...

599
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,960
licks of the Nazca Plain of Peru.

600
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,780
Obviously.

601
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,340
It's the only explanation for giant wads of salt.

602
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:42,960
Jeez.

603
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,980
Giant cows licking the salt.

604
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:51,300
That's not really the only one. I mean, we could make up, like, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 more good explanations.

605
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,320
We wouldn't have to, you know, go by that as the only explanation.

606
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,820
Hey, let's write a new subgenius book!

607
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,940
We'll have one explanation per page. That's 140 pages.

608
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:04,160
Wow, that's 140 explanations, or...

609
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:04,960
Um...

610
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,480
What are the...

611
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:05,640
What are they called?

612
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,880
Those ruminations where they're like...

613
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:13,120
Oh, like the Haditha and the Koran, or, you know, the Talmud, and, you know, different...

614
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:24,080
Or the Old Testament, and, you know, all these different little books and stuff that people are supposed to learn to do the silly walk, and take all the punishment they can.

615
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:34,460
Right, and do the silly sacrifices, and kill... do the silly wars, and slay the silly unbelievers, and chop off the silly foreskin...

616
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:34,660
Ooh!

617
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:36,740
Ouch!

618
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,620
Now, Dave, I'm...

619
00:35:38,620 --> 00:35:47,900
This... this, uh, letter writer, Reverend Matt, also has... you can tell he has wonderful taste by the way he described...

620
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:50,200
Well, he says, to quote, okay,

621
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:59,040
I understand that Bob, meaning Bob Dobbs, is many things to many people, and no two people may view him in quite the same way.

622
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:03,720
For example, Bob may appear to one follower in a piece of toast.

623
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,540
For others, he may be...

624
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:10,040
He may be staring back at them from a freshly-plamed length of American black walnut.

625
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:11,660
Now, since we're...

626
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:13,740
You would be more likely to see him, Princess.

627
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:14,180
Yes.

628
00:36:14,180 --> 00:36:14,540
Yes.

629
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:14,700
Definitely.

630
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:15,260
Yes.

631
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:16,360
Um...

632
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:17,920
Let's...

633
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:27,420
As for me, I would like to think that Bob's aura is intertwined with all the things which bring me peace and fulfillment on a daily basis, such as...

634
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:27,700
Wow.

635
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:34,540
...the smell of old blueprints, or a freshly-sharpened Eberhard Faber Mongol pencil.

636
00:36:34,540 --> 00:36:42,540
Or perhaps that first swig of freshly-ground coffee from my earth-tone 1960s vintage thrift store mug.

637
00:36:43,540 --> 00:37:00,000
When I am seated at my drafting table, I imagine that Bob is there with me, sporting an avocado turtleneck, along with festive rayon trousers and brown corduroy slippers, the aroma of vanilla blend billowing forth from his noble pie.

638
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:02,120
So he's got very specific...

639
00:37:02,120 --> 00:37:14,680
Yeah, I would say that he doesn't understand that the avocado stain is just a mere lump of guacamole that missed his mouth and landed, as it usually does, on his fine-pronounced American-style breasts.

640
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:17,460
No, it's the whole turtleneck is covered with avocado.

641
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:29,460
Anyway, he says, however, the notion that I'm worthy of sharing the Naugahyde with Bob smacks of foolhardy arrogance on my part, and I certainly wouldn't want Bob to view me with a jaundiced eye.

642
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,100
And he's hoping that...

643
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:32,100


644
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:35,300
He's hoping that he's going to get something for his money.

645
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:40,440
A bound printed matter, a poster-sized likeness of Bob.

646
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,280
Well, it depends on how big of a poster you're talking about.

647
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:49,520
You may have to do that blow-up yourself if you want one that big.

648
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,480
Anyway, he wants our opinion...

649
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,540
I don't want to blow up your eyes just to get rid of a little bit of jaundice.

650
00:37:54,580 --> 00:38:00,560
All you have to do is just wipe it down with some hydrogen peroxide very fiercely and vigorously until you scream and holler.

651
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:01,880
There's no need for...

652
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:06,800
for pumice or some of the other liquid attributes that pile on there.

653
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:12,520
But he wants our opinion about something important.

654
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:13,880
Okay.

655
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:26,000
I have developed, he says, quite a fondness, a fetish really, with the massive old-style barbecue outdoor fireplaces prevalent in the 1940s through the 1960s.

656
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,820
I'm currently designing such a landmark,

657
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,260
not merely for roasting viands,

658
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:36,920
but more so to serve as an altar to honor Bob,

659
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:45,540
to be sure such an edifice would indeed serve as a hub around which the pursuit of slack would be tirelessly and diligently practiced.

660
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:54,040
And he wants to hear our thoughts on this matter of an outdoor massive old-style barbecue fireplace,

661
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:57,340
which I wouldn't even know what he was talking about,

662
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,800
except that I've read my Mad Max.

663
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,180
I've read all the magazines from that period.

664
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:06,000
And I distinctly remember an ad for a fiberglass fireplace,

665
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:11,980
which they showed the dad starting to cook at this magnificent thing,

666
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,880
and then of course the entire thing started to melt.

667
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,160
My favorite.

668
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,620
I was wondering if it might be something similar to what Reverend Heathen had built.

669
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:23,620
Like which?

670
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:24,800
Firewood.

671
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:25,340
Firewood.

672
00:39:25,340 --> 00:39:32,280
He built a barbecue that could barbecue a whole pig or about 30 chickens.

673
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,080
And it was portable.

674
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:40,620
He set it up at Wisteria for Ex-Day Drill number 1521.

675
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:45,360
Yes, and we all worshipped the barbecue and Reverend Heathen.

676
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,120
And the food.

677
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:46,740
And the food.

678
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:49,300
But the barbecue itself was very much worthy.

679
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:55,240
It was probably more worthy of worship than either Reverend Heathen or the pig.

680
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:57,900
No offense to the pig or Reverend Heathen.

681
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:01,220
I don't know what we'd do without Reverend Heathen, really.

682
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:01,880
We'd starve.

683
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,140
Yes, we would starve.

684
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:04,160
Everyone would starve.

685
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,680
And we'd all be lost and broken.

686
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,640
No, he can't help us with that.

687
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,020
We are lost and broken.

688
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,520
And we wouldn't understand the labor theory of value,

689
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:16,240
as bespoken by the old professor,

690
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:21,540
that 30 chickens, as far as labor value, equals one pig.

691
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,860
Or vice versa.

692
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:25,220
I'm sorry.

693
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:25,940
I had to say that.

694
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:28,580
I just had to, you know, keep on inferring.

695
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:35,520
So, chickens only get one thirtieth of a vote compared to a pig.

696
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,260
How much of a vote does a pig get?

697
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:41,540
Well, since all animals are created equal,

698
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,200
but some animals are more equal than others, as Orwell once said,

699
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:49,420
I would say that 30 chickens per pig is quite a paltry sum.

700
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:55,200
And I would say that the greater exchange rate might be like 30 turkeys or 60 chickens.

701
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:59,300
If I could say such a thing.

702
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:00,180
You could say that.

703
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:00,880
I could say that.

704
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:05,020
But the point is, what about this giant barbecue that's going to be built by this,

705
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:09,000
apparently an architect or something in Euclid, Ohio?

706
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:10,300
Hmm.

707
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:11,500
This Reverend Matt.

708
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:12,200
What is his...

709
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,440
Why should I even wonder about that?

710
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,280
I've been building things in Minecraft obsessively for a month now.

711
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:24,480
And the first thing you do is you build...

712
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,200
You can build a Dobbs head out of bricks.

713
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,200
And here's how you do it.

714
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:34,740
You get some of that plain ordinary graph paper from the drugstore or the soup or whatever.

715
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:46,080
And the Bob's poster that comes with your membership pack fits perfectly under that grid of graph paper.

716
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,880
And you just trace the Bob.

717
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,760
I did that.

718
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:53,500
And I made a Dobbs head high atop a mountain in Minecraft.

719
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:58,560
80 blocks high and about 35 blocks across, I think.

720
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:01,500
And then you cut the mountain down with the side of your hand, right?

721
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:01,760
Yeah.

722
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,520
Yeah, I cut the...

723
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:02,720
Yeah.

724
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,120
I stood up next to the mountain.

725
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,500
Well, I didn't exactly cut Choppy down the side of my hand.

726
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,280
I sneezed real hard in the mountain.

727
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,220
Just blew the mountain right away.

728
00:42:14,220 --> 00:42:17,620
It kind of dissolved in the parts where my sneeze hit it.

729
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,080
That's not Hendrix.

730
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:20,220
That's Malus philosophy.

731
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:23,480
When you sneeze down the mountain, that's part of the Little Red Bull.

732
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,460
That's the books characters there.

733
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:30,000
Sneezing down the mountain is when the people overcome the people and become...

734
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,120
More equal than others.

735
00:42:32,180 --> 00:42:36,560
More equal than each other and in the process much less.

736
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,720
Yeah, we know how the revolution noise ends up.

737
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,180
They all end up on their heads, everything.

738
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:48,840
I'm hoping for a revolution and I'm hoping to be the next pig, the next teen pig.

739
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:49,820
Right.

740
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,700
Now, I'm going to go there, Princess Wee.

741
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:54,460
Okay.

742
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,140
We started thinking just last night, wasn't it?

743
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:06,380
What if the subgeniuses, the ones that we know that we see all the time at X Day, the ones that you can see pictures of on the internet.

744
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:06,980
Uh-huh.

745
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:09,020
Like Dave, for instance.

746
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:10,040
We never thought of Dave.

747
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,780
What if they were cartoon animals?

748
00:43:11,900 --> 00:43:13,440
What animal would they be?

749
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:19,320
We decided that you would be a koala bear because of your sweet expression.

750
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:23,460
You were saying I would be a lion, but I was saying...

751
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,140
I would probably be more like a goat.

752
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:26,320
Yes.

753
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:26,920
What would Dave be?

754
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,740
I don't like this game because it gets to be mean.

755
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:32,520
Well, some people were bulls and some were...

756
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:36,760
Well, specifically we had a couple that we thought of as...

757
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:37,920
Horses.

758
00:43:37,940 --> 00:43:41,340
Elmer and Daisy on the Borden's packaging.

759
00:43:42,540 --> 00:43:43,300
Horses, yeah.

760
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:44,280
There were people...

761
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:45,300
What would Dave do?

762
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,420
What animal...

763
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:51,440
Say Tex Avery was drawing animal farm subgenius style.

764
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,440
I'd be like Woody Woodruff.

765
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:53,660
I'd be like a woodpecker.

766
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:53,860


767
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:57,400
If a woodpecker was in it so it could touch Avery, I'd have the same kind of long nose

768
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:00,100
and wet hair flying back.

769
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:01,040
That would be like Nutty Squirrel.

770
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:02,140
And teeth under my beak.

771
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:06,940
I'd have a beak full of teeth, unlike so many other ducks and woodpeckers and birds.

772
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:13,740
There was a Nutty Squirrel, but he was a little bit more frenetic and active than you, and

773
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:14,400
he had buck teeth.

774
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:15,520
But Dave doesn't have...

775
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:18,600
I see Dave more as an antelope myself.

776
00:44:19,220 --> 00:44:19,680
Antelope?

777
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:21,140
Yes, an antelope.

778
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:21,600
Springing?

779
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:22,080
Yes.

780
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:24,980
So you see me as food to some poor people?

781
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,660
No, food to a large carnivore.

782
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:28,980
No, I'm talking about facial characteristics.

783
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,340
An antelope.

784
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:31,280
Antelope, yes.

785
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,140
I thought it was a cantaloupe the first time you said that.

786
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:40,000
I thought it was because of my melon-sized breasts and my thick, large forehead.

787
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:44,840
But yeah, it can't be as easy as all that.

788
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:50,920
Dave used to look sort of like Big Chief Uggamug in a Popeye cartoon of the 30s, but now he

789
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,660
looks more like Old Lodge Skins.

790
00:44:53,260 --> 00:44:53,980
Old who?

791
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,620
Old Lodge Skins.

792
00:44:55,680 --> 00:45:02,380
Remember the movie Little Big Man starring a Native American actor named Chief Dan George?

793
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,440
Yes.

794
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:07,140
You would say, my heart soars like a hawk when I see you.

795
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:07,480
Yes.

796
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:08,040
Yeah.

797
00:45:08,580 --> 00:45:13,840
Wouldn't you say that you're more like the Indian that looks upon the polluted garbage

798
00:45:13,840 --> 00:45:15,520
and the tear rolls down his cheek?

799
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,980
Well, that wasn't Chief Dan George.

800
00:45:18,060 --> 00:45:20,280
That was Chief Texaco Highgrass.

801
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,820
From the Sumptuous Mountain Brigade.

802
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:22,900
Right.

803
00:45:22,900 --> 00:45:23,040
I know.

804
00:45:23,060 --> 00:45:23,400
Different.

805
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,120
The same ones which sniffled off the salt.

806
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:31,360
Besides, we're talking about cartoon animals that would match subgeniuses.

807
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:36,220
Yeah, I see we shouldn't get too personal because some people might take it the wrong

808
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:36,540
way.

809
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:43,860
Now, I can safely say that Dr. Legume would be played by a gorilla because I've seen him

810
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:46,360
a couple of years ago.

811
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,520
I said, Legume, you look like a gorilla over there.

812
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,680
And he slumped down.

813
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,260
And I said, what?

814
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:50,260


815
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:54,680
And then after I said that, he really looked like a gorilla.

816
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,220
I can't see that.

817
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:57,860
I just can't.

818
00:45:57,860 --> 00:45:58,300
He rubbed his knuckles on the ground.

819
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,060
No, he's got dimples.

820
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:01,780
Come on.

821
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:02,460
Not like a gorilla.

822
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:03,700
Yeah, he doesn't look like a gorilla.

823
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:06,880
The listeners can't see these people.

824
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:10,020
This is a pointless conversation.

825
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:15,960
I'm stucking them in their minds right now as they lift back the page and take a look

826
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:17,940
at the mugshot of their brain.

827
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,040
Well, you...

828
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:20,720
This one looks like an antelope.

829
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,380
This one looks like a pantalope.

830
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:30,060
Well, there are subgeniuses who only listen to subgenius radio and have never looked at

831
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,040
a subgenius book.

832
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:38,820
Or perhaps they've never looked at the subgenius website, the main one, the archive, the gigantic

833
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:44,860
archive one that I shovel tons into once every three years or so.

834
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:49,360
Although the X Day page is all spiffed up and really looking pretty right now.

835
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,020
I don't know.

836
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:50,960
I don't know.

837
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:58,800
But the listeners can actually go scooting around the subgenius website, the sections

838
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:08,820
about our shows, our live shows, which we did for 35 years and will be doing at X Day

839
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:10,460
and Starwood next...

840
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,180
In one month.

841
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,240
Less than a month.

842
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:15,600
Wait, in less than a month there's not gonna be a world here.

843
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,160
What's today, June 7th?

844
00:47:17,420 --> 00:47:18,080
That's right.

845
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,020
We've got 28 days before the world.

846
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:20,660
That's right.

847
00:47:21,540 --> 00:47:23,160
So why are we even...

848
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:23,420
Better get ready, because...

849
00:47:23,420 --> 00:47:24,000
Let's go home.

850
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,880
Look, why are we waiting for the next show host?

851
00:47:28,780 --> 00:47:29,640
Let's just split, man.

852
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:30,980
Yeah, you won't be around in 25 years.

853
00:47:30,980 --> 00:47:31,240
What is the point?

854
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:32,440
Because we're being here now.

855
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:33,920
Be here now.

856
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:35,780
I'd rather be there then.

857
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:37,800
Be there then?

858
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:38,780
Yeah.

859
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:39,820
Yeah.

860
00:47:39,860 --> 00:47:40,760
I'm a thenist.

861
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,080
Princess We is the nowest among us.

862
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:45,660
It's always now for her.

863
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:46,600
There is no then.

864
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,340
There's no before, no after.

865
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:50,000
It's always now.

866
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,000


867
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,000


868
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,000


869
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,000


870
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,000


871
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,000


872
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,000


873
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:50,000


874
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:55,580
There's always a continuous now point, skidding through the universe of time.

875
00:47:56,760 --> 00:48:03,740
In the hardly read ever novel that I wrote entitled Neighborworld, there's three ideas

876
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,300
of time.

877
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:09,040
There's the then, which is indistinct and just covers everything that just happened

878
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,600
before then happened, or that then is.

879
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:15,740
There's the now, which is the very same moment, and they're shaping up.

880
00:48:15,860 --> 00:48:19,620
Rather than the future, there's the idea of shaping up.

881
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:24,740
That things could go in one direction or another, but sometimes they go both directions.

882
00:48:25,040 --> 00:48:25,340
Right.

883
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:35,220
Now, according to some, anything that can happen will happen in some universe or another,

884
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:42,240
and that every atom breaks off a whole new universe every time it has a change.

885
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:48,480
So that's a heck load of a lot of universes, because you got a few atoms to deal with.

886
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:49,100
Yeah.

887
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:50,900
And then your atoms have atoms.

888
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:58,380
Every flea has another flea upon its back to bite them, and those fleas have smaller

889
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,040
fleas, and so ad infinitum, or something like that.

890
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:03,340
Yeah, exactly.

891
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,120
And what's-

892
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:05,560
So that's a lot of universes.

893
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:06,380
Yeah.

894
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:14,100
So what do the exfolates, those that we might refer to from Planet X, which we'll call exfolates,

895
00:49:14,840 --> 00:49:18,560
because they do remove some of the skin and some of the air from your body.

896
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:19,080
Yeah.

897
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:19,080


898
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:20,960
What do they view-

899
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:23,500
Well, that's just a transformation.

900
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,940
... and need some time and a little bit of the strength and some theory, so to speak.

901
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,840
I mean, they might like a little more of you.

902
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,340
I don't want to scare the listeners about the exes removing the skin.

903
00:49:32,480 --> 00:49:41,640
True, when the subgeniuses are ruptured, they will seem to be burning up alive, but that's

904
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,120
just casting off-

905
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:43,700
Yeah, just a little.

906
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:45,720
That's just casting off the old shell.

907
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:48,980
That's like changing your shoes, the way we-

908
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,200
The way we look at it.

909
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:57,980
When you rematerialize, you will rematerialize however you want to look.

910
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:03,160
So you better really give that some thought, friends.

911
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:08,600
You don't want to have some half muddled ... You don't want to, right at the moment of rupture,

912
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:13,600
when the exes come and Bob's promise comes true and you get your new body, you don't

913
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:18,400
want to be still trying to make up your mind between looking like the Incredible Hulk,

914
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:20,260
or Britney Spears.

915
00:50:20,360 --> 00:50:20,800
Right.

916
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:23,200
You don't want to be ... You have one or the other.

917
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:25,140
Get that image defined.

918
00:50:25,740 --> 00:50:30,020
Yeah, your face could come up as Hulk, and your body's Britney Spears looking real hot,

919
00:50:30,180 --> 00:50:31,280
or vice versa.

920
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:31,940
Right.

921
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:36,800
Or other body parts too, but I think the head is probably the most important commandment.

922
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,180
Do any of our listeners even remember who Britney Spears is, or is that too long ago?

923
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,840
That's old person music now.

924
00:50:44,140 --> 00:50:45,080
Or even Hulk Hogan.

925
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:48,660
I doubt if very many of them remember who he is other than he was-

926
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:48,940
Yeah.

927
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:48,960
... the last few centuries.

928
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:48,960


929
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:53,180
Isn't he president of Wisconsin or Minneapolis or something?

930
00:50:54,120 --> 00:51:00,420
I think he was president of Racine or somewhere near Milwaukee, but I don't know.

931
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:06,120
I don't know much about Wisconsin or Minnesota because too many people with flat feet up

932
00:51:06,120 --> 00:51:06,340
there.

933
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,100
You know?

934
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,680
I bet Hulk Hogan could kick Al Franken's butt.

935
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:14,360
Well, he wouldn't want to kick Al Franken's butt down.

936
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:14,380
Physically.

937
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:18,960
No, I wouldn't want to get into a debate situation or stand up comedy might be a good

938
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:18,960


939
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:18,960


940
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:18,960


941
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:18,960


942
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:18,960


943
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:19,020
idea.

944
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:22,920
I think he was a very different ... But one's a governor and one's a senator, right?

945
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:25,420
And Hulk Hogan was a governor.

946
00:51:26,260 --> 00:51:28,960
Yes, he was a duly elected governor.

947
00:51:29,340 --> 00:51:33,140
I loved it when wrestlers were becoming governors.

948
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:41,960
Wrestlers and circus strongmen, Arnold Schwarzenegger and rock stars.

949
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:43,980
Yeah, man.

950
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:44,960
That's who should be politicians.

951
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:46,320
And movie actors.

952
00:51:46,540 --> 00:51:46,640
Rock stars.

953
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:47,620
Movie actors.

954
00:51:47,620 --> 00:51:48,380
Yeah, yeah.

955
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:49,680
That Ronald ... What's his name?

956
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:50,620
The cowboy guy.

957
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:51,400
Yeah.

958
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,420
He was ... He got elected to something and there was ... There'd been ... Yeah.

959
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:57,620
Who knew?

960
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:01,220
I didn't ... And that brilliant politician rocker Ted Nugent.

961
00:52:01,540 --> 00:52:03,120
The great philosopher.

962
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:04,040
Mm-hmm.

963
00:52:04,180 --> 00:52:04,560
Right.

964
00:52:05,140 --> 00:52:06,460
And radio personality.

965
00:52:06,980 --> 00:52:07,100
What a brain.

966
00:52:07,100 --> 00:52:08,760
Hey, he's got a lot more listeners than we do.

967
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:17,240
That proves that most people are stupid with an E. They're ignorant with an E.

968
00:52:17,340 --> 00:52:17,600
Stupid.

969
00:52:18,980 --> 00:52:19,460
Yeah.

970
00:52:19,560 --> 00:52:20,040
Ignorant.

971
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:26,260
I can see him in my mind right now with the old crossbow and the clenched teeth, you know,

972
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:27,700
the gritting teeth and stuff.

973
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:29,900
He's going to kill somebody or something.

974
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:35,540
And I just ... I often wonder how people like this become ... get to be president like

975
00:52:35,540 --> 00:52:36,980
they are nowadays many times.

976
00:52:37,260 --> 00:52:39,500
Or at least Senator from Milwaukee.

977
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:41,840
Well, Bob explained it.

978
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:42,560
J.R.

979
00:52:42,580 --> 00:52:46,320
Bob Dobbs said, you know how dumb the average person is?

980
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:47,600
Well, by mathematical theory.

981
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:51,280
By mathematical definition of average, half of them are dumber than that.

982
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:53,100
So ...

983
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:53,680
Dang, you would have ...

984
00:52:53,680 --> 00:52:54,900
Sad but true.

985
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:55,900
That is sad.

986
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,640
You would have to admit though that we are up against ... we as all the kind of dumb

987
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,420
people except for the Sun ... said Jeannie, she's a big chair.

988
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:05,640
Kind of dumb.

989
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:14,380
Are up against a mega, mega monstrous PR thing that stretches all the way from the heart

990
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:17,580
of the media, of all media, to the heart of the media.

991
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:17,580


992
00:53:17,580 --> 00:53:19,380
She's boshing Shee to the seat.

993
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:26,160
Which is the heart of the matter whether the universe element on here.

994
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:27,860
You're going to do something for, you know what freaks you out?

995
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:29,620
I'll John gravitate to you and ask you, wish on the internet .

996
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:29,620


997
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:29,620


998
00:53:29,620 --> 00:53:31,840
Nevertheless, the media right now ...

999
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:33,300
It's just a college radio station.

1000
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:33,900
But goodbye.

1001
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:35,800
There's no place to dance.

1002
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:36,880
It's perfect for Shakespeare, but it's plainly there!

1003
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,520
I watch every TV.

1004
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,620
invite you

1005
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:42,440


1006
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:42,440


1007
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,280
in my head.

1008
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:45,200
there that are listening by internet.

1009
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:49,040
And Dave, don't you work

1010
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,280
in the

1011
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:52,800
news media?

1012
00:53:52,980 --> 00:53:54,680
I don't want to name names or anything

1013
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:57,220
so as to get you or them fired

1014
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:58,240
or up or

1015
00:53:59,060 --> 00:54:00,960
burned at the stake, but...

1016
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,220
Yeah, but

1017
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:04,580
it was none of my choosing.

1018
00:54:04,740 --> 00:54:06,500
It was the poor people of my village.

1019
00:54:06,700 --> 00:54:08,360
After the tanks came in,

1020
00:54:08,460 --> 00:54:11,180
the big garbage tanks that they put

1021
00:54:11,180 --> 00:54:13,220
on the bio-recyclables

1022
00:54:13,220 --> 00:54:15,000
and stuff like that, we could

1023
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:16,680
hardly put together enough of

1024
00:54:16,680 --> 00:54:19,000
both aluminum foil for our

1025
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,180
hats, cheese for our bellies,

1026
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,920
and various types of

1027
00:54:22,920 --> 00:54:25,040
cellulose for our mismarkings.

1028
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,820
And in times before,

1029
00:54:26,980 --> 00:54:28,420
and that's why we asked Father Grumman,

1030
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:31,180
he came all the way from the United States to help us,

1031
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,020
but all he could do was get killed

1032
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,860
with the rest of us.

1033
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,780
So, in my own personal

1034
00:54:36,780 --> 00:54:38,780
humble opinion, that's why I've chosen

1035
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:40,560
Bob. Not as my personal avatar,

1036
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:40,960
but

1037
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,580
just, you know,

1038
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:43,780
I felt like choosing him.

1039
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,820
Or choosing him, excuse me.

1040
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:47,800
You felt like what?

1041
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:49,120
Choosing him.

1042
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:50,980
Yeah.

1043
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,380
Saying, Bob, you're the one,

1044
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,340
the only one, only one, only one

1045
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:56,760
Bob.

1046
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,440
Do you think that impressed Bob?

1047
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,900
I mean, I know other people named Bob, but I mean,

1048
00:55:01,980 --> 00:55:04,560
who among them puts, you know, quotation marks

1049
00:55:04,560 --> 00:55:05,400
around his name?

1050
00:55:05,860 --> 00:55:07,300
Only the Bob.

1051
00:55:08,620 --> 00:55:09,320
All right.

1052
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:09,800
All right.

1053
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,480
I had to go all grammar Nazi on somebody

1054
00:55:13,160 --> 00:55:15,500
over the lack of, I was polite about it.

1055
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:18,160
I explained that, yes, we are grammar Nazis about the quote

1056
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:19,800
because the quote is part of his name.

1057
00:55:20,060 --> 00:55:21,600
It's on his birth certificate.

1058
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:22,020
Yes.

1059
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:25,920
Bob doesn't, isn't short for Robert and the quotes are his

1060
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:26,360
name.

1061
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:26,860
Yes.

1062
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,260
Otherwise, it's just any old Bob.

1063
00:55:29,380 --> 00:55:31,540
Any old gimme Bob, I'm a Bob.

1064
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:32,980
Right.

1065
00:55:32,980 --> 00:55:39,780
You know, Roberts, physicians for Roberts instead of doctors for Bob.

1066
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:39,780


1067
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:39,780


1068
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:39,780


1069
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:39,780


1070
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:39,780


1071
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:39,780


1072
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:39,780


1073
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:39,780


1074
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:39,780


1075
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:39,780


1076
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:39,780


1077
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:39,780


1078
00:55:39,780 --> 00:55:42,100
To be some old flat footed Minnesotan.

1079
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,740
Hey, I have to, I have to end this charade and the show right now.

1080
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:50,880
It's because it's time to end this show, right?

1081
00:55:51,100 --> 00:55:56,280
Friends, you're listening to Hour of Slack number 1521.

1082
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:05,700
And subgenius.com is where all previous shows are stashed and also logs and websites and

1083
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:09,220
about what did we get to over 2000?

1084
00:56:09,780 --> 00:56:10,860
200,000 files.

1085
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:12,240
It's filled, filled up.

1086
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,060
200,000.

1087
00:56:14,060 --> 00:56:14,360
Good.

1088
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:14,560
Me.

1089
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,120
Couldn't he?

1090
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:15,340
Okay.

1091
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,080
We've been listening to Einstein's secret orchestra, which disco in the background.

1092
00:56:21,460 --> 00:56:25,840
And I'm going to end that and I'm going to play a song.

1093
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:29,940
It's very short, but, and not very sweet.

1094
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,900
Bob is the man.

1095
00:56:34,880 --> 00:56:36,340
Their name isn't on here.

1096
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,640
The cybernetic strawberries.

1097
00:56:37,840 --> 00:56:38,620
I think.

1098
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:39,760
I believe.

1099
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:40,200
I believe that.

1100
00:56:42,420 --> 00:56:43,040
God.

1101
00:56:44,940 --> 00:56:47,680
I may have to splice the name in later.

1102
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:49,980
The cryogenic strawberries.

1103
00:56:50,480 --> 00:56:53,940
It is the cryogenic strawberries.

1104
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:55,580
Anyway.

1105
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:57,760
Thank you, Dave.

1106
00:56:59,380 --> 00:56:59,980
The fade out.

1107
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,120
Thank you.

1108
00:57:01,120 --> 00:57:05,040
I am so heartfully thankful and grateful.

1109
00:57:05,180 --> 00:57:06,580
It's been real, Dave.

1110
00:57:23,740 --> 00:57:31,300
I may have had a cold but I can meet you.

1111
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:31,300


1112
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:31,300


1113
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:31,300


1114
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:31,300


1115
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:31,300


1116
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:31,300


1117
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:31,840
Starving.

1118
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:34,420
ahorning oddly.

1119
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:34,420


1120
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:36,220
Bob doesn't have aAL wearing these enquanto

1121
00:57:36,220 --> 00:57:36,220


1122
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:38,140
Nobody빼

1123
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:38,140


1124
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:06,280
Now everybody

1125
00:58:09,780 --> 00:58:16,120
Bob the King

1126
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:38,000
Bob put it in Ayn Rand

1127
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,520
Bob

1128
00:58:39,780 --> 00:58:41,780
Bob put it in Iron Man!

1129
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,440
Bob put it in Iron Man!
