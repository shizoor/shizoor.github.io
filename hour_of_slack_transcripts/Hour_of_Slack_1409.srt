1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:09,840
Yes, dear friends.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,420
Thank you for calling J.B. Smith.

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,440
I will be returning to this telephone number on Tuesday,

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:21,780
so please leave a message for me,

5
00:00:21,820 --> 00:00:24,200
and I will return your call at that time.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:24,960
Thank you.

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:28,960
Well, another very sad moment.

8
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:34,900
A message meaning that you will not be away till Tuesday.

9
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,780
I don't know.

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,380
These calls are getting more and more and more expensive.

11
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:47,880
Mr. Smith, it would behold you to stay in your room

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,140
until you are called either by a major studio,

13
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,780
Branson, Missouri, or God.

14
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,980
You're missing the most important,

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,500
important thing in your life.

16
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:04,360
That is your dear friend and talent,

17
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,320
former star, Jonathan Winters.

18
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,940
Righter side?

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,640
Two words, who cares?

20
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,120
You know, we're only visitors.

21
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,100
Bye-bye, and remember the Prince of Darkness

22
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,840
is with us 24 hours a day.

23
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,760
Regardless of light,

24
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,200
the Prince of Darkness can deal with it.

25
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,720
Heavy.

26
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:33,960
This is Smith.

27
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,140
Please leave a message for me,

28
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,800
and happy Easter to you.

29
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,960
Here comes Peter Cottontail

30
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,600
Up and down the dusty trail

31
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,040
Yeah, the bunny song

32
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,060
The bunny song

33
00:01:58,060 --> 00:01:59,980
Cutting through the snow

34
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


35
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,480
Colored eggs

36
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,880
How do you think the bunny does that?

37
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:03,760
Hmm?

38
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,520
He takes dye

39
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,480
Yeah, colored dye and drinks it

40
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,820
Sometimes purple

41
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,320
Sometimes red

42
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,720
Sometimes black

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,680
Yellow

44
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,960
Green

45
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,320
Blue

46
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,300
Chartreuse

47
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,620
Indigo

48
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,940
And so forth and so on

49
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:42,800
The subgenius hour of swatting

50
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:47,280
Everybody must get stoned

51
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:54,440
The subgenius hour of swatting

52
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,780
Thanks for calling J.B. Smith.

53
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,340
If you would please leave your name and telephone number,

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,600
I'll return your call just as soon as possible.

55
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:06,600
Thank you.

56
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:13,820
Yes, Mr. Smith, this is Dr. Death in Indianapolis.

57
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,740
I've been putting people to sleep and out of their misery for a number of years now.

58
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:27,000
The government has stepped in and slapped a lot of suits against me for doing this.

59
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,760
However, a lot of people have been relieved by the government.

60
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,040
I've going to go to my own home soil now.

61
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:32,040


62
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,840
Dr. Ethic不能 policy

63
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:39,900
Phew...

64
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:44,000
Oh, I got to go to the room, wait a minute, maybe I have to allege a little.

65
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,000


66
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:44,200
Thank you.

67
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,960
Quit that.

68
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,540
Give them a chance to help me here.

69
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:46,660
Talking to age

70
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,460
Yeah

71
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:51,500
but women really do?

72
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:52,040
Yeah.

73
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,040


74
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:52,080
We've had children with disabilities.

75
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,500
So some people have the same,

76
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,740
separate mental health levels.

77
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:08,600
and I hope you'll call me, area code 617-478-1000, Dr. Death.

78
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:12,240
And I'd be only too happy to fly out there.

79
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:17,520
The only expenses you would incur would be my flight out,

80
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,660
which of course would be first class because you're going to have a first class death.

81
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,780
And that would be out and back to Indianapolis.

82
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:30,640
I'll take care of my own arrangements at some motel near you.

83
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:36,120
And I hope that you'll get back to me in all fairness and just let me know

84
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:40,320
because I've got lots of people on my agenda and my list here.

85
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,480
So please let me know one way or another if you decide to take your own life or just sweat it out.

86
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,680
I would be only too happy to be informed.

87
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:54,040
Inform me as soon as you can, would you?

88
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,440
In the meantime.

89
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,760
As Dr. Death says, even though death is knocking at your door,

90
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,560
it could be tomorrow or forevermore.

91
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,080
Thank you.

92
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,060
Not clever, but the best we can do with the many patients that I've been seeing

93
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,100
that occasionally depress me.

94
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:14,760
Have a good day.

95
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,060
Yes, dear friends.

96
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:25,100
As we record this at WCSB Cleveland, tomorrow is tax day.

97
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,620
April 15th.

98
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:30,620
And the subgenius taxes, yeah, I'm afraid there are such things,

99
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:36,000
are going to be filed late thanks to Jonathan Winters dying.

100
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,260
It's tribute time.

101
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:45,340
And I've got an hour of rare, secret, unreleased, uncensored special recordings ready to go.

102
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,020
For you see, friends, St. Jonathan Harshman Winters III,

103
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:55,640
born on Kennedy Day, 1925, an Ohio boy,

104
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,820
was a huge influence on many of us older subgenius spouters and blabbermouths,

105
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,400
even before the Firesign Theater.

106
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:10,540
Some of you might remember Jonathan Winters only for his roles on various live TV sitcoms,

107
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,060
but I never saw those.

108
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:18,140
As a child, I was educated by his comedy albums, thanks to my parents.

109
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,620
And later, I was blown away by the stuff I'll be playing tonight,

110
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:25,760
which is mostly ad-libbed outtakes from various commercials,

111
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,680
and also some of the special recording sessions,

112
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,820
recordings which I obtained as a young assistant sound man.

113
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:37,100
Actually, friends, I found most of these recordings on the internet today,

114
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,880
although mine are better versions, I must say.

115
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:45,500
And thanks to Philo and Jonathan Winters' agent, Jim Smith,

116
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,660
heh, Agent Smith,

117
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:52,480
we also have a string of phone messages that Winters left on his agent's phone.

118
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,440
Now, Reverend Baby Bear did our titles,

119
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,040
but everything else tonight will be Jonathan Winters,

120
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,860
not performing in front of crowds,

121
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:04,500
but just for his old buddy or his fellow actors in various recording sessions.

122
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,860
And so, dear friends, please settle in for a long Winters night.

123
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,940
Well, the other fellas are wonderful.

124
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,020
The warden's a nice guy.

125
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,840
Here comes Mel. Hi, warden.

126
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,120
Hi, listen, boys.

127
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,000
Now, you've got to shape up.

128
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:25,760
A lot of us in our dramatic classes and clay and our fun times on Sunday,

129
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:26,620
Father Duffy.

130
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:28,060
Yes, I know, boys.

131
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:31,020
Father Duffy's a wonderful person, and I want you guys...

132
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,280
I didn't know the warden was a queer.

133
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,020
Listen, we're all queers, dear.

134
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,520
We're creative people.

135
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,080
We can put the fires out in your prison.

136
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,540
Just for that, your radio's taken away, Junkie.

137
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,100
You don't get to hear the prison jokes.

138
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:48,500
All right, uh...

139
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,220
Philo, some adventures.

140
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,260
I gotta... I'm trying to find this character here.

141
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:54,840
You're first.

142
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,920
I know. I'm sorry. I didn't... I lost my hand.

143
00:07:58,980 --> 00:07:59,800
We're just gonna do it for time.

144
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:00,160
Okay.

145
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,720
Mr. Strasburg won't wait for you, dear. You're all over.

146
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:04,160
Henry Fonda gets the part, after all.

147
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:07,660
Straighten up, honey.

148
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,940
Tear your clothes off and live the part, Judas Priest.

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:10,620
It's Adam and Eve.

150
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:13,380
Don't come in here with some high-miller shoes and a dress on, for God's sake.

151
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,000
It's an Adam and Eve role.

152
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,880
Broadway will eat it up.

153
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,920
You got a great body and a voice.

154
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:17,600
Sing it out, honey.

155
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:21,200
Sure, you don't like to be naked, but you're getting $400 a week in Boston, New Haven,

156
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,440
and a thousand if you score.

157
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:24,260
We'll have an affair.

158
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,180
All right.

159
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,880
A salad should be tossed, not bossed.

160
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:32,780
That's why I, Fussy Piper, use only tender, well-mannered garlic in my chef salad dressing.

161
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,520
Folks!

162
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,660
Stop there and radio land.

163
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,820
Today, the Reverend R.D. Sopter will be brought to you.

164
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:43,240
A real down-to-earth religious fanatic who saves buildings and then the people.

165
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:44,380
How about that, boys and girls?

166
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,240
Get your decoder pins.

167
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,080
Forget letters on that.

168
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,840
I'm dissolving, Johnny. I'm dissolving.

169
00:08:54,330 --> 00:08:55,970
I wonder why I don't have my own show.

170
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:56,830
I tell the truth.

171
00:08:59,250 --> 00:09:00,010
Go ahead, honey.

172
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:00,730
Try to leave the park.

173
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:03,790
I'll tell you why.

174
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,710
Because I was kidding you.

175
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:06,330
I'm a Blue Jay.

176
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:08,450
It's another $25 Chatelle.

177
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,390
I got those guys all screwed up.

178
00:09:11,490 --> 00:09:12,690
I had seven of them after me.

179
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:14,510
Are you really?

180
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,810
Why did you say you're from outer space?

181
00:09:15,950 --> 00:09:16,570
Because I am.

182
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:18,030
Now, don't say that.

183
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:19,050
Have you been out there?

184
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:20,850
See, that's the important thing.

185
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,570
Nobody's been there.

186
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:22,690
They got six clowns.

187
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:26,810
One Marine officer and the rest of the Navy guys trying to get a piece of cement up in the air.

188
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:29,570
I believe in flying saucers.

189
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:30,610
I talked to a clown the other day.

190
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:31,410
He said, that's a lot of jazz.

191
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,130
I said, are you reading Popular Mechanics or looking out?

192
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,930
I said, I've never seen any, but there are 400 billion stars out there.

193
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:40,450
Is this the only hip planet?

194
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:43,890
Everybody's got to see everything.

195
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,070
They're all, you know, from Missouri.

196
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:46,150
I got to see it.

197
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:46,950
I don't believe anything.

198
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:51,870
It's going to happen, boy, when we land.

199
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:56,610
Not going to be like H.G. Wells or any of the clowns, you know, space after dark and all that.

200
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:01,510
Come in on Halloween so that it's a big joke anyway.

201
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,570
You know, trick or treat.

202
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:04,890
Charles Adams thing and say, hello, lady.

203
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:06,590
I'm from Mars.

204
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,350
Oh, you got a wonderful costume on.

205
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:11,290
All right, next.

206
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:14,790
What a great way.

207
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,250
We'd never attack on Christmas.

208
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,430
But Halloween is meat for us.

209
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,850
And all the little kids, welcome to Disney.

210
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,070
Oh, good.

211
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:22,690
Look at him, boy.

212
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,070
He looks all fuzzy and green and everything.

213
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,970
All right, we're ready to go.

214
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:28,850
Two to top, 14.

215
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,690
By the name, what is your last name, doctor?

216
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,230
I haven't figured that one out.

217
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,670
Well, Judas Priest, Doc.

218
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:36,050
I mean.

219
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:36,650
That's it.

220
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,370
Judas Priest.

221
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,110
That's it.

222
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:38,850
Goodness.

223
00:10:38,870 --> 00:10:40,430
Of course, I can tell by the secret ring.

224
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:46,670
Doctor, I'm in here because my wife, I'm not, I'm not able to score.

225
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,070
I hate to put it in that vein.

226
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:49,790
What do you suggest?

227
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:51,830
Well, just bring your wife or a friend.

228
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:51,830


229
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:51,830


230
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:51,830


231
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:51,830


232
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:51,830


233
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:51,830


234
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:51,830


235
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,070
I'm not going to put her in here.

236
00:10:52,170 --> 00:10:52,990
I see what's the trouble.

237
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:53,750
I couldn't just.

238
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,550
You mean you take advantage of my wife?

239
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:56,190
No, no.

240
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,610
I take the couch out before she comes.

241
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:58,970
Oh, I'm sorry.

242
00:10:58,970 --> 00:10:58,990
Yes.

243
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:00,230
Okay, Doc.

244
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,450
You're a wonderful person.

245
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:08,030
My little boy's going to take advantage of my little dog.

246
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:09,770
It's a sick family, Doc.

247
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:13,390
It's a very teddy bear with sawdust all over the floor.

248
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:17,330
Let's run this one down.

249
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:18,690
It'll be tight, huh?

250
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,810
All right, so, where are the sports?

251
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,630
Good afternoon, sports.

252
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:21,810
Thank you.

253
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:21,810


254
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:21,810


255
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:21,810


256
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:21,810


257
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:21,810


258
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:21,810


259
00:11:21,830 --> 00:11:22,070
Well, let's move it there.

260
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:23,010
There's a beautiful lake and certainly is a beautiful lake.

261
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,650
A little lightning over there.

262
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:30,230
However, there's a snow storm and here is one of the all-time greats Chick Harburg.

263
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,050
Chick, what do you think about the game so far here at half time?

264
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:37,270
Well, it's hard to say.

265
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:46,490
Both teams have taken the air a lot, have been tremendous groundwork for both teams.

266
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,490
I enjoyed the Willerton High School band.

267
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:51,650
It gave me a feeling of warmth.

268
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:51,810
Yeah.

269
00:11:51,830 --> 00:11:53,390
of seeing the youth of America

270
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:56,490
with 20 degrees below zero

271
00:11:56,490 --> 00:11:58,230
blowing their little horns,

272
00:11:58,830 --> 00:12:00,130
playing their instruments,

273
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,470
those girls in the naked legs,

274
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:06,870
letting America know that they're there.

275
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:08,570
Thank you, Chuck.

276
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,110
Jesus, pathetic.

277
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,230
Well, friends, that's it.

278
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:14,030
And in the meantime, don't forget

279
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,110
Carlton's Cool Shave.

280
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:19,150
When you step up in front of that mirror

281
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:21,130
in the morning or at night

282
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:22,030
or whenever you shave,

283
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:23,890
always go,

284
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:28,190
and the whole side of your face is open, Jack.

285
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:32,110
Done.

286
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:33,190
It was a pleasure.

287
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:34,790
Thank you, buddy.

288
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:35,310
Bye-bye.

289
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:35,990
Good to work with you.

290
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:37,810
Good luck, Gil.

291
00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:40,410
To the women out there who are listening in

292
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:41,570
at our noontime program,

293
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:43,210
it's now 1.03,

294
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:45,390
and our next platter is

295
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:47,030
Roy Bean and the Beaneries.

296
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,290
Let's give it a listen.

297
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,470
G-B-E.

298
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:53,430
Jesus, Roy, you goofed on the bringer.

299
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:54,130
Oh, I'm sorry.

300
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:57,210
Um, friends, we don't have that record

301
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,470
with us this afternoon,

302
00:12:58,610 --> 00:13:00,390
but a guy just stepped in here,

303
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:01,450
Tony Burlow,

304
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,790
one of the all-time great singers,

305
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,470
has a new record out called Fancy Fuzzies.

306
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:06,550
Ah.

307
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,430
How's it going with you?

308
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,470
Crazy, man.

309
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:11,130
Like, I've been pressing a lot of things,

310
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:13,650
and I've been flipping over your show, man.

311
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:14,230
It's too much.

312
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,510
I mean, like, how do you come on?

313
00:13:15,590 --> 00:13:17,950
Like, steel balls and a steel striking pitchfork.

314
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:18,890
Ha, ha, ha.

315
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,110
What kind of a kick are you on?

316
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:23,150
It was right up in the paper here

317
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:23,930
that you were a narcotic.

318
00:13:24,030 --> 00:13:26,290
Yeah, yeah, man, but like I take in the back,

319
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,290
I scratch wrists, you know.

320
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:28,770
Crazy.

321
00:13:29,370 --> 00:13:29,890
Mm-hmm.

322
00:13:30,270 --> 00:13:32,190
Well, you heard it, boys and girls out there.

323
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:35,110
Instead of exchanging those silly little baseball cards

324
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,830
or hearts for Valentine's Day,

325
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:38,370
be a poppy pal,

326
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:40,270
and this year, wear the real ones.

327
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:40,870
Huh?

328
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,010
Okay, kids.

329
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:44,070
And here's for all our little poppy pals

330
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,150
who sent in those dope letters.

331
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,870
Here's a little thing entitled

332
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:49,050
Swinging All the Way.

333
00:13:49,530 --> 00:13:50,830
I dig my parents.

334
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,110
I dig my parents.

335
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:51,250
I dig my parents.

336
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:51,570
And fair as day,

337
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,550
we swing all the way.

338
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:53,810
Here you go.

339
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,190
Let's pick up the music.

340
00:13:55,550 --> 00:13:55,910
Crazy.

341
00:13:56,030 --> 00:13:56,490
You like it, Bob?

342
00:13:56,610 --> 00:13:57,770
Yeah, man, like everybody moves.

343
00:13:57,970 --> 00:13:58,650
Elvis is back.

344
00:13:58,830 --> 00:13:59,090
Ha, ha.

345
00:13:59,190 --> 00:13:59,690
Good boy.

346
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:01,770
Better than World War V.

347
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:04,150
Elvis, how do you feel?

348
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:05,910
Jesus, I never felt better.

349
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,090
That damn army boy like to beat this shit.

350
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,390
Watch where I'm on the air, Elvis.

351
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:10,710
Hey, come on.

352
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:11,850
Whew.

353
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:13,970
What'd you do over in Germany?

354
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,590
I told them crats by God

355
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:18,670
that I was one of the king rock and rollers,

356
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:20,790
and I told my lieutenant and the general and everything.

357
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,450
I told them to kiss my elbow.

358
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,510
Well, Elvis, I'm sorry.

359
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,910
I see your language is still limited.

360
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:26,630
That's right.

361
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:27,270
I don't care.

362
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:28,910
I got five million dollars.

363
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:29,550
Ha, ha.

364
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:31,150
Mm-hmm.

365
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:31,930
Here you go.

366
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:34,770
Well, you'll never record for Capitol.

367
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,290
I don't care.

368
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,070
I got moon killing it.

369
00:14:36,270 --> 00:14:38,290
I put silver dollars in the machines in Vegas.

370
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,030
Silver dollars.

371
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:39,770
Don't know Roy Gene.

372
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:40,410
There's my agent.

373
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,470
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

374
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:42,630
He's an idiot.

375
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:45,950
Number three.

376
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:47,590
Number three.

377
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:49,510
Hey.

378
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,110
Ha, ha, ha.

379
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:52,290
Ha, ha, ha.

380
00:14:52,290 --> 00:14:53,210
Number three.

381
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:55,930
Number three.

382
00:14:56,010 --> 00:14:59,870
And, friends, that was some of that Jonathan Winters material

383
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,210
from outtakes, I guess,

384
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:07,550
from some commercial recording doing an ad.

385
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:12,030
There's a bunch more for when he was doing

386
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:14,150
some hefty garbage bag coming up.

387
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:19,670
In fact, the one coming up after two phone messages

388
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:20,770
may be a fake.

389
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,070
I don't know.

390
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:21,070


391
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:21,070


392
00:15:21,070 --> 00:15:23,630
It's offensive to some tender sensibilities

393
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:27,350
since its racial humor of the 60s

394
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:30,110
before white guys imitating black guys

395
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:32,130
became officially bad taste.

396
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,670
But, you know, if you're looking for taste in a religion,

397
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,730
try McDonald's or Waffle House.

398
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,650
That's my favorite.

399
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:40,950
It's the one I prefer.

400
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:45,270
Official bad taste food of the church and subgenius.

401
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:45,850
Ha, ha, ha.

402
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:49,330
In fact, I'll probably tack that.

403
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:50,750
The racially offensive,

404
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:57,570
offensive routine onto the end of the internet-only version of this show, which would be downloadable

405
00:15:57,570 --> 00:16:06,890
at subgenius.com, but which I would not inflict upon all of the listeners of WCSB. Most of them

406
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:11,850
would probably be perfectly cool with it, but there's always somebody who just doesn't get it.

407
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:15,610
Now, friends, you know, in the world of Church of the Subgenius,

408
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:24,730
we have our own sort of Jonathan Winters, which would, of course, be Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

409
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:36,150
an uncontrolled eruption of spewing character voices and accents, which tend to go surreal

410
00:16:36,150 --> 00:16:41,630
fairly quickly, as we'll probably be hearing any minute now.

411
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,590
As we'll probably be hearing any minute now.

412
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:48,030
With any luck, anyway.

413
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:54,150
Well, I guess Dave's time control is all over the place.

414
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:54,670
I guess.

415
00:16:55,110 --> 00:17:01,290
Like the characters in his head. Princess Weave, did your parents have Jonathan Winters' comedy albums?

416
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:07,490
Oh, my goodness, yes. I definitely grew up with Jonathan Winters as part of my family,

417
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:08,670
as far as I was concerned.

418
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,610
But those were the clean ones?

419
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:12,170
The clean ones.

420
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,950
Yes. Yes. But he was a...

421
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:17,910
a huge presence in my young life.

422
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:19,910
He wasn't a small man.

423
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:21,270
No.

424
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:28,530
Yeah, I remember thinking, gosh, I wish I had the ability to suddenly go into characters like that

425
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:33,690
and sort of spout like as if I was somebody different from what I was or am,

426
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,890
if I even knew what that was going to be.

427
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:36,430
Oh, wait a minute.

428
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:39,850
I think I was just using somebody else's character.

429
00:17:40,570 --> 00:17:43,610
And I think that is the truth, too.

430
00:17:44,190 --> 00:17:44,710
Yeah.

431
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,350
Oh, well.

432
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,550
You are just using someone else's.

433
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:55,610
I've only got like five or six personalities, really, that I can call upon.

434
00:17:56,570 --> 00:18:02,090
And I can't get all of them out just in front of everybody because, you know,

435
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,110
some people don't like to see that.

436
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:10,830
But Dave, on the other hand, can't stop.

437
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,550
In fact, let's see if we can stop him now.

438
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,290
Dave?

439
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:16,430
Dave?

440
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:16,650
Hello?

441
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:17,850
Oh, there we go.

442
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,030
Yeah, what happened?

443
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:24,730
Are you still there?

444
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:25,530
That's not Dave.

445
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:27,490
This is a different Dave.

446
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:29,950
Yes, this is a different Dave.

447
00:18:29,990 --> 00:18:32,690
This is a.k.a. Reverend Angry Lair.

448
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:39,850
Well, I was wondering when somebody would hijack Dave's place when we were waiting for Dave to call.

449
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,190
I know.

450
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:42,110
I heard that.

451
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:44,370
And that's why I was like, okay, well, I better call.

452
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:45,190
Uh-huh.

453
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,350
Oh, well, I think Dave's as good as another.

454
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,850
You know, I told Dave that he could only talk for ten minutes on this show.

455
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,890
Because it really is going to be all Jonathan Winters.

456
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:56,250
Well, that's fine.

457
00:18:56,370 --> 00:19:03,650
Actually, when I thought of the news, I put all of my Jonathan Winters records on sale at Weirdsville Records.

458
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,870
Is that Weirdsville Records in Detroit?

459
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:09,550
I sold quite a few Jonathan Winters records at the store.

460
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,330
Oh, good.

461
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:14,290
Well, the stuff we're playing tonight is not on any records.

462
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:14,790
I don't.

463
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,310
I think.

464
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,170
No, I don't think so.

465
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:24,250
Well, I got the impression that his phone calls to his agent ended up on an audio book somehow.

466
00:19:25,190 --> 00:19:27,310
I have hand-selected those.

467
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:28,950
Yeah.

468
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:29,410
Well.

469
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:34,350
I haven't heard any of that stuff that you've been playing on any of his records, though.

470
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:44,590
So we've got popular dead Dave, but we don't have lonesome live Dave.

471
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:45,770
Yeah.

472
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,370
It would be great to have a two-headed Dave show.

473
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:50,650
Yeah, Dool and Dave's.

474
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,450
Yeah.

475
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,490
Well, I mean, if you want, I can imitate Dave.

476
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:55,190
Go ahead.

477
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:55,630
Yeah.

478
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:03,230
I can do some of the other really, really weird voices that he does and kind of talk about things that are irrelevant.

479
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:05,950
About banana trees.

480
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:08,410
Stan, you know about banana trees, right?

481
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:13,850
Yeah, and rear elephants and manna trees falling from the sky.

482
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,750
Sure, sure, Dave.

483
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:16,250
And manna trees, yeah.

484
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:22,150
They grow up from the depths beyond the discos that are underneath the Earth's crust.

485
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:26,030
I don't know, man.

486
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,930
I think we need the lonesome Dave.

487
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:29,910
Right.

488
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:33,210
You're too popular of a Dave to really be that insane.

489
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,350
Because there is no other besides him.

490
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,450
So, yes, I do understand that.

491
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:44,650
And my apologies to the true lonesome.

492
00:20:44,650 --> 00:20:45,370
Cowboy Dave.

493
00:20:45,430 --> 00:20:48,830
But the Reverend Angry Larry cannot do him justice.

494
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,630
And that's fine.

495
00:20:49,970 --> 00:20:51,670
That was a pretty good Dave, though.

496
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:52,610
I thought.

497
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,570
I think it was.

498
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:54,490
I give you your due.

499
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:55,410
Here's the other Dave.

500
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:00,270
You know, it's a series of errant urinations caused my head to spin.

501
00:21:00,550 --> 00:21:06,550
And I forgot I was five minutes later than I was had I been staying in my yacht up on the.

502
00:21:06,910 --> 00:21:07,850
It's okay, Dave.

503
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:11,450
We had a Dave stand in who I think I just accidentally cut off.

504
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:14,550
Because I've never had two callers.

505
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:21,290
Once you have to put the caller one on hold and then push it, punch in caller two.

506
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:23,570
But I kind of forgot.

507
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:31,630
Well, anyway, we only have five more minutes left now to talk about you and your good old buddy, Jonathan Winters.

508
00:21:31,650 --> 00:21:35,510
So can you tell us any, you know, anecdotes from your.

509
00:21:35,550 --> 00:21:37,490
Well, I use your affair with him.

510
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,910
I'm in my my affair from my affair, my actual affair.

511
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:41,550
Yeah.

512
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:44,490
Well, he was a rude man.

513
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:50,370
Sometimes we'd go to restaurants and we'd, you know, whatever I'd order, he'd want to order.

514
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,890
And I'd say, of course, well, that's two, you know, and then we can't share and stuff like that.

515
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,290
And he'd get very brushed.

516
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:58,130
One time he punched a waiter in the stomach.

517
00:21:58,770 --> 00:21:59,170
Wow.

518
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,210
The main sail of his yacht completely naked.

519
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:04,510
Goodness.

520
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:05,390
As you remember.

521
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:06,850
Oh, yeah.

522
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,870
He kind of made the news for that in the early 60s.

523
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,010
He was one of the few.

524
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:13,710
He had a nervous breakdown, but he was just fed up with everything.

525
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:14,410
Like most.

526
00:22:14,650 --> 00:22:14,950
Of us are.

527
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:22,010
And he decided to take a jaunt where where he could be the jauntiest on the main sail of his boat.

528
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:22,770
Completely.

529
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:26,590
You know, everybody hears a different story.

530
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:37,090
I heard that he climbed up on a on a like a theme park pirate ship rigging, saying he was a pirate or something and then was locked up.

531
00:22:37,170 --> 00:22:40,450
But, of course, I don't think any of that actually happened.

532
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,410
I think he just had he had the bipolar.

533
00:22:44,650 --> 00:22:47,690
And which may explain a lot.

534
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:52,730
And and he was locked up for a year voluntarily.

535
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:58,530
I think he's one of the few comedians that would, you know, talk about that back in the day.

536
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,210
I remember him referring to it on the albums that my parents played.

537
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:05,830
You say, oh, I better not talk about the UFOs anymore.

538
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:06,830
They'll lock me up again.

539
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,030
Stuff like that.

540
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:09,070
Maybe that.

541
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:11,710
Well, there was also that going around that he had made.

542
00:23:12,010 --> 00:23:13,610
He had made first contact.

543
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:14,590
But.

544
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,510
But he also had some of the habits of his father.

545
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:19,310
So, you know, he may have seen them and they weren't really there.

546
00:23:19,370 --> 00:23:20,790
Kind of like DTs or something.

547
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:22,550
Oh, man, I wish.

548
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:23,790
Do you have any of those DTs?

549
00:23:23,890 --> 00:23:24,990
Because I've ran out.

550
00:23:25,370 --> 00:23:29,270
Well, I've only got the ones with a little with a little yellow speckles on them and stuff.

551
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:31,530
And they keep you up for three weeks.

552
00:23:32,590 --> 00:23:33,650
Not not awake.

553
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,870
They just keep you physically off the ground.

554
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:36,490
Right.

555
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,050
Yeah.

556
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:38,510
Right.

557
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,290
After an hour.

558
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:42,050
Yeah, I wouldn't want to.

559
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,410
I don't think I'd want to be that way for three.

560
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,230
The gluteus maximus goes first.

561
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:46,970
Your butt muscles.

562
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:47,730
You just you.

563
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,050
You're hanging from your butt in the air.

564
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:51,670
Yeah.

565
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:56,330
And it's a vicious drill for those who care to perform it.

566
00:23:56,350 --> 00:24:00,190
Unless you're, you know, certified EMS by the state of Ohio and the city.

567
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:02,330
That's the way.

568
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,970
Boy, your phone sounds great.

569
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:04,630
This time.

570
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,550
It's a great phone, isn't it?

571
00:24:06,670 --> 00:24:08,430
It's a wonderful phone.

572
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:12,610
As a matter of fact, for only fourteen ninety five, we're selling all of these phones right here.

573
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:14,030
The entire lawn here.

574
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:14,450
You're on me.

575
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:16,230
It seems like something's missing.

576
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,310
I'm going to try to provide what's missing.

577
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,170
Well, anyway.

578
00:24:29,450 --> 00:24:29,970
Yeah.

579
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:36,830
Dave, I take it you were also exposed to Jonathan Winters comedy albums as a child.

580
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:37,230
Right.

581
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,810
And that's what happened to you, among other things.

582
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,110
Among other things.

583
00:24:41,130 --> 00:24:42,510
Also, I used to watch this.

584
00:24:42,510 --> 00:24:50,010
I would stay up late because my parents were not always in the same area as the television or the babysitter.

585
00:24:50,230 --> 00:24:50,790
Right.

586
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:56,290
And I would watch Professor Irwin Corey, who also was a.

587
00:24:56,370 --> 00:24:57,070
Oh, yeah.

588
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:57,910
Oh, yeah.

589
00:24:58,310 --> 00:24:58,710
Yeah.

590
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:02,510
And, you know, when Brother Dave Gardner died, nobody made a big deal about that.

591
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:06,150
Well, I liked Brother Dave Gardner quite a bit.

592
00:25:07,270 --> 00:25:10,950
There were some people who didn't like him on account of.

593
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:14,030
The problem.

594
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:16,670
But, you know, we really.

595
00:25:16,750 --> 00:25:22,530
I should go back to the Jonathan Winters stuff because this is the only time I'm going to do this.

596
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:28,170
And I really do have a lot of stuff that probably a lot of Jonathan Winters fans have never heard.

597
00:25:28,550 --> 00:25:29,070
So.

598
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:34,850
Quite an archive of consequential and inconsequential drivel.

599
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:40,770
Well, we'll have our own style of drivel in the next weeks to come.

600
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:41,550
But this week.

601
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:46,870
You know, whenever somebody dies, that's when they get an hour of slack show about him.

602
00:25:47,450 --> 00:25:49,630
Peter Bergman, Professor Chaz.

603
00:25:50,690 --> 00:25:54,670
Who else have we killed and then done a tribute to?

604
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:55,330
Oh, wait.

605
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:58,510
I didn't say.

606
00:25:58,550 --> 00:25:59,290
I can cut that.

607
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,430
But it didn't really happen.

608
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:01,050
Remember that one?

609
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:01,570
Oh, yeah, that's right.

610
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:02,910
The Katahdin Legume tribute.

611
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:04,570
And then we found out he was really alive.

612
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,550
That bastard.

613
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:06,390
Yeah.

614
00:26:07,690 --> 00:26:09,150
They didn't kill Legume.

615
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:09,950
Those bastards.

616
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:11,670
OK.

617
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:14,050
Maybe he didn't kill Jonathan Winters either.

618
00:26:14,150 --> 00:26:14,510
Who knows?

619
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:18,530
He may be with Jim Morrison and Hendrix and Janice.

620
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:22,990
All the people with J at the beginning of their names hanging out in heaven.

621
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:25,930
Jim, Janice, Jimmy, Jonathan.

622
00:26:27,010 --> 00:26:28,750
Let's kill Jonathan Colton.

623
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:29,570
No.

624
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:31,930
I bet some of my listeners would be ready for that.

625
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:38,770
Well, anyway, Dave, let's go and listen to the St. Winters.

626
00:26:39,610 --> 00:26:40,290
Of Ohio.

627
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:41,330
Of Ohio.

628
00:26:41,670 --> 00:26:41,990
Yes.

629
00:26:42,070 --> 00:26:43,250
An Ohio man.

630
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:44,750
Hello.

631
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:45,910
This is Jim Smith.

632
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:51,630
If you would leave a message for me and the nature of your call, I would appreciate it.

633
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:54,270
And I'll return it as soon as possible.

634
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:55,110
Thank you.

635
00:26:57,050 --> 00:26:59,090
The nature of the call.

636
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:05,370
Well, it's a call of a very violent elderly person.

637
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:08,870
Someone close to your age.

638
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:11,550
You realize that just a few months.

639
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,410
May, June, July, August.

640
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,670
In August, you know what you're going to be.

641
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:22,570
Sixty-nine.

642
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:25,010
Yeah, that's a magic number, you know.

643
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,610
It's a sexual connotation.

644
00:27:28,030 --> 00:27:28,970
Sixty-nine.

645
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:29,730
Swazanuf.

646
00:27:31,010 --> 00:27:35,150
Well, my friend, it's the last time you'll be that.

647
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:38,310
Then you go into 7-0.

648
00:27:38,410 --> 00:27:39,510
And just remember.

649
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:39,710
Remember.

650
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:43,370
The prince of darkness is really staring.

651
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:48,050
On the walls and the halls and the people with the white hair.

652
00:27:49,510 --> 00:27:51,650
People with the bad rugs.

653
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:53,830
People bent over, crippled.

654
00:27:55,290 --> 00:28:00,130
Drooling and screwling and grueling and stumbling and fumbling.

655
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,070
Using a cane.

656
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:03,450
Using their hands.

657
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:09,270
Be fewer and fewer sit-ups and, you know, push-ups and running.

658
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,450
You'll have stopped running, you see.

659
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:15,530
Maybe, maybe, maybe in your room in tight circles.

660
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:18,050
A few little things there.

661
00:28:18,230 --> 00:28:22,070
But the body eventually turns to clay.

662
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:26,110
You heard the expression, feet of clay.

663
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:28,910
Well, get ready.

664
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:33,870
Yeah, this is Mitch.

665
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,590
I'm out of stir.

666
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:39,130
I need some heat.

667
00:28:39,510 --> 00:28:40,370
I need some bread.

668
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:41,550
And I need a car.

669
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,870
Now, you told me you'd be around here at 9.30.

670
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,930
Like, what's happening, you know?

671
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:50,150
Can't you tell time?

672
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:51,950
You got no Mickey Mouse on your wrist.

673
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,610
I'm gonna have to get you one.

674
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,010
Yeah, tattoo it on your wrist.

675
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,190
It'll be 9.30.

676
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:02,810
Permanent tattoo.

677
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:07,250
So every time you say I'll see you, it'll have to be 9.30.

678
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:08,610
Do you get what I'm...

679
00:29:08,610 --> 00:29:10,230
what I'm putting down?

680
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,510
You hear me?

681
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:18,110
Hello?

682
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,270
This is number two.

683
00:29:21,770 --> 00:29:22,690
Another call.

684
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:25,710
A toilet of time.

685
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,750
A time toilet.

686
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:31,330
You'd be able to come along with us, sir.

687
00:29:31,670 --> 00:29:33,370
A lot of the men are full of fever.

688
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:36,070
Dr. Mudd was sorry about the Lincoln thing,

689
00:29:36,130 --> 00:29:37,670
but he likes actors,

690
00:29:37,750 --> 00:29:38,490
and that's why he helped.

691
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,210
John Wilkes Booth.

692
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,750
Oh, here comes the president now.

693
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:41,790
Good evening, Mr. Lincoln.

694
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:45,570
Good evening, General Grant.

695
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:48,830
How's the war going, Ulysses?

696
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,430
Well, it's going great, eh?

697
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,190
God bless you.

698
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:57,310
Got that crazy beard on, eh, gang?

699
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,470
You bring any juice with you, eh?

700
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:00,250
Thank you.

701
00:30:01,830 --> 00:30:05,110
I've asked you not to drink so heavily, Ulysses.

702
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:08,250
You know the war is going badly,

703
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:12,670
I'd hope that you would give me a direct liability answer.

704
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:14,310
What'd he say?

705
00:30:15,630 --> 00:30:16,430
Liability answer?

706
00:30:17,170 --> 00:30:18,930
Come on, Abe, all them pretty words.

707
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:20,170
You're sitting over there in Washington.

708
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:22,110
One minute you're for the colored folks,

709
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:22,970
and then you're for the union,

710
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,130
and you're kissing Jefferson Davis.

711
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:26,650
What kind of clown are you?

712
00:30:27,850 --> 00:30:30,870
I happen to be the president of the United States.

713
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:33,110
Oh, sorry.

714
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,430
I've been drinking a lot, you know.

715
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:37,890
I'm gassed up and firing them mini-balls in the side of walls.

716
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:39,450
I'm going to get you for that.

717
00:30:39,450 --> 00:30:41,350
Jesus, I don't know how the war is going.

718
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:44,210
We got 800,000 men, and the clowns are in Gettysburg.

719
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,050
I know.

720
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:50,130
I've got a little something here that Mary's been helping me with.

721
00:30:51,590 --> 00:30:54,370
Four score and seven years ago.

722
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:57,170
What are you saying, Abe?

723
00:30:57,570 --> 00:31:01,370
Well, it's going to be something, a message when the war's over.

724
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:03,790
And we haven't won it by a hell of a long shot yet.

725
00:31:04,590 --> 00:31:06,330
And you're reading a peace thing already?

726
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,070
Is that right, Mrs. President?

727
00:31:08,610 --> 00:31:12,550
I have asked Abe, God bless it, memorize past the four score.

728
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:16,210
I wrote the damn thing for you on a paper sack full of hard-boiled eggs.

729
00:31:16,450 --> 00:31:17,410
Now, come on, Abe.

730
00:31:17,410 --> 00:31:18,310
They ain't got no cue cards.

731
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:19,230
Read it, damn it.

732
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:23,390
Mary, I don't like you, just like Washington hated Martha,

733
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,850
made his face break out with all that damn candy.

734
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:28,590
You're a mean woman.

735
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:30,890
You have the quality sometime of a lesbian.

736
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,530
My two boys are half faggots.

737
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,030
And I'm President Judas Priest.

738
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:36,730
Mr. Lincoln, time off, Daddy.

739
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,690
You're too much.

740
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,770
Never mind there, Samuel.

741
00:31:40,690 --> 00:31:42,610
I've told your people they'll be released.

742
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:47,010
You know, some cat earlier tonight on Cincinnati was going on the Underground Railroad

743
00:31:47,010 --> 00:31:48,270
and he stopped at the damn hole.

744
00:31:48,710 --> 00:31:49,890
Don't think that wasn't hard.

745
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,190
I come on like a catfish running into a trench mile.

746
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:54,990
All right, your people will be released.

747
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:56,990
God, I promise you that.

748
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,010
I love you, Mr. Abe.

749
00:31:59,070 --> 00:31:59,790
You're all right.

750
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:03,010
I don't want to hang around that blue theater too much, though,

751
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,110
because some clown's going to shoot you.

752
00:32:04,310 --> 00:32:05,590
I heard about that the other night.

753
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:06,770
I was sitting around Eddie's place.

754
00:32:07,090 --> 00:32:08,190
Never mind, I'm not afraid.

755
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,930
Mr. President, looks like a fun show.

756
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,390
I'm sure it does.

757
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:16,990
Who's the headliner?

758
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:19,050
I think that's what they say in the trades.

759
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,670
It's John Wilkes Booth.

760
00:32:23,170 --> 00:32:24,930
He's a fantastic actor.

761
00:32:26,090 --> 00:32:27,450
Try to get rid of that habit.

762
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:30,630
Yes, it's going well.

763
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:31,470
Don't you think so, Mary?

764
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,830
Ah, hell, I got to take a dump, Abe.

765
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,450
Mary, I wish you wouldn't talk like that.

766
00:32:38,130 --> 00:32:38,590
I don't know.

767
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,470
After all, we're sitting up here in the...

768
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,830
Oh, go ahead and take a dump.

769
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:45,190
Who's that clown behind the curtain?

770
00:32:45,290 --> 00:32:45,590
You there!

771
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:49,130
I'm glad I killed him.

772
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:52,530
Man, I told you he was going to come behind the curtain with me.

773
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,210
Thank you, Samuel.

774
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,990
I'll make you my secretary of war.

775
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:00,690
Tell John Wilkes it's all over.

776
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:04,210
General Lee?

777
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:04,550
General Lee?

778
00:33:05,630 --> 00:33:07,930
It's all over, and as Ulysses says,

779
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,070
he gave his word, you give the horses to the men,

780
00:33:10,510 --> 00:33:11,810
and their land is back.

781
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:12,610
It's all over.

782
00:33:13,430 --> 00:33:15,250
You fought one hell of a war.

783
00:33:15,350 --> 00:33:16,490
Don't quote me on that, gentlemen, please.

784
00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:18,190
I don't want to use a curse.

785
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:24,470
Well, I want to thank you, Mr. Lincoln.

786
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:28,430
Are them folks going to move all around me?

787
00:33:29,370 --> 00:33:30,690
What do you mean, those folks?

788
00:33:31,230 --> 00:33:33,090
I mean all them clowns.

789
00:33:33,610 --> 00:33:34,950
Yeah, we're going to move around you.

790
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:36,610
What the hell you think you do?

791
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:37,750
You done lost the war, Whitey.

792
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:37,930


793
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,270
When I'd have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.

794
00:33:43,910 --> 00:33:47,530
That's been history again here on Station WMUD,

795
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:49,090
originating from New York.

796
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:52,210
An original picture of it could have happened, and almost did,

797
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,890
in the Civil War.

798
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,230
This is your announcer, John Burgerar.

799
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:56,970
Burgerar.

800
00:33:57,210 --> 00:33:57,710
Bargerar.

801
00:33:57,930 --> 00:33:59,270
Jesus, I can't even read it, friends.

802
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:02,030
Join us again next week when we present

803
00:34:02,030 --> 00:34:03,290
The Monitor and the Merrimack.

804
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:04,870
Faggots killing faggots.

805
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:06,710
One with a box of cheese,

806
00:34:06,770 --> 00:34:07,830
the other with a floating...

807
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:08,370
a floating barge.

808
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,090
There's another mini-ball.

809
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:10,610
Who's he?

810
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:14,010
It's a fun picture, friends, of it could have happened and almost did,

811
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:17,370
for the Monitor and Merrimack in the year 1863.

812
00:34:18,150 --> 00:34:21,370
And now a special message about Rosalie's rosy bushes.

813
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,910
Do you use our Rosalie rosy bushes?

814
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:24,630
Try them.

815
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,110
You get your little stuff all torn up down here inside,

816
00:34:27,270 --> 00:34:29,070
and your fingers full of little needle points, but they're fun.

817
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:31,110
And they bloom 14 times a year.

818
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,990
Why not die right with Rosalind's rosy bushes?

819
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:37,570
This is Station WXQR MUD.

820
00:34:37,570 --> 00:34:39,150
And Hi-Fi and Nu-Fi.

821
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:44,950
Brought to you, and now, we're going to join the network with Galen Drake.

822
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:47,710
Here's something I like.

823
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:52,590
Every time you see a little boy, spit on him.

824
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:57,150
And now here's an old lady, Maude Frickert.

825
00:34:57,270 --> 00:34:59,070
Maude, you been in here how long?

826
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:02,530
I came in here when I was three years old.

827
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:06,690
Really? That's an unusual age that they would catch us.

828
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:08,450
I'm erotic.

829
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,250
Catch you that early?

830
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,650
They didn't catch me. I come in on my own accord.

831
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,610
It was Easter time, and I was rolling some eggs,

832
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:20,230
and I rolled an egg across the road over into the sanitarium grounds,

833
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:22,710
and I've just been here ever since. It's a ball.

834
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,570
I have my own little jobs and chores.

835
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:27,750
I knit rugs and weave baskets.

836
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:30,750
I screw a lot of the day patients.

837
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:33,630
When I say screw, don't misunderstand. I mean I screw them financially.

838
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,730
And a lot of the guests that come in, we sock them for the rugs.

839
00:35:36,730 --> 00:35:38,790
$14.95. And they feel sorry for us.

840
00:35:38,810 --> 00:35:39,590
You know, we wander up.

841
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,550
Help us out. We're loonies.

842
00:35:41,850 --> 00:35:43,090
You know, and they give us.

843
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:46,530
It's a ball. I ain't no more insane than some of these other cats.

844
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:49,370
We get out on the afternoons and watch hardball games.

845
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:51,650
Went down to see the Yankees last spring, the Red Cross.

846
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,190
Bunch of square clowns took us down to see that.

847
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,110
Junior league girls, you know.

848
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,750
How's it going? That's all they say.

849
00:35:57,830 --> 00:36:00,190
We roll them before they take us back just for dark time.

850
00:36:00,330 --> 00:36:03,970
You know, hit them in the shrub, pick off their uniforms, and get some jack out of them.

851
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:05,570
Terrible.

852
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:08,110
This is one of the most frightening programs I've ever witnessed.

853
00:36:08,590 --> 00:36:11,150
And to hear some of these people and what they have to say.

854
00:36:12,690 --> 00:36:14,590
And here's a man who's going to be released.

855
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:17,750
Uh, Lamar Jean Gumbadie.

856
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:20,410
Mr. Gumbadie, you've been in here some four years.

857
00:36:21,430 --> 00:36:24,090
Well, how do you feel? What has the sanitarium done for you?

858
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:26,850
Well, I'll tell you.

859
00:36:28,070 --> 00:36:31,510
I know, I, uh, when I come in here, I lost my mind.

860
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,030
And, uh, I regained it in four years.

861
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:39,410
I'm going out now into a new way of life.

862
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,170
Well, what will you be doing?

863
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:45,370
Well, my aim is I'm going to kill my brother-in-law first.

864
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:49,570
And, uh, it's a terrible thing to say, but I do.

865
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,770
I always wanted to kill him.

866
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:52,830
I wanted to kill him before I lost my mind.

867
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:56,070
And, uh, he never wrote me no cards or nothing.

868
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:57,450
My sister put me in there.

869
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,770
And I'm going to kill her after I kill him.

870
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:04,490
Uh, those are the two big projects I have on my mind now.

871
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:07,550
Third project is how I'm going to get a damn gun.

872
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:13,050
Uh, because being a man of taste, you know, they won't say nothing but a damn BB gun or no Count 22.

873
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:16,810
And that way you got to hold it up and get both of them at the same time.

874
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,410
Unless they're laying together, you can't do it.

875
00:37:20,170 --> 00:37:24,310
Uh, what I aim to do is, if I can't get the gun, is just to burn their damn house down.

876
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:26,430
I know where they live over on, uh, Bexford Avenue.

877
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:29,270
And I'll just get a box of matches, you know.

878
00:37:29,390 --> 00:37:31,870
Have some kid go in there, high school kid, get a box of matches.

879
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:34,250
And then I'll pour gasoline all around the house and cook them in there.

880
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,330
Well, I think that's a wonderful outlook.

881
00:37:36,790 --> 00:37:40,370
Uh, I'm sorry to hear that that is your project, what you're going to do.

882
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,730
Would you lock him up now, please?

883
00:37:42,350 --> 00:37:43,490
I don't think he's ready.

884
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:46,150
We don't lock up anybody here, fella.

885
00:37:46,950 --> 00:37:48,170
We're locking you up.

886
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:49,350
Really?

887
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:52,690
Next week...

888
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,590
Caught my hand in there, you fool.

889
00:37:56,810 --> 00:38:02,850
Next week from the Funny Farm, we bring you another inside story of It Can Be Fun to Be Crazy.

890
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:05,870
That's from our leader.

891
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:09,810
What is the top cigarette in the country?

892
00:38:10,250 --> 00:38:11,670
Let me tell you, mother, something.

893
00:38:12,750 --> 00:38:14,890
L&M's, L&M's, buddy, you know.

894
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:16,390
Let's go when the whistle blows.

895
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:19,010
Now, let's face it.

896
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:23,430
A lot of you folks out there, you know, another thing along with L&M's,

897
00:38:23,890 --> 00:38:25,750
where these southern cats are at responses.

898
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:29,310
Why, uh, we have some northern folks.

899
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:30,390
It's a Jew fella.

900
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,490
His name is Mr. Goldie.

901
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:34,470
Mr. Goldie puts out this King Kong.

902
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:35,450
King Kong hair straightener.

903
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,490
And, uh, let's face it.

904
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:39,150
A lot of you cats have got kinky hair.

905
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:42,370
And the thing to do is jab some of that salve on, see?

906
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:43,230
And then you're free.

907
00:38:43,370 --> 00:38:43,890
You're free.

908
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:45,350
This is the way to get the white chicks.

909
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:46,310
Ugh, mother.

910
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:49,850
That's pretty sick, isn't it?

911
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:50,850
Yes, sir, friends.

912
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:52,770
I don't think we got too many letters, do you?

913
00:38:53,470 --> 00:38:56,650
Maybe just from the West Side or Harlem District.

914
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,590
I told Sammy Davis that one night, and I thought he'd die.

915
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,590
You know, he's broad-minded.

916
00:39:03,650 --> 00:39:04,470
And I mean broad-minded.

917
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:05,870
White broad-minded.

918
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:07,850
He tells a lot of Ina White jokes.

919
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:18,010
I had a thing I wrote over Christmas about a family scene, you know,

920
00:39:18,030 --> 00:39:20,710
and it was a thing about describing the members

921
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,890
and putting it into a wild vein.

922
00:39:23,010 --> 00:39:26,310
There was Uncle Willie, who was a little odd, boys and girls,

923
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,730
in the fact that Uncle Willie used to always take all the presents,

924
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:31,250
a little bit after 12,

925
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,450
and center them in the center of the floor,

926
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:35,370
and take a bottle of maraschino cherries,

927
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:36,330
pour it all over.

928
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:39,490
We often thought Uncle Willie should have gone up to the funny farm,

929
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:42,050
but we just didn't have the heart to put him away.

930
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:46,010
Then there was Lamar Jean Lamar, my stepsister,

931
00:39:46,650 --> 00:39:47,870
who had a husky voice.

932
00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:50,430
And she used to ride up in a sleigh,

933
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:53,190
pulled by three teenagers in black leather jackets,

934
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:55,870
which was a gimmick of hers.

935
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,570
And she worked at the commissary over at the big depot for the Army.

936
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:01,910
And she'd ride up there in the late afternoon,

937
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:04,410
and then she'd stand there in her red Mackinaw,

938
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:05,150
I'll never forget it,

939
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:06,970
her hair flowing in the breeze,

940
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,610
boy, she had a long, mmm, man.

941
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:11,250
And then she'd stand there and she'd rip her Mackinaw off,

942
00:40:11,250 --> 00:40:12,050
and she wouldn't have nothing on,

943
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:13,010
and she'd run over the snow,

944
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:13,410
hollering,

945
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:15,290
Jimmy Dean's alive, alive, alive.

946
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:17,570
Oh, that's some wild stuff.

947
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,610
Hello, this is Smith.

948
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:26,750
I should be returning to base about 8.30 this evening.

949
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:31,210
8.30 this evening.

950
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:38,390
Are you gone literally all day from 6 o'clock until after dark?

951
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:39,970
It's hard to believe, isn't it?

952
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:40,450
Yeah.

953
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:42,890
That's a full-time job.

954
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:46,270
24 hours of nothing, huh?

955
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:48,370
Just driving a white car around.

956
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:49,950
That's okay.

957
00:40:49,990 --> 00:40:50,630
It's an exercise.

958
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,490
Keeps your arms,

959
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,890
if you don't want to jog,

960
00:40:52,990 --> 00:40:56,890
you don't want to be out there running in the streets or on the sand,

961
00:40:56,970 --> 00:40:58,490
you know, doing wind sprints,

962
00:40:58,630 --> 00:41:00,930
best thing is to stay in the white car

963
00:41:00,930 --> 00:41:03,870
and drive around until you're shot at.

964
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:09,810
Yeah, I like to get together and, you know,

965
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,830
see what's happening here,

966
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:13,850
see what the expression on the face is,

967
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,870
and what you're doing with your hair,

968
00:41:16,990 --> 00:41:17,650
your body,

969
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:21,050
whether you're squeezing a soft rubber ball

970
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:24,590
to strengthen your fist or whatever's happening, you know.

971
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:29,710
Man, you've got to pull the chain on your mind

972
00:41:29,710 --> 00:41:30,490
and pull,

973
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:34,470
pull the chain on your head and flush your mind.

974
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,690
Okay? Yeah.

975
00:41:35,750 --> 00:41:37,950
Pull the chain on your head, man,

976
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:39,630
and flush your mind.

977
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,150
Okay, I've been using that

978
00:41:42,150 --> 00:41:44,070
and it's starting to pick up momentum.

979
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,750
So, until next time, man,

980
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,370
I remain your obedient servant,

981
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:50,630
The Shadow.

982
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,950
Well, we're not leaving any names

983
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:00,090
or numbers.

984
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:04,330
This is a city and a country of paranoia.

985
00:42:05,850 --> 00:42:08,390
It means that, you know,

986
00:42:08,410 --> 00:42:09,590
they can use your name,

987
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,190
false pretenses,

988
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:14,110
and the number can be traced,

989
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:15,730
and your house can be blown up,

990
00:42:15,730 --> 00:42:16,830
or you're murdered in it.

991
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,290
Well, the nature of the call is

992
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,190
what to do about the deficit.

993
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,570
I mean, I can't handle all this.

994
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:30,850
I mean, the little guy,

995
00:42:30,930 --> 00:42:33,210
people like yourself are going to have to

996
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:34,750
take responsibility here.

997
00:42:35,530 --> 00:42:37,970
You're going to have to be bitten into,

998
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:38,790
as it were.

999
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:41,250
And I'm sorry to see that.

1000
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:43,330
I know what it's like.

1001
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:45,970
I've been bitten into several times in the past.

1002
00:42:47,810 --> 00:42:49,170
Uh, mm-hmm.

1003
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:50,170
All right.

1004
00:42:50,450 --> 00:42:51,330
And bye-bye for now.

1005
00:42:51,410 --> 00:42:52,590
In Toluca Lake.

1006
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:54,110
Hello.

1007
00:42:58,230 --> 00:42:58,750
Well,

1008
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:03,070
you see, it's late to me.

1009
00:43:03,770 --> 00:43:05,710
I'll be in bed in a half an hour.

1010
00:43:05,770 --> 00:43:08,410
It's 8.30.

1011
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,090
And of course, to you,

1012
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,270
it'll be 11.30 or 12.30, I guess.

1013
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:17,270
You're on some kind of a magical tour,

1014
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:20,450
I guess, preparing yourself for heavy taxation.

1015
00:43:21,710 --> 00:43:23,770
You better study all the papers now,

1016
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:26,270
because one mistake and you're in prison.

1017
00:43:27,550 --> 00:43:28,730
Sit down there to take a nap.

1018
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:28,730


1019
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:28,730


1020
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,050
You're like a dump.

1021
00:43:29,410 --> 00:43:30,970
You drop them Levi's,

1022
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,110
sit down there where you're on the Twin Holder,

1023
00:43:33,130 --> 00:43:34,390
and maybe you're in one of them big hotels.

1024
00:43:35,590 --> 00:43:37,090
Anyway, you got to take your pants down, right?

1025
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:38,430
Sit there on the crapper.

1026
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:40,370
Just smoke up a storm.

1027
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:42,450
Shit, ain't nobody going to bother you.

1028
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:45,050
Just sit there on the stool and cut away, boy.

1029
00:43:45,610 --> 00:43:46,510
You know what they are.

1030
00:43:47,050 --> 00:43:48,730
Oh, yeah, occasionally now and then,

1031
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:50,750
you get ahold of them bad, bad bowl of grits,

1032
00:43:51,150 --> 00:43:52,150
they'll go right on through you.

1033
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:54,310
I've had them screaming mimics.

1034
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,650
Called it the Green Apple Quickstep.

1035
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,690
Move like a bandit, boy. That's it.

1036
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,470
That's why I say you're going to have plenty of time there with the GIs.

1037
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:03,070
Well, fellas, that is.

1038
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,310
Or just the GIs. You know what them is.

1039
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:06,850
Like the Green Apple Quickstep, like I say.

1040
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,670
So, just sort of pick up a copy of Bugle,

1041
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:12,030
or some funny papers, whatever is down around your feet.

1042
00:44:12,730 --> 00:44:14,370
Don't ever grab hold of nobody in the next stool.

1043
00:44:14,850 --> 00:44:15,830
Lose a buddy that way.

1044
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:18,190
Take out a pack of them L&Ms.

1045
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,570
Sit back and light up and...

1046
00:44:20,430 --> 00:44:22,650
Oh, you can't beat it.

1047
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:24,270
Just too much.

1048
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:25,010
Ain't it, Jed?

1049
00:44:25,010 --> 00:44:27,050
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1050
00:44:27,230 --> 00:44:29,390
You better put your clothes on. Folks are starting to talk.

1051
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:31,270
L&M draws easy.

1052
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:38,470
All right, where's the fire? Where's the fire?

1053
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,470
In your eyes, officer. In your eyes.

1054
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:42,570
You're a fairy, aren't you?

1055
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:44,650
Do you see any wings?

1056
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:48,810
I think that's a mastinine remark on your part.

1057
00:44:48,990 --> 00:44:51,490
You great big Neanderthal person, you.

1058
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:53,690
Yeah, it's just a hood with a badge.

1059
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:54,470
That's the only difference.

1060
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:56,210
What did you call me?

1061
00:44:56,490 --> 00:44:57,190
A hood, a hood.

1062
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,070
You ought to have one right over your skull.

1063
00:44:59,610 --> 00:44:59,970
Jesus.

1064
00:45:00,690 --> 00:45:01,650
Now, watch your cursing.

1065
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,370
I happen to be, uh, patrolman O'Brien.

1066
00:45:03,690 --> 00:45:04,790
Oh, tell us, old leader.

1067
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,130
Where is your motorcycle?

1068
00:45:06,950 --> 00:45:09,270
Do you have the multicolored foxtails and the devil on the front?

1069
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:10,270
What'll a Harley do?

1070
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:12,990
Open it up on a snowy day, and then we'll see.

1071
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:15,150
Oh, you damn fool.

1072
00:45:15,430 --> 00:45:16,510
You ran right into me.

1073
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:19,250
Yes, yes, fairies can fly, can't they?

1074
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:21,130
All right, well, lock him up, Joe.

1075
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,610
Fag. Put it down. Number 367.

1076
00:45:23,610 --> 00:45:24,810
That's right. Take it in the prison.

1077
00:45:24,970 --> 00:45:25,530
I don't want to fool with him.

1078
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,810
Get in the back seat with those devils and they'll tear your clothes off.

1079
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:38,130
As in our report to the nation today, we have with us, uh, a number of important men here

1080
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:41,990
that have been working on the Atlas and some of the other guided missiles.

1081
00:45:42,430 --> 00:45:45,830
Here with us, first of all, is, uh, Dr. Alan Duvers.

1082
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,570
Uh, Dr. Duvers, that's all rhymes, excuse me for the pun.

1083
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:52,770
Uh, Dr. Duvers, just what are they doing about the Atlas?

1084
00:45:52,770 --> 00:45:55,310
Uh, not a darn thing.

1085
00:45:55,810 --> 00:45:57,050
Uh, we put that aside.

1086
00:45:57,130 --> 00:46:02,150
A lot of them people went down to Montego Bay, and they're down there for about two or three months' rest.

1087
00:46:02,290 --> 00:46:04,610
It's a tremendous strain on all of us.

1088
00:46:05,050 --> 00:46:08,850
And, well, good Lord, the country here, this has been the problem all along, Doctor,

1089
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:13,470
is the fact that there have been too many vacations and talk and, uh, very little work.

1090
00:46:13,710 --> 00:46:14,830
Well, look, I'm a scientist.

1091
00:46:15,070 --> 00:46:19,070
I mean, uh, I just knocked my ass out over this thing.

1092
00:46:19,170 --> 00:46:20,590
We're on the air, Doctor. We're on the air.

1093
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:22,750
Oh, well, I don't know. I didn't know. I'm a scientist.

1094
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,030
I'm sorry. I'm sorry out there.

1095
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:26,730
But I have. I've just been working my ass off on it.

1096
00:46:27,170 --> 00:46:28,850
All right, cut. We're off now, Doctor.

1097
00:46:28,930 --> 00:46:29,910
Jesus, I have way to go.

1098
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:31,910
All right, Ted, we're off the air.

1099
00:46:32,010 --> 00:46:33,670
Because of that, you can't say ass on the air.

1100
00:46:34,510 --> 00:46:36,330
Well, I guess not. Uh, shit.

1101
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:43,590
The scene is an old farmhouse somewhere out there in Midwest land.

1102
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:46,950
And, uh, it's summer.

1103
00:46:47,770 --> 00:46:50,150
And there's about that much dust in the road.

1104
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,750
It's an old, run-down farmhouse.

1105
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:57,470
And inside is an old lady, 87 years old, Grandma Frickert,

1106
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:59,290
been confined to a wheelchair.

1107
00:46:59,910 --> 00:47:01,910
The term we use is shut-in.

1108
00:47:02,670 --> 00:47:05,390
The mister's been dead now some 20 years,

1109
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:09,330
and she runs the place herself, along with the hired hand, Lenny,

1110
00:47:09,410 --> 00:47:13,290
which is 22, who helps out milk the cows and what have you.

1111
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,470
And this is the scene. She's in the living room in her chair,

1112
00:47:16,030 --> 00:47:17,650
wheeling back and forth, rocking.

1113
00:47:18,930 --> 00:47:21,550
And over the fireplace is a, is a rifle.

1114
00:47:21,550 --> 00:47:24,270
And the beaded curtain's in the knotty pine pillow,

1115
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:26,450
which says Niagara Falls, 1934.

1116
00:47:27,870 --> 00:47:31,910
And suddenly Lenny comes in with dung all over his Levi's,

1117
00:47:31,910 --> 00:47:34,410
and he's a good-looking Lenny is all he is, you know.

1118
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:35,190
And he's standing there.

1119
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:36,830
She says,

1120
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:38,730
Good heavens, Lenny.

1121
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:40,630
What are you doing in here?

1122
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:42,470
You've never been allowed in the house.

1123
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:45,230
Why, if the mister was alive, he'd kill you.

1124
00:47:45,450 --> 00:47:47,230
Now you get on out and get about your chores.

1125
00:47:47,870 --> 00:47:48,910
Lenny, what are you doing?

1126
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:50,630
Good God.

1127
00:47:51,550 --> 00:47:52,870
You're exposing yourself.

1128
00:47:53,650 --> 00:47:54,450
Oh, no.

1129
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:55,870
You're sick.

1130
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,630
If I could just get over to that fireplace and get that gun, I'd, I...

1131
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,670
You ain't gonna get over to that fireplace.

1132
00:48:03,530 --> 00:48:04,930
Oh, God in heaven.

1133
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,210
Oh, if I could just get over to the telephone, I'd call Sheriff Bain.

1134
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:09,670
You ain't gonna get over to the telephone.

1135
00:48:11,490 --> 00:48:13,230
Oh, Lenny, don't touch me, please.

1136
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:13,830
I beg of you.

1137
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:14,730
I'm church people.

1138
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:16,070
Don't attack me.

1139
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:16,970
Lenny, please.

1140
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:17,630
Oh, Lenny.

1141
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:19,310
Oh, oh, oh.

1142
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:20,190
Hey, hey.

1143
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:22,930
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1144
00:48:23,470 --> 00:48:24,910
That wasn't so bad, was it, Mom?

1145
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,530
I'm going out there and get that dog out of the road.

1146
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:29,450
Set the crapper up right.

1147
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:31,450
Fix that fence and I'll be back.

1148
00:48:31,650 --> 00:48:32,350
Oh, God.

1149
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:34,270
Oh, oh, mercy.

1150
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:37,570
See that you don't stay away too long.

1151
00:48:39,790 --> 00:48:44,350
That's our chapter for today in Sex Can Be Fun.

1152
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:49,630
Join us again tomorrow when the makers of aluminum screens brings you...

1153
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:50,830
Grandma Brickert.

1154
00:48:51,830 --> 00:48:53,150
Chapter 365.

1155
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:55,330
Book 12.

1156
00:48:55,710 --> 00:48:58,250
Sex Can Be Fun After 60.

1157
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:05,470
Here's one for strictly fellas.

1158
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,790
This is pantomime, see?

1159
00:49:10,970 --> 00:49:11,630
Pantomime.

1160
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:12,870
Oh, right.

1161
00:49:14,590 --> 00:49:16,310
And the kid, it's a...

1162
00:49:17,130 --> 00:49:18,870
10-year-old boy in an attic.

1163
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,110
He's up there in...

1164
00:49:21,110 --> 00:49:22,470
Oh, oh, oh.

1165
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:25,750
Oh, oh, oh.

1166
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,030
Wellis, Wellis, are you up there again in the attic?

1167
00:49:30,390 --> 00:49:31,670
What the devil you done up there?

1168
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:38,350
Wellis, I'm not doing anything, Mom.

1169
00:49:38,390 --> 00:49:39,210
I'm looking for my ball glove.

1170
00:49:44,410 --> 00:49:47,790
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

1171
00:49:58,490 --> 00:50:00,690
I'm coming, dammit, dammit, dammit.

1172
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:05,610
That's a pretty second.

1173
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,730
So, one can does the work of more.

1174
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:11,490
Hefty, hefty trash can liners.

1175
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:12,210
Use them.

1176
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:12,650
Oh.

1177
00:50:16,610 --> 00:50:17,230
Hefty.

1178
00:50:18,290 --> 00:50:19,610
Hefty trash can liners.

1179
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:19,610


1180
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:19,610


1181
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:19,610


1182
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:19,610


1183
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:19,610


1184
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:19,610


1185
00:50:19,610 --> 00:50:29,010
Trish can liners. Use them. No kidding. A lot of the guys over at Bernie's Bar throw up in them.

1186
00:50:30,510 --> 00:50:33,290
And we cart it out. Okay?

1187
00:50:39,390 --> 00:50:46,150
When garbage starts piling up on you, use hefty trish can liners and wrap up the problem.

1188
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,630
There's a dead cat in there that won't come out.

1189
00:50:54,030 --> 00:50:55,930
Let's do one more. Okay. Another.

1190
00:50:58,070 --> 00:51:03,370
Get down, you ding-dong, and get hefty trish can liners.

1191
00:51:03,870 --> 00:51:08,410
Big, strong, hefty trish can liners will hold all you can throw away.

1192
00:51:08,730 --> 00:51:10,770
They're leak-proof, odor-proof, plastic.

1193
00:51:11,370 --> 00:51:15,490
Help the container. Well, keep the container. Blow it.

1194
00:51:17,350 --> 00:51:19,470
Looks like help to me, isn't it, son?

1195
00:51:19,610 --> 00:51:20,190
Instead of keep.

1196
00:51:21,130 --> 00:51:23,090
That's why I was in the home for a year.

1197
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:25,930
Now, let's see.

1198
00:51:26,930 --> 00:51:29,310
Holy cow, what am I going to do with all this garbage?

1199
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:31,590
That's some mess.

1200
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:34,230
I wish I had some hefty bags.

1201
00:51:35,170 --> 00:51:37,670
Hey, down there, old lady. You old beast.

1202
00:51:38,370 --> 00:51:39,710
You got any hefty bags?

1203
00:51:40,990 --> 00:51:43,130
Hefty, H-E-F-T-Y, hefty.

1204
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:44,170
Hot damn you.

1205
00:51:45,970 --> 00:51:47,750
I can't help it. The house stinks.

1206
00:51:49,150 --> 00:51:49,590
Thanks.

1207
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:52,370
There are a lot of people inside. I don't know. I think they're hippies or something.

1208
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:54,530
And they've just let the place go.

1209
00:51:54,850 --> 00:51:56,230
I need hefty bags.

1210
00:51:56,710 --> 00:51:57,490
You got any?

1211
00:51:58,690 --> 00:51:59,850
Well, screw you.

1212
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:03,450
Hey, Margaret.

1213
00:52:05,750 --> 00:52:08,110
I'm not going in the service.

1214
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:09,610
I'm not kidding.

1215
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,830
I'm going to hold up up here.

1216
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:13,370
Ah, damn it.

1217
00:52:14,070 --> 00:52:16,670
I don't want to die in Chinlou, fool.

1218
00:52:16,930 --> 00:52:18,450
Or whatever it is.

1219
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:20,270
And the lieutenant was right.

1220
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:21,930
He should have killed them all.

1221
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,090
I don't want to play with you, kid.

1222
00:52:28,350 --> 00:52:29,470
I'm stoned.

1223
00:52:29,910 --> 00:52:30,470
Oh.

1224
00:52:32,710 --> 00:52:34,230
But where to rake it to?

1225
00:52:35,350 --> 00:52:38,010
Hefty lawn cleanup bags solve that one.

1226
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:43,030
They're extra big to hold lots.

1227
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:44,710
Extra tough to hold up.

1228
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,430
Extra easy to haul away.

1229
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:47,490
Hefty.

1230
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:48,430
Hefty lawn clean-up bags.

1231
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:48,430


1232
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:49,430
Use them.

1233
00:52:53,450 --> 00:52:54,290
Ah.

1234
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:02,490
I did doo-doo.

1235
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:05,050
I did it.

1236
00:53:05,910 --> 00:53:08,690
Pants are all full of music.

1237
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:10,630
Oh.

1238
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:14,130
See the doggie go away?

1239
00:53:17,210 --> 00:53:18,050
Oh.

1240
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:18,390
Oh.

1241
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1242
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1243
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1244
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1245
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1246
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1247
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1248
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1249
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1250
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1251
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1252
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1253
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1254
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1255
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1256
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1257
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1258
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1259
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1260
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1261
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:18,410


1262
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:20,430
Under the rock is a...

1263
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:21,790
Psh-s-s-s-s.

1264
00:53:22,430 --> 00:53:22,770
Psh-s-s-s-s.

1265
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:24,430
That's a snake.

1266
00:53:25,150 --> 00:53:26,270
Psh-s-s-s-s.

1267
00:53:26,330 --> 00:53:26,610
Ah.

1268
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,970
Ha ha.

1269
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:28,510
Ha ha.

1270
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:28,950
Ha ha ha.

1271
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:29,350
Ha ha ha.

1272
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:29,530
Ha ha ha.

1273
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:29,710
Ha ha ha.

1274
00:53:30,110 --> 00:53:30,710
Okay.

1275
00:53:31,070 --> 00:53:31,970
We'll try it again, huh?

1276
00:53:32,950 --> 00:53:34,090
So we get it.

1277
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:35,450
Cleanup bags.

1278
00:53:35,850 --> 00:53:36,450
Okay.

1279
00:53:37,290 --> 00:53:37,890
Jim Smith.

1280
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:39,630
Hello, this is Jim Smith.

1281
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,030
And please leave a message for me.

1282
00:53:42,450 --> 00:53:44,670
And I will return your call.

1283
00:53:44,810 --> 00:53:45,590
Thank you.

1284
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:46,850
Beep.

1285
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,970
Yeah, you should be getting up now.

1286
00:53:50,110 --> 00:53:51,430
It's 7 o'clock.

1287
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:55,730
See, the hours are getting away from all of us.

1288
00:53:56,630 --> 00:54:01,810
And this thing, you're married to eternal sleep.

1289
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:07,650
And you're going to have that, you see, anyway.

1290
00:54:08,290 --> 00:54:09,310
That's the bonus.

1291
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,950
Yeah, just striking 7 now.

1292
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:17,270
Yeah, about five minutes faster on the great clock.

1293
00:54:18,530 --> 00:54:21,850
I wanted to report here as to what's happened.

1294
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:25,450
And you see, once again, I hear nothing.

1295
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:34,350
I tell you, as far as being with intelligence, an intelligence unit or information,

1296
00:54:35,330 --> 00:54:38,470
I would not think that would be your following.

1297
00:54:39,690 --> 00:54:41,630
Because I'm responsible.

1298
00:54:41,950 --> 00:54:44,450
I'm responsible for getting back to a person who's concerned.

1299
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:47,990
I don't know if I'm making myself clear.

1300
00:54:48,150 --> 00:54:54,310
Because the sick people, even the well people, I mean, I question how many times I'm understood.

1301
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:58,910
Because a lot of times, most of my career, I've been too smart for the room.

1302
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:04,690
And you've been in the room, of course, when I was talking.

1303
00:55:05,450 --> 00:55:07,910
And, of course, you were talking to someone else.

1304
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:09,810
But I should be used to that.

1305
00:55:09,870 --> 00:55:11,050
I've seen it with my wife.

1306
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:11,930
I've seen it with my father.

1307
00:55:11,950 --> 00:55:12,370
My mother.

1308
00:55:12,890 --> 00:55:16,310
And other would-be loved ones.

1309
00:55:16,870 --> 00:55:22,850
And while I was trying to perform and trying to capture the attention of a few,

1310
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:26,410
what I would call today mudheads,

1311
00:55:28,550 --> 00:55:34,290
people were just gallivanting around with their humor.

1312
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:39,050
I would like to know, Mr. Smith, what's going on here.

1313
00:55:39,110 --> 00:55:40,210
I'm coming down tomorrow.

1314
00:55:41,090 --> 00:55:41,810
You know?

1315
00:55:41,950 --> 00:55:44,530
So you, Mr. Smith, you said a nice thing about not hearing your voice.

1316
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:50,490
The only thing is, really, I'm not, you know, you don't try to top me or interrupt.

1317
00:55:50,890 --> 00:55:51,890
The art of interruption.

1318
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:58,110
This is the one time that silence prevails at the other end, which is semi-good.

1319
00:55:59,350 --> 00:56:04,370
But I'm not going to ramble on here too much longer because I'm not making a cent, as they say.

1320
00:56:04,610 --> 00:56:09,670
And you just wonder if the tape is in the machine or what is working.

1321
00:56:10,830 --> 00:56:11,930
If you can find one of those, I'd love to have one of those.

1322
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:11,930


1323
00:56:11,930 --> 00:56:18,530
it in your in your pocket forget about your heart because i think that's probably a mattel reject

1324
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:28,190
anyway in your in your in your mind what's left of that to call me you know it just uh if it means

1325
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:35,970
calling me collect i guess i'll have to go to that because uh the spending of money on your part now

1326
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:45,450
is i i realize your hand is deep in your in your pants but at any rate um please uh inform me one

1327

1328
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:55,930
it's certainly sunny and beautiful up here i would imagine down there the only

1329
00:56:56,610 --> 00:57:02,750
reason it would be overcast would be from the smoke from the guns that are killing people thank

1330
00:57:02,750 --> 00:57:03,230

1331
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:12,590

1336
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:48,730
you'll have to play that back over and over again to write the number down

1337
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:56,090
the music in the background is by the rudy schwartz project they have a new album coming out uh

as traditional

1354
00:59:12,630 --> 00:59:13,910
organic

1355
00:59:13,910 --> 00:59:13,950
sighted

1356
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:13,950


1357
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:15,450
it

1358
00:59:15,450 --> 00:59:16,990
does

1359
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:16,990


1360
00:59:16,990 --> 00:59:18,230
Cherry

1361
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:18,230


1362
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:18,350
out

1363
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:18,350


1364
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:34,590
going to

1365
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:35,310
christmas

1366
00:59:34,590 --> 00:59:42,770
look around. You old beast. I don't need that kind of language. I'm gonna go to the manager.

1367
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:54,770
I not only own this store, lady, I own the chain. Well, it's the last time I'm shopping here.

1368
00:59:55,130 --> 01:00:01,030
Guru, great. That's the best break I've had all day. Take your business elsewhere.

1369
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:13,670
I don't need it. And take your kid and your dog. You made fun of my son? He's a creep. Ask the dog.

1370
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:24,750
Here, boy. Come on, sport. Hold my arm. Back over. Now, pick the dog up.

1371
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:26,970
Oh.

1372
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:31,490
Okay.

1373
01:00:33,710 --> 01:00:39,290
Number one product. This is spossy hyacinth of potassium sulfate.

1374
01:00:39,890 --> 01:00:42,510
A lot of people come into my drugstore and say,

1375
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:45,250
Holy Jesus Christ!

1376
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:49,590
This is what we use.

1377
01:00:52,610 --> 01:00:55,730
It'll slow the person down to almost a screeching halt.

1378
01:00:57,050 --> 01:01:00,550
He becomes almost anesthetized in front of me.

1379
01:01:02,310 --> 01:01:05,590
Only $15. Think about it. $15.95.

1380
01:01:06,890 --> 01:01:10,590
But if you come in early, a dollar and a half.

1381
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:13,330
You deal with me.

1382
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:21,170
Now, a lot of the kids on the street, as you know only too well, being parents,

1383
01:01:21,810 --> 01:01:26,090
sniffing glue, smoking pumpkins, all kinds of weird things.

1384
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:29,310
This puts an end to it. What's this?

1385
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:31,410
This? Kalinau. Kalinau.

1386
01:01:33,250 --> 01:01:36,010
Nothing on the label. Don't ask me about that.

1387
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:39,090
Inside those, these kids are...

1388
01:01:39,570 --> 01:01:40,490
Once they...

1389
01:01:44,590 --> 01:01:45,910
And our last.

1390
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:48,350
The rest of these shelves, as you can see, are empty.

1391
01:01:49,430 --> 01:01:51,190
We've had sellouts like this.

1392
01:01:52,230 --> 01:01:55,330
People come in here. We used to have liquor on that side.

1393
01:01:56,030 --> 01:01:58,690
We got stone, you know. I didn't need that.

1394
01:01:59,310 --> 01:02:01,370
And a guy fell into the deep freeze and...

1395
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:03,530
frozen out.

1396
01:02:04,510 --> 01:02:05,430
Sold him, though.

1397
01:02:07,570 --> 01:02:08,070
$136.

1398
01:02:09,090 --> 01:02:10,490
To a necrophiliac.

1399
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:18,290
That's all for today from Mr. Grocery Man.

1400
01:02:24,570 --> 01:02:27,290
Good evening, everybody. This is Philana Philbert.

1401
01:02:27,990 --> 01:02:29,030
And as you know,

1402
01:02:29,030 --> 01:02:29,710
this is, uh,

1403
01:02:30,770 --> 01:02:31,090
uh,

1404
01:02:31,130 --> 01:02:33,350
last year on television was,

1405
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:35,790
uh, Mr. Nat King Cole,

1406
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:38,230
one of the all-time great, great cats.

1407
01:02:38,630 --> 01:02:40,570
I would like to explain this, first of all,

1408
01:02:40,570 --> 01:02:42,150
to get the show off to a great start.

1409
01:02:42,370 --> 01:02:43,730
We are, uh,

1410
01:02:43,830 --> 01:02:45,370
really expressing realism.

1411
01:02:46,110 --> 01:02:47,550
I'm certainly no phony cat,

1412
01:02:47,670 --> 01:02:48,810
and we're gonna come on strong,

1413
01:02:49,390 --> 01:02:50,870
pushing that type of theme.

1414
01:02:51,630 --> 01:02:54,070
As you can see and observe, I'm a nigger.

1415
01:02:54,230 --> 01:02:56,490
Now, right away, folks are getting up out of their chairs.

1416
01:02:56,870 --> 01:02:59,010
Already, our switchboard is lit up.

1417
01:02:59,030 --> 01:02:59,530
Like Christmas.

1418
01:03:00,050 --> 01:03:01,490
But I, you see, I wanna get that,

1419
01:03:01,530 --> 01:03:03,210
everybody knows we're niggers, boogies,

1420
01:03:03,330 --> 01:03:04,170
all kinds of words.

1421
01:03:04,350 --> 01:03:05,390
But we wanna stress that.

1422
01:03:05,450 --> 01:03:07,050
We wanna put our cars on the table.

1423
01:03:07,430 --> 01:03:08,190
The ace of spades.

1424
01:03:08,430 --> 01:03:09,530
That's a little funny for you.

1425
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:11,170
Black is the ace of spades.

1426
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:11,670
You've heard that.

1427
01:03:11,930 --> 01:03:12,770
Or coon.

1428
01:03:14,390 --> 01:03:15,910
We, uh, cloud, you know,

1429
01:03:15,970 --> 01:03:16,870
darky, smoky.

1430
01:03:16,890 --> 01:03:17,430
We get them all.

1431
01:03:17,650 --> 01:03:19,190
So I wanna use just one nigger,

1432
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:19,890
if you don't mind.

1433
01:03:20,010 --> 01:03:20,730
I'll just stick to that.

1434
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:22,590
A lot of you wanna use your own little cuties.

1435
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:24,970
We're gonna have all kinds of folks on.

1436
01:03:25,090 --> 01:03:25,450
Jews,

1437
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:26,990
and guineas,

1438
01:03:27,010 --> 01:03:27,970
and hunkies,

1439
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:28,650
and poles,

1440
01:03:29,030 --> 01:03:29,750
and limeys,

1441
01:03:30,350 --> 01:03:30,710
krauts,

1442
01:03:31,510 --> 01:03:32,230
and, um,

1443
01:03:32,990 --> 01:03:34,250
we're gonna have on, uh,

1444
01:03:34,310 --> 01:03:34,730
spics,

1445
01:03:35,270 --> 01:03:36,010
and, uh,

1446
01:03:36,090 --> 01:03:37,250
we're gonna have on, uh,

1447
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:39,210
we're gonna have on boogies, too.

1448
01:03:39,350 --> 01:03:40,510
I mean, I don't wanna, you know, be,

1449
01:03:40,630 --> 01:03:42,750
I don't wanna show that I'm anti-this,

1450
01:03:42,830 --> 01:03:43,450
or anti-that.

1451
01:03:43,570 --> 01:03:44,590
I'm anti-everything.

1452
01:03:45,350 --> 01:03:45,970
But, uh,

1453
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:46,810
I'm mad at white girl.

1454
01:03:46,930 --> 01:03:47,670
A lot of folk right away,

1455
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:48,790
see if the boys lit up again.

1456
01:03:49,510 --> 01:03:50,510
Uh, but, uh,

1457
01:03:51,010 --> 01:03:51,970
well, it was a thing.

1458
01:03:51,970 --> 01:03:52,570
We fell in love.

1459
01:03:52,890 --> 01:03:54,730
And, uh, society has frowned upon it,

1460
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:56,490
but we live in Sutton Place just the same.

1461
01:03:57,030 --> 01:03:57,390
Um,

1462
01:03:57,750 --> 01:03:58,910
because we're making money,

1463
01:03:59,030 --> 01:03:59,250
you know,

1464
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:00,450
and my daddy is Father Divine.

1465
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:01,830
So, uh,

1466
01:04:02,090 --> 01:04:03,190
may the Lord be with you, Daddy.

1467
01:04:03,470 --> 01:04:04,450
He's gonna be on, too.

1468
01:04:04,530 --> 01:04:05,590
He's a religious boog.

1469
01:04:06,290 --> 01:04:06,890
And, uh,

1470
01:04:06,930 --> 01:04:08,070
right now, incidentally,

1471
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:08,990
our sponsor's a Jew,

1472
01:04:09,710 --> 01:04:10,770
uh, Mr. Goldie.

1473
01:04:10,810 --> 01:04:12,630
Mr. Goldie has put out a great thing,

1474
01:04:12,730 --> 01:04:13,970
the King Kong hair straightener.

1475
01:04:14,150 --> 01:04:15,230
A lot of you cats, you know,

1476
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:16,270
have the frightening wigs,

1477
01:04:16,790 --> 01:04:17,430
and, uh,

1478
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:18,550
come on like spooks.

1479
01:04:18,850 --> 01:04:20,450
So, this puts it down, man.

1480
01:04:20,510 --> 01:04:21,590
I mean, oh, so much.

1481
01:04:21,950 --> 01:04:23,070
That's how you get the white sex.

1482
01:04:23,810 --> 01:04:24,330
And, uh,

1483
01:04:24,350 --> 01:04:24,750
right now,

1484
01:04:24,750 --> 01:04:26,570
we're gonna have the former mayor of New York on,

1485
01:04:26,650 --> 01:04:27,090
who's a guinea.

1486
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:27,990
Um,

1487
01:04:28,530 --> 01:04:29,810
Mr. Impilateri.

1488
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:31,390
I'd like to say I'm not a guinea.

1489
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:32,070
I'm Italian.

1490
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:33,030
Well, same thing.

1491
01:04:33,130 --> 01:04:34,490
I mean, that's one thing we're trying to stress

1492
01:04:34,490 --> 01:04:35,830
to make the people relax, Daddy.

1493
01:04:36,050 --> 01:04:36,870
You know, you're a guinea.

1494
01:04:36,930 --> 01:04:37,350
Let's face it,

1495
01:04:37,410 --> 01:04:38,150
they go a-wop.

1496
01:04:38,370 --> 01:04:39,550
Well, I wish you'd stop that,

1497
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:40,010
Mr.,

1498
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:41,470
uh, Philander,

1499
01:04:41,490 --> 01:04:42,030
whatever you're...

1500
01:04:42,030 --> 01:04:42,650
Philander, Philander,

1501
01:04:42,670 --> 01:04:43,250
that's it.

1502
01:04:43,610 --> 01:04:44,890
You know, relax, Daddy.

1503
01:04:44,910 --> 01:04:45,730
You're out, you know,

1504
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:47,010
to beach up in the longshore.

1505
01:04:47,410 --> 01:04:48,350
Uh, but, uh,

1506
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:49,410
it's true,

1507
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:50,250
you screwed the people there

1508
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:51,110
for a long while, didn't you?

1509
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:52,610
I mean, you joined a lot of the hoods,

1510
01:04:52,610 --> 01:04:52,850
didn't you?

1511
01:04:52,890 --> 01:04:53,990
You swung pretty hard with the,

1512
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,350
with the, uh, longshore group.

1513
01:04:55,670 --> 01:04:56,970
Well, I did have my difficulties.

1514
01:04:57,450 --> 01:04:57,770
Difficulties?

1515
01:04:57,770 --> 01:04:58,270
Hell, you're out.

1516
01:04:58,350 --> 01:04:58,850
That's obvious.

1517
01:04:59,530 --> 01:04:59,850
Um,

1518
01:05:00,610 --> 01:05:01,210
but, uh,

1519
01:05:01,230 --> 01:05:02,370
how do you feel about the Italians?

1520
01:05:02,590 --> 01:05:03,110
Do you feel...

1521
01:05:03,110 --> 01:05:03,630
Well, certainly,

1522
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:04,550
well, how do I feel?

1523
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:05,610
That's one of their silly questions,

1524
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:05,990
and actually,

1525
01:05:06,050 --> 01:05:06,670
my being Italian,

1526
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,050
they're a wonderful people.

1527
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:08,950
Well, they kept them

1528
01:05:08,950 --> 01:05:09,990
in a certain part of the city.

1529
01:05:10,050 --> 01:05:10,210
I mean,

1530
01:05:10,210 --> 01:05:11,490
more or less put the monkeys

1531
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,210
and the organ grinders

1532
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:12,770
and all them people

1533
01:05:12,770 --> 01:05:13,790
and them, uh,

1534
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,210
those, uh, guinea grinders,

1535
01:05:15,250 --> 01:05:16,310
those, uh, heroes and everything,

1536
01:05:16,410 --> 01:05:17,590
they bunched up that soup cap

1537
01:05:17,590 --> 01:05:18,050
and pizzas

1538
01:05:18,050 --> 01:05:18,870
and they jammed them in

1539
01:05:18,870 --> 01:05:19,590
right in town.

1540
01:05:19,590 --> 01:05:19,790
I mean,

1541
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:20,770
they're not spread all over.

1542
01:05:20,810 --> 01:05:21,890
Well, I don't think

1543
01:05:21,890 --> 01:05:23,150
they can certainly go anyplace.

1544
01:05:23,530 --> 01:05:24,010
Well, now,

1545
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:24,570
you see right away,

1546
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,830
that's true about the guineas,

1547
01:05:25,830 --> 01:05:26,950
but the boogies, man,

1548
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,210
we're all jammed into Harlem.

1549
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:28,910
You know, you can't,

1550
01:05:28,910 --> 01:05:29,810
I had some folks up

1551
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:30,390
in White Plains,

1552
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:30,950
they kept the,

1553
01:05:30,950 --> 01:05:31,530
burn them up,

1554
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:32,190
burn them up,

1555
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:33,050
something terrible,

1556
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:34,330
but on the highway,

1557
01:05:34,470 --> 01:05:35,710
it made it look like a crash.

1558
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:36,670
Um,

1559
01:05:37,410 --> 01:05:38,450
well, I see our time

1560
01:05:38,450 --> 01:05:39,110
is running out,

1561
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:40,130
and, uh,

1562
01:05:40,130 --> 01:05:40,550
remember,

1563
01:05:40,730 --> 01:05:41,670
uh, next week,

1564
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:41,990
we're gonna,

1565
01:05:42,630 --> 01:05:43,270
we're stressing,

1566
01:05:43,430 --> 01:05:43,650
uh,

1567
01:05:43,750 --> 01:05:44,750
don't care packages

1568
01:05:45,510 --> 01:05:46,190
to, uh,

1569
01:05:46,310 --> 01:05:47,290
Confederate soldiers.

1570
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:48,430
Uh,

1571
01:05:49,190 --> 01:05:49,510
well,

1572
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:49,930
no, just,

1573
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:50,870
I was just kidding, folks.

1574
01:05:51,050 --> 01:05:52,650
Two soldiers in Arkansas,

1575
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:53,650
we are sending those

1576
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:54,730
don't care packages, though,

1577
01:05:54,790 --> 01:05:55,670
and, uh,

1578
01:05:55,670 --> 01:05:56,490
next week will be

1579
01:05:56,490 --> 01:05:57,610
not Brotherhood Week,

1580
01:05:57,710 --> 01:05:58,770
but Anti-White Week.

1581
01:05:59,290 --> 01:05:59,650
So,

1582
01:05:59,790 --> 01:06:00,650
think about it, friends.

1583
01:06:01,210 --> 01:06:02,410
All my white friends,

1584
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:03,550
my chalk people,

1585
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:04,150
I call them,

1586
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:05,550
and my blackies.

1587
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:06,870
So, remember,

1588
01:06:07,490 --> 01:06:07,930
keep it cool,

1589
01:06:08,010 --> 01:06:08,310
you know,

1590
01:06:08,330 --> 01:06:09,030
and keep it down.

1591
01:06:09,990 --> 01:06:10,530
Good night,

1592
01:06:10,590 --> 01:06:11,410
and good night for Mr.,

1593
01:06:11,410 --> 01:06:12,130
thank you, Mr. Goldie.

1594
01:06:12,310 --> 01:06:12,670
Wonderful.

1595
01:06:12,950 --> 01:06:13,350
That's that.

1596
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:15,090
That's all he says.

1597
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:16,710
Oh, incidentally,

1598
01:06:16,710 --> 01:06:17,210
we hope we didn't

1599
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:17,670
offend anybody.

1600
01:06:19,590 --> 01:06:20,870
B-O-B

1601
01:06:20,870 --> 01:06:21,710
Friends,

1602
01:06:22,270 --> 01:06:23,150
we're glad

1603
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:24,410
you listened to this show,

1604
01:06:24,490 --> 01:06:25,930
and we're even more glad

1605
01:06:25,930 --> 01:06:26,750
that some listeners

1606
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:27,850
have donated enough

1607
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:29,130
to help us keep on going

1608
01:06:29,130 --> 01:06:30,670
for another couple of months.

1609
01:06:30,830 --> 01:06:32,490
Not just this show,

1610
01:06:32,590 --> 01:06:34,150
but subgenius.com

1611
01:06:34,150 --> 01:06:34,870
and all the other

1612
01:06:34,870 --> 01:06:35,690
archive sites.

1613
01:06:37,050 --> 01:06:39,210
But if you truly love Bob

1614
01:06:39,210 --> 01:06:40,390
and want some of that

1615
01:06:40,390 --> 01:06:41,770
slack back to rebound

1616
01:06:41,770 --> 01:06:42,750
to you,

1617
01:06:42,910 --> 01:06:44,150
you should go to

1618
01:06:44,150 --> 01:06:45,570
subgenius.com

1619
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:46,690
front page,

1620
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:47,230
or especially

1621
01:06:47,230 --> 01:06:48,290
the radio page,

1622
01:06:48,410 --> 01:06:49,150
or the catalog,

1623
01:06:49,590 --> 01:06:50,250
store pages,

1624
01:06:50,830 --> 01:06:51,970
and help out

1625
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:53,590
financially as best you can.

1626
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:55,370
Now, we know

1627
01:06:55,370 --> 01:06:56,070
what it's like

1628
01:06:56,070 --> 01:06:56,990
to be on the brink

1629
01:06:56,990 --> 01:06:57,970
of total poverty,

1630
01:06:58,050 --> 01:06:58,830
and we don't want

1631
01:06:58,830 --> 01:06:59,950
any subgeniuses

1632
01:06:59,950 --> 01:07:00,470
to make their own

1633
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:01,590
situations worse.

1634
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:03,230
But some of you

1635
01:07:03,230 --> 01:07:04,630
still have jobs.

1636
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:06,530
Even five bucks

1637
01:07:06,530 --> 01:07:07,910
makes a big difference,

1638
01:07:08,030 --> 01:07:09,130
even if it's only

1639
01:07:09,130 --> 01:07:09,910
once a month

1640
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:11,450
from enough of you.

1641
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:12,530
Fifty bucks

1642
01:07:12,530 --> 01:07:13,130
makes an even

1643
01:07:13,130 --> 01:07:13,870
bigger difference.

1644
01:07:15,430 --> 01:07:16,590
All we're saying

1645
01:07:16,590 --> 01:07:17,170
is that

1646
01:07:18,290 --> 01:07:18,850
blowjobs

1647
01:07:18,850 --> 01:07:19,350
could go

1648
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:19,870
the way of

1649
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:20,610
Steve Jobs

1650
01:07:20,610 --> 01:07:21,750
if you don't

1651
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:22,650
pay Dobbs.

1652
01:07:23,250 --> 01:07:24,610
We also take

1653
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:25,570
checks and money

1654
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:26,230
orders to

1655
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:28,130
Subgenius Foundation,

1656
01:07:28,630 --> 01:07:30,250
P.O. Box

1657
01:07:30,250 --> 01:07:31,730

1658
01:07:32,710 --> 01:07:33,470
417

1659
01:07:34,390 --> 01:07:35,910
Cleveland Heights,

1660
01:07:36,810 --> 01:07:36,930
Ohio

1661
01:07:39,850 --> 01:07:40,610
44118.

1662
01:07:41,170 --> 01:07:42,630
Thanks for anything

1663
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:43,370
you can do

1664
01:07:43,370 --> 01:07:43,990
to help

1665
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:44,810
let there

1666
01:07:44,810 --> 01:07:45,810
be slack.
