1
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,220
s-mantic

2
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:20,420
.

3
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,300
Oh, smack!

4
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:19,820
Oh, smack!

5
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,840
She is good and we don't.

6
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:26,960
We begin.

7
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:36,620
I am leaving soon.

8
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,840
And you will forgive me if I speak bluntly.

9
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:40,400
You suck.

10
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,620
I came here to give you these robots.

11
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:43,700
He does suck.

12
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,600
The result is we pretend to have achieved perfection.

13
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,480
You're not being paid to screw up.

14
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,220
This does not mean giving up any freedom to act irresponsibly.

15
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:54,720
What do you mean?

16
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,960
Freedom to pursue profitable aggression and war.

17
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,300
Your choice is simple.

18
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:08,100
Pursue your present course and live in peace or join us and face obliteration.

19
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,860
You're just saying that to try and scare me.

20
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,840
We shall be waiting for your answer.

21
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,760
The decision rests with you.

22
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,420
Okay.

23
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:28,900
Now I'm done.

24
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:28,900


25
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:29,260


26
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:29,640
I'm done!

27
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,060
I'm done!

28
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,300
I'm done!

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,820
I'm done!

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,340
I'm done!

31
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:43,000
And again in Ruth 16 23 we read,

32
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,360
But we shall gain great comfort from this,

33
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,660
That he who shall turn his head from the brightness of the Lord shall have it loose from his neck.

34
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,780
And since we are out of time for today,

35
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:57,220
Let's close now the passage from Ezekiel 12 14.

36
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,140
Busy, busy, busy, want a cup of coffee? You don't have a bathroom, do you? Don't pump me.

37
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,540
You know how things go.

38
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:18,060
Busy, busy, busy, want a cup of coffee? You don't have a bathroom, do you? Don't pump me.

39
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:22,280
You know how things go.

40
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:32,500
Everybody knows you run round town. All my friends, what you doing?

41
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,780
Um...

42
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:28,060
Well, Pimp Daddy Supreme will tell us about the record business.

43
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,320
A band going good can also be twisted to do evil.

44
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:57,680
Yes, music is a powerful force for good or evil.

45
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,500
Young people use music to reflect their own ideas, frustrations, questions and attitudes,

46
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:06,340
and some of their music responds to these questions.

47
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,700
What kind of music dominates your life?

48
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,760
Are you deciding for yourself?

49
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,600
Get As ready

50
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:20,700
Get As ready

51
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:20,900
Get As ready

52
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,260
Or are you allowing Hollywood stars to be apahti and start coreson thing?

53
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:22,260


54
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:22,260


55
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,100
to direct your life.

56
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,580
Let's tell it like it is.

57
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,380
Popular music is helping to corrupt

58
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,040
the youth of America.

59
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,720
The big bowl beat may disguise the message,

60
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,360
and many kids tell me they really don't pay any attention to the words.

61
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,640
But you know as well as I do

62
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,920
that those words come through loud and clear.

63
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,460
Saka to me, baby.

64
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,520
Gimme, gimme, gimme.

65
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,720
But is that what the kids are listening to?

66
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,060
Not necessarily.

67
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,560
Guess what the world needs now is sex, shock, and...

68
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,360
Hold on a minute!

69
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,100
What kind of music is this pop music?

70
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,820
I think you know the answer to that.

71
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,640
Conforming to the world's ideas,

72
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,360
these people are merely following the crowd.

73
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,640
Music.

74
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,640
Music.

75
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:24,840
Music.

76
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:25,340
Music.

77
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:25,760
Music.

78
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:26,560
Music.

79
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:26,560


80
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:26,560


81
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,260
On the other hand,

82
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,280
Jam the Boss!

83
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:29,060
You know differently.

84
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:32,140
Teenagers, don't let the world around you

85
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:33,400
squeeze you into its mold.

86
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:35,640
Stop, look, and listen.

87
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,160
Music must be free.

88
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,520
Does that make sense?

89
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,200
But maybe where we disagree is what we mean by music,

90
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,380
and it's characterized in songs like this one,

91
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,100
with which we conclude.

92
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:54,640
But you gotta watch out.

93
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,740
This could lead to dancing.

94
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:58,860
Bob and Connie really enjoy life.

95
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,680
Mmm.

96
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:02,640
Hey, victory at sea, Bob.

97
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,640
Now auto is warming up again.

98
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,360
This time it's for the jumps.

99
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,200
He holds the world's record

100
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:10,400
of well over a hundred feet in lot jumping.

101
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:10,980
Cool!

102
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,800
Justy to these privateballers

103
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,700
sera du этого das que

104
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,260
Jaunty Mommy catch up to you in this

105
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:20,540


106
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:28,520
A federal judge shot a pregnant Palestinian man who was driving his neighbor to a campground in the Angeles National Forest.

107
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,400
Killed by a bullet to the head.

108
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,600
At least 10 people have collapsed and destroyed 15 homes.

109
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:41,880
In the northern Gaza Strip, defense lawyers from eight African countries are suspended out of fear of more PR news.

110
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,740
In the latest from Wall Street, the 3610581 to 2090.

111
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,700
I'm stranded in PR news, Washington.

112
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,160
New drugs, new treatments.

113
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,240
These men must keep pace with time.

114
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,620
And now observe that man.

115
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,760
The one carrying a briefcase.

116
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,940
A salesman.

117
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,860
He too must keep pace.

118
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,020
Not with formulas or drugs, but with people.

119
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,340
His stock in trade is people.

120
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:09,700
And people change.

121
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,760
The story they fingerprints from.

122
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:22,360
했엙

123
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,020
Get out of there away from here

124
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,220
playing

125
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,800
aria

126
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,840
I

127
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,100
in the

128
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,920
And friends, what we're fighting for is the most important thing in the world, our slack!

129
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:05,600
Slack!

130
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,500
Now some people say, oh yeah, slack, what do you mean?

131
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,140
Well, we won't tell you.

132
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:20,400
As the great philosophers of the hell's angels used to say,

133
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,280
those who say don't know, and those who know don't say.

134
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,220
So I should shut up, please.

135
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,500
But instead I'll keep at it.

136
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:33,040
Because friends, slack is different for each person.

137
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:36,080
Ideally it's something for nothing.

138
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:40,220
And for some people, slack is,

139
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,400
a lot of money.

140
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,620
For some people, slack is sex.

141
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:48,060
But for some people, slack is stamp collecting,

142
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,840
bird watching, tinkering with their little computer.

143
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:52,440
Who knows?

144
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:56,720
Everybody has their own weird perverted idea of slack.

145
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,300
But friends, Bob is sex.

146
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,820
Bob is money.

147
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:03,100
And Bob is slack!

148
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,540
It's that simple.

149
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,860
We stand here trying to explain all this stuff,

150
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:09,580
but it doesn't matter.

151
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,480
Those are just words.

152
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:13,220
When you look at that face,

153
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,360
that's really all you need to know.

154
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:21,120
If, when your eyes fall upon that dotted dot pattern of a face,

155
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:24,900
if you think, that's kind of cool, and I don't know why,

156
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,480
then you know you are a subgenius.

157
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,540
It is only Bob.

158
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:33,440
All the rest of it is just our pathetic human preacher bullshit,

159
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:36,620
and an attempt to make some more money for his mighty empire.

160
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:40,480
But really, all you need to do is just stare into it,

161
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:40,480


162
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,420
and look into that face!

163
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:44,100
It's pure religious love.

164
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:48,860
And boys, it's not queer if it's Bob.

165
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,840
You know, it's a religious thing.

166
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,080
It's a religious love.

167
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:59,640
But friends, you know, you don't try to over-rationalize religion.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,280
That just, it's crazy.

169
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,280
Religion has to be crazy.

170
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,000
It can't make any sense.

171
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,260
By definition, that would wreck it.

172
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,680
Let me put it this way.

173
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,140
Bob sold it.

174
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,600
I smoked it.

175
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,000
That settles it.

176
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,820
That's all I need to know.

177
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,440
Bob said,

178
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,780
I'm a liar.

179
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,300
Did I have faith?

180
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,040
That's what faith is all about.

181
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,400
Some people say,

182
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:23,220
Oh, I don't believe in miracles.

183
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:24,640
I don't believe in magic.

184
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,300
Friends, there is a type of magical miracle

185
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
that happens every day,

186
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,140
a million times a day.

187
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,300
And I don't mean the beauty of a leaf falling from a tree.

188
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,420
The miracle,

189
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,760
the incredible,

190
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:40,460
unbelievable miracle that happens every day

191
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:44,640
is that so many people can believe such stupid crap.

192
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:47,300
And yet they do.

193
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:49,960
And that is the miracle of faith, my friends.

194
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,680
And we will not let any other religion be any crazier than we are

195
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,540
as far as faith goes.

196
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,320
Bob sold it.

197
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:58,980
I smoked it.

198
00:11:59,040 --> 00:11:59,840
That settles it.

199
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:00,940
As Bob said,

200
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:05,220
you must learn to pull the wool over your own eyes.

201
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,800
You're still blind,

202
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,240
but at least it's your wool and not theirs.

203
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:11,240
So,

204
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:12,260
you know,

205
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,140
again,

206
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:20,220
the conspiracy wants everyone to have the same idea of slack.

207
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,560
And they show it on their commercials all the time.

208
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:24,280
Oh,

209
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,360
my team just won.

210
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,280
I'm drinking Miller beer.

211
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,320
I'm surrounded by this year's model,

212
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,660
good looking person.

213
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:34,220
I have good,

214
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:36,780
respectable gifts.

215
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,120
I have a job.

216
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:37,900
Yeah,

217
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,600
I'm drunk.

218
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:39,280
Whoa,

219
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,360
I have slack.

220
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:41,140
Oh,

221
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,320
no.

222
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:41,940
And you're thinking,

223
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,140
no,

224
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,920
that's not slack.

225
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,920
It's pink boy stuff.

226
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,640
Real slack is smoking dope and watching MTV.

227
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:47,940
You know,

228
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:48,580
friends,

229
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:54,520
it is such a delicate line to figure out what is the true slack for you.

230
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,000
And what is the false slack?

231
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:59,020
Some people think that slack means being lazy.

232
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,200
And for some,

233
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,380
that certainly is true.

234
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:02,980
But then there are other,

235
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,760
that those are the reward in sub geniuses for some of us.

236
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:06,760


237
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:06,760


238
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:06,760


239
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,020
We emerge in tiles.

240
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,540
For instance,

241
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:10,460
slack is when we're working,

242
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,120
but at what we wanted to work at.

243
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,640
And then you forget to eat.

244
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,960
You forget to drink or breathe or pee.

245
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,120
You just make a big puddle under your desk and keep working or whatever it is you do.

246
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:23,460
You know,

247
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,000
make your own sports guide.

248
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,220
You like to run or something.

249
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,920
You get into the zone where everything is true and right.

250
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,880
And you know you're doing the right thing.

251
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:32,740
And friends,

252
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,900
that's when you suddenly know that life is worth living.

253
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,820
You are actually pretty smart.

254
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,340
And everything truly is as psychedelic as that old t-shirt that you can't fit into anymore.

255
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,960
That is the thought that you have to hold onto.

256
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,620
That is the slack.

257
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,780
The moment of slack.

258
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:55,320
Sometimes the more undeveloped sub geniuses come to me and go,

259
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:55,860
well,

260
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:57,960
I paid my 20 euro,

261
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,380
but I still don't have slack.

262
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,400
No,

263
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,400
you have misunderstood everything.

264
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,060
You have to make the slack.

265
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:05,880
You're not going to make the slack.

266
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:10,040
You're just paying us to give you a pep talk so you won't forget.

267
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:17,120
We know how difficult it is to be alone in this world and be a loner.

268
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:17,540
You know,

269
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,180
some of us,

270
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,760
well,

271
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,840
this is an organization.

272
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:24,260
It's a disorganization for non-joiners.

273
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,260
So it's never really been very big.

274
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,220
I guess it wasn't a good business idea.

275
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:30,160
You can,

276
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,680
but the great thing about Bob is you don't want to,

277
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,520
you don't want to have one of those other gods.

278
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:36,840
Breathing down your neck,

279
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,740
telling you what to do.

280
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,300
You don't want a bunch of other religious,

281
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,060
your fellow religious fanatics.

282
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,520
You just want to be alone.

283
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:44,560
But,

284
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,580
but you like Bob.

285
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:49,900
You can be alone with Bob.

286
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:53,340
You can be alone with Bob.

287
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:58,180
That's the miracle of our very special guru friends.

288
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,340
But so many people are laboring under this addiction,

289
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:05,000
a foul addiction to money,

290
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,440
filthy lucre.

291
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:06,680
Well,

292
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,060
actually,

293
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:09,360
we could use more of that ourselves.

294
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:13,060
Bob is not a communist exactly.

295
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:16,420
He doesn't want everyone to be equally poor.

296
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,040
No,

297
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:19,020
he wants everyone to be equally rich,

298
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,460
gluttonously,

299
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,580
piggishly rich,

300
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,740
but without working.

301
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:29,140
According to Bob,

302
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,420
there's no hard evidence to prove Bob's story either.

303
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,980
And it's not going to be true.

304
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,880
He's not going to be a two-headed blowjob,

305
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,480
contrary to popular demand.

306
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:47,340
I thought we were dancing with a hard-on.

307
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:25,340
I thought it was jut torture for anybody.

308
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:25,340


309
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:25,340


310
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:25,340


311
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:25,380
This happened for love.

312
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:25,380


313
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:25,460
He wanted us to let this discussion go,

314
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:33,980
because everyone wanted to slow down.

315
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,840
Bob.

316
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,400
Did anyone mention Bob?

317
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:56,220
Yeah, boy.

318
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,280
Bob's arriving next week.

319
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:58,760
Divine.

320
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,520
Oh, excuse me.

321
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,100
Bob!

322
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:05,040
Outstanding.

323
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,240
Come on and sit down, Bob.

324
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,500
Luteus Maximus.

325
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:08,460
Right?

326
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,080
That's right.

327
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:11,220
People lost in the world of pills.

328
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:12,140
They're good.

329
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,080
Yes, I guess you could say that.

330
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:33,980


331
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:50,840
No answer?

332
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:58,640
20% off in October!

333
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:03,960
$UOMA SYCAKS REGARDED.

334
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:03,960


335
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:03,960


336
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,780
Someone to watch over me

337
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,080
Ave Maria Stella

338
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:20,760
Dei Mater Alma

339
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:29,320
So nice to be with you again.

340
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,560
Start a new week together?

341
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,340
Tomorrow, tomorrow

342
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:39,160
We'll start the day tomorrow

343
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,860
With a song or two

344
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,540
I'm not the only soul

345
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,260
Choose love, hit and run

346
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,960
Tied tracks on cross your back again

347
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,260
See you at your fun floor

348
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:54,320
See you at your fun floor

349
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,340
See you at your fun floor

350
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,620
See you at your fun floor

351
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,440
See you at your fun floor

352
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,940
See you at your fun floor

353
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:19,940
I must leave your planet now and return to a world of cold and unemotional galaxy beings.

354
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:23,520
I will give them my report and I will be destroyed.

355
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,520
I have failed in my mission, not because I am weak, but because you are stronger.

356
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,500
Can you draw me? Can you draw me?

357
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:37,080
We, the Republic of the International, today charge the Argentine government with blatant violations of human rights under the very...

358
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:44,700
Phone code, nucleus, on the water house, bloom, blood, germinate the sign of host.

359
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:50,760
So, river, I'll ride with you, only child, and take your joy up.

360
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:54,580
You look up and I'll be gone, bit by bit.

361
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,420
I came for you, for you, I came for you, but you did not heed my urgency.

362
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,400
Hotel, Motel.

363
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,720
What you gonna do today?

364
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,800
Make it a grand party out in the cold.

365
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,940
Watching those detectives.

366
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,900
Oh, I'll say shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot now.

367
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:16,580
Future for you.

368
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:20,540
When painting, when painting are done.

369
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,060
When cleaning, when cleaning are done.

370
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,360
Who are we? We're the communication people.

371
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,920
People whose talk is strictly state-of-the-art technology.

372
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,540
Is disposable, universal.

373
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,320
Reusable with almost anything.

374
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:32,460
Leading the ground of our deal.

375
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,760
Including our deluxe life.

376
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,380
Yours.

377
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,260
Hey, boo-boo, I'll save you.

378
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,940
Whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop, whoop.

379
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,280
Get them doggies moving.

380
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:40,120
Great, you.

381
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:41,140
Hey, you're talking to me.

382
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:41,680
Uh-huh, boo.

383
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,060
Yeah.

384
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,060
Number nine.

385
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:44,020
The lot you see.

386
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:44,720
The twist.

387
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:45,720
Elgaraga.

388
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,820
Can you throw a bead on him?

389
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,720
Can you throw a bead on him?

390
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,920
I remember a wild fish.

391
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:51,760
A guy's been in a train station and the rain's inside.

392
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,520
He's kicked out.

393
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:53,480
Go ahead and shoot.

394
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,840
You'll be doing me a favor.

395
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,460
Bonjour, Monsieur Dam, s'il vous plaît.

396
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:00,140
My English told me that I've been out of my head.

397
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,040
The way you described it.

398
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,300
You said I'd be better dead than alive.

399
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,000
Dripping, legs hanging from their rags.

400
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,920
Aluminum, styrofoam, people at your clock.

401
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,920
Five o'clock, go home.

402
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,140
Eat the baby, eat the baby.

403
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,280
Daddy's got a little patty.

404
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,460
Somebody must be screaming, dinner.

405
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,460
Everyone sits down.

406
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:14,480
Oh, it's work today, dear.

407
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,480
Bang, bang.

408
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,720
Can I have a piece, honey?

409
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,720
What's in the frying pan?

410
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:18,540
Shhh.

411
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,760
Case in point.

412
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,660
A young man trapped in a car with a million legs

413
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,060
with fantasy and compulsion.

414
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,640
Just eased with money.

415
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:28,100
He just sat at the twilight zone.

416
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,940
Everybody wants to get into it.

417
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:30,120


418
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,880
Those of you who've just tuned in,

419
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:33,800
the President of the United States has been shot.

420
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,400
Pause for station identification.

421
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:36,660
Mr. Spaniard, look out!

422
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,380
St. Francisco.

423
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:41,780
I scare myself when I let my thoughts run.

424
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:44,320
I guess the waves make for the heaven shore.

425
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,980
So do our minutes hasten to their end.

426
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:50,040
So come to the ender.

427
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,920
You are here to participate in an atomic maneuver.

428
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:56,160
Oh, your baby has gone down.

429
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,120
Oh, the first radiation from heaven.

430
00:21:59,280 --> 00:21:59,820
Whoosh.

431
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:01,020
I flattened the city.

432
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:03,980
When I demolished the city was God's fire.

433
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,740
And God said, grab all your stuff.

434
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:08,700
And they made all these deals.

435
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,760
And the evil just kept going up and up and up.

436
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:14,160
And God just turned around right then, went swoosh.

437
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,080
And he opened the sixth seal.

438
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,040
And he opened.

439
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:19,460
The sun became black as sackcloth.

440
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:21,580
The full moon became like blood.

441
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:24,840
And the sky vanished like a scroll that has rolled up.

442
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:28,600
And I saw an angel call to the birds of midheaven.

443
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,140
Come.

444
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,700
I am here for the great supper of God.

445
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,560
To eat the flesh of men.

446
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:38,600
Oh, I see.

447
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:38,900


448
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,220
It's a miracle.

449
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,940
I am here for the great supper of God.

450
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:40,940


451
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:46,180
But the Bodhisattva realizes the whole five skandhas are empty.

452
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:51,760
He is freed from the cycle of birth, death, and suffering.

453
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,260
Ba, da, ba, ba, ba, da, da.

454
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:55,560
Hm.

455
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:10,180
Yes, dear friends, that was the great Michael Pepe, Reverend Michael Pepe, or Pope Imho Pepe, as he is also known.

456
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:20,400
Before that, friends, this whole show has had a lot of cut-ups and collages by Mr. Fernanda Nande Lee Murr.

457
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,040
That's just in general. It's suffused with that.

458
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:32,340
We also heard before that some Frank Zappa, a little bit of ancient Frank Zappa.

459
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:38,000
And before that, some Ray Hay, the guitar player for the Swinging Love Corpses.

460
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,640
They're playing with the amino acids.

461
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,040
And?

462
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,140
Next day, seven.

463
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:46,000
Then, yes, Lee Murr, Lee Murr.

464
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:50,300
And now some more Lee Murr from PR News.

465
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:56,020
From PR News in Washington, I'm skeptical of PR News in Washington.

466
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:02,620
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan and former CIA Director George Tenet have been jailed outside of China.

467
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,020
Lawyers will be illegal.

468
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:09,020
It's not clear if 20 political parties in Mozambique raised Span again.

469
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:10,160
President Biden's administration has said that the U.S. will not be able to do anything about the U.S.

470
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,160


471
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:10,160


472
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,740
President Biden has been thrown out by a judge.

473
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:15,100
The ruling effectively overturns presidential elections.

474
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:19,240
He has been sharply criticized for the nation's highest civilian honor.

475
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:24,760
On Wall Street, 52-690-1421-6-1202-625.

476
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,160
Greetings. Welcome back. Great to have you with us, ladies and gentlemen.

477
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,920
It's Al Rushbow here, the EIB Network.

478
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,260
I am loaded today.

479
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:34,800
Hey, it's me.

480
00:24:35,020 --> 00:24:38,700
Cancer and anemia with uncontrolled high blood pressure and blood clots.

481
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,600
I'm the germy mess.

482
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,620
Rheumatoid arthritis.

483
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:46,140
It's so good to have serious fatal infections, lymphoma, nervous system and blood disorders and headache.

484
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:46,940
Fabulous.

485
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:55,760
Call now to find liver injury, heart failure, blood disorders, tuberculosis, nervous system disorders and lymphoma, allergic reactions, hives, trouble breathing and low blood pressure.

486
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:56,440
For you.

487
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:04,300
My fellow citizens, I have requested this opportunity to talk about the tragedy which happened last Friday evening.

488
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:09,580
This morning I entered a plea of guilty to the charge of leaving Massachusetts on my own.

489
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:27,900
The court has been

490
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:33,720
Oh, baby.

491
00:25:33,940 --> 00:25:34,640
Oh, baby.

492
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,920
Oh, baby.

493
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,600
Oh, baby.

494
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:36,720


495
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,580
Oh, baby.

496
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,800
Excuse me.

497
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:40,160
Sorry.

498
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:42,320
Looks at the heart.

499
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:42,320


500
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:43,540
It might be hair conscious illness.

501
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:43,540


502
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:43,760
It may be farsility, biliary, or un feuiste Pedro.

503
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:43,760


504
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:53,600
Look, one I only Gianni Calax khôngرف Eco now.

505
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,140
Guun.

506
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,700
You can callіш median mutグ tomorrow.

507
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,280
I should have done.

508
00:25:58,700 --> 00:25:59,500
Me?

509
00:25:59,900 --> 00:25:59,900


510
00:25:59,900 --> 00:25:59,900


511
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:01,840
When did you come back?

512
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:03,740
Today, others say it's般 зимει dîm ur b aconteheid?!

513
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,700
It nurse in.

514
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:04,700


515
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:04,700


516
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:04,700


517
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,140
Have you viene in today and pouch on the raise?

518
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:07,060
Yeah.

519
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:07,480
So you live near that bênz there?

520
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:07,480


521
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,560
Far 이상.

522
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:08,560


523
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,240
And the days when we die

524
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,960
We'll be riding in the acid rain

525
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:36,160
And every day we got the acid rain

526
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:39,620
To get our new face complexion

527
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,760
With the flesh hanging out our face

528
00:26:41,760 --> 00:27:02,760
And we hate the acid rain

529
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,460
But we love to tear our face off

530
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:05,800
Oh

531
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,280
And the days when we die

532
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,220
They get us fickle world records

533
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,840
And they get our clothes on us

534
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:32,680
We're just gonna be a pile of flesh

535
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,200
With clothes on

536
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:34,720
Oh

537
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,000
Oh

538
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:35,280
Oh

539
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:36,140
Oh

540
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,480
Oh

541
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:39,740
Oh

542
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,540
Oh

543
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,500
Oh

544
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:45,860
Oh

545
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,260
Oh

546
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:46,800
Oh

547
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:46,900
Oh

548
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:46,940
Oh

549
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:46,940


550
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,120
Oh

551
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,380
Oh

552
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,040
Oh

553
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:49,820
Oh

554
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:55,280
Hello, we have a mic.

555
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,200
We really like to have a mic.

556
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:08,960
If you can hear us punching now, we're really going to be in a fight room now.

557
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:09,940
Listen.

558
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,460
Listen.

559
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:25,600
And every day we come out.

560
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:28,740
We come around to hear the storm.

561
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:31,960
I told you I'll hit our room with some aspirin.

562
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:34,240
Whoa, whoa.

563
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,940
That's a good thing.

564
00:28:45,160 --> 00:28:47,060
We have a thousand dollars.

565
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:56,300
And every day we're not so good.

566
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,180
We play a devil and it's so stupid.

567
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,560
You're a devil, devil.

568
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:06,780
I'm going to get you.

569
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:08,860
No.

570
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,640
Take that.

571
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,800
Take that, you little devil.

572
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,520
No, I hope you like our party.

573
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,600
Because it is it.

574
00:29:32,660 --> 00:29:34,200
I hate you.

575
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,000
Oh.

576
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:36,820
Ha ha.

577
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,040
Trust me.

578
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:41,840
Onlyaka.

579
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:45,960
Psych!

580
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,300
Hypos!

581
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:53,660
Burning 62.

582
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,940
EBACO.

583
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:55,780
Don't ask me why I know I'm that sick.

584
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:55,780


585
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:55,780


586
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:55,780


587
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,480
Water first.

588
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,200
My one and only son.

589
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:01,740
My friend.

590
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,120
Little buck.

591
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:02,340
And then you have toamızet silly.

592
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,340


593
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,340


594
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:02,340


595
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,460
That's called autism.

596
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:09,920
There's a lot of photos.

597
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:09,920


598
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:15,180
I'm going to show you some of the material we've been scraping off of Alt.Binary Slack.

599
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:19,360
It was all lemurs before that.

600
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,280
From top to bottom, all the way down.

601
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:29,720
From TR News in Washington, I'm in a bombing and shooting attack on Saturn's largest moon.

602
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:36,640
The European Space Probe said it would not retaliate after a meeting with a U.S. delegation in North Korea and Indiana.

603
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:42,380
President Bush wants $500 to spite more than 5 million low-income students.

604
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:45,640
Bush says he'll ask to be explored by spacecraft.

605
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:46,900
E-mails.

606
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:51,060
North Korea says they beat and humiliated them for PR News.

607
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:56,920
Spain's Basques have officially presented a plan for making a soft landing on PR News.

608
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:57,700
Washington.

609
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,220
Sh-de-sa-s-lumps-you. Sh-de-sa-s-lumps-you. We smell sausage.

610
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,460
Sh-de-sa-s-lumps-you. Sh-de-sa-s-lumps-you. We smell sausage.

611
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:07,460
Okay.

612
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:11,020
I just can't understand it.

613
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,420
Maybe it's just because you're stupid.

614
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,080
Oh.

615
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:13,460
Yeah.

616
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,480
So that's it.

617
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,320
That's the oldest excuse in the world.

618
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:35,000
How do you see why I was amused?

619
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:35,400
No.

620
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:39,360
I'm not amused.

621
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,400
I'm not amused.

622
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:39,420
I'm not amused.

623
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:39,420


624
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:39,420


625
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:39,420


626
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:39,420


627
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:39,420


628
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:39,420


629
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:41,620
My fellow Americans.

630
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:46,620
The Great Society rests on poverty for all.

631
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:50,380
But that is just the beginning.

632
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:58,900
The Great Society is a place where every child can find racial injustice.

633
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:03,840
It is a place where leisure is boredom and restlessness.

634
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,620
It is a place where...

635
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,600
It is a place where man serves nature.

636
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:17,680
But most of all, the Great Society is not in our classrooms.

637
00:32:19,080 --> 00:32:29,220
Aristotle said, men come together in cities in order to rebuild the entire urban United States.

638
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:35,740
Worst of all, expansion is eroding precious and time-honored loneliness.

639
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:38,020
And boredom and indifference.

640
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:41,640
And our society will never be great.

641
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:51,400
Once our natural splendor is destroyed, it can never be recaptured.

642
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:55,600
And man can no longer wonder at nature.

643
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,440
His spirit will well be .

644
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:00,100
And his the gefunden of the wasted.

645
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,680
So we must give every child hours of labor.

646
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:05,720
And I'm going to say something else and then deal with it.

647
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:05,720


648
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:05,720


649
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:05,720


650
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:05,720


651
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:05,720


652
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:05,720


653
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:05,720


654
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:05,720


655
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:05,720


656
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:09,620
to find new ways to stimulate the love of the great society.

657
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:19,600
My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,

658
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:24,520
my Government will continue to pursue policies

659
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:30,040
which entrench and promote international terrorism and organized crime.

660
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:35,820
A bill will be introduced to extend the serious organized crime agency

661
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:39,680
and the crime that flows from it will be strengthened.

662
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:46,020
My Government will continue to take action to secure high levels of manslaughter.

663
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:51,080
In particular, the bill will introduce a new offense of corporate employment

664
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:53,960
as it reforms the welfare state.

665
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,800
My Government has always recognized the importance of drug abuse

666
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,020
to help the people of the world.

667
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:04,500
We look to reduce further the numbers of those engaged in training and education.

668
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:10,500
There will be further legislation to tackle growth and prosperity

669
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:13,940
in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.

670
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,300
My Government is committed to reducing educational opportunity

671
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:23,560
and to promoting mental illness in Northern Ireland

672
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:26,100
to support the continuing exploitation.

673
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:30,000
We look forward to receiving the state government's

674
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:33,480
visit of His Excellency the President of the Republic of Canada

675
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,600
and will use this opportunity to combat human rights

676
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:39,180
on both sides of the Atlantic

677
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:42,400
and will work with the international community

678
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:47,600
to consolidate the distribution of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons

679
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:48,840
to good causes.

680
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,760
My Government will work to strengthen drug smuggling

681
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,100
and international crime

682
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:58,540
and reduce democratic reform to improve performance.

683
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,100
My Lords and Members of the House of Commons,

684
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:06,400
I pray that the blessing of Almighty God

685
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,420
may rest upon your councils.

686
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:25,540
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, commit to platform.

687
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:44,140
Subject to information being provided via the

688
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:44,560
link in the description.

689
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:44,960
1

690
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,440
Go ahead and shoot them.

691
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,180
Start right now.

692
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:55,960
Execute by engine only.

693
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,120
Pro entertainers, Ph록aoraintonavae is at the aid.

694
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,000
The Vertical Offender Operation will be in few days.

695
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,000


696
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,000


697
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,000


698
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:00,000


699
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,880
Boy, that was quite an experience.

700
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:08,020
Part of our spaceship has left us now and we're going up higher and higher, Loose Nut.

701
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:11,340
Yes, I know that, Captain Shalp.

702
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,960
Boy, we're having quite a time.

703
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,900
I wonder how everybody's doing.

704
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,820
Yes, why don't I check?

705
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:21,960
Go ahead, Loose Nut, and check on your earphones there.

706
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,480
Listen in. Sister Shalp is in the auxiliary control room.

707
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,920
And see what's going on down there, if everything is okay.

708
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,120
Captain Shalp?

709
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,340
Yes, Loose Nut?

710
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,940
Listen into your earphone.

711
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:39,680
I hear Sister Shalp singing a song right now.

712
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:53,420
Somewhere in outer space, God has prepared a place for those who trust him and obey.

713
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,680
Jesus will come again.

714
00:36:57,780 --> 00:37:00,000
And though we don't know when, we know he will come.

715
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,000


716
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:03,220
When the countdown's getting lower every day.

717
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:09,380
Ten and nine, eight and seven, six and five and four.

718
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:12,720
Call upon the Savior while you may.

719
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:18,600
Three and two, coming through the clouds in bright array.

720
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:22,240
The countdown's getting lower every day.

721
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,940
Somewhere in outer space, God has prepared a place

722
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,000
for those who trust him and obey.

723
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,980
Jesus will come again.

724
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,900
And though we don't know when, we know he will come.

725
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:41,480
The countdown's getting lower every day.

726
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:47,600
Ten and nine, eight and seven, six and five and four.

727
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:50,940
Call upon the Savior while you may.

728
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:56,900
Three and two, coming through the clouds in bright array.

729
00:37:57,700 --> 00:38:00,000
The countdown's getting lower every day.

730
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:17,340
Three and two, coming through the clouds in bright array.

731
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:17,340


732
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:29,160
Go see, it's like brings Eight Hours with You at last.

733
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:31,060
outside the Supreme Court building later today.

734
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:36,220
Powerful weak Microsoft says it will hold a blast via a phone hookup from PR News.

735
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:39,500
A suicide car bomber braved PR News in Washington.

736
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:44,280
Is it making a public performance of the Happy Birthday song a violation of copyright law?

737
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,200
Yes.

738
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:51,280
Isn't performing Happy Birthday in public a violation of the copyright law?

739
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:55,220
Yes, but according to the fair use law,

740
00:38:55,220 --> 00:39:02,260
it all depends on which country club the judge goes to.

741
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,640
That's essentially how copyright law is decided.

742
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:10,560
That's my position on copyright law.

743
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:14,180
If they catch you, then you did wrong.

744
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,940
They have not really caught me yet.

745
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:18,580
Yes?

746
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,420
Can I continue to follow Martha Stewart?

747
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,600
To follow Martha Stewart?

748
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,560
Straight into the clinker, daddy-o.

749
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,000
Oh, yeah.

750
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:31,840
Actually, being a subgenius doesn't preclude believing in any other faith.

751
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,120
In fact, you can believe in pretty much anything.

752
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,920
It'll all work in.

753
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:40,260
Our doctrine is so fluid and hypocritical

754
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:45,720
that you can pretty much believe anything and everything in the book of the subgenius.

755
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,300
Yeah?

756
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,660
Are we there yet?

757
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:49,820
Are we there yet?

758
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:54,060
Friend, that is a question only you can answer.

759
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:57,060
I love turning it around like that.

760
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:00,800
That makes people feel so crappy.

761
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,780
I'm afraid only you can answer that question.

762
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,640
The hokey pokey is what it's all about.

763
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,160
Right. Maybe the hokey pokey indeed is what it's all about.

764
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:13,120
Turn it all around.

765
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:16,660
Do you like the hokey? I don't like the hokey pokey.

766
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:17,780
That's not really an answer.

767
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,180
No. Well...

768
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,760
It's kind of hokey.

769
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:22,280
You're just repeating what she said.

770
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,140
I'm sorry.

771
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:24,840
Yeah?

772
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,140
That's it. There's your answer.

773
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:28,920
I'm a sorry, pathetic faker.

774
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:29,920
I think you're cool.

775
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:30,840
See?

776
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:32,140
See?

777
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,760
Okay. What else?

778
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:48,440
Well, actually, it looks like there's a new set of Bob videos out,

779
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:50,340
which is what has been showing back there.

780
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,460
That's what I've been doing for the last year,

781
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:54,060
is replanting.

782
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,640
I've been finishing my animation and video cutting skills.

783
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,360
Nobody reads anymore.

784
00:41:00,100 --> 00:41:02,860
But I've been selling our old video, Arise.

785
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:05,680
A lot of people have been buying that,

786
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,800
especially since I started giving it away.

787
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,260
You can download.

788
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:12,000
By the way, I will proudly tell you this.

789
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,740
All of our best work,

790
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,620
you can download right now off of a news group

791
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:18,140
called Alt Binary Slack

792
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:21,760
and another one called Alt Binary's Monterre Movies.

793
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,300
All of it for free.

794
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,720
And they're not crappy copies.

795
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,680
They're the kind that you can put onto a CD

796
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:28,400
and play it in your DVD player.

797
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,580
It's not a DVD, but it's closed.

798
00:41:31,080 --> 00:41:33,180
And ever since we announced that

799
00:41:33,180 --> 00:41:35,060
and started giving our stuff away,

800
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:37,040
by God, if I didn't start,

801
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,420
the orders tripled.

802
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,700
So now I've got three orders.

803
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,080
So, you know, yeah.

804
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,480
He, uh...

805
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:46,880
I don't understand.

806
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:47,840
He's good for keeping passports

807
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:50,240
and waterproofing cases.

808
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,980
Now, I thought you weren't in the memory part.

809
00:41:52,420 --> 00:41:54,160
Oh, no, I'm the memory part.

810
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:54,520
Oh.

811
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:55,740
I understand.

812
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,440
I understand.

813
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:57,400
And translate.

814
00:41:57,460 --> 00:41:58,820
You'll be on the center and do it.

815
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,160
And translate.

816
00:41:59,200 --> 00:41:59,980
He remembers.

817
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:00,620
Yeah.

818
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,900
I'm the read-only memory.

819
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:06,520
She's the real intelligence behind the thing.

820
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:08,440
Sort of like a pipe and Bob.

821
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,740
The pipe is the real brain.

822
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,940
Bob is just missing the...

823
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,420
We are smoking you.

824
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,820
Bob is there.

825
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,540
You're taking the question, though.

826
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:20,380
No.

827
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:22,700
You're on the air.

828
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,560
Just in the far east,

829
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:28,500
it is spoken that there is a sacred tortilla

830
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:30,040
above his head.

831
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:32,860
Is it Plano, Texas?

832
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,220
That was, uh...

833
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,520
Yeah, that was a long, long time ago.

834
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:42,200
This is supposedly more holy than the grail,

835
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,540
the Christian grail.

836
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,320
It has magical powers.

837
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:45,840
I am understood.

838
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,340
Well, it was back in the 80s.

839
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:50,220
But then they started appearing on, like,

840
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,640
everybody's tortillas.

841
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,520
What about...

842
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,280
Eventually, they just started marketing

843
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:54,820
these tortillas.

844
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,140
Damn, Dobbs had tortillas,

845
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,540
and then the market was flooded,

846
00:42:57,580 --> 00:42:58,660
and it lost its holiness.

847
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,220
What about the dinner roll?

848
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,520
The dinner roll that was discovered?

849
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,220
There was a dinner roll also in Plano.

850
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:09,500
Yeah, that was in Plano, Texas.

851
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,140
You're right.

852
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:13,160
There's a famous photograph of that

853
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,840
in the Book of the Subgenius.

854
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,880
Where can I come to adore and worship after Bob?

855
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:21,140
I don't...

856
00:43:21,140 --> 00:43:22,460
You must kill Bob.

857
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,300
You must find him and kill him.

858
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:24,780
Well, first...

859
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:26,200
First, you have to become a minister,

860
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:32,000
which, uh, that's, uh, involves quite a bit of money,

861
00:43:32,140 --> 00:43:32,820
and...

862
00:43:32,820 --> 00:43:34,300
I have very much money.

863
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:35,760
What do you want?

864
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,240
Jewels?

865
00:43:36,320 --> 00:43:36,760
Wealth?

866
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:37,940
Travel the world?

867
00:43:39,100 --> 00:43:40,280
Do you have any children?

868
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,380
No children.

869
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,620
I am a homosexual.

870
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:44,620
Oh.

871
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,320
We might be willing to trade children for...

872
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,280
I am a woman.

873
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:48,560
For power.

874
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,280
I am a lesbian.

875
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:50,840
Really?

876
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:51,600
Yes.

877
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:53,600
That's a wonderful voice you've got there,

878
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,180
let me tell you.

879
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,260
Well, when you are a lesbian,

880
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,020
that's very good.

881
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,480
You have a very male voice.

882
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,360
It gets you around better.

883
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,320
I bet.

884
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,420
We might have a, uh,

885
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,720
some sort of a work,

886
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:05,760
harder work,

887
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,840
work study plan

888
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,520
at the Dobstown.

889
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:09,340
You're a...

890
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,840
Home for slackless children.

891
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,520
How big is the cage at Dobstown?

892
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,900
How large would the cage be for me?

893
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:17,900
Very, very large.

894
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,060
So that even you,

895
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,340
who are a strong, like, bull,

896
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:22,360
make good wife, you will.

897
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:24,440
I thank you very much.

898
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:25,080
Uh...

899
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:26,260
Praise the Bob.

900
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:27,260
Praise the Bob.

901
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:30,160
I think that guy had us confused

902
00:44:30,160 --> 00:44:32,080
with that other cult that worships,

903
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:32,640
The Bob.

904
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:33,480
I don't know.

905
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,660
Who is the Bob anyway?

906
00:44:34,740 --> 00:44:35,660
You're on the air, by the way.

907
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,100
It's, uh, 6873515.

908
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:38,920
Caller.

909
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:39,520
Yeah, Bob.

910
00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,440
You know...

911
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:42,400
With the Lincoln?

912
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,060
With the Lincoln.

913
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:45,260
Yeah.

914
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,400
When you say Lincoln,

915
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,120
what class of object are you referring to?

916
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:50,620
We're talking about an automobile.

917
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:51,880
No.

918
00:44:52,620 --> 00:44:53,400
You're on the air.

919
00:44:53,640 --> 00:44:54,420
Hey, how's it going?

920
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,800
It's Bucky calling from Canada.

921
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:57,140
Well, Bucky.

922
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,580
Good to hear from you again.

923
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,080
How you been?

924
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,020
I'm all right.

925
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:01,160
I was, uh, just calling in.

926
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:01,800
I got a couple questions,

927
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:02,540
and I'm way behind,

928
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,220
because I started calling in about half an hour ago.

929
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:04,880
Oh, yeah.

930
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,680
But it's one of those ring, ring, ring,

931
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:07,900
then my phone hangs up thing.

932
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:08,440
Ah, yeah.

933
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,460
I know how that is.

934
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:10,780
My question is, actually,

935
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:11,600
my first thing is a point.

936
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,100
The opposite of Burning Man,

937
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,020
wouldn't that be, like, a wet woman?

938
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:16,540
Yeah.

939
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:18,060
But somebody else was, like,

940
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:19,600
well, Drowning Woman was...

941
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,580
We thought about calling it Drowning Woman,

942
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:22,320
but then we thought,

943
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,280
no, that was, um...

944
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:23,940
That would...

945
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:25,920
That's negative marketing, you know?

946
00:45:26,280 --> 00:45:26,640
That would...

947
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:27,040
Ah.

948
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,760
So we were trying to hone it...

949
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:29,740
How about Non-Flammable Woman?

950
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:30,120
What would...

951
00:45:30,120 --> 00:45:32,300
What really is the selling point?

952
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:32,720
And that's...

953
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,740
Non-Flammable Woman.

954
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:34,080
...naked woman,

955
00:45:34,220 --> 00:45:35,440
as opposed to Burning Man.

956
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,940
Non-Flammable Woman.

957
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:37,940
You actually...

958
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,580
Flame-Retardant Woman.

959
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,040
Fire-Retardant Woman.

960
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:44,780
Fire-Retardant Woman.

961
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:47,400
Inappropriate!

962
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:48,320
Oh, you know what?

963
00:45:48,360 --> 00:45:49,560
I think I had to bleep that out,

964
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:50,780
because you mentioned a price on there.

965
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:51,360
Oh.

966
00:45:52,080 --> 00:45:52,560
Who?

967
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,440
I'm not sure, though.

968
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:55,100
You're not really advertising the event,

969
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:55,700
but I don't know.

970
00:45:55,760 --> 00:45:56,420
I have no idea.

971
00:45:57,260 --> 00:45:57,700
No.

972
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,300
Oh, Burning Man is actually a non-commercial event.

973
00:46:00,740 --> 00:46:01,460
I know it is.

974
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:02,380
Oh.

975
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:03,340
We've got another caller here.

976
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,480
We're gonna expand the panel to four callers now.

977
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:07,860
You're on the air.

978
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:09,800
Inappropriate.

979
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,440
Yeah.

980
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:12,380
Anyway...

981
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:12,660
Wow.

982
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:13,400
What was that?

983
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,120
Inappropriate.

984
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:14,700
That was...

985
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:16,400
Inappropriate!

986
00:46:16,460 --> 00:46:16,980
You know, when...

987
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:19,460
That's the guy from the, uh, FCC,

988
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:22,980
who calls up to make sure that everything is,

989
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:23,320
uh,

990
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:24,960
you know,

991
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,000
you know what you have to do,

992
00:46:26,020 --> 00:46:26,260
Senator,

993
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:27,080
is you have to find...

994
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:29,100
There's an FCC song out by Eric Idle.

995
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:30,180
Oh, yeah?

996
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:31,180
It's, uh...

997
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,360
I can't even say the title of it,

998
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:32,940
because it would be bleeped.

999
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:34,560
Oh, yeah?

1000
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:35,160
Try it.

1001
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:35,860
It's, uh...

1002
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,300
It's Blank You Very Much, the FCC.

1003
00:46:37,940 --> 00:46:38,380
Oh, yes.

1004
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:38,640
And it's...

1005
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:39,780
It's not blank.

1006
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:41,340
It's an expletive.

1007
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:42,480
Expletive.

1008
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:42,980
Oh, boy.

1009
00:46:43,080 --> 00:46:43,740
Well, you know what?

1010
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,060
I'm gonna say that right now.

1011
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:46,580
Fuck the FCC.

1012
00:46:46,920 --> 00:46:47,240
Of course!

1013
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,680
It is politically protected speech,

1014
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,460
and we have aired a disclaimer.

1015
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:52,820
Did you just...

1016
00:46:52,820 --> 00:46:53,920
I can't tell if that went out or not.

1017
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:54,480
It's on the radio right now.

1018
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:54,960
Ah, say!

1019
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,200
Did that go,

1020
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:57,240
or did you have to bleep yourself?

1021
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:58,420
Uh...

1022
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,280
It went.

1023
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:00,060
It went.

1024
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:00,860
And, uh,

1025
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:01,640
I think...

1026
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,560
We haven't gotten obscene yet.

1027
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:04,020
We've been...

1028
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,360
We're allowed to be indecent,

1029
00:47:05,420 --> 00:47:06,700
but we're not allowed to be obscene.

1030
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:07,800
Right, right.

1031
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:09,840
And because that was a political statement,

1032
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,960
it is, by definition, not obscene,

1033
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:12,880
because it, uh...

1034
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,520
It worked for me.

1035
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:14,960
It has serious...

1036
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,040
It has serious literary...

1037
00:47:16,040 --> 00:47:17,860
Oh, is that what they're calling it now?

1038
00:47:18,060 --> 00:47:18,340
...notistic merit?

1039
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:18,340


1040
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:20,440
You're exercising your right to really free speech.

1041
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:20,940
That's right.

1042
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,560
We've got one more caller here now.

1043
00:47:22,660 --> 00:47:23,440
Uh, you're on the air.

1044
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:23,900
Uh...

1045
00:47:25,940 --> 00:47:26,420
Uh...

1046
00:47:26,420 --> 00:47:26,920
Absolutely...

1047
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,160
Wrong.

1048
00:47:29,580 --> 00:47:31,040
What happened to Pig Man?

1049
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:31,620
Pig Man...

1050
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,300
I heard Pig Man's voice earlier tonight.

1051
00:47:33,420 --> 00:47:35,440
Pig Man called up just for a second,

1052
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:36,580
and got cut off!

1053
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:39,160
I don't remember Pig Man exactly,

1054
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:40,100
um...

1055
00:47:40,100 --> 00:47:41,560
I'm certain it was Pig Man.

1056
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,980
I barely recognize the voice,

1057
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,220
but I think I heard something...

1058
00:47:45,220 --> 00:47:45,680
Someone,

1059
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:46,960
someone something like that.

1060
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:48,320
Hmm.

1061
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:49,780
But, uh...

1062
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:50,840
One of my last questions.

1063
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:51,480
Um,

1064
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:52,020
okay,

1065
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:52,980
I have a question about beer.

1066
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:53,900
We were talking about the idea

1067
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:53,900


1068
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:53,900


1069
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:53,900


1070
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:53,900


1071
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:53,900


1072
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:53,900


1073
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:53,900


1074
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:53,900


1075
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:58,440
I think I had some that I might have offered to you the other weekend.

1076
00:47:58,580 --> 00:47:58,960
You did.

1077
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:00,800
You didn't have a digit.

1078
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,040
I declined.

1079
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:07,480
As a result, I had so much extra of this Molson Canadian that I bought in Cleveland

1080
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:12,140
that we brought it back to Canada, Helena and I, when we came back.

1081
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:17,420
So my question is, as I'm drinking Molson Canadian from Cleveland back here in Canada,

1082
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:19,000
am I drinking imported beer?

1083
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:23,180
It's called re-imported. Re-importation, just like...

1084
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:25,040
They let you take drugs across the border?

1085
00:48:25,180 --> 00:48:29,220
Right. Like, a lot of Americans go to Canada to get prescription drugs

1086
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:33,380
for the cheaper government price-controlled price over there.

1087
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:33,920
Right.

1088
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:37,000
And then they bring them back to the U.S., even though they were made in the U.S. originally.

1089
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:39,600
We call that re-importation of prescription drugs.

1090
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,060
We figured that the beer would be technically... that the word would have to be deported.

1091
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:45,320
The beer was deported.

1092
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:51,200
From PR News in Washington, I'm described as a paltry and miserly car bombing in Baghdad

1093
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:52,800
during a raid on parts of Wisconsin.

1094
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:55,320
Michigan, Indiana, and Afghanistan,

1095
00:48:55,820 --> 00:49:00,020
and a buffer between the expanding European Union and northern Ohio.

1096
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:04,820
Sami Mohammed Ali Saeed Al-Jahaf, Abu Omar Al-Khourdi,

1097
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:08,560
will be part of a larger package in the war on PR News.

1098
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:10,720
The God Almighty...

1099
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:11,920
We'll have to make it another week, but...

1100
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,380
The God Almighty...

1101
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:16,760
The...

1102
00:49:20,340 --> 00:49:21,300
Very soon.

1103
00:49:21,540 --> 00:49:23,160
And then all of a sudden there was...

1104
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,700
The God Almighty...

1105
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,440
Canadian flag on the screen.

1106
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:27,480
You know, I never really asked.

1107
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:30,400
Yeah.

1108
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:31,640
It's about time.

1109
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:32,540
He's stagged.

1110
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,560
He's stagged.

1111
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,280
It's about time.

1112
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:40,960
He's stagged.

1113
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:42,160
Aren't you the delivery boy?

1114
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:42,880
I know.

1115
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,320
Sweet little pussy.

1116
00:49:47,860 --> 00:49:49,480
The God Almighty...

1117
00:49:49,480 --> 00:49:51,240
I hear you got a sweet little pussy.

1118
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:56,300
You know, I never really asked.

1119
00:49:56,580 --> 00:49:57,620
He's stagged.

1120
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,240
Who's a commercial?

1121
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:02,800
He's stagged.

1122
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:09,960
You know, I never really asked.

1123
00:50:10,140 --> 00:50:11,300
But you have to assume.

1124
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,860
Then how good are you?

1125
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,840
The God Almighty.

1126
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:20,740
Then how good are you?

1127
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:23,000
The God Almighty.

1128
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:24,200
Then how good are you?

1129
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:26,300
The God Almighty.

1130
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:27,480
Then how good are you?

1131
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:29,280
The God Almighty.

1132
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:30,460
Then how good are you?

1133
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,720
The God Almighty.

1134
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:32,920
The God Almighty.

1135
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:33,480
Then how good are you?

1136
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,260
Who's he trying to contact?

1137
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:39,980
He told me that the world is in big trouble,

1138
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,600
and he wants me to —

1139
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:42,120
Not now, Bob.

1140
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:46,100
What am I doing?

1141
00:50:46,100 --> 00:50:46,540
I have to go out.

1142
00:50:49,320 --> 00:50:50,580
Champion Ong, I want to makeain of this—

1143
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,100
You know, I never really asked.

1144
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,220
I met God today.

1145
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:13,740
Andy, I met God today.

1146
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:19,080
Andy, I met God today.

1147
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:23,620
Andy, I met God today.

1148
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,380
Cool.

1149
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:27,520
Cool.

1150
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:29,520
Cool.

1151
00:51:30,580 --> 00:51:32,100
Then what good are you?

1152
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:33,820
What good are any of you?

1153
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:36,740
Must I do everything myself?

1154
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,080
Over here.

1155
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:52,240
Cool.

1156
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:57,820
Do you have special powers?

1157
00:51:58,180 --> 00:51:58,640
Did he?

1158
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,640
God is the most powerful being in the universe.

1159
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:12,300
Do you have special powers?

1160
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,300
Did he?

1161
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,280
God is the most powerful being in the universe.

1162
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,180
What's going on?

1163
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,060
She's taking it.

1164
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:19,220
Is it?

1165
00:52:19,220 --> 00:52:19,360
Shaking over.

1166
00:52:19,600 --> 00:52:19,760
Shaking over.

1167
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:20,200
It's horrible.

1168
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:25,600
누리�ędzie usted?

1169
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:27,900
Don't ask.

1170
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:45,920
That's town reforms,

1171
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:49,040
MRNQR community should consider engaging.

1172
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:51,340
Turn his arm into a missile launcher like Megalor?

1173
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,020
Well, I saw him make himself a hundred feet tall.

1174
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:59,180
He certainly does.

1175
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:02,960
I'd like to get a little bit of that jobs on my dork.

1176
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:06,020
Can he turn his arm into a missile launcher like Megalor?

1177
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:12,400
Well, feline animal is not available for petting in any petting zoo.

1178
00:53:12,660 --> 00:53:14,980
Can he turn his arm into a missile launcher like...

1179
00:53:14,980 --> 00:53:17,860
I see the alien heart that I'm not interested.

1180
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:22,900
Well, where's the devil?

1181
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:23,700
I saw no cats.

1182
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:27,360
You just don't want to see the alien heart that I'm not interested.

1183
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,080
Well, where's the devil?

1184
00:53:30,220 --> 00:53:32,480
Can he turn his arm into a missile launcher like...

1185
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:34,440
I just don't want to see the alien heart that I'm not interested.

1186
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:37,260
I'm not interested.

1187
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:39,040
My little smilodon.

1188
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:42,100
Can he turn his arm into a missile launcher like Megalor?

1189
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:44,800
Well, I saw him make himself a hundred feet tall.

1190
00:53:45,260 --> 00:53:46,340
I don't know missiles.

1191
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:49,180
No.

1192
00:53:50,520 --> 00:53:51,000
No.

1193
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:56,000
I swear, I saw him with my own eyes.

1194
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:58,920
Um, just like the UFO you saw when we were camping.

1195
00:53:59,240 --> 00:53:59,240


1196
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:08,880
Hey, you can't tell me that the government has a helicopter that can veer sideways with that kind of velocity.

1197
00:54:09,140 --> 00:54:09,820
And, uh...

1198
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:15,140
I know you scientists would love to get home and get a few DNA samples off a monster.

1199
00:54:15,140 --> 00:54:16,260
Hey, you can't tell me that the go...

1200
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,060
That may or may not have...

1201
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:20,360
been psychic TV.

1202
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:22,040
I really don't know.

1203
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,560
It was labeled psychic TV when I downloaded it.

1204
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:29,280
And before that, we heard, of course, some PR news from, uh...

1205
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:30,700
Leemur.

1206
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:33,880
We heard some radio synesthesia.

1207
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,960
That's Dr. Sinister's show on WCSB in Cleveland on Sunday nights.

1208
00:54:39,100 --> 00:54:41,320
Right after the hour of Slackware.

1209
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:44,220
We use that show a lot, and it uses us.

1210
00:54:44,420 --> 00:54:47,860
And before that, I think a little bit of yours truly preaching at Starwood.

1211
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,060
If you need to know more...

1212
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:52,760
about the Church of the Subgenius, or the Swinging Love Corpses,

1213
00:54:52,760 --> 00:54:55,400
which is, uh, what produced the music in the background,

1214
00:54:55,640 --> 00:54:59,580
please check out www.subgenius.com.

1215
00:54:59,940 --> 00:55:05,480
Or you can write to us at Hour of Slack, or Bob, or Subgenius Foundation

1216
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:08,640
at Box 181-417,

1217
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:15,000
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1218
00:55:15,540 --> 00:55:17,960
Accept no substitutes.

1219
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:23,300
We've got another line blanking here.

1220
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,700
Dare we see who's on here?

1221
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:25,380
You're on the air.

1222
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:30,360
Hello?

1223
00:55:31,340 --> 00:55:33,660
Man, what's with this, uh...

1224
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:38,440
You want to wait or no with the line?

1225
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:41,200
What is it?

1226
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,980
It's a coded message from God.

1227
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:48,680
Actually, it's from the Illuminati, actually.

1228
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,160
Who is this guy?

1229
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:55,120
The, the, uh, the ringing, the frequency of the, of the ringing phone.

1230
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,020
When, you know, you hear the phone ringing,

1231
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,980
that's actually vibrating a specific frequency.

1232
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,120
It's a coded message from the Illuminati.

1233
00:56:02,340 --> 00:56:03,900
I don't understand this.

1234
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:08,120
Well, then you're in some trouble, because you're, you're the only hope.

1235
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:09,340
Don't you understand?

1236
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,340
The Illuminati are trying to contact you because you are the chosen one.

1237
00:56:13,860 --> 00:56:14,820
This is not right.

1238
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:16,620
You alone will have the power to save us.

1239
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,220
This is not right.

1240
00:56:18,220 --> 00:56:19,000
I don't understand.

1241
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:19,760
I agree with this.

1242
00:56:19,860 --> 00:56:20,360
So what?

1243
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:20,720
I don't know.

1244
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:23,860
Anyway, enough of that guy.

1245
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:27,040
I just cut him off.

1246
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:28,180
I, I do that.

1247
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:30,900
Eh, and the shit's a bit...

1248
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,340
Can I say that on the radio?

1249
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,120
I guess.

1250
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:37,400
If there's anything you should be able to say on the radio, it's, uh, it's that.

1251
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,200
Yeah.

1252
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:41,580
But, uh, I'm gonna free up another line for you guys so you can take some more calls.

1253
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:42,560
Alright, hey, you know what?

1254
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:43,660
I keep forgetting your name.

1255
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,120
I mean, I recognize you and me, Bucky.

1256
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:46,640
Right.

1257
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:47,460
Okay, Bucky.

1258
00:56:47,460 --> 00:56:51,560
No, he's named that for those giant teeth that stick out in front like a cartoon squirrel

1259
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:51,920
man.

1260
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:52,660
Yeah.

1261
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,980
That's exactly what I'm gonna do.

1262
00:56:53,980 --> 00:56:55,100
Huge giant buck teeth.

1263
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:55,580
Okay.

1264
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,460
I'm not gonna forget.

1265
00:56:56,620 --> 00:56:58,420
He can cut down a telephone pole.

1266
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:02,520
When you get him real drunk, he can cut down a telephone pole in about half an hour.

1267
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:06,960
Actually, I actually stole the name from, uh, uh, our Buckminster Fuller.

1268
00:57:07,020 --> 00:57:08,460
Although people keep on, uh...

1269
00:57:09,020 --> 00:57:09,640
Bucky Fuller.

1270
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:13,240
People keep on insinuating that I stole it from Captain America's sidekick, Bucky.

1271
00:57:14,480 --> 00:57:15,780
No, I figured that you stole it from Buckminster Fuller.

1272
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:16,760
I like the Bucky ball.

1273
00:57:16,860 --> 00:57:17,440
Bucky Fuller.

1274
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:17,440


1275
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:22,520
I know there are many subgeniuses who are, are Buckminster Fuller, uh...

1276
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,760
Buckminster Fullerites.

1277
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,180
He's their, uh, long derp or sap for many.

1278
00:57:26,500 --> 00:57:28,040
Well, yeah, but that's, that's the problem.

1279
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:32,660
See, I was partway through reading, uh, Synergetics, uh, when I, when I made a post to All Black

1280
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:34,760
Slack and had to pick a name, and off I went with Bucky.

1281
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:35,780
I just like that...

1282
00:57:35,780 --> 00:57:36,600
I never finished reading it.

1283
00:57:36,680 --> 00:57:36,860
I just...

1284
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:40,320
So all the people that want to talk about our Buckminster Fuller, I'm only on page 60.

1285
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,420
I like the, uh...

1286
00:57:41,420 --> 00:57:42,380
And it's like a 500-page book.

1287
00:57:42,580 --> 00:57:46,040
I like the fact that he went by Buckminster instead of whatever his first name was.

1288
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:46,780
You know, like...

1289
00:57:46,780 --> 00:57:47,620
I think it was Richard.

1290
00:57:48,280 --> 00:57:48,680
Richard.

1291
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:50,300
Or Buckminster.

1292
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:51,400
Which name do you want to...

1293
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:51,560
Dick.

1294
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:52,440
Go by, go by.

1295
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:53,140
Dick Fuller.

1296
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:54,900
Dick sounds like a joke name.

1297
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:55,760
I think I see why now.

1298
00:57:56,020 --> 00:57:58,100
You know, a brush salesman joke name.

1299
00:57:58,220 --> 00:57:59,540
But Buckminster, now that's a name.

1300
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:00,480
Dick Fuller.

1301
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,240
And they, there are molecules named after him now, such as...

1302
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:04,840
Right, they're not gonna call him Dicky Balls.

1303
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:04,980
They're...

1304
00:58:04,980 --> 00:58:07,160
They're the Bucky Ball and the Bucky Tube.

1305
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:07,780
They're called Bucky Balls for obvious reasons.

1306
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,160
C60.

1307
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:13,260
If you call the carbon, that type of carbon arrangement a, uh, if that's what it is, a

1308
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:16,240
Dicky Ball, that would be laughable, risible.

1309
00:58:16,380 --> 00:58:16,760
Yeah.

1310
00:58:16,780 --> 00:58:18,780
He would turn in his grave.

1311
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:19,780
That's right.

1312
00:58:19,940 --> 00:58:21,700
Well, Bucky Balls is pretty funny if you...

1313
00:58:21,700 --> 00:58:22,440
Yeah, that's a...

1314
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,380
Yeah, but it's cute.

1315
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,960
If you're me and people call you Bucky and start talking about Bucky Balls, it's a little

1316
00:58:26,960 --> 00:58:29,180
bit, uh, that's a little bit weird too.

1317
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:29,880
Right.

1318
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:31,140
That's the kind of thing you see at X-Day.

1319
00:58:31,260 --> 00:58:33,400
You see a lot of Bucky Balls at X-Day if you hang around the pool.

1320
00:58:33,500 --> 00:58:33,780
Gross.

1321
00:58:33,900 --> 00:58:34,380
Oh, boy.

1322
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:36,420
Horrible.

1323
00:58:36,580 --> 00:58:37,780
Anyway, that's, that's enough for me.

1324
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,900
I've explained my name and, uh, I'll see you guys later.

1325
00:58:40,060 --> 00:58:40,380
All right.

1326
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:41,080
Bye.

1327
00:58:41,140 --> 00:58:41,700
You have a good night.

1328
00:58:44,880 --> 00:58:46,520
The shakes go too much.

1329
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:46,760
Time to go.

1330
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:46,760


1331
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:46,760


1332
00:58:46,760 --> 00:58:51,140
One of the kids down at the bank got kneed from a little just went hair like that.

1333
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:51,440
Two.

1334
00:58:51,540 --> 00:58:51,820
Yeah.

1335
00:58:52,020 --> 00:58:52,640
Oh, no.

1336
00:58:52,880 --> 00:58:54,820
The rat drove off and left him there.

1337
00:58:55,020 --> 00:58:55,340
What?

1338
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:56,300
What's yours, Tom?

1339
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,320
Cream puff went.

1340
00:58:57,640 --> 00:59:00,320
Do other people's children like this find out?

1341
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:01,440
Uh, no.

1342
00:59:01,900 --> 00:59:02,340
Yeah.

1343
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:05,440
Yeah.

1344
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:05,780
Yeah, no.

1345
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:07,240
Yeah, no.

1346
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:09,480
Boys and cream, no friend here is boy flabby.

1347
00:59:09,500 --> 00:59:11,100
Here, the eye got my girl's fluff.

1348
00:59:11,200 --> 00:59:11,680
Oh, no.

1349
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,580
But I know what the lips time.

1350
00:59:13,640 --> 00:59:14,740
That the little delights went.

1351
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:16,460
You stop it.

1352
00:59:16,520 --> 00:59:16,740
You stop it.

1353
00:59:16,740 --> 00:59:18,500
while trying to talk.

1354
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:22,900
Try to talk and find out what makes your life better.

1355
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,760
Friends, you're listening to...

1356
00:59:28,560 --> 00:59:32,020
Friends, you're listening to...

1357
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,900
Friends, you're listening to...

1358
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:39,760
Friends, you're listening to...

1359
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:41,120
Lestos di ando, lestos di ando...
