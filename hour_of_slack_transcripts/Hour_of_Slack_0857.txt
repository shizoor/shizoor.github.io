I've done far worse than kill you.
I've hurt you.
And I wish to go on hurting you.
What?
Oh, uh...
Say, kids, what time?
What time is it?
I wonder exactly in a temporary way.
Can we really understand time?
Of course you can, kids.
And here's the easiest way you can.
Just pull those gentle, tender flaps apart
and sit down quietly between your own knees
and just begin.
That's right.
Be brave and time to the music.
Uh...

Go!
Well, we've asked everybody here
if they've got a special request
for each and every one of you here.
I have a burden.
God has given Pastor a message for you.
God has given.
Bad, bad hit.
For you, the devil has gone far enough.
The devil has gone far enough.
Prayer warrior!
Prayer warrior!
Meet me on my knees.
On your knees, Friday night.
Prayer warrior!
At 7.30.
And listen now, my friends,
the prayer tower is open.
The prayer tower is open right now.
Prayer warrior!
You that need prayer.
We're going to pray.
My God.
The prayer team is here.
We're going to hang down.
Right now.
Remove those brain parts.
I'll stick this on.
What the hell is that?
Light your problem.
Light up.
Test it back.
Well, welcome to the hour of slack.
Praise Bob Gold and Connie Drag.
Yes, welcome to the hour of slack.
I have no time to make a show of loving kindness
before my fellow men.
Not in this life.
I've too much laughing to do.
Hurrah!
This goes to show.
What is with meaning?
You know what I mean?
Meaning is so relative.
What is reality?
What?
Reality.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What is reality?
Know what you what?
Just so selfish.
I don't get it.
What is reality?
See, we can make people trip right on the air
on various toxic substances,
bacterial agents,
and some of them only charge 15%.
Reality is what doesn't go away when dot, dot, dot.
But let's leave things of this world behind and walk now down the path of Bob for this brief
minute of slack from the church of the subgenius.
This so-called civilization?
On the day when we finally realize that things are all backwards and we have slack without
work in the promised kingdom of Bob Dobbs, then perhaps we'll find the true civilization
which needs not Xerox machines nor fancy coats and ties.
It don't have to have them.
It can have them.
You can be civilized and not live in a cave, but you're probably going to be more civilized
being one of these characters that sits in a cave scratching his butt than you are running
around on this treadmill of false slack.
Oh yes, and look at the humans lined up for the slaughterhouse.
Oh yes, the harvest.
Praise Bob.
Let there be slack.
I'm just an American boy.
I'm just an American boy.
Raised on MTV.
And I seen all the kids in the soda pop pants, but none of them look like me.
So I started looking around for a light out of the dim.
And the first thing I heard that made sense was the world of Mahogany.


I was told to get a sword and a hammer and peace be upon them.
I shot and knew.

Remix number two by Dr. Onan's Wotan Band.
And before that, my sermon,
backed by Einstein's Secret Orchestra
at the Blind Lemon Club DeVival in Cleveland last year.
And speaking of last year, friends,
the world ends tomorrow!
This is our track.
Now it's on.
Running along the top of the muscles and all of that was torn loose.
It's so wonderful.
It's considered benevolent in that part of the world.
The ice is right there.
Here. There it is.
All right.
Look at that. Just like that.
Just that. Because it's plastic.
We've got the red dot in here because it's so wonderful.
Um, but, and, uh, and we were going around
and didn't even think we liked each other too much.
Well, you know what?
I don't know.
I don't have a clue.
$140.
The end times are near.
Hello.
Hello, monsters are born.
Did the end times come yet?
Are we incarcerated?
Are we dead?
Come here.
Or are we just thinking of a new way of living?
Look at this beautiful Bel Air mansion
made from stucco and popo
and filled with your favorite 3.5 kids.
Some of them have their asses dangling from the cactus
in their backyard, but you're a cowboy dad
and you're ready for this new century.
Let's go bomb.
Let's go bomb.
Let's go bomb with the president.
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!


Now that fella knows how to get bombs.
Let's go do some drugs.
Legal drugs, that is.
Yeah!
Hey, let's put on a thing of these furry monkey pants
and dance for the guy with a grinded his organ over there
against a telephone pole.
It's disgusting.
Of course it's disgusting.
It's the world we're living in today.
Open your eyes, dearly.
Open them wider.
No, a little wider.
Open them up wider.
OK, you got to get the drops in there.
Can you help me put the sticks up?
You can't look away now.
That's right.
Oh, that's right.
I threw up.
Yep, when I looked at my TV and saw what was going on,
I threw up.
I threw up.
I threw up.

I threw up.
I threw up.
I threw up.
Bye now.
What is the meaning of this?
You'll be reborn now, you hear?
What is the meaning of this?
The meaning of death and the cycle of rebirth.
What is the meaning of the tender, tiny thread that extends
from the flap below the reptile's eye deep into the womb
of nature itself?
There is a seeker born every minute.
Well, as far as our scientists have been able to determine,
the purpose of life is, in fact, simply to squirt.
Or in the case of some creature, it's to squirt.
Or in the case of some creature, it's to ooze.
Ah, squirting and oozing.
Ultimately, an ooze squirt.
Yes, that's it.
There's no high, lofty meaning of life.
It is simply to...
Squirt and ooze.
Yes, and not for the procreation aspects, just for the pleasure.
The mere ejaculation and the vibration.
That's it.
And banging the nervous system ever so gently.
Yes, if you're looking for a meaning, there it is.
It doesn't matter whether it's by yourself or with somebody else.
It's just a bit...
That's it.
You can just take a walk out into your neighborhood any day
and get on the bus and get that same sensation
as you ride over them old potholes.
You know, life ain't much more than a oozing and a squirting
and a kind of a dangerous feeling coming up the back of your neck.
I'm gonna rub my little rat belly.
Things are growing up there now.
They're growing now.
And like bad thoughts, you know,
just hanging in the top of your head.
They can't get out.
They got to find a way out some day.
Oh, I can't wait to have Bob rub my little round belly
over at that rabbit supper tonight.
Oh, he's gonna rub you like a Buddhist belly.
He's gonna create more slack out of the top of your head than you ever saw.
Hey, old Bob, he's Bodhi Shatva.
Yeah.
He's a fully realized enlightened being.
He's gonna be at that squirrel supper tonight.
You gonna be there, Benny?
Hey, look, he's eating barbecued chicken.
And I never know Bodhi Shatva.
I enjoyed meat that way.
I mean, you know, that way.
Oh, hell, you know, him and Bob go way back.
I threw up.
Yeah, it's hard to pull it out of your moon pants.
Teej, you just let it go out in front.
Is that you going through there, Musgrave?
Now, why in the world would I be going through there, D-D-Dog?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah.



Yeah.
Yeah.

Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I kidnapped the future and ransomed it for the past.
I made time wait up for me to bleed my lizard.
My infernal breath wilts the tree of life.
I left my sword on the rock of ages.
Who will tear flesh with me?
Who will spill their juice?
Who will gouge with me?
Whose candle will I fart out?
Good.
I'm ready.
So step aside, all you but loot.
Neurotic, insecure, bespectacled slaps all went meet.
I'm a crime-fighting master criminal.
I am not insane.
I'm a screamer and a laugher.
I make a spectacle of myself.
I am a sight.
My physical type cannot be classified by science.
My familiar is a pterodactyl.
I feed it to feagles.
Dziękuję milia.
You are a spy and a ratsam.

I hate it
the swingin' love corpse is live
in St. Louis
1991 and now
from the Akron Revival
this summer, Dr. Katahdin
Legu
who starts his sermon by reading
a suicide
note
a suicide note, is it mine?
I found this suicide note. It was from a young teenage girl. At least from the content I'm assuming it was a teenage girl.
It says here, I'm tired of the pain in my heart. You are all so unfair to me. You don't love me and you don't understand me.
Everyone hates me because I'm fat and ugly. The only thing I ever wanted was to be with Patrick.
But I found out he was at the mall with that slut Michelle. And I hope they all feel bad when I'm gone.
But, tough. I tried to talk to you about it, Mom. But you was more interested in your soap operas than my real problems.
So I'm not going to bother with that.
I'm not going to bother any of you anymore. And I hope Patrick is real happy at the mall with his slut.
You're going soft aren't you?
I hope you're all happy now. Goodbye.
What a stupid little bitch.
Fucking shit yeah.
The very idea of offing yourself because of some stupid little problem like that makes me think, well...
What is a problem?
What is a problem that's worthy of killing yourself?
And it reminded me. It reminded me of when I was a child.
When I was a child I grew up in a town called Mansfield, New Jersey.
And out on Route 206 which cuts right through Mansfield, New Jersey, there's a farmer's market.
It's the biggest shop in town. Everybody goes there. It's the only reason anybody comes to Mansfield.
Is to shop at this farmer's market.
But across the street from this farmer's market, there was a junkyard.
Not just any junkyard. It was an old military junkyard full of crashed World War II planes and trucks and tanks and such.
And it was owned by a man named John Mihaljec.
John Mihaljec had a lot to say.
He had so much to say.
Did I own Route 206?
Down the entire length of his property.
He had these huge billboards with pictures of political figures on them.
They had a picture at the time, it was the 1970s.
There was a picture of President Richard Nixon with the bleeding body of a dead rat.
And there were these long, long ramps that he would put up on these billboards on his property.
And the town hated him.
When he drove by, the ramps on the sides were so long and involved that the cars would have to slow down to five miles an hour just to read them.
Oh yeah, they hated him bad.
So what did John Mihaljec do?
He ran for Senator.
That pissed off all the people who hated him even more.
All the townspeople hated him.
One day they said, we're going to finally take care of this John Mihaljec.
And that was the problem.
So one night, some of the townspeople got together, in the best tradition of the angry villagers in Frankenstein movies.
They all got their torches together and they went down to his property and they burned his house to the ground.
Oh, they burned his house to the ground, but that's not all they did because his wife was in the house.
And they killed his wife.
They killed his wife and they burned down his house.
And they said, finally we're going to see the end of John Mihaljec because no man is going to be able to stand up after something like this.
John Mihaljec had other ideas.
John Mihaljec, in the smoking ashes of the ruins of his home, the smoking ashes of his now dead beloved wife,
built a giant teepee on that spot and let everybody know they were not going to run him off his land.
The townspeople hated him even more.
So one night, the townspeople, in the best tradition of the angry villagers in Frankenstein movies,
once again got together and they went out to John Mihaljec's land.
And they burned down his teepee.
This, they said, would run off John Mihaljec.
How much more could one man stand?
He would leave, he would kill himself, he would do something, but he would be out of their hair forever.
John Mihaljec had other ideas.
And so, on the smoking ruins of his teepee, built on the smoking ruins of his home and his dead beloved wife,
John Mihaljec built another teepee.
An identical teepee to the first, but with one small difference.
It was made of steel!
The villagers didn't know what to do about that.
They hated John Mihaljec.
They wanted to run John Mihaljec off his land.
But those stupid motherfuckers never could figure out how to burn down a steel teepee.
And John Mihaljec lived there until he died an old, old man.
Can I get a praise John Mihaljec?
Yes!
Can I get a praise John Mihaljec?
Yes!
Oh, brothers and sisters, John Mihaljec found the perfect solution to his problems.
Maybe you have problems too.
Maybe your problems could be solved by giving up or committing suicide.
Probably not.
Well, come to think of it, we probably solved all your problems.
But we're not the kind of a cult that's going to have a choice.
We're not the kind of a cult that's going to advocate suicide.
We are the first anti-suicide suicide cult.
One day we will all get together and after the point of time we will all drink Kool-Aid.
And nothing will happen. We'll just drink some Kool-Aid.
You don't lie until we say so.
Yes.
I'm sure you have problems too, but I don't think that many of your problems are going to be solved by a big tin teepee.
However, there is always a solution to your problems.
And only the perfect solution to your problems.
And brothers and sisters, Bob.
Bob will give you a blueprint.
A blueprint for your perfect teepee of vengeance.
That will help you get over your problems without having to take a hundred Tylenol.
Yeah. Tom Waits. Are you Tom Waits fans here?
Yeah.
I remember there was a song by Tom Waits where he said something about a woman.
She was a crumbling beauty with a tattooed tear on her cheek.
For each year her man was away.
And then Tom Waits said, hell, there's nothing wrong with her that a hundred dollars won't fix.
Well brothers and sisters, it's even better for all of you.
Because there's nothing wrong with her.
There's nothing wrong with you that thirty dollars won't fix.
Yes brothers and sisters, because that thirty dollars, when put in the hands of Bob, will help deliver unto you the blueprint for your own tin teepee.
That tin teepee will fill that tin teepee shaped hole in your life.
Oh yes brothers and sisters, you may not have very small problems.
You might have little tiny problems.
Oh yes, but Reverend Stang, he's here to help you with those problems.
Maybe that hole in your life is shaped like a little bobkin.
Maybe that hole in your life is shaped like a bumper sticker or a t-shirt.
And brothers and sisters, through Bob's love, Reverend Stang is here tonight to fill that t-shirt shaped hole in your lives, brothers and sisters.
Oh yes brothers and sisters.
Can I get a praise Bob?
We're filling CD shaped holes tonight.
Oh yes brothers and sisters.
And I saw a lot of you out there tonight who have CD shaped holes.

CD shaped holes in your lives that are just begging to be filled.
And Reverend Stang is here tonight to help Bob fill your holes.
Can I get a praise Bob?
Praise Bob!
Many of my victims have joined my unholy legion of the undead, becoming creatures without souls, living only for hideous torment.
And I think if we continue that way, to, you know, do what they said to do with poor Shia LaBeouf,
to eliminate unsigned beings, what will happen next?
Well, did you write to your Congressman about the pigs?
Of course I did. I did.
I said we would be liberated and he said, he sent back a hand mimeographed, a Xerox letter.
He sent back a hand signed letter, I mean, that said thank you very much Citizen Dave for your interest in the pork.
We're preparing a place for you in the re-education camps.
We have your room number and your keys waiting for you in your special hot tub.
And then I wrote a letter back saying,
the pork problem is probably the most,
problem we have to deal with in these days
of post 9-11 surgery.
Well, humanity is in danger of getting
thrown out of the cosmic
tent
party for crapping
in the universal hot tub.
Not sending in their 30 bucks.
Yeah. The United States
Navy is going to build these things
that create sounds
underwater around 80% of the surface
of the oceans, which will kill all the whales and
seals and porpoises, and nobody's going to stop
them because they're the U.S. Navy.
What do you mean, Ghana? Ghana.
It's a word we use. I thought they already
did that. They get the most amazing recordings
out of that. Yeah, the whales
squealing in agony as their eardrums
explode. Now that is a song.
By the time they're gone, we'll have
figured out their language.
Well, yeah, by the time
they utter their last pained cry
of, yeah.
Pained cry?
Oh, I'm sure they have vials
of whale sperm hidden away
somewhere.
Oh, yes. Long DNA, then short DNA.
Any kind of whale you want.
How about a Moby-Doby? We've got a blue one.
We've got the oversized white ones.
Those whale incubators, though, are really
big. Yeah. And whale, but
there's a booming business
in whale placenta.
Oh, and there's nothing better
with a little bit of almond extract.
Whale placenta?
Shaved almonds? You like to shave
your nuts for the whales? You can get quite a bit from each
birth. Oh, yeah?
From those mighty mammals
of the deep, yeah? So they're going to give
or they're making like little quants that's full
of whales. That's what rich people
in Japan are doing, man. All the
really, the rich Japanese people
look at this. They bathe in whale.
Beautiful people. Freshly
caught whale placenta.
It is so lovely for my skin. I just wave a little bit
of whale oil on my arms and look
as smooth as a baby's forehead.
And also look what it's done
for my hair. So it gets you away
from the poo-poo stuff.
And back into the menstrual
placental.
My favorite place.
The plasma pond of the beginning.
The primal mommy. The original
ooze from which it all sprang.
Friends, you and I, each and every
one of us with the chromosomes
dancing on the backs of our spines.
Like little egg yolks. Or like little egg yolks.
And can be no more than
individual fried eggs.
So live it up as long as you can.
Send your $30 before you're
completely cooked. Do it!
Now! Now! Do it before
your sex differentiates. While you're
still a yolk. Before the zygote
splinters. Some of us
may go in a different direction.
There are X chromosomes.
There are Y chromosomes.
There are now Z chromosomes.
Yes, that's
right. Have your genes outgrown
you? What about the
anti-chromosomes?
What about them?
What about them?
What about them?
What about them?
Shoop.
Shoop.
The many moods of an alien.
I descended from monochromes.
I ascended from polychromes.
I descended from
morochromes.
I am
all chromatic activity.
Repeat this to yourself.
Then sit down
and close your eyes,
ears, nose, and throat.
For this is your
good place.
What?
Insert transition here.
Yeah, right.
Well, I timed it.
I had the guy.
Yeah, I could tell that.
It was a 15-second segue.
Amazing timing.
I laughed so hard.
Sometimes I slow down when I read.
It really caught me was the timing.
It was a 15-second segue.
Stang was supposed to say something kind of laconically funny.
And then you were supposed to say something really silly.
I'm going to sit over here and eat my cupcake.
I'll do all that later.
Okay.
So you'll make it sound like you said something laconically silly.
Oh, right.
And then Chaz said something really silly.
And then, oh, no, that's not going to be it.
Oh, okay.
Yeah, whatever.
It doesn't matter.
No.
These people are idiots anyway.
I mean, you put a certain show form.
You sew it together like a piece of stew.
You know, I mean, you just flap a shoe in there.
You put some of your own, I don't want to say the other words, some of your own stuff in there.
You just, you know, you don't really care what goes in there because you have no respect.
For your subgenia who listen each week.
What in the world are you talking about?
Oh, I'm just saying the way Stang so haphazardly throws his hours of slack together.
First, he takes all the drugs you can take.
Heroin, monochrome, femur, that weird poison from South America.
Well, no, that's how you organize each show.
You do heroin.
As a theme.
And then you pick certain material for the heroin-based show.
And then you do a bunch of crack.
And you pick all the material that goes with that kind of a...
So you're just pretty much living the life, aren't you, man?
You're just like kind of out there.
You're just living the life.
You know, and so forth.
Down through...
You don't really care about your...
Nitrous oxide.
Prozones.
Long jeans and shirt.
That, uh...
See, I can't even remember what drugs this show was supposed to be.
Stang, you're losing your balance.
Tell me about it.
This is that cut.
That's 15 different Claudine Leger songs all played on top of each other.
Is there a pill to counteract all those pills?
This is a pill.
This is the red pill.
Oh, God.
I hate the red pill.
Oh...
Oh...

Oh...
Oh...
Oh...

Oh...
Oh...
Oh...
Oh...

We're all wired into a survival trip now.
No more of the speed that fueled the 60s.
That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip.
He crashed around America selling consciousness expansion
without ever giving a thought to the grim meat hook realities
that were lying in wait for all those people who took him seriously.
All those pathetically eager acid freaks
who thought they could buy peace and understanding for three bucks a hit.
But their loss and failure is ours too.
What Leary took down with him was the central illusion
of a whole lifestyle that he helped create.
A generation of permanent cripples, failed seekers
who never understood the importance of life.
The essential old mystic fallacy of the acid culture.
The desperate assumption that somebody, or at least some force,
is tending the light at the end of the tunnel.
It was possible for the dark to smash out the stageigkeit
and sixes around the anger field.
Through the jurors and specialists engaged at first glance

Thank you.
Hello.
This is Marlowe.
Why didn't you telephone?
I didn't have a nickel.
Oh. What did you find at the lake?
I found a little girl.

Shut up and get me my number.

Who's being cute now?
You are.
What?
Did you ever try to pull anybody out of the telephone booth?
Yeah. Muriel Chester and San Bernardino.
What's this Crystal Kingsman?
Coming to that.
Oh. What man?
The guy I didn't know his name.
Oh.
Where do you usually spend Christmas Eve?
To the gas station.
On the south road.
Oh. Where do you?
Little Fawn Lake.
It's a place in the mountains beyond Arrowhead.
Oh brother.
Here we are.
How did I get here?
Thirty days in the water.
Luckily a sailor came along.
What's the matter?
There isn't much left of her.
Shut up.
This is Marlowe.
And you are?
I'm here to see who the cougar is,

and before that the Broken Circle Gospel

Do you think it's alright to
ring our land in a ring of iron?
I'm trying to wind it up here.

They're exaggerating the
harmfulness of uranium.
It's all been spent.
You just squirt it out of your tube of yours.
I like any common ejaculating orangutan.
It's the only squirt thing, only it's plutonium and it's spent.
Talk about that.
I can see why they call him Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
Don't get too close.
Not Popular Cowboy Dave.
Now that was it.
Now I remember Popular Cowboy Dave.
Yes, I do.
He was tall.
Tall.
He was rich and intelligent.
Christ-like.
Christ-like.
Popular Cowboy Dave was.
But, well, we're going to have to have Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
That's a good name.
Popular Christ-like Dave.
Popular Christ-like Stang.
And Popular Christ-like Chaz.
And, of course, Popular Christ-like Wee, even though she's a female.
Well, there was.
There was Popular Bull Girl Davina.
Oh, Popular Bull Girl Davina?
Yeah.
Was she Christ-like in her appearance?
No, no.
No, no.
No, she was just popular.
No shining.
Like a lonely traveler in the night.
Yeah.
Well, okay.
You know, that's what happens to some of them when they can't find that spot.
You know, when they can't reach down there far enough.
That's me, man.
Yeah, me too.
We keep on looking for the itchy, slingy, ooze, squirt mechanism, and it doesn't ever shine.
I'm flying for a lot of weeks.
Speak for yourself, Dave.
I am speaking for myself.
All right, then.
Fauxvine boy, Dave.
Hey, look.
You say Yaka Teasma.
And you're just deluding yourself.
And I say Yaka Teasma.
We're all lonesome, lonely stars in the night.
Lonely lights in the night.
We come in alone, and you go out alone.
Ships passing in the night, baby.
That's right.
You're burning your hair off in the middle.
That's the bottom line.
You come in alone.
You go out alone.
That's why you should spend the night with me, baby.
You urge, you squirt, and sometimes...
To make this loneliness end for just a little while, just you, me, and Bob.
Come on.
What do you say?
Come on, be Christ-like, just for a moment.
But you haven't seen the other cages.
Don't worry, Boris.
We'll get to all of the cages eventually.
But first, you must climb into, and then escape, the cage of B-B-B-Bob!

For you must heed my word!
They pay no heed to us.
You notice that?
They have their world, and we have ours.
You must believe in me for me to exist.
But those who have chosen to deny my existence have sometimes found me a most deadly enemy.

Do they mean anything to you in any way?
They stand on their own two feet and force me toq...
