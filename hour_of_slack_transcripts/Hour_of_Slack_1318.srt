1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,040
Now, ladies and gentlemen, soon you're going to hear the voice of Ivan Stang himself, the sacred scribe.

2
00:00:07,060 --> 00:00:14,020
We also have Papa Joe Mama, an extraordinary ranter and theologist,

3
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:19,300
who has helped us refine our doctrine down to the purity of bedrock,

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:24,560
and acts as a check upon the wild and fanciful flights of the rest of us.

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,820
And it's possible that we may entice Priestess Pisces to the podium.

6
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:37,200
And, in fact, there could be an agreeable smorgasbord in all ways.

7
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:42,820
Once we get going, which is imminent, we are making the final technical adjustments.

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,600
All systems are go.

9
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,700
We are prepared for launch and are holding.

10
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,340
Our announced time to PM is theoretical,

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,420
but we will hew to it.

12
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,420
As closely as possible.

13
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,900
He gave me his phone number and we said goodbye.

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,680
It was two months later that old Bob died.

15
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,400
Needle in his arm.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:07,280
In some hotel room.

17
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,020
With a needle in his arm.

18
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,360
My name's Bobby.

19
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,900
He said I'm Bobby too.

20
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:14,780
My name's Bobby.

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:15,960
He said I'm...

22
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,380
Self-genius.

23
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:19,300
Our own self.

24
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,380
We are Bob Dobs!

25
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,380


26
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,460
They are Bob Dobs!

27
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:34,720
We're still preparing for the main sequence of our broadcast,

28
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,600
and now it is my privilege to introduce to this stream

29
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:42,180
the redoubtable Papa Joe Mama,

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:44,580
deacon of the Church of the Subgenius.

31
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,300
Could you pot up Papa Joe, please, on the far microphone? Thank you.

32
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,500
We have to be plugged into the matrix here.

33
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:55,040
We have to turn the magic switch.

34
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,960
Now I'm feeling potted.

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,000
Actually, that started the moment I got close to the campgrounds.

36
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,260
The...

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,440
The air.

38
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,500
The camp air.

39
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,280
And speaking of air,

40
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,360
the idea is that this will be live via tape.

41
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,140
Is that the idea?

42
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,860
Oh, it's as live as can be.

43
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,980
It's as live as a wriggling snake.

44
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:20,000
Oh, live versus via tape worm.

45
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,140
Yeah, exactly.

46
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:21,940
And...

47
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,160
It gets into your gut.

48
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,480
Not only that, but... It gets into your gut.

49
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:23,480


50
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,140
Not only that, but it will be resurrected and live again.

51
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,480
And again and again and again.

52
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:34,520
You know, a tape worm is one of the unique animals in the animal kingdom, Dr. Howell,

53
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,880
because you can slice it and dice it into a million pieces,

54
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:40,360
and it just keeps growing and growing,

55
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:42,040
much like the word of Bob.

56
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:47,720
You can break it up, sever it, chop off its head, cut off its tail,

57
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:50,600
and it just resurrects and grows even more.

58
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,980
It's like the sorcerer's apprentice.

59
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:56,740
Yes, it will grow an extra head if you tease it properly.

60
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,200
But what it will never be is an amphisbema,

61
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,640
a being with a head at each end.

62
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,580
One end must always be anterior.

63
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,400
And we of the Church of the Subgenius,

64
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,200
whether or not we be a parasitic organism in the bowels of the conspiracy,

65
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:19,500
must move ahead or face choking ourselves in the labyrinth of our own coils.

66
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,640
Indeed, the subgenius motto is,

67
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:21,960
Indeed, the subgenius motto is,

68
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,020
You never get enough head.

69
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:31,020
And you know, lately we've been studying parasites and microbiology in the Church of the Subgenius.

70
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:37,260
Soon Ivan Stang will be able to pronounce on the water sample he took yesterday from the swimming pond,

71
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:41,500
and tell us what jointed horrors are swimming in it now.

72
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:47,000
Some microscopic, some terrestrial, and some from origins unknown.

73
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,740
Well, that's all relative, you know, a matter of size,

74
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:53,920
but sometimes the little guys can sting you the most.

75
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,720
There's all sorts of different orifices that climb into that pool,

76
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,960
and what they emit is almost as scary as what enters those orifices.

77
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,180
But there's somebody there.

78
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,140
And the orifices enter other orifices,

79
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,940
and then there's orifices that enter other orifices,

80
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:15,820
and then slot A, tab B, and I think that makes sex hurt.

81
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,480
Other combinations make sex hurt.

82
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,720
Slot B, tab B.

83
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,720
Instead of slot A, tab B.

84
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,680
And then there's tab B, tab C, and slot A.

85
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:27,880
Slot A.

86
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,740
But the little critters in the puddle are so finely organized

87
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:38,740
that there are special delegations of them organized to take advantage even of the mistakes.

88
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,860
But you know, I think the pond organisms will find that the yeti chemistry,

89
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:48,220
the body chemistry and the makeup of mutants,

90
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:54,560
may not work exactly with their body chemistries as nature intended.

91
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,980
Producing gigantic mutants,

92
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:59,080
huge diving beetles,

93
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,280
blood-sucking sand fleas.

94
00:05:01,460 --> 00:05:02,900
But it's not always about reproduction.

95
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,040
Sometimes it's just the act of reproduction.

96
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,080
If there's one thing that there's never a shortage of at these events,

97
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,580
it's lots of yeti and lots of their cohabitating slots.

98
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:17,220
Of course, the yeti lives in happy harmony with nature,

99
00:05:17,390 --> 00:05:23,130
and acknowledges the many fellow travelers which abide in his shaggy pelt.

100
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:29,270
And even we, the etiolated descendants of the yet and sin,

101
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,510
have special organisms that live in the eyelash

102
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:36,270
as different from the other arthropods that live in the eyebrow,

103
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:38,370
and so forth and so on.

104
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:41,810
Your body requires this maintenance staff.

105
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,930
But the mighty yeti had a whole army of critters

106
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,930
scampering through his fur.

107
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,390
And please be kind to your maintenance staff

108
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,390
and these anima-cules, as they've been known.

109
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:58,810
Yeah, you don't want to singe them with chemicals and all this crap that conspiracy gives you.

110
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,990
All they want to do is get their groove on,

111
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,530
have a little anima-cule sex hurt.

112
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,570
Don't stop them.

113
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,190
That would be so cruel.

114
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,550
Be kind.

115
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,190
Let these organisms reproduce.

116
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:15,890
Provide your sex.

117
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,350
Your ancestors may be one of them.

118
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:24,150
As the lusty, cheap motel for microorganisms

119
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:29,430
to have their exciting, though momentary, trysts.

120
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,590
You wouldn't be able to have a normal bowel movement

121
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:36,190
without your large group of intestinal flora,

122
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:38,990
who are always on the job, helping you out.

123
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:43,150
And if you ever disturb their world of equilibrium,

124
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,910
you can eat yogurt and things like that.

125
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,250
And help them out.

126
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:51,230
But what one should not do is be at an antagonistic remove

127
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:54,230
from one's churning insides.

128
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:56,810
From any part of the body.

129
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,170
We must work in sync with it

130
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:02,230
so that we are better able to achieve our goal.

131
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:04,890
When it comes down to the battlefield

132
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:07,490
and the war against the conspiracy.

133
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:12,150
In a similar manner, such is the subgenius to the conspiracy.

134
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,990
They think of us as parasites,

135
00:07:14,130 --> 00:07:15,890
but what they don't realize is that we are not.

136
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:18,730
We are the salvation of their existence.

137
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,870
Without us, the conspiracy cannot survive.

138
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,210
But we, fellow subgeni,

139
00:07:24,290 --> 00:07:26,750
we can survive without the conspiracy.

140
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,870
And that is what we are about to discover.

141
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:31,210
And just to load these three days away.

142
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,170
Papa, Joe, Mama, as usual, you'll get right to the point.

143
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,210
I was taking too long to make it.

144
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:40,130
Which is that we are not the parasite on the conspiracy.

145
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,850
The conspiracy is the parasite on us.

146
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:45,870
Though vastly larger and bloated,

147
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:47,970
mostly with our juices,

148
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,630
all their ideas come from us.

149
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,250
And for good or ill,

150
00:07:53,410 --> 00:07:56,510
we direct them on their reproductive,

151
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,890
mimicry-dominated pattern.

152
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:03,550
We're sort of the intellectual energy

153
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:06,270
which they sap their battery packs from,

154
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,330
much in the same way that the Matrix might live off of humans.

155
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,890
We are, in essence, the intellectual firepower

156
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:15,630
of all humanity.

157
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,010
If not civilization in general.

158
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,130
Not to take too much on ourselves,

159
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,670
but the stimulus which creates the tropism.

160
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,450
And keep in mind,

161
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,990
it's not unlike, if you remember the concept of that

162
00:08:29,630 --> 00:08:31,410
sort of ectoplasm.

163
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:34,050
How the ectoplasm gets its,

164
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:39,230
going back to a good, great subgenius movie, Ghostbusters.

165
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,890
And the ectoplasm sort of absorbs the energy that's put out.

166
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:47,910
The conspiracy is also that ectoplasm.

167
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:49,990
And they can pick up our energy.

168
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:52,270
So it is a possibility to,

169
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,110
I don't want to say use this for good per se,

170
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,570
because we're not about good or evil or such,

171
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:00,450
you know, binary terms as that.

172
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:04,030
But it is possible that you can take your yeti energy

173
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:07,410
and take, and sort of push it into,

174
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,750
and let that conspiracy ectoplasm absorb it.

175
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,510
And what's great about that is then,

176
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:14,870
one of the greatest things about it,

177
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,170
one of the great examples that I've always heard,

178
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:18,050
is that yeti sex hurt, for example,

179
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:21,950
can often spawn future yetis.

180
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:25,890
For example, if you and your yeti mate are getting it on,

181
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,650
and your neighbors upstairs are at the same time,

182
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:35,670
that yeti energy actually goes into the fetus of your neighbor.

183
00:09:35,970 --> 00:09:41,290
These completely, utterly pink conspiracy slaves

184
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,030
will then give birth

185
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,810
to a mutant yeti.

186
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:48,230
But that wouldn't be parasitism,

187
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,870
that would be synchronicity,

188
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,690
an organic, orgasmic vortex,

189
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:56,890
in which nobody suffers and all benefit.

190
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,670
It would be symbiosis, right?

191
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,470
Yes, symbiosis, that's what I was thinking of.

192
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,270
And yet they always try to make you feel guilty

193
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,630
for inspiring this act of creation.

194
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:09,270
They might take their broomstick and hammer it on the top of their ceiling

195
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:11,470
and complain that you're disturbing them.

196
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,930
Such mindless primitives.

197
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:14,650
And yet if we hadn't made that noise,

198
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,070
they never would have even been inspired to have sex in the first place.

199
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:19,410
They would not even be alert,

200
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:25,290
but snoozing and dozing on in their own blocked-off, mind-forged manacles.

201
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:28,070
Once again, they try to make you feel bad for what you are.

202
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,370
They say that your ectoplasm is nothing more than snot

203
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:33,250
that they blow out of their third nostril,

204
00:10:33,310 --> 00:10:34,570
and yet it is...

205
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,410
You can't survive without mucus.

206
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,890
You need that ectoplasm.

207
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:39,350
It's a spiritual ectoplasm.

208
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:42,050
It's more than just some sort of bodily fluid.

209
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:44,970
So they may think of it as something that's just

210
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:47,550
not even worthy of picking from their nostrils

211
00:10:47,550 --> 00:10:51,230
and smearing underneath the underbelly of the dining room table,

212
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,270
but it is an essential ingredient to their survival.

213
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:57,930
This whole thing of the reprimand which they give,

214
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:03,350
which seems so hurtful to us, the sensitive individuals,

215
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:06,070
means very little to them in truth,

216
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:08,070
and it's actually just a trick, a device,

217
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:11,170
to give them time to catch up with us,

218
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:14,870
because they don't think as fast as we do,

219
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:16,430
and they want some breathing room,

220
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,790
and so they try to make you feel guilty.

221
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:22,610
And while you stammer, blush, stumble, and flush,

222
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:25,590
they can come to the next slow plan

223
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:29,470
of how they can trick you out of your last simoleon.

224
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,410
And the problem you have is that they are so limited.

225
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:36,510
They can't see beyond that which is just in front of them.

226
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,390
And you, in your very existence,

227
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,290
are inserting this X, this unknown variable,

228
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:47,030
and they don't know how to do the math.

229
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:52,190
Their brains just can't handle another variable

230
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:54,090
into the equation of their lives.

231
00:11:54,370 --> 00:11:55,870
But they might be able to.

232
00:11:55,970 --> 00:11:57,950
They might be teachable, do you think?

233
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:00,890
Well, unfortunately, yes, but they'll take something like math,

234
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,250
the pure science that does not discriminate,

235
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,010
and they turn it into a tool of discrimination

236
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:08,850
by using something like the law of averages.

237
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:11,590
We know just from our mathematical studies

238
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:14,210
that for every conspiracy dupe,

239
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:16,810
there's only one one-thousandth of a subgenius.

240
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,910
So in essence, there's a thousand pings

241
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:20,490
for every subgenius that's out there.

242
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:22,210
So they'll turn that around on its head,

243
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:24,310
and they'll say, well, there's more of us

244
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:25,890
than there's more of you.

245
00:12:26,090 --> 00:12:28,690
Therefore, you are the abnormal one.

246
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,270
You are the aborition.

247
00:12:30,470 --> 00:12:32,690
You are the mutant.

248
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:34,510
Well, it's true that we are the mutant,

249
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,390
but is that a bad thing? No.

250
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,350
Just as to humanity,

251
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:39,990
the Neanderthals were unique

252
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:42,690
when it first dawned on this planet

253
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,850
amongst the fields of Neanderthals.

254
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,570
They turned and said,

255
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,850
look at the ones with the extended foreheads.

256
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,110
They are ugly.

257
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:51,230
They are stupid.

258
00:12:51,430 --> 00:12:53,870
They cannot even throw a spear as far as we can.

259
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,070
And they made them feel abnormal.

260
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,390
And yet, where are they now?

261
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:00,330
I have to...

262
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:01,070
They're still here.

263
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:05,030
The Neanderthals are actually still here.

264
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,370
They are folded into our own genetic...

265
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:08,610
...genetic...

266
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,850
...structure. It's interesting.

267
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,130
The only true humans left on the planet

268
00:13:13,130 --> 00:13:14,230
are Africans.

269
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,710
Black Africans.

270
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,330
Every other type of race,

271
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,130
so-called, on the planet's surface

272
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,730
migrated out of Africa

273
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:24,550
and encountered other forms of hominids.

274
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:26,930
Those who were sexually incompatible

275
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:27,930
bred mules,

276
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,690
offspring which were sterile themselves.

277
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,930
But the Neanderthals,

278
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:34,350
from whom we get fair skin,

279
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,290
blue eyes,

280
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:38,830
light, easily sunburned,

281
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:39,910
skin, and so forth,

282
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:42,670
intermarried with

283
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:44,890
the dear Africans and produced

284
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,910
the contemporary races.

285
00:13:47,050 --> 00:13:48,470
First, the races which

286
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,510
developed into Asia, and then

287
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,730
finally, the races that

288
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,250
inhabited Europe.

289
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,750
This brings up an interesting point, though.

290
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,790
That would sort of

291
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,610
lead me to make a logical jump

292
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,030
to assume that not only

293
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:04,150
are

294
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:05,930
every peak

295
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,830
has a small portion of us,

296
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:10,270
but

297
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,730
we have a small

298
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:14,170
portion of pink.

299
00:14:14,410 --> 00:14:16,670
Yes, and our lives have a small portion

300
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,550
of death. It's important

301
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:20,790
to keep a little bit

302
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,250
of the opposite matter

303
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:24,670
incubating, just to be on

304
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:26,590
the right track. There's really no way to

305
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:28,650
remove the pinkness, but there is a way

306
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,830
to replace the pinkness. And the idea

307
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:32,030
is to simply

308
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:34,590
push it out with new DNA

309
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,150
from a new life force.

310
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:38,670
That life force of which we're hoping to

311
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:40,310
encounter in just a mere three days.

312
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:42,890
So, new genetic

313
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,830
material is on its way from a distant

314
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,290
star system, but

315
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,750
we'll want to still encapsulate

316
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,790
some of those pink genes and put them

317
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,690
in deep seed storage, much

318
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,710
like some of the seed stores

319
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,710
in Antarctica, just for

320
00:14:56,710 --> 00:14:58,610
museum purposes. Well, and the

321
00:14:58,610 --> 00:15:00,670
thing that bothers me about that thought is

322
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:02,750
that, you know, as

323
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,530
much as we look forward to

324
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:06,710
the saucers coming, and as

325
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:08,750
much as we look forward to the sex goddesses and

326
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,350
the eternal bliss that's guaranteed,

327
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:12,410
I worry because

328
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:14,070
how does one know slack

329
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,670
without knowing not slack?

330
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,770
What will happen to us

331
00:15:18,770 --> 00:15:19,830
when we forget

332
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,570
what not slack

333
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:24,790
is? Sister Pisces, you

334
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,810
bring up a very controversial but important

335
00:15:26,810 --> 00:15:29,050
part of the whole Holocaustal

336
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,290
theology, which is the necessary

337
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:32,350
perhaps the

338
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,710
setting aside of

339
00:15:34,710 --> 00:15:36,770
pink reservations for the future. Should

340
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:38,490
we save not just some of the genetic... We could call them

341
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:39,810
camps. Yes.

342
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,690
So people can concentrate on those

343
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:44,730
pinks. Concentration camps for

344
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:46,330
the pinks. Yes, right. They could be concentrated

345
00:15:46,330 --> 00:15:48,610
into these camps. Now, at the

346
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:50,650
present time, here we are in a camp,

347
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:52,730
but after our revolution,

348
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,730
they will be in the camps

349
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,610
like this while we inhabit

350
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,430
the catbird seat.

351
00:15:59,090 --> 00:16:00,790
When we put up the

352
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,470
barbed wire fences and

353
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,790
electrified fences, it will be... It's really

354
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,770
to keep us out from messing with

355
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:08,810
them and their poor, feeble

356
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:10,610
nature. It is for their own safety,

357
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:12,670
I would imagine. I mean, once everything

358
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,810
comes into place and we have the alien technology

359
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:16,890
to make us reach our fullest potential,

360
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,910
it's... We would...

361
00:16:18,910 --> 00:16:20,750
I mean, the decimation

362
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,470
that we could rack upon...

363
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,690
I'm not saying they're

364
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:26,170
innocent. Please don't

365
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:28,870
think that. They are innocent of some things.

366
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:29,850
We should pity them.

367
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,730
It's that little gene of pinkness that you're

368
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:34,730
talking about that is responsible for

369
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:36,590
those less desirable

370
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:37,950
traits and subgeniousness.

371
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,370
The feelings of wanting revenge,

372
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,410
the feelings of contempt for them, that is

373
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:44,370
the pinkness of coming through. So,

374
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:46,810
again, the electrified fences and the barbed wire

375
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,570
fences, right now it's to protect

376
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:50,370
them from us going out and

377
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:52,490
ravaging them, but when they're inside

378
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,650
the camps, it will be to protect them from

379
00:16:54,650 --> 00:16:56,910
us coming back. Absolutely. Because we're going to outnumber

380
00:16:56,910 --> 00:16:58,470
them. The guard towers

381
00:16:58,470 --> 00:17:00,450
with the machine gun carrying

382
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:02,190
guards... Protection. They're

383
00:17:02,190 --> 00:17:04,650
psychological protection for them. They

384
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,590
have to believe that it's not their

385
00:17:06,590 --> 00:17:08,390
choice to be inside

386
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:10,690
these compounds because their

387
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:12,470
egos wouldn't stand

388
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,750
the knowledge of the real truth.

389
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,690
And keep in mind, we will have to

390
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,790
train very special, very

391
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,630
hardy subgeniuses

392
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,910
to manage these.

393
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:24,710
A special staff. A special staff.

394
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:26,750
Maybe we could give them their own uniforms

395
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:28,490
or something like that. It needs to be...

396
00:17:28,490 --> 00:17:30,810
I honestly believe that it will have

397
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:32,710
to be some sort of

398
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:33,510
rare...

399
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:36,670
A true holocaustal would

400
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:38,390
have to manage that system.

401
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:40,050
All these scare tactics,

402
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:42,670
these rumors that people have been passing around

403
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:43,630
about... Deplorable.

404
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:46,590
There's going to be millions that are going to be killed

405
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:48,690
as they try to escape. They don't understand the

406
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:50,770
economy of fear.

407
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,790
The fact of the matter is, is that after

408
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:54,850
your first attempted escape,

409
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:56,630
say six

410
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,770
people, maybe twelve people gunned down,

411
00:17:58,890 --> 00:18:00,790
no one else is going to attempt after that.

412
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:02,490
I mean, you only need to demonstrate

413
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:04,790
once. This is a concept that we

414
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,070
learned from training elephants.

415
00:18:06,470 --> 00:18:08,230
Well, now you're talking about directing traffic.

416
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:10,910
I mean, we can take care of that after the...

417
00:18:10,910 --> 00:18:12,730
You put the chain on there only for the first

418
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,710
time until they hurt their ankle, and then

419
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,750
after that you just have a little rope and eventually

420
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,090
you can replace it with a thread.

421
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,550
But sadly, even today

422
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:22,550
we have to ask ourselves, how has that

423
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:24,570
been twisted and used on us?

424
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:26,530
How have we been held

425
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,430
at bay with these psychological

426
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:30,850
threads that are chains

427
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,630
in our own minds? They represent no

428
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,570
real physical boundaries

429
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:35,910
and yet they hold us back.

430
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:38,370
That's your elephant. This is a really big

431
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,690
concern that has been, you know,

432
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,870
and especially, and I know there are

433
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:44,150
some uberfems in the audience,

434
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:46,790
uberfems are subjected by the

435
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,570
conspiracies to some really,

436
00:18:48,630 --> 00:18:50,310
really horrible programming

437
00:18:50,850 --> 00:18:52,830
that is sort of deep-seated in

438
00:18:52,830 --> 00:18:54,710
us that we have to fight on a daily basis.

439
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,730
I mean, the conspir...

440
00:18:56,730 --> 00:18:58,450
It's the same thing with the fear tactics.

441
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:00,810
As uberfems, we are told we

442
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:01,650
are too fat,

443
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,730
we are ugly, we should

444
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,610
shut up, we should sit down.

445
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:08,390
Carping cause of jealousy.

446
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,430
And what that does is

447
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,070
we...

448
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,750
There are beautiful women here, and the truth

449
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,870
of the matter is you won't see as many

450
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,490
titties as there should be.

451
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:20,750
Because they have that conspiracy

452
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,610
programming in their head that says that

453
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:24,330
they are ugly, they are worthless,

454
00:19:24,610 --> 00:19:26,050
they have been treated this way.

455
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,270
They should be ashamed.

456
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:30,670
Exactly. That you should be ashamed

457
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:32,850
of how you are, you should be ashamed of

458
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:34,810
your wonderful mutant beauty.

459
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:36,890
And that

460
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,830
goes back to what you discussed with the

461
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,830
fear tactics. It's being used

462
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:42,630
on us, but we can learn from that.

463
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:44,810
And we can adapt that, and we can not

464
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:46,550
only break our own programming

465
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:48,830
that has been embedded in

466
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:50,770
us by the media, by our

467
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:52,150
parents, by the conspiracy,

468
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:54,770
by television, by radio, by

469
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,090
the stores everywhere.

470
00:19:56,530 --> 00:19:58,450
Will you dare to wear your underwear

471
00:19:58,450 --> 00:20:00,110
on the outside of your clothing?

472
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:02,590
If not, why not? Because someone

473
00:20:02,590 --> 00:20:04,330
tells you that it has to be on the inside?

474
00:20:04,430 --> 00:20:06,550
It's more comfortable on the outside, especially

475
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:08,410
after you've soiled it. You don't want to be that

476
00:20:08,850 --> 00:20:09,910
trash. But no,

477
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:12,910
we continue to follow what they tell us to do.

478
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:13,790
This is outrageous.

479
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,230
But remember, they are not

480
00:20:16,850 --> 00:20:19,050
always only in an official guise.

481
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:20,670
Your peers can

482
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:22,570
be silent simps and

483
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:24,310
fellow travelers of the conspiracy.

484
00:20:24,690 --> 00:20:26,390
They will enforce

485
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:28,450
these meaningless memes

486
00:20:28,450 --> 00:20:30,650
upon you if you don't

487
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,790
examine each and every one of them.

488
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,610
Now I know this could cause a

489
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,150
skull-buster of a headache,

490
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:38,770
but it's worth to fall into the habit

491
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,370
and ultimately more

492
00:20:40,370 --> 00:20:42,210
easeful in the long run.

493
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:43,810
More producing of slack.

494
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:46,850
Conventional wisdom, the dirtiest

495
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,650
conspiracy word ever

496
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:49,370
developed.

497
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:52,390
Because if wisdom is anything, it's not

498
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,970
conventional. No, no.

499
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:56,590
And if common sense is anything, it's not

500
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,610
common. Also, there's quite

501
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:00,370
a difference between wisdom

502
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,590
and intelligence. They are

503
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:04,590
not the same thing. Being

504
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,810
smart is being able to figure things out

505
00:21:06,810 --> 00:21:08,630
and take care of yourself. Wisdom

506
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:10,470
is simply to be able to

507
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,430
incorporate extra-somatic

508
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:13,730
knowledge and remember it.

509
00:21:14,770 --> 00:21:16,090
Knowledge by writ

510
00:21:16,850 --> 00:21:18,510
instead of knowledge by intellect.

511
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:20,310
Repetitio est mater

512
00:21:20,850 --> 00:21:22,570
studiorum. And this is another thing the conspiracy

513
00:21:22,570 --> 00:21:24,130
is so good at doing.

514
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:26,570
I mean, we, we, they are

515
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,630
good at having us wrote,

516
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:30,770
memorize. We get

517
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:32,810
taught again and again and again

518
00:21:32,810 --> 00:21:34,570
reinforcement, reinforcement,

519
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,530
reinforcement of these

520
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:37,650
horrible ideas.

521
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:40,770
That we are then stuck.

522
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,610
They're programmed in our brain before

523
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,570
we even know it.

524
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,750
But fortunately, we being subgeniuses can

525
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:48,150
invert them,

526
00:21:48,910 --> 00:21:50,650
speckle them, turn them inside

527
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:52,130
out and otherwise

528
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,590
arrange them for our own

529
00:21:54,590 --> 00:21:56,910
convenience and pleasure. We don't

530
00:21:56,910 --> 00:21:58,630
just accept what they

531
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:00,690
spoon out, but we spice

532
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,710
and season it according to our own

533
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:04,670
dictates. Perhaps the most

534
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,610
insidious thing that the conspiracy ever

535
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:08,810
developed was the ability to erase our

536
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,850
racial memory. There was at one

537
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:12,650
time when we were born with the ability

538
00:22:12,650 --> 00:22:14,190
of language and

539
00:22:14,850 --> 00:22:16,990
all the experiences of our forebears.

540
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:18,950
But they realized that if we continued

541
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,570
this trait, we would know that

542
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,590
we were better than them.

543
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:24,650
This is true. So they had to erase

544
00:22:24,650 --> 00:22:26,650
all the history that we might otherwise

545
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,610
know. And we are born now, but

546
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,770
essentially without any instinct other than the

547
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,910
bear instinct of that to suckle.

548
00:22:32,930 --> 00:22:34,750
And thank God for that. Well, without any

549
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:36,730
conscious instinct, but as

550
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:38,290
Plato proved,

551
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:40,590
actually we already know

552
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:42,850
all that stuff. We just need it to be

553
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:44,250
teased out of us.

554
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,630
Get that little slave boy the proper

555
00:22:46,630 --> 00:22:48,430
pencil and a little bit of guidance.

556
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:50,650
There's no telling what he may innately

557
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,570
know. He may be an

558
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,970
astronomer equal to Aristarchus

559
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:56,630
and a philosopher equal to

560
00:22:56,630 --> 00:22:58,790
Heraclitus. And this he can

561
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:01,010
demonstrate to the Athenian Solons.

562
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:02,990
Then he can go back and clean the toilets.

563
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,810
But why is it that the animals have

564
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,610
more instinct than us? I mean, they're supposed

565
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:08,750
to be lesser beings. Because they don't have

566
00:23:08,850 --> 00:23:09,430
the conscious

567
00:23:10,470 --> 00:23:12,670
governor, the system

568
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,590
which sits on top of the limbic

569
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:16,790
system which only yet in sin

570
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:17,810
and humans have.

571
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:20,690
That and the fact that there

572
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,650
are not animals telling other

573
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:24,710
animals that they're wrong. And yet

574
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,750
it only takes one generation often to

575
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:28,610
forget some of those

576
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:30,850
instincts. You take the simple rabbit, for example.

577
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:32,150
Take that rabbit,

578
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,610
take it out of the wild, put it in a cage,

579
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,010
breed one generation,

580
00:23:36,370 --> 00:23:38,830
and that new generation loses the ability

581
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:40,430
to burrow. And thus,

582
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:42,830
the ability to survive in the wild. They've been

583
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,450
domesticated. Dear friends,

584
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:46,690
this is the essential problem of the

585
00:23:46,690 --> 00:23:48,430
subgenus. We've allowed ourselves

586
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:50,750
to become domesticated.

587
00:23:51,750 --> 00:23:52,710
Not only

588
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,490
domesticated, but completely

589
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,450
inculcated with false

590
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,710
principles. Like false

591
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,510
slack. This is why coming to

592
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:02,630
a camp like this is so essential

593
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,810
to our salvation. We are going back

594
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,530
to the pre-civilization, the

595
00:24:06,530 --> 00:24:08,030
pre-domestication days.

596
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,890
We were all born with original slack.

597
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,070
But the conspiracy

598
00:24:12,850 --> 00:24:14,370
wants to suck that away

599
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,770
from us, to use it for its own purposes,

600
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:18,450
and then to sell us

601
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,750
false slack, which

602
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,210
it manufactures.

603
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:24,610
And to pay for the

604
00:24:24,610 --> 00:24:26,530
false slack, to spend

605
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:28,730
endless hours of meaningless toil,

606
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:29,910
only to buy

607
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:31,970
meaningless tchotchkes.

608
00:24:32,150 --> 00:24:34,630
But every iPod or

609
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:36,630
iPad or whatever that you're jonesing

610
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,670
for that you think is going to

611
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:40,570
be the thing which completes

612
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:42,430
you and will make you happy thereafter

613
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:44,510
turns out simply to be

614
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:46,310
an ignis facius.

615
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,950
A mirage.

616
00:24:48,130 --> 00:24:50,630
Because the moment you get it, you want

617
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,770
the next thing and you forget that other

618
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,590
thing. And you were never truly happy

619
00:24:54,590 --> 00:24:56,810
because your attention is not

620
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:57,890
where it belongs.

621
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:00,450
They should be wanting your stuff.

622
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:02,610
You shouldn't be wanting their stuff.

623
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:04,770
And they do want your stuff.

624
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:06,610
But they just don't let you

625
00:25:06,610 --> 00:25:07,710
know about it.

626
00:25:08,850 --> 00:25:10,110
They turn you into servants.

627
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,670
Servitude. They want you to

628
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:14,790
work for them all your

629
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:16,790
lives. They want you to punch a time

630
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,670
clock. And now they want to look at your

631
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:20,710
pee. They want to look at your body

632
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:22,790
fluids. They want to control what

633
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,430
you do when you're off site.

634
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,470
They want a complete

635
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,070
lattice of control.

636
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:30,590
Perhaps another one of the

637
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:32,510
conspiracies most, greatest

638
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,670
accomplishments in rewriting history was

639
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,570
the so called emancipation

640
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,410
proclamation where they quote,

641
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:40,590
did away with slavery.

642
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:41,470
Unquote.

643
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:44,370
Well anybody in their right mind knows that the only

644
00:25:44,370 --> 00:25:46,750
difference between old time slavery and

645
00:25:46,750 --> 00:25:48,730
present day slavery is that

646
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:50,930
present day slavery is timeshare

647
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:52,750
slavery. And you know back

648
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,630
in the old days, the old form of slavery

649
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:56,690
was actually more expensive. You had to

650
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:58,810
pay for that slave. You had to provide

651
00:25:58,810 --> 00:26:00,870
that slave healthcare. You had to provide

652
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:02,870
that slave food. You had to provide

653
00:26:02,870 --> 00:26:05,010
that slave clothing. And yet

654
00:26:05,010 --> 00:26:06,270
what do they have now?

655
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:08,330
Slaves who go and work for them at least

656
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,030
eight hours a day, often times more.

657
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,090
And those slaves buy their own

658
00:26:12,090 --> 00:26:14,050
food. They buy their own

659
00:26:14,050 --> 00:26:16,310
clothing. And they even have to pay for

660
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:18,170
their own healthcare. This is

661
00:26:18,170 --> 00:26:20,170
outrageous. And the

662
00:26:20,170 --> 00:26:21,950
moment that you're no longer an efficient

663
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,810
slave, and you're no longer

664
00:26:23,810 --> 00:26:26,030
capable of producing

665
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,190
the necessary quotas,

666
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,250
then you're let go.

667
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,350
And replaced with a new

668
00:26:32,350 --> 00:26:34,270
slave who jumps in the line

669
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:36,010
looking forward for the opportunity to

670
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,070
serve them. I might also

671
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,170
add that you're let go into an

672
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:42,330
abyss of economic uncertainty.

673
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,950
But still with the basic

674
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,070
needs that have to be met.

675
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:48,030
And your recreational needs,

676
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,970
your recreational drugs, or what have you.

677
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:51,850
So you end up being criminalized.

678
00:26:51,950 --> 00:26:54,070
You fall into the extensive

679
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:56,030
prison system, larger

680
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,870
than the population of many countries.

681
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,070
And there you are a slave again.

682
00:27:00,350 --> 00:27:02,230
Only now you're not

683
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,050
being paid. Or you're paid such

684
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:06,110
a small, contemptible amount that

685
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:07,590
might as well be nothing.

686
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:10,050
It's just as much a kick in the slats

687
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:12,330
to your self-esteem. So of course

688
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,230
you want to stay out of the prison system.

689
00:27:14,370 --> 00:27:16,250
You want to stay out of the medical system.

690
00:27:16,450 --> 00:27:18,110
You want to stay out of the legal system.

691
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:19,890
You want to stay out of any

692
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,050
system. And the conspiracy

693
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:23,810
is the greatest system

694
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,910
of all. The greatest time

695
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,210
waster and the greatest

696
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:30,290
ball breaker that you'll ever

697
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:32,330
encounter toddling down the pike.

698
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:34,010
Never fight the

699
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:36,030
system. That's what they say.

700
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:38,330
We say the only good system

701
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:39,650
is a non-system.

702
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,610
A system that's been systematically

703
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,230
destroyed from the

704
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:45,810
inside out. And that is why many

705
00:27:45,810 --> 00:27:47,710
subgeniuses have their so-called

706
00:27:47,710 --> 00:27:49,970
con job. We're in positions

707
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,250
usually having to do with computer networks,

708
00:27:52,930 --> 00:27:54,230
nerds, people who are right

709
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:56,230
at the epicenter of the control centers.

710
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:58,190
And when it hits the fan,

711
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,350
who do you think is going to be throwing the switches?

712
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,690
This is true.

713
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,010
You'll notice many

714
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:06,030
subgeniuses have jobs in

715
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:07,910
things that seem not

716
00:28:07,910 --> 00:28:09,710
very subgenius at all.

717
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,290
Food service. In the government.

718
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:14,410
In legal.

719
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,270
School crossing guards.

720
00:28:16,570 --> 00:28:17,970
Healthcare. Garbage

721
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:20,110
collecting. Things that seem

722
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,210
not so slackful,

723
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:23,730
but yet they keep going.

724
00:28:24,190 --> 00:28:26,090
Mechanics. But how

725
00:28:26,090 --> 00:28:27,670
many of them are lawyers? Well,

726
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:30,130
that's not a position of, that's a

727
00:28:30,130 --> 00:28:31,990
prestigious position of subgenius.

728
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:33,690
Why? Would they want to be a lawyer?

729
00:28:33,890 --> 00:28:36,070
Go look in your phone book. The typical

730
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:37,690
phone book, let's say it has, oh,

731
00:28:38,270 --> 00:28:39,270
200 pages.

732
00:28:39,670 --> 00:28:42,030
I'll bet you 60 of those pages are filled

733
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:44,270
with lawyers. 60 pages

734
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:46,070
for lawyers. And yet

735
00:28:46,070 --> 00:28:48,290
if you turn to the section on mechanics

736
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,270
or garbage collectors...

737
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:51,750
One page.

738
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,970
Fewer pages than

739
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,950
the lawyers. You are so preaching to the choir.

740
00:28:56,150 --> 00:28:58,170
And yet how long can society last

741
00:28:58,170 --> 00:29:00,350
without garbage collecting?

742
00:29:00,370 --> 00:29:02,090
How long can society last without

743
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,910
food preparation? How long can society

744
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:06,130
last without mechanics to keep the cars

745
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,250
running? And then we have to ask ourselves,

746
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:10,110
how long can we last without the

747
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,270
lawyers? Forever!

748
00:29:11,610 --> 00:29:14,110
At the moment, the conspiracy is

749
00:29:14,110 --> 00:29:16,210
trying to destroy these civil

750
00:29:16,210 --> 00:29:17,950
bonds of society and

751
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,030
place all against all, because

752
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,890
it's found that desperate people

753
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:24,110
are even better customers than

754
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,930
the self-satisfied

755
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,090
cud-chewers that used to be their

756
00:29:28,090 --> 00:29:29,250
prime source of revenue.

757
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,890
And this is the thing, the one thing,

758
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:34,070
the reason the conspiracy wants

759
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:36,150
your slack, and you touched on

760
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:37,970
it, is that slack cannot

761
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:39,830
be bought or sold. True slack

762
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,370
has no monetary

763
00:29:42,370 --> 00:29:44,150
value. Unfortunately, it

764
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,010
is a motivator, and the conspiracy

765
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:48,190
also knows this. And that's

766
00:29:48,190 --> 00:29:50,150
why they present their false version.

767
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:52,210
They try to actually badmouth

768
00:29:52,210 --> 00:29:54,090
slack. They try to make you afraid of

769
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,030
slack. I mean, ten years ago

770
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,150
we were saying real slack

771
00:29:58,150 --> 00:30:00,010
meant quit your job. And yet now

772
00:30:00,010 --> 00:30:02,090
they've turned that around on their heads. They want you to

773
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:04,050
feel the worst thing in the world that could

774
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:06,090
possibly happen to you in today's modern

775
00:30:06,270 --> 00:30:07,710
age is for you to lose

776
00:30:08,270 --> 00:30:10,130
your job. And I do believe

777
00:30:10,130 --> 00:30:11,990
it was Ivan Stang who said that

778
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,250
the worst thing that can happen

779
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:15,810
if you quit your job is that

780
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:18,150
you'll find a better one. That's him.

781
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,150
He's right over there.

782
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,070
And yet even within these conspiracy

783
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:24,210
times, we've managed to get our little worm

784
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:25,850
holes within their little systems.

785
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,110
The very first, the moment that it becomes

786
00:30:28,110 --> 00:30:30,070
hard to get a job, we've managed to extend

787
00:30:30,070 --> 00:30:32,290
unemployment insurance

788
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:34,310
for another, what was it, 13 months?

789
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:36,130
They can't get rid of us.

790
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,150
They keep trying. They take

791
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,030
one step forward, but they go two steps

792
00:30:40,030 --> 00:30:42,270
back. Because, let's face it,

793
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:44,070
there is no aspect

794
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:46,470
of life, no phase more rewarding

795
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,030
than that involved with

796
00:30:48,030 --> 00:30:49,630
being the highest

797
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:52,070
example of evolution, an

798
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:52,710
art bum.

799
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,790
Ah, the art bum.

800
00:30:56,010 --> 00:30:58,070
I love subgenius

801
00:30:58,070 --> 00:30:59,950
art. I've seen such great

802
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,170
things. I have right here

803
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:02,670
a

804
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:05,670
Bob-marked

805
00:31:06,270 --> 00:31:07,010
pinball machine.

806
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:09,170
A pinball machine with

807
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,070
planets and saucers and

808
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:14,030
a nice message on the back

809
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:16,110
that says, if you see this

810
00:31:16,110 --> 00:31:17,570
man, kill him.

811
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:20,330
Subgeniuses

812
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:22,130
have a special kind of art.

813
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,130
An art that is completely

814
00:31:24,130 --> 00:31:25,890
incomparable to what

815
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,110
the conspiracy would call art.

816
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:29,750
Subgeniuses often

817
00:31:30,270 --> 00:31:31,950
will be walking works of art.

818
00:31:32,230 --> 00:31:33,530
Walking a pure

819
00:31:34,270 --> 00:31:36,070
slack in an artistic form

820
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,810
their very appearance and

821
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:39,530
movements and voice

822
00:31:40,270 --> 00:31:41,610
are art itself.

823
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,010
But the conspiracy will never

824
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:46,150
see that because they can't

825
00:31:46,150 --> 00:31:47,910
package it. They can't

826
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:50,190
market it. They can't figure

827
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:51,430
out how to control

828
00:31:51,430 --> 00:31:54,130
that which is mutant art.

829
00:31:54,430 --> 00:31:55,650
This conspiracy

830
00:31:56,490 --> 00:31:58,010
shuns the bull dada.

831
00:31:58,210 --> 00:31:59,770
They laugh at it.

832
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:02,110
It is ridiculed unless they can make

833
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,890
a trend out of it and the hipsters will buy it.

834
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,230
The conspiracy doesn't like

835
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,290
real art because it shines

836
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:10,370
a little light and shows

837
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:12,370
just a portion of the fraud

838
00:32:12,370 --> 00:32:14,270
of the conspiracy. But let's

839
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,050
be real. Genuine

840
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,610
art comes from pain.

841
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,230
It does not come from a desire to

842
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:22,150
decorate your living room

843
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:24,110
with a Thomas Kinkade painting

844
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:26,290
which comforts and cheers

845
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:28,330
until the next

846
00:32:28,330 --> 00:32:30,350
few seconds when you forget about it for the rest

847
00:32:30,350 --> 00:32:30,830
of your life.

848
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:34,390
The being of art is therapeutic.

849
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:36,250
You do it because you know

850
00:32:36,270 --> 00:32:38,070
you need in some subconscious

851
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:40,190
way to right the wrongs

852
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:41,990
that have been done to you.

853
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:43,830
And ironically

854
00:32:43,830 --> 00:32:46,070
enough it's often the conspiracy which is

855
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:48,010
producing, at a remove,

856
00:32:48,330 --> 00:32:49,210
this pain.

857
00:32:49,650 --> 00:32:52,230
So in a way you could even

858
00:32:52,230 --> 00:32:54,190
thank the conspiracy for

859
00:32:55,030 --> 00:32:56,110
being the

860
00:32:56,110 --> 00:32:57,650
fountainhead of art

861
00:32:58,270 --> 00:32:59,090
just as

862
00:33:00,270 --> 00:33:01,910
the Jews could thank Hitler

863
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:04,190
for preserving the Polish

864
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,150
the synagogue

865
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:07,950
in, where was it,

866
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:10,630
that he wanted

867
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,210
for a museum of

868
00:33:12,210 --> 00:33:14,130
Jewishness so it was saved.

869
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:16,010
It's like with friends like that

870
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:17,750
who needs enemies? It was in

871
00:33:18,270 --> 00:33:19,830
Prague actually and still is.

872
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,950
Well once again the essential

873
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,950
difference between art and entertainment

874
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,350
is that art spires

875
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,170
off some of the synapses in your mind

876
00:33:28,170 --> 00:33:29,710
that actually engage in think.

877
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:32,010
Thinking art. Whereas

878
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,630
entertainment is just sort of stimulation

879
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,970
for stimulation's sake. But the

880
00:33:36,270 --> 00:33:38,050
conspiracy knows that if you don't

881
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:40,210
use it you will lose it.

882
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,030
And that is why their entertainment

883
00:33:42,510 --> 00:33:44,230
has so little real art.

884
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:46,350
They don't want you to fire off the synapses.

885
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:48,330
They don't want you to think. They want you to lose

886
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,150
that ability to think. They want you to lose

887
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:52,330
and snooze. They want you to

888
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,030
be just enough awake

889
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:55,150
to order

890
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,770
the special order that

891
00:33:57,770 --> 00:33:59,650
you can order at this time only.

892
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,950
Can I get you to move ever so slightly?

893
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,110
And while

894
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:07,930
we're pontificating about art

895
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:10,010
I'm going to advance the controversial

896
00:34:10,010 --> 00:34:11,770
view that good art

897
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,130
entertains. Yes I know

898
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,150
this is blasphemy because art exists

899
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,630
for the artist and so forth.

900
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,630
Well as Gertrude Stein said

901
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:21,910
the bad artist suffers

902
00:34:21,910 --> 00:34:24,170
just as much anguish and agony

903
00:34:24,170 --> 00:34:25,690
as the good artist.

904
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,070
And then at the end is still a

905
00:34:28,070 --> 00:34:29,670
bad artist. No

906
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,930
you should unbend a little bit

907
00:34:31,930 --> 00:34:34,110
as an artist and try to make your work

908
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:36,050
appeal to somebody

909
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:37,590
not to everybody.

910
00:34:37,870 --> 00:34:40,070
Not everything's for children and not

911
00:34:40,070 --> 00:34:41,870
everything's for everybody as

912
00:34:41,870 --> 00:34:44,210
R. Crumb said. But it should be directed

913
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:46,250
towards somebody. It shouldn't

914
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:47,950
be masturbation

915
00:34:47,950 --> 00:34:49,870
like bad art. But

916
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,670
it should have some

917
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:54,110
recipient in mind. There's going to be

918
00:34:54,110 --> 00:34:55,970
someone out there who appreciates it.

919
00:34:56,190 --> 00:34:57,990
I would believe that sometimes

920
00:34:57,990 --> 00:34:59,610
even if you design

921
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,210
or imagine your art just for yourself

922
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:03,330
that someone

923
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,770
must appreciate

924
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,010
some reference of the same thing

925
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:10,010
that you appreciate. And like that

926
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:12,170
mental masturbation you don't want it all to just

927
00:35:12,170 --> 00:35:14,190
be wasted. I mean that's almost like

928
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:16,070
mass murder. You want there to at least be a

929
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:18,210
chance that one of those little modules

930
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:19,530
of your satisfaction

931
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:22,230
might lead to greater satisfaction for future

932
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,250
generations. Ah Papa Joe

933
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:26,110
Mama's Jesuitical training

934
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:27,850
always shows through.

935
00:35:28,110 --> 00:35:30,190
Yes in principle I agree with

936
00:35:30,190 --> 00:35:30,890
that as well.

937
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:33,550
We must keep these sorts of principles

938
00:35:34,110 --> 00:35:35,850
deeply embedded in our subconscious

939
00:35:36,270 --> 00:35:36,510
and we must not

940
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:36,510


941
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,890
extended vacation type events like this.

942
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,890
Well it's important not to let it just

943
00:35:41,890 --> 00:35:43,770
wander away at the end of its tether.

944
00:35:44,990 --> 00:35:47,310
And this might be the appropriate time

945
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:49,190
to promote the latest addition

946
00:35:49,190 --> 00:35:50,990
to the subgenius

947
00:35:50,990 --> 00:35:52,990
merchandise branch which is

948
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:55,290
the Connie and Dobbshead condoms.

949
00:35:56,270 --> 00:35:57,370
I'm sure everyone's seen those

950
00:35:57,370 --> 00:35:58,810
or have they?

951
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:01,890
Oh my gosh

952
00:36:01,890 --> 00:36:03,150
I'm on. Yes

953
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:05,870
the Dobbs and Connie condoms are over there.

954
00:36:06,270 --> 00:36:08,170
Oddly enough there are more Connie-doms

955
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:10,670
than Dobbsdoms.

956
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:11,730
Why wouldn't you want...

957
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:12,630
They're only two dollars a piece.

958
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:15,950
We're selling these at a tremendous loss.

959
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,310
We do this as a

960
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,250
head of health concern.

961
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,670
These are not disposable condoms though

962
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,130
Reverend Stang. That's why they have to be

963
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:26,110
two dollars each because if they were less than

964
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:28,030
two dollars each you might throw them away after

965
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:29,450
using them. But with the

966
00:36:30,070 --> 00:36:31,890
subgenius condoms they're actually

967
00:36:31,890 --> 00:36:33,210
suitable for freezing.

968
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,150
I'm really disappointed that the con...that the

969
00:36:36,270 --> 00:36:38,090
Connie condoms have sold less because

970
00:36:38,090 --> 00:36:40,470
I hear all the time

971
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:42,290
the males in this church talking

972
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:44,290
about how much they want Connie

973
00:36:44,290 --> 00:36:45,170
on their schlong.

974
00:36:45,670 --> 00:36:47,830
Well they're not just for men too. I mean these

975
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,070
female condoms. They're just trying to be

976
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,950
politically correct.

977
00:36:52,570 --> 00:36:54,110
You may want to use these for

978
00:36:54,110 --> 00:36:56,190
all sorts of appliances. I hate to say it

979
00:36:56,190 --> 00:36:58,070
but Connie's face

980
00:36:58,070 --> 00:36:59,990
on a Dobbs product is the

981
00:36:59,990 --> 00:37:01,350
kiss of death.

982
00:37:02,550 --> 00:37:04,290
Sales wise. I'm not sure

983
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,230
why that is. It's because Connie... I guess

984
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:08,370
people walk...they like Playboy better or something.

985
00:37:08,450 --> 00:37:10,310
It depends on what way that...which direction

986
00:37:10,310 --> 00:37:11,390
the face is facing.

987
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:14,050
It really comes down to this. This is something

988
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:16,270
that I...is sort of ingrained

989
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:18,170
in our minds and not

990
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,450
on a conscious level but

991
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,230
there is no one face for Connie.

992
00:37:22,390 --> 00:37:23,950
Connie is every

993
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:25,870
woman. And by

994
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,950
every woman I do unfortunately mean

995
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:29,550
every woman.

996
00:37:30,070 --> 00:37:31,610
Connie is the

997
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:33,930
angelic sort of

998
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:35,910
cherubic beauty such as

999
00:37:36,270 --> 00:37:36,970
a woman like Pantiera.

1000
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:39,710
Connie is the buxom loud

1001
00:37:40,270 --> 00:37:42,110
mouthed crazy woman such as

1002
00:37:42,110 --> 00:37:43,850
myself. Connie

1003
00:37:43,850 --> 00:37:45,890
is the space goddess

1004
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:47,430
princess like we.

1005
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,110
Connie is

1006
00:37:49,110 --> 00:37:51,290
any number

1007
00:37:51,290 --> 00:37:54,110
of the women you see here. We are all

1008
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:55,930
facets of Connie. And

1009
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,730
trying to nail down just

1010
00:37:57,730 --> 00:37:59,890
one side of Connie on any

1011
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,850
just an item.

1012
00:38:02,110 --> 00:38:04,150
That is...it doesn't do it justice.

1013
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,130
Yes the side is not

1014
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:06,690
the same.

1015
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,130
Ironically there is a little bit of Connie in

1016
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,290
everyone and everything except for

1017
00:38:12,030 --> 00:38:12,550
conspiracy.

1018
00:38:14,750 --> 00:38:15,790
No no.

1019
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:17,610
That is the opposite.

1020
00:38:17,930 --> 00:38:19,890
It's almost like the anti-Dobbs

1021
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,590
has Dobbs name in it. You

1022
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,710
can't go off of just simply the name.

1023
00:38:23,910 --> 00:38:25,370
There is more to it than the name.

1024
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,870
Connie is...I...I...I

1025
00:38:28,870 --> 00:38:30,070
Connie has her

1026
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:31,050
place in the conspiracy.

1027
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:33,610
Connie does have her place.

1028
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:36,030
I tend to believe there is sort of a difference

1029
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,170
in the machinations and the movements and how

1030
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,910
Bob and Connie work.

1031
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:42,030
Connie has the gift

1032
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,190
of...let's put it this

1033
00:38:44,190 --> 00:38:45,870
way. I recently had a discussion

1034
00:38:45,870 --> 00:38:48,330
with a fellow sub-genius

1035
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:50,030
who said...we were

1036
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:52,190
discussing it and I said you know honestly I think

1037
00:38:52,190 --> 00:38:53,270
I'm more evil than you.

1038
00:38:53,610 --> 00:38:56,110
And he said...why?

1039
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,090
And I said...

1040
00:38:57,090 --> 00:38:59,050
because I'm a woman.

1041
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:01,950
Females have an ability

1042
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,170
a manipulative power and Connie

1043
00:39:04,170 --> 00:39:06,210
has to be part of the conspiracy because

1044
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,730
that's where she can use

1045
00:39:08,270 --> 00:39:09,410
that manipulative power.

1046
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,030
It's not a bad thing per se.

1047
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:14,270
Just as nothing as I said before is good

1048
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:15,690
or evil in itself.

1049
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,570
It's how those powers are used.

1050
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:19,810
Well like most animals, female humans

1051
00:39:19,810 --> 00:39:22,030
are the more lethal of the species.

1052
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,270
Exactly.

1053
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:26,210
They have to be to protect the future

1054
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:26,990
of the race.

1055
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,170
Speaking of the future of

1056
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:30,590
the race,

1057
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,890
I believe that we can now

1058
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:35,950
say truly that the hour of

1059
00:39:36,270 --> 00:39:36,730
slack number

1060
00:39:39,790 --> 00:39:40,530
1317

1061
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:41,970
or something

1062
00:39:41,970 --> 00:39:43,910
like that has begun.

1063
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,050
Now that I've finished my

1064
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,370
janitorial duties

1065
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,590
and we've got

1066
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:52,010
the music soundtrack from the

1067
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:53,910
time machine running, the George

1068
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,870
Powell time machine. Ah yes!

1069
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:57,930
Welcome to the sub-genius

1070
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:00,150
radio ministry hour of slack.

1071
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:04,210
And we hope you enjoy

1072
00:40:04,210 --> 00:40:06,130
the next hour of

1073
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,210
broadcast as much as we enjoy

1074
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,090
bringing it to you.

1075
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:14,010
So we were yak yak

1076
00:40:14,010 --> 00:40:16,110
yakking about Bob and

1077
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,770
Connie and the conspiracy.

1078
00:40:17,970 --> 00:40:20,230
As we know, Bob embraces

1079
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:21,690
Connie and

1080
00:40:22,270 --> 00:40:24,210
no one, let's be quite

1081
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,810
real about this, is pure

1082
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:28,190
enough to be untainted by

1083
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,950
the conspiracy. All

1084
00:40:29,950 --> 00:40:32,170
religions present an ideal

1085
00:40:32,170 --> 00:40:34,330
which you try to live up to.

1086
00:40:34,490 --> 00:40:36,250
Trying to divest one's self

1087
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,990
from the conspiracy is an ideal.

1088
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:40,050
But you know, many

1089
00:40:40,050 --> 00:40:42,190
Muslims who consider themselves

1090
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,050
quite devout still go to strip

1091
00:40:44,050 --> 00:40:45,930
clubs and bars. They

1092
00:40:45,930 --> 00:40:47,870
give themselves a pass for falling

1093
00:40:47,870 --> 00:40:50,170
short of their severity. But

1094
00:40:50,170 --> 00:40:52,130
they still consider themselves good

1095
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,150
Muslims, just as Christians

1096
00:40:54,150 --> 00:40:56,310
who also fall into

1097
00:40:56,310 --> 00:40:58,330
sin know smugly

1098
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,910
and confidently

1099
00:40:59,910 --> 00:41:02,030
that they will be forgiven

1100
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:04,330
if they simply perform the proper

1101
00:41:04,330 --> 00:41:06,150
rigamarole. But you see how

1102
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,490
Bob isn't about

1103
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:10,170
forgiving your sins. Not at all.

1104
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:12,510
Bob is about watching your sins.

1105
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,610
And Bob likes to videotape

1106
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:16,110
your sins. And Bob

1107
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,090
likes to sell those videotapes

1108
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,410
on RedTube later.

1109
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:22,150
Most of you have already bought

1110
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:24,230
the excuse for your sins that he

1111
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:25,730
sells. That divine excuse.

1112
00:41:26,530 --> 00:41:28,130
And if there's any

1113
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:29,950
unsaved listening

1114
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:32,270
now, this could be your

1115
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:34,230
last chance to go over there to that sales

1116
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,170
table. That's right. There's the swag.

1117
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,270
Right there. It emanates.

1118
00:41:39,010 --> 00:41:40,590
It radiates darshan.

1119
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,230
Holiness. Just a touch

1120
00:41:42,230 --> 00:41:43,470
that stuff puts you a leg up.

1121
00:41:43,570 --> 00:41:45,910
It radiates an excuse.

1122
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:48,250
That's right. You show it to the cops

1123
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:50,190
and they'll go, oh, sure, of course,

1124
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:52,250
Bob, fine. Go ahead and finish

1125
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:52,850
what you're doing.

1126
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,450
That hasn't ever worked for me.

1127
00:41:56,570 --> 00:41:57,630
It works for a buzzly hand.

1128
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,290
Bob sold it, I smoked it,

1129
00:42:00,330 --> 00:42:02,090
that settles it. Praise Bob.

1130
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,530
And how many times have we heard

1131
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:06,110
people outside the church say derogatory

1132
00:42:06,270 --> 00:42:08,270
things like, oh, that subgenius church.

1133
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,870
There's too much resentment.

1134
00:42:09,970 --> 00:42:11,870
There's too much hatred in that religion.

1135
00:42:11,910 --> 00:42:14,170
I'm not interested in that. Boy, if they

1136
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:16,110
only knew. We've got more love

1137
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:17,830
than all those other religions put together.

1138
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,230
How many of those Christians will say things like

1139
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,070
love the sinner but

1140
00:42:22,070 --> 00:42:24,450
hate the sin. In the church of the subgenius

1141
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:26,110
we love the sinner and

1142
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:27,930
we love the sin. We've got

1143
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:30,310
double the love that they have, brothers and sisters.

1144
00:42:30,310 --> 00:42:32,070
And Bob doesn't care diddly

1145
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:33,930
about sins, honestly.

1146
00:42:34,190 --> 00:42:36,130
That is such a wrong idea. Bob

1147
00:42:36,270 --> 00:42:37,970
doesn't give a frog fart for sins.

1148
00:42:38,670 --> 00:42:39,790
Maybe Bob,

1149
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,890
if he had the thought, would wish people

1150
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:44,310
didn't have them, but in general

1151
00:42:44,310 --> 00:42:45,970
they're not going to scratch his

1152
00:42:45,970 --> 00:42:47,990
veneer. What Bob has

1153
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,910
and has all of

1154
00:42:49,910 --> 00:42:51,890
is luck. And the

1155
00:42:51,890 --> 00:42:54,130
closer you can come to the nature

1156
00:42:54,130 --> 00:42:56,070
of Bob, the more you can

1157
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,670
surf the luck plane

1158
00:42:58,270 --> 00:42:59,890
and avoid these conspiracy

1159
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,990
monsters that we've been talking about.

1160
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,230
You just have to keep surfing.

1161
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,090
Of course, like anyone who surfs,

1162
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:07,770
eventually you're going to wipe out.

1163
00:43:07,930 --> 00:43:10,190
But don't concentrate on the wipeouts.

1164
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,190
They happen. Get back on the

1165
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:13,930
board and continue to

1166
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:15,790
surf the luck plane.

1167
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:18,310
That's all Bob would ever advise.

1168
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:19,570
Sins indeed.

1169
00:43:19,910 --> 00:43:21,870
And the quicker you get back on that board,

1170
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:24,270
the quicker you can catch the next

1171
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:25,770
big luck plane wave.

1172
00:43:25,770 --> 00:43:28,030
You don't want to wallow in your sand and bruises

1173
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:30,190
and splinters and shark bites. You want to

1174
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:31,390
get back on there and

1175
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,050
recreate the glorious moments of

1176
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,630
slack. And it is then that you

1177
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:38,210
evince the Bob-like nature the most.

1178
00:43:38,330 --> 00:43:40,270
But please, correct me if I'm wrong,

1179
00:43:40,410 --> 00:43:41,570
Reverend Stang.

1180
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:43,850
Well, actually, it's the whole

1181
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:45,950
lack of luck that's the tell-tale sign

1182
00:43:45,950 --> 00:43:48,390
of the conspiracy. You go into the casino,

1183
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:49,950
all ties go to the house.

1184
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,190
You drive down the highway, making some good

1185
00:43:52,190 --> 00:43:54,150
time. Well, there's that conspiracy

1186
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:56,490
highway patrolman there waiting for you.

1187
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:58,170
It's infuriating. Who are we

1188
00:43:58,170 --> 00:44:00,190
to have to obey society's primitive

1189
00:44:00,190 --> 00:44:02,050
laws and morals of stop signs,

1190
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:04,030
yield signs, and so forth?

1191
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:06,070
But with slack,

1192
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:08,090
comes luck. And with luck, comes slack.

1193
00:44:08,290 --> 00:44:09,450
But which comes first?

1194
00:44:10,850 --> 00:44:12,250
Speaking of coming,

1195
00:44:12,450 --> 00:44:14,050
sinning and the

1196
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:16,290
sinless, I have noticed that

1197
00:44:16,290 --> 00:44:17,930
for many

1198
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:20,050
subgeniuses, there's this

1199
00:44:20,050 --> 00:44:21,450
odd, perverse

1200
00:44:22,250 --> 00:44:24,090
desire that increases

1201
00:44:24,090 --> 00:44:25,890
for a person with the

1202
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:28,370
innocence of that person.

1203
00:44:28,490 --> 00:44:29,990
For instance, some

1204
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:32,170
subgeniuses, if they see a

1205
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,090
woman walking

1206
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:35,950
along all dressed up, you know,

1207
00:44:36,270 --> 00:44:37,190
slutty style,

1208
00:44:37,470 --> 00:44:39,410
Las Vegas hooker look,

1209
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:41,350
they're not that interested.

1210
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,970
But when they see that prim and

1211
00:44:43,970 --> 00:44:45,730
proper Amish girl,

1212
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:47,990
that Hasidic high school

1213
00:44:47,990 --> 00:44:49,570
girl walking along the front

1214
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:51,830
street, that flow of innocence

1215
00:44:51,830 --> 00:44:53,170
and sinlessness,

1216
00:44:53,370 --> 00:44:54,830
for some reason,

1217
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,530
I don't know about the rest of you guys,

1218
00:44:57,730 --> 00:45:00,030
but for some of us, there's

1219
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:02,090
this odd desire

1220
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:02,790
to

1221
00:45:04,270 --> 00:45:06,050
taint them, to take the clean

1222
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:06,950
and the pure.

1223
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:09,550
What was that line in Shakespeare?

1224
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:11,470
Dost thou

1225
00:45:12,270 --> 00:45:14,170
love her most foully

1226
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:16,150
for that which makes her

1227
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:17,010
good?

1228
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,110
That was Antonius, I think,

1229
00:45:20,150 --> 00:45:22,410
talking about a nun that he had a crush on.

1230
00:45:22,410 --> 00:45:22,650
That is true.

1231
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:25,230
How many of y'all had a crush on a nun?

1232
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:27,990
What it comes down to, Stang, is it's a blank

1233
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,930
I know Princess Wee did at one point.

1234
00:45:30,010 --> 00:45:31,950
She was raised by nuns.

1235
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,510
Stang, it's a blank canvas.

1236
00:45:33,790 --> 00:45:35,990
Our sins and our dirty thoughts

1237
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:37,730
are in some ways our art.

1238
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,570
And we see the

1239
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:41,630
innocent, beautiful,

1240
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:43,290
pure

1241
00:45:44,230 --> 00:45:45,790
being and we think,

1242
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,150
I would love to spread

1243
00:45:48,150 --> 00:45:49,710
my art all

1244
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:51,870
over that canvas.

1245
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:53,710
I hate to repeat myself,

1246
00:45:53,990 --> 00:45:55,310
but I've always said that

1247
00:45:55,310 --> 00:45:57,750
the truest, most honest

1248
00:45:58,270 --> 00:45:59,930
artist, is it not the

1249
00:45:59,930 --> 00:46:01,090
jack-off artist?

1250
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:03,950
Or the rub-off artist? Because

1251
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:05,810
that is the artist who's

1252
00:46:06,270 --> 00:46:06,490
doing it for the audience.

1253
00:46:06,490 --> 00:46:07,710
They're not doing it for an audience.

1254
00:46:07,850 --> 00:46:10,050
They don't care what the critics think.

1255
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,010
They're doing it for their own

1256
00:46:12,010 --> 00:46:14,170
pure self-expression.

1257
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:17,490
That's what I call real art.

1258
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:18,890
It's the most real art.

1259
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:21,110
And as such, I am the Van Gogh

1260
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,710
of the subgenius world.

1261
00:46:24,090 --> 00:46:25,250
That type of art.

1262
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:27,310
Or an impressionist, or pointillist, maybe.

1263
00:46:27,530 --> 00:46:29,870
But the idea is

1264
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,990
that that may be pure art,

1265
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:33,050
but it's not necessarily

1266
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:35,930
good art. It's simply the most

1267
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:37,770
original art.

1268
00:46:38,070 --> 00:46:40,030
I'm not trying to sell it

1269
00:46:40,030 --> 00:46:41,190
to anybody. I'm just

1270
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,890
saying that in terms of, well, you could

1271
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,090
probably get paid for it.

1272
00:46:45,150 --> 00:46:46,990
No, I'm just saying, Wankers for Bob

1273
00:46:46,990 --> 00:46:49,810
absolutely supports wanking in every shape

1274
00:46:49,810 --> 00:46:51,610
and form. One of the discussions

1275
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:52,970
that Wankers for Bob have had is,

1276
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,570
why do the saucers keep not showing up?

1277
00:46:55,970 --> 00:46:57,610
And someone proposed

1278
00:46:57,610 --> 00:46:58,970
that maybe the problem was

1279
00:46:58,970 --> 00:47:01,630
we weren't letting off the right energy.

1280
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:03,890
And it's been suggested that

1281
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:05,790
I understand that

1282
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:08,010
you don't always have time

1283
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:10,230
to get it on with another

1284
00:47:10,970 --> 00:47:11,930
fellow Yeti.

1285
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,130
But you can always get it on

1286
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:14,670
with yourself.

1287
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:17,950
You can take a few minutes and

1288
00:47:17,950 --> 00:47:20,090
run into the bathroom on your coffee

1289
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:22,130
break at work, or you can

1290
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,290
do it while you're driving down the road.

1291
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,230
It'll stop you from falling asleep at the wheel.

1292
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:27,610
How did Bob put it?

1293
00:47:28,170 --> 00:47:30,110
Fornicate as if your very life

1294
00:47:30,110 --> 00:47:32,030
depends upon it, even if you

1295
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,810
have to do it with someone else.

1296
00:47:34,370 --> 00:47:36,250
Or somebody else, I should say.

1297
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,210
Or something else.

1298
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:38,370
Or something, yeah.

1299
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:41,550
But the point is, is that this

1300
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:44,350
jilling, or jacking, or wanking,

1301
00:47:44,410 --> 00:47:46,110
or whatever term you want to use,

1302
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:47,670
if we could encourage

1303
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:50,210
more of this amongst subgeniuses,

1304
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:52,150
I truly believe that

1305
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:53,850
it would send the message.

1306
00:47:54,210 --> 00:47:54,690
Those

1307
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:57,970
energies that are released when you

1308
00:47:57,970 --> 00:48:00,130
get that point and you reach the top of that hill.

1309
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:02,070
A Ruben Funny name. She doesn't mean

1310
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:04,350
you have to do that right now in front of us.

1311
00:48:04,430 --> 00:48:05,990
That's a private thing. You go

1312
00:48:06,270 --> 00:48:07,910
somewhere else. So we should all make a point of

1313
00:48:07,910 --> 00:48:10,250
reaching out to those people that aren't

1314
00:48:10,250 --> 00:48:12,070
doing this enough, and reaching out and

1315
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:14,050
shaking their hand, after

1316
00:48:14,050 --> 00:48:16,210
washing it, and making sure that they join

1317
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:18,610
us in this self-satisfaction.

1318
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:20,330
This great circle of

1319
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,330
jerks, or subgeniuses,

1320
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,750
as we prefer to be called. Right. And jerkettes.

1321
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:26,230
Yes, and I'm amazed

1322
00:48:26,230 --> 00:48:27,850
that, you know, that there's

1323
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:30,110
some of you boys seem to think

1324
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,150
that us

1325
00:48:32,150 --> 00:48:34,130
uberfans don't do that, and

1326
00:48:34,790 --> 00:48:35,910
God, you're stupid.

1327
00:48:36,270 --> 00:48:37,350
I mean...

1328
00:48:37,350 --> 00:48:39,990
Only because they revere you,

1329
00:48:40,070 --> 00:48:42,170
you see. I revere

1330
00:48:42,170 --> 00:48:44,110
myself quite a bit. But, as my

1331
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:46,130
father said, there's such a thing

1332
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,130
as too much. He didn't say how

1333
00:48:48,130 --> 00:48:49,790
much. When I was about twelve,

1334
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:51,670
Pappy, the great Pappy,

1335
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:52,870
he said to me,

1336
00:48:54,110 --> 00:48:56,130
Ivan, I'm sure you probably

1337
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,930
do that thing that

1338
00:48:57,930 --> 00:48:59,830
all boys do.

1339
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,070
And I kind of sheepishly went,

1340
00:49:02,190 --> 00:49:03,930
well, we never

1341
00:49:03,930 --> 00:49:06,010
know. I didn't throw in

1342
00:49:06,270 --> 00:49:07,330
eight times a day.

1343
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:09,650
But he said,

1344
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:11,910
just

1345
00:49:11,910 --> 00:49:14,010
don't do it too

1346
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:14,710
much.

1347
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:18,030
As if he had some experience with that.

1348
00:49:18,190 --> 00:49:20,210
But I never was told

1349
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,450
what too much was.

1350
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:24,050
And, as I

1351
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:25,250
became a father,

1352
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,790
I said to my

1353
00:49:27,790 --> 00:49:30,090
daughter when she got of age, I said,

1354
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:31,670
I know that

1355
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,810
you're going to be bad

1356
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:36,030
sometimes. I just

1357
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:36,810
didn't think about it in general.

1358
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:39,370
She was a teenager, a fairly normal

1359
00:49:39,370 --> 00:49:41,930
teenager. And I said, I know you're going to be

1360
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:44,110
bad. Just try to

1361
00:49:44,110 --> 00:49:45,830
use some common sense and

1362
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:47,210
don't be too bad.

1363
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:49,490
And she looked at me sideways,

1364
00:49:49,630 --> 00:49:51,910
the same way I probably looked at my dad

1365
00:49:51,910 --> 00:49:53,890
when he made that vague warning.

1366
00:49:54,350 --> 00:49:55,950
You know, it's like, well, how much

1367
00:49:55,950 --> 00:49:58,030
is too bad? How much

1368
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,990
is too much? Too much,

1369
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:01,910
we know this much, is

1370
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:03,530
always better than not enough.

1371
00:50:03,590 --> 00:50:06,010
Or at least that sounds

1372
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,130
good. But sometimes it's

1373
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,190
just as bad. The original line was that too much

1374
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:12,130
is always better than not enough, but it's almost

1375
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:13,990
as bad. And our

1376
00:50:13,990 --> 00:50:16,110
publicity people suggested we cut

1377
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:18,090
that last half of the sentence because it

1378
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,010
didn't appeal to the kids as much.

1379
00:50:21,650 --> 00:50:23,490
And if you do too much, there are creams.

1380
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:26,250
Bag balm seems to work in certain cases.

1381
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:27,550
And the first aid

1382
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:29,970
trailer is right over there

1383
00:50:29,970 --> 00:50:31,910
if you happen to do it too much.

1384
00:50:31,970 --> 00:50:33,890
Well, that's why Dobbs created blisters, so

1385
00:50:33,890 --> 00:50:35,310
you know when there's too much.

1386
00:50:36,270 --> 00:50:38,190
The other warning I would make

1387
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:40,470
would be don't take the other

1388
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:40,870
half.

1389
00:50:42,770 --> 00:50:44,070
If it's given

1390
00:50:44,070 --> 00:50:45,790
to you by a subgenius pope,

1391
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,290
don't take the other half.

1392
00:50:49,530 --> 00:50:50,650
I hate

1393
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,210
to leave you people wondering

1394
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:53,950
what I mean by that,

1395
00:50:54,070 --> 00:50:55,810
but when the time comes,

1396
00:50:55,950 --> 00:50:57,150
I think you'll know.

1397
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:00,210
In the fullness of time, all shall be made apparent.

1398
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:02,030
You'll notice that

1399
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:04,030
the wisdom of Dobbs and his great

1400
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:06,110
sound bites have a

1401
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:07,090
certain ambiguity.

1402
00:51:07,610 --> 00:51:10,090
We leave a lot up to the common

1403
00:51:10,090 --> 00:51:12,090
sense, or lack of it, of

1404
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:13,110
the subgenius.

1405
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:16,150
We don't have that many

1406
00:51:16,150 --> 00:51:18,050
rules where we're going to tell

1407
00:51:18,050 --> 00:51:20,110
you exactly how

1408
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:20,450
many

1409
00:51:22,730 --> 00:51:23,990
sins of whatever

1410
00:51:23,990 --> 00:51:25,950
kind or cans of

1411
00:51:25,950 --> 00:51:28,410
root beer you're allowed to drink.

1412
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:30,010
You have to decide

1413
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:30,890
that for yourself.

1414
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:33,910
Exactly. You may be a subgenius, but that doesn't mean

1415
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:35,910
you're not smart enough to figure this out.

1416
00:51:36,270 --> 00:51:38,490
The problem is when you're too stupid

1417
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:40,030
to be a subgenius.

1418
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:41,450
You know, and that's what kills me.

1419
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:43,610
I mean, here we are. Let's face it.

1420
00:51:43,630 --> 00:51:46,610
I mean, it's not Church of the Genius, it's Church of the Subgenius.

1421
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:48,530
It took me 45 minutes

1422
00:51:48,530 --> 00:51:50,010
just to set up a backup

1423
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:52,270
recording deal and to be able to get

1424
00:51:52,270 --> 00:51:54,170
the music running on here, and that was with the

1425
00:51:54,170 --> 00:51:56,730
help of four other subgeniuses.

1426
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:57,510
And yet,

1427
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,330
if it was Pink's, it would have taken

1428
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:02,110
five times as long and fifty

1429
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:04,150
times more of them, and they still

1430
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:06,250
never would have gotten it right. And they would have

1431
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:07,030
charged you for it.

1432
00:52:07,690 --> 00:52:09,670
Yeah, they charged twice as much.

1433
00:52:10,290 --> 00:52:12,030
It's irony sometimes,

1434
00:52:12,390 --> 00:52:14,290
I think, of what drives a person

1435
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:15,970
to become an idol,

1436
00:52:16,350 --> 00:52:18,670
to realize their unsubgenius.

1437
00:52:18,850 --> 00:52:19,970
It's an evolving church

1438
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,250
for the evolving being.

1439
00:52:22,390 --> 00:52:24,250
It's not so much what's said in the Church

1440
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:26,290
of the Subgenius, but that which is unsaid.

1441
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,270
What you yourself must put in,

1442
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:29,570
the parentheses that are implied.

1443
00:52:29,570 --> 00:52:32,070
It's like when you read a comic book. You're looking at

1444
00:52:32,070 --> 00:52:34,350
a series of static pictures.

1445
00:52:34,510 --> 00:52:36,250
The action in the comic book

1446
00:52:36,270 --> 00:52:38,090
occurs between the pictures,

1447
00:52:38,270 --> 00:52:39,750
in the gutters between

1448
00:52:40,270 --> 00:52:42,290
the panels. All of life

1449
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:44,010
happens when you're not looking.

1450
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:45,710
When you're not paying attention.

1451
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,070
It's what's happening between the lines,

1452
00:52:48,090 --> 00:52:50,070
or in Dobbs' pictures case, between

1453
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,030
the dots. Sleight of hand.

1454
00:52:52,130 --> 00:52:53,890
That's how magic works. Real

1455
00:52:53,890 --> 00:52:54,370
magic.

1456
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:57,350
Magic without a K.

1457
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:00,530
Sleight of mind. The kind I believe in.

1458
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:02,110
Out of sleight, out of mind?

1459
00:53:02,310 --> 00:53:02,850
Yeah.

1460
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:06,110
The other kind is not worth

1461
00:53:06,270 --> 00:53:06,890
messing with.

1462
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:10,010
Well, actually, we have many of our pagan brethren

1463
00:53:10,010 --> 00:53:11,750
are here, and pagan

1464
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:13,990
subgeniuses, and some of them

1465
00:53:13,990 --> 00:53:16,130
are practitioners of magic.

1466
00:53:17,070 --> 00:53:18,290
But they go into it

1467
00:53:18,290 --> 00:53:19,490
so blithely and

1468
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:21,690
cast spells and so on.

1469
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:24,270
Well, they brag a lot about it, but the funny

1470
00:53:24,270 --> 00:53:25,730
thing I've noticed is that

1471
00:53:25,730 --> 00:53:26,890
the ones who

1472
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:30,090
talk the most about it seem to

1473
00:53:30,090 --> 00:53:31,770
benefit from it the least.

1474
00:53:31,950 --> 00:53:33,850
Yeah, well, the more you talk about it, the least you

1475
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:35,030
benefit from it.

1476
00:53:36,270 --> 00:53:37,710
The ones who say it the most do it the least.

1477
00:53:38,110 --> 00:53:39,530
The sleight of hand job.

1478
00:53:39,530 --> 00:53:41,250
Magic right here on this poster.

1479
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:43,750
Why don't you point those out?

1480
00:53:43,810 --> 00:53:45,790
You know, a poorly cast spell,

1481
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,950
and it will be poor if you don't know what you're doing,

1482
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:49,230
it's going to come back and

1483
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:51,350
continually strike you.

1484
00:53:51,510 --> 00:53:53,210
So, why even bother?

1485
00:53:53,410 --> 00:53:54,890
Oh, we have visual aids.

1486
00:53:55,170 --> 00:53:57,330
Here we go. Can everyone see this diagram?

1487
00:53:57,650 --> 00:53:59,490
There is such a thing as magic.

1488
00:53:59,750 --> 00:54:01,650
This is the Slack Pyramid.

1489
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:04,190
King Bob's keys to magic.

1490
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:05,850
They were inspired by

1491
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:08,130
Solomon's keys to magic, but his

1492
00:54:08,130 --> 00:54:09,710
report is hard to understand.

1493
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:11,430
The first

1494
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:13,790
key to magic, friends,

1495
00:54:13,930 --> 00:54:16,050
so simple, get off

1496
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:18,270
your ass. I think we all understand

1497
00:54:18,270 --> 00:54:19,790
that's how it starts.

1498
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:22,070
If you're, if you

1499
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:23,530
want a girlfriend,

1500
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:26,090
don't pray for

1501
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:27,690
a girlfriend. Talk

1502
00:54:28,270 --> 00:54:29,550
to a girl.

1503
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,170
Second one, bust your

1504
00:54:32,170 --> 00:54:34,250
ass, which is merely an amplification

1505
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,930
of get off your ass.

1506
00:54:36,270 --> 00:54:38,210
But, when you get really good at

1507
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:40,090
busting your ass, you learn how to

1508
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,490
get others to bust their asses

1509
00:54:42,490 --> 00:54:44,350
for you. As you can see

1510
00:54:44,350 --> 00:54:46,150
for the first 45 minutes of this

1511
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,110
recording, I have not yet mastered

1512
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:48,790
that myself.

1513
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:52,030
More impor- a very important

1514
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:53,950
rule of Bob's rule of magic,

1515
00:54:54,170 --> 00:54:55,830
watch or cover

1516
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:57,930
your ass. That can be

1517
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,690
taken both ways.

1518
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:02,290
You know, watch out for the conspiracy

1519
00:55:02,290 --> 00:55:04,150
sneaking up behind you, and

1520
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,250
also, just to do the right thing,

1521
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:08,190
best of us favor, keep your pants

1522
00:55:08,190 --> 00:55:10,090
on until the Bob test. A robot must

1523
00:55:10,090 --> 00:55:11,890
protect himself, except where it

1524
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:13,530
conflicts with the first or second law.

1525
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:16,050
Red Fox actually taught this one

1526
00:55:16,050 --> 00:55:18,130
to Bob. Wash your

1527
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:19,990
ass. More important than

1528
00:55:19,990 --> 00:55:22,130
watching, and those of you who

1529
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:24,250
are talking about, hell, I can't get a girlfriend,

1530
00:55:24,430 --> 00:55:25,730
I need to talk to a girl,

1531
00:55:25,830 --> 00:55:28,050
maybe you ought to wash your ass first.

1532
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:30,170
You'd be amazed,

1533
00:55:30,410 --> 00:55:32,270
as I think Pisces has said

1534
00:55:32,270 --> 00:55:33,450
before at X-Days,

1535
00:55:33,570 --> 00:55:36,190
how much difference a little person

1536
00:55:36,270 --> 00:55:37,510
of personal hygiene could make.

1537
00:55:37,650 --> 00:55:38,870
I have extra soap.

1538
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:42,550
I do, I bring extra soap

1539
00:55:42,550 --> 00:55:43,090
every year.

1540
00:55:44,590 --> 00:55:45,990
The slack, the

1541
00:55:45,990 --> 00:55:48,270
high point of the pyramid.

1542
00:55:49,170 --> 00:55:49,930
If you

1543
00:55:49,930 --> 00:55:51,870
need to wash your ass,

1544
00:55:52,110 --> 00:55:54,270
talk to me, I collect

1545
00:55:54,270 --> 00:55:56,130
throughout the year hotel

1546
00:55:56,130 --> 00:55:57,810
soaps and save them, and

1547
00:55:57,810 --> 00:56:00,190
I can ensure you that you'll have your own

1548
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:02,550
soap and you can wash your own ass.

1549
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,190
Yes, your bombosity will

1550
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:05,630
smell like a Motel 6.

1551
00:56:06,270 --> 00:56:07,830
Actually, I have a word to add

1552
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:10,070
to, just as a general announcement

1553
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:12,050
to folks, they like you to use

1554
00:56:12,050 --> 00:56:13,930
Dr. Bronner's soap here,

1555
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,070
and they supply it at the shower house,

1556
00:56:16,230 --> 00:56:17,890
so avail yourself

1557
00:56:17,890 --> 00:56:20,030
from the free dispensers

1558
00:56:20,030 --> 00:56:21,930
in the shower house. You'll also enjoy

1559
00:56:21,930 --> 00:56:24,190
reading the bottle. Not only do you get this excellent soap, but you get

1560
00:56:24,190 --> 00:56:25,710
some of the best reading material

1561
00:56:26,270 --> 00:56:28,450
outside of the book of the subgenius.

1562
00:56:28,570 --> 00:56:30,190
It's almost like the book of the

1563
00:56:30,190 --> 00:56:32,210
subgenius, as you read the outside of

1564
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:33,130
this incredibly

1565
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:35,890
highly lettered soap bottle.

1566
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:37,550
Okay, okay, slack, slack.

1567
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:39,590
In fact, certain key

1568
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:41,330
subgenius, uh,

1569
00:56:41,690 --> 00:56:44,250
well, not doctrine, but ways of stating

1570
00:56:44,250 --> 00:56:46,190
it were lifted directly

1571
00:56:46,190 --> 00:56:48,450
from Dr. Bronner's

1572
00:56:48,450 --> 00:56:50,150
essays on his soap

1573
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:52,250
bottles. Now, once again. I'm sure most of you are familiar

1574
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,630
with these, and if you're not,

1575
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:56,270
hide thee up to that shower house

1576
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:57,750
now and read them.

1577
00:56:57,910 --> 00:57:00,150
And while you're at it, take a

1578
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:01,230
refreshing shower.

1579
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,950
Please. But, uh, you know,

1580
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:06,110
we do not so much steal,

1581
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:08,370
as synthesize this material

1582
00:57:08,370 --> 00:57:09,830
which we get from all

1583
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:11,930
points of the compass. Because

1584
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:13,990
we don't present it as our own,

1585
00:57:14,110 --> 00:57:16,150
but we mix it up with a lot of stuff.

1586
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:18,410
And that's what makes it our own.

1587
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:20,210
It's a little bit like the mama bird

1588
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:22,230
who chews up the worm

1589
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,190
and then spits it back out again

1590
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,230
for the baby birds. Because those

1591
00:57:26,230 --> 00:57:28,210
little conspiracy, uh, chicks

1592
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:29,970
have not yet developed a

1593
00:57:29,970 --> 00:57:31,410
horny beak to

1594
00:57:31,410 --> 00:57:34,430
slash through their fodder.

1595
00:57:34,590 --> 00:57:36,250
It is this tendency to assimilate

1596
00:57:36,270 --> 00:57:38,290
that makes it impossible, it makes it

1597
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:40,490
virtually impossible, to resist

1598
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:41,990
Bob, for resistance

1599
00:57:41,990 --> 00:57:44,050
is futile. Well, Bob's

1600
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:46,390
power is like the warmth of the sun

1601
00:57:46,390 --> 00:57:48,130
rather than the blowing

1602
00:57:48,130 --> 00:57:50,250
of the wind. Bob beams

1603
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,050
and radiates and ultimately

1604
00:57:52,050 --> 00:57:54,130
must be accepted and cannot be

1605
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:56,270
avoided. But at the same time,

1606
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,330
does Bob also, not unlike

1607
00:57:58,330 --> 00:57:59,690
the sun, burn

1608
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:02,390
and scorch? And then there are those

1609
00:58:02,390 --> 00:58:04,370
troublesome sunspots. He will burn

1610
00:58:04,370 --> 00:58:05,930
away all that which will not

1611
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:08,150
be assimilated. He will

1612
00:58:08,150 --> 00:58:10,330
burn everything down to the quick

1613
00:58:10,330 --> 00:58:11,730
and what's left will be pure.

1614
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,150
Will he burn you, my

1615
00:58:14,150 --> 00:58:16,210
friend? Well,

1616
00:58:16,570 --> 00:58:18,110
some people would say, hey, he burned

1617
00:58:18,110 --> 00:58:19,890
me the day I spent thirty dollars.

1618
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,710
And of course... They lack vision.

1619
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:23,910
The day that X-Day

1620
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:26,210
does arrive, it might be this, uh,

1621
00:58:26,210 --> 00:58:27,850
7 a.m., uh,

1622
00:58:28,110 --> 00:58:30,310
July 5th, it might be

1623
00:58:30,310 --> 00:58:32,270
tomorrow! It might be in five minutes.

1624
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:33,750
Now, wouldn't that be...

1625
00:58:34,270 --> 00:58:35,950
That'd throw everything out of order. Now, there is this little problem.

1626
00:58:36,270 --> 00:58:38,130
Of, uh, panicking

1627
00:58:38,130 --> 00:58:40,110
when you see your fellow

1628
00:58:40,110 --> 00:58:41,630
subgeniuses and yourself

1629
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:44,110
suddenly burst, screaming

1630
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:45,210
into flames.

1631
00:58:46,370 --> 00:58:48,050
Don't worry, you're simply

1632
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:50,130
casting off the old shell.

1633
00:58:50,430 --> 00:58:52,150
That's right. You'll gain a new body

1634
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:54,250
or at least a brain in a

1635
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,330
tank aboard the escape saucers.

1636
00:58:56,410 --> 00:58:58,350
It will seem like your own panic.

1637
00:58:58,390 --> 00:58:59,510
Your dreams come true.

1638
00:58:59,890 --> 00:59:02,010
And, uh, so

1639
00:59:02,010 --> 00:59:04,090
it's like casting off

1640
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:06,030
an old shoe. So if you find yourself...

1641
00:59:06,270 --> 00:59:08,110
You don't need that body anymore. You're gonna have

1642
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:09,990
a new, improved version

1643
00:59:09,990 --> 00:59:12,190
of everything. So if you find yourself reaching a

1644
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:14,010
high temperature in the upward, uh,

1645
00:59:14,110 --> 00:59:15,930
area of 1300 degrees Fahrenheit,

1646
00:59:16,130 --> 00:59:18,210
uh, and your, uh, skin,

1647
00:59:18,390 --> 00:59:19,810
uh, burning off into ashes,

1648
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:21,810
do not panic. This is completely normal.

1649
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:24,030
It's

1650
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:26,090
not necessarily going to be a

1651
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:28,070
cakewalk, a walk in the park.

1652
00:59:28,170 --> 00:59:30,690
It might hurt. So what? Boo-hoo-hoo.

1653
00:59:30,930 --> 00:59:32,110
It's worth it for
