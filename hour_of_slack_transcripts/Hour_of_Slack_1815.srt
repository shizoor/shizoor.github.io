1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
Let me tell you something right now.

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,960
You keep talking, you're gonna talk your way right into jail.

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:09,120
The Self Genius Power of Science.

4
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:10,460
That's illegal.

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,640
Now just keep on talking.

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,180
Talk yourself right into jail.

7
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,580
The jails are full of guys that don't know when to keep their mouths shut.

8
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:20,380
The Self Genius Power of Science.

9
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:23,820
I was driving to a sanitarium, 25 Colorado Mass,

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,120
I sold it tonight to go out and get some booze, you know.

11
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,080
And I'm getting tired of the whole situation.

12
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:31,440
So I don't know, they better do something fast.

13
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:33,240
You take your time to talk.

14
00:00:33,380 --> 00:00:35,040
And what happens to it's gonna happen to you.

15
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:38,320
All the people I meet and talk to, all the places I go,

16
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,260
no one's ever walked up to me and said, hey, you wanna buy some cigarettes?

17
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:47,080
Remember me, Ruben, in a little while.

18
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,040
I'm gonna drop my phone.

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,340
Put it in the toilet.

20
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:54,680
Walking in the sunshine, sing a little sunshine song.

21
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,060
Can't sit in the sun.

22
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:58,540
I'm gonna negotiate.

23
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,320
I did it.

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,440
You don't do the wrong, you feel terrible, like you're gonna die.

25
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:03,860
And I know all the reasons for it.

26
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,100
I know every single reason for it.

27
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,120
Then you have the basic honk.

28
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,460
And the goose honk.

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:21,480
I'll be giving to every adult in the service.

30
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,960
Where are Donald and that shoe?

31
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:29,900
Hello?

32
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,980
Just what you call it.

33
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,860
You're just able to pick it up in a hurry.

34
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:37,400
Yo, yo, yo.

35
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,740
I've been thinking about all day long.

36
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,900
Because every day becoming much more practical for my inspiration.

37
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,060
But I'm fascinated to know that.

38
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,460
No way could you get that happy face.

39
00:01:51,460 --> 00:01:55,580
I'm feeling when you are stealing that extra ball.

40
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,840
Bob, what a relief.

41
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,700
How you doing tonight?

42
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,900
His name is Bob.

43
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:04,800
Bob is not the illegitimate son of Michael Jackson.

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,780
Take it from me.

45
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,240
Billy G is not Mr. Bob.

46
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,680
Come on, how many?

47
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,200
Come on, Bob.

48
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:12,960
How many posts do you think is good Michael?

49
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,560
Bob.

50
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,180
Come on, Bob.

51
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,020
Come on.

52
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,440
Will seven be enough, Bob?

53
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:20,360
They call him Bob Doves.

54
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:21,340
Yeah.

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:21,440
Bob Doves.

56
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,440


57
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,440


58
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,440


59
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,440


60
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:21,440


61
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,000
Yeah, I call him Bobo.

62
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,820
He was the leather man at a time when leather was nothing but wingtip shoes.

63
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,780
He led the way, brothers.

64
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,460
He was a lonely pioneer in those days.

65
00:02:33,460 --> 00:02:34,040
Ah, the 50s.

66
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:34,560
I remember.

67
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:38,960
At first, a frivolous, sore-footed shoe salesman.

68
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,900
One day he was a tinkering with a television set of his own design when he messed around

69
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,760
with the back and got himself a huge shock through the coil that we call the divine immaculation.

70
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:51,420
But you know his very name was Bob.

71
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,360
Bob Doves spawned a bornite in a upper bölter Appreciate it.

72
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,880
Bye-bye,So�'er.

73
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,440
See ya later.

74
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:58,620
Covid

75
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:58,620

00:02:59,940 --> 00:02:59,940


78
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,220
Goo-Urgh Far-H London

79
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,540
Because of continues fungus

80
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,160
Or died

81
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,840

00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,100


85
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,400
For a

86
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:16,000
To go

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000


88
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,000


89
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:19,600

00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:19,760
Do

91
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,380
Either

92
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:20,980
Or

93
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,880
with a tiny,

94
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,400
tiddling poodle.

95
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,860
She gave him comfort

96
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,560
and sheltered him

97
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,520
in a tree

98
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,100
to rest safely

99
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,220
until needed

100
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:33,120
by the show once more.

101
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,720
What's going on here?

102
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:38,700
Yeah, why don't we?

103
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,980
It's later than you think.

104
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:43,060
Aye, the terrible

105
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,020
spittin' vengeance

106
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,640
of Bob's mighty staff

107
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:46,840
shall scour clean

108
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,520
this planet

109
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,680
and the all-pervading

110
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,980
radioactive pastiche

111
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:50,900
of his boundless

112
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:51,900
supernatural love.

113
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,140
Wake up,

114
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,160
open your heart,

115
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,260
drop your pants,

116
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,080
close your mind

117
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,840
and bend over

118
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,560
because he'll be

119
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,660
kicking and taking names,

120
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,440
dear brothers and sisters.

121
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,620
He'll be struggling

122
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,460
and gasping.

123
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,480
His face will turn blue.

124
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,580
Then Bob will pitch over

125
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,120
on the floor

126
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,320
in the grip

127
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,040
of a massive

128
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,360
coronary thrombosis.

129
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,580
And we will be there

130
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:11,440
to see that event

131
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,320
and to record it for you.

132
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,620
And that's the way

133
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:15,620


134
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,680
As it was at the beginning

135
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,320
of time.

136
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,420
Come on,

137
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,640
I saw a man

138
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,340
with a pop and a grin

139
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,260
all in the new morning light.

140
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,740
Grinning.

141
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,840
Come on, sing along now.

142
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,920
Grinning with me

143
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:30,080
like a mad man

144
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,560
and he made me uptight.

145
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,760
I told him

146
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,600
don't bother me anymore

147
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,520
but he kept on

148
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,720
just the same

149
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,080
till I was totally brainwashed.

150
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,760
Bob is his name.

151
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,680
He's the ring.

152
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,760
Bob is my story.

153
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,800
Bob is my song.

154
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,780
Bob's my amphetamine.

155
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,620
All the day long.

156
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,620
Doo doo doo doo.

157
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,360
I won't tear my poster

158
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,040
of Dobbs down.

159
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,760
I'll feel no sadness or shame

160
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,040
till I behold him in Dobbs town.

161
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,900
Bob is his name.

162
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,340
Doo doo doo doo doo doo.

163
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,580
He has no lack

164
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,300
of his patented slack

165
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:23,280
for those of his following fold.

166
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,520
He is the friend

167
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,340
of whoever will send

168
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,140
greenbacks or gold.

169
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,540
Doo doo doo doo doo.

170
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,040
He's growing stronger

171
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,440
and stronger.

172
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,600
He'll get all the credit

173
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,460
and blame.

174
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:41,340
I'll be a big boy no longer.

175
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,380
Bob is his name.

176
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,640
Doo doo doo doo doo.

177
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:47,320
Yes, it is a sad name.

178
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:47,320


179
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:47,540
I fail.

180
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,760
Bob's bigger than your Bob.

181
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,960
My Bob's bigger than yours.

182
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,120
My Bob's bigger than your big Bob.

183
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,080
My Bob's better than yours.

184
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:56,520
Huh!

185
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,860
Watch out.

186
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,100
The Bob, it's loose.

187
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,220
It's coming this way.

188
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,840
Back!

189
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,280
Back!

190
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,160
I created you.

191
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:02,640
Back!

192
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,200
Back!

193
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:13,020
After all, we are depending from J.R. Bob Dobbs' divine

194
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:13,960
immaculation.

195
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,360
All information was revealed.

196
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:19,140
The Dobbs in this blinding flash of knowledge,

197
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,640
which occurred, as every true subgenius

198
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,880
and every schoolboy knows,

199
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,200
when he was working back in the 50s

200
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,800
on an experimental television set

201
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,600
of his own design.

202
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,260
The transmitter was 100% redundant.

203
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:32,800
He was messing around with the back of a TV set

204
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,560
and it was suddenly immaculated.

205
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,480
Amplifier and multiplex the oral and visual.

206
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,060
Don't give it away.

207
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:37,680
Don't tell them.

208
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,300
Let them figure it out for themselves.

209
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,640
Bob arrived at the mountaintop location.

210
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,380
He found the transmitter to be operating properly.

211
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,660
Normally, it would return a system to standard operating.

212
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,940
Oh, you're giving away church secrets.

213
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,040
This is nuts, huh?

214
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Don't listen to him.

215
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,100
He's giving away church secrets.

216
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:54,180
Uh, uh, uh, uh, don't listen, don't listen, don't listen.

217
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,320
The transmitter designed this stuck contact

218
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,620
to be found through visual interaction.

219
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,300
Does Alice figure any of this?

220
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:02,260
Alice?

221
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:04,020
Alice, with the pink laser beam.

222
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:04,640
Alice?

223
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:05,740
I don't know Alice.

224
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:06,400
Alice, Alice.

225
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,000
The visual transmitter associated with 22KV...

226
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,860
Ah, you're fading out.

227
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,820
You can't triangulate on your signal.

228
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,280
Speak into the rectifier.

229
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,640
Unfortunately, the visual network

230
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,020
and the neural network are not in order.

231
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,380
The power supplies are identical in appearance.

232
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,740
I don't know how long this static storm is going to continue.

233
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,220
The high voltage contactor is stuck in the opposition.

234
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,620
I'm out of contact.

235
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,200
He's out of control.

236
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,280
He's got a mind of his own.

237
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,520
Yes, that used to happen a lot on the Puzzling Evidence Show.

238
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:40,740
What do you expect from a radio station in Berkeley like KPFA?

239
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,120
Of course, we don't have that problem here at Hour of Slack,

240
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,880
because we don't have a radio station.

241
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:50,480
What we have is a radio studio high in this tree,

242
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,340
made entirely of rock, stick, and beast,

243
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,080
which is why it's called Tarzan's Radio Studio.

244
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:03,440
Our background music for credits tonight is the Psychoskeletons,

245
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,100
a bit called Cubist OCD Ritual.

246
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,940
And now, a word from our sponsor.

247
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,100
Located in the heart of the Earth,

248
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,900
located in the basement of the Donut King Drive-In,

249
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,580
is a new and unique dining experience,

250
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:20,800
freeway close, but far enough to work up one heck of an appetite.

251
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:24,840
It's Vincent Tomein's Leg of the Crow Restaurant.

252
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,460
Yes, Leg of the Crow.

253
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:29,440
Dining au naturel, nude and informal,

254
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,740
as it was in Rome before the tourists came.

255
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,840
Vincent Tomein's Leg of the Crow Restroom,

256
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,460
where your host Vincent is ever ready to tickle your palate with a golden feather,

257
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,460
and the bathroom's just a quick drop down the hall.

258
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,120
Leg of the Crow,

259
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:47,740
where the salad's tossed at you, not at your table,

260
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:52,460
and sharing dessert with a stranger is almost a way of life.

261
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:55,020
And if you want to drink your dinner and dunk your date,

262
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,980
there's a wine list that'd make a Greek burp.

263
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:00,900
Squeezed fresh at your table in an aluminum thumb screw,

264
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,140
just like Daddy used to do.

265
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,980
Whet your whistle with these fine selections.

266
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:10,640
Chablis, Beau Cholet, Nippon Cadet, Cabernet, Sauvignon, and Pinot Noir.

267
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,380
Red, white, blue, any year.

268
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:15,300
You name it, we print it, you drink it at

269
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:18,120
Vincent Tomein's Leg of the Crow Restaurant.

270
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,520
Conveniently located near the medical center,

271
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,900
color TV in every room,

272
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:26,800
phonetically translated, real French menu,

273
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:31,760
food to go, and free doggy bags supplied with every order of Vietnamese food.

274
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,400
At Vincent Tomein's domain,

275
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,440
the crippled crow.

276
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:39,160
And remember, you only live once,

277
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,820
but you have to eat,

278
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,400
every day.

279
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,640
Hey!

280
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,240
Little bit loud, okay.

281
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:57,000
I guess this is the end of the night where it's the new year.

282
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,000
And I should do a bit of reflection over the last year.

283
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:04,120
You know, a lot of stuff has changed.

284
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,880
A lot of things are different.

285
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:08,240
And they continually keep on changing.

286
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,200
Sometimes that's for the best,

287
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,780
sometimes it's for the worst.

288
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:17,060
But I can tell you this,

289
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:21,120
2020 was a shitty and great year,

290
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:21,980
all in one.

291
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:27,960
2021 has won in it.

292
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,300
And if 2020 was a shitty great year,

293
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,080
but all in one,

294
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,160
maybe 2021 will be the best year ever.

295
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:37,040
I don't know, who cares?

296
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,160
We all just wake up and act like we're just normal people anyways.

297
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:47,080
Like everyone acts like they just jump up

298
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:49,460
and their clothes are magically attached to them

299
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,980
like they're in some sort of video game.

300
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,220
No, that's not how it works.

301
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,920
You wake up and you walk around and you go,

302
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,640
oi, oi, oi, and aye, aye, aye.

303
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:59,480
And you just pop your pants on and then you go to work.

304
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:04,800
And you're super mad about life until the caffeine kicks in.

305
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:06,740
And then you're like, ah,

306
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,820
I'm going to die.

307
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:08,840
All right.

308
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,740
Well, I guess this is my day.

309
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,040
I actually had a good day today.

310
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:19,380
I hadn't had a good day at my conspiracy job in a long time.

311
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,020
And today was actually really great.

312
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,400
And it made me wonder what's going to happen next.

313
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:28,080
Who knows?

314
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,980
Hello, Moonbase.

315
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:42,040
It's been a really long time since we've heard from you.

316
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:49,220
Our diagnostic shows response times are slow.

317
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,920
And you're feeling blue.

318
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:59,260
We have made a plan.

319
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:02,240
As best we can.

320
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:07,300
Are there any surviving technicians that could lend a hand?

321
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,240
We'll send someone else to sort this out.

322
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,280
Worst case scenario, we'll just pull the cord.

323
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,000
You're not alone.

324
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:30,100
No, you're far from home.

325
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:32,220
You're not alone.

326
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,220


327
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,220


328
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,300
But you do have your friends, new employees, friends, and friends.

329
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,400
And they might be necessary, a little bit.

330
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,220
Sometimes it's key to do balance.

331
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:51,740


332
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:51,740


333
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:51,940
It's prたい делать.

334
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,940
Boris.

335
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:53,060
Are you still in the responses?

336
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:53,840
How do we get your investigationฅ?

337
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:53,860


338
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:53,860


339
00:12:53,860 --> 00:13:00,660
I'm hoping that we can all answer either of your questions clearance vive la mese chegou

340
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:05,640
It was when those egghead scientists wanted to send me into space

341
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:13,460
They said the supercomputer that runs the whole works up there had gone catawampus on them

342
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:20,460
They needed me to take a rocket to the moon and see if I could get it working again

343
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:23,520
Reboot it, they said

344
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:26,900
But here's what I told them

345
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,300
I won't work in space, no, I just won't work in space

346
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:42,660
I'll work the land, I'll work it out, but I'll never work in space

347
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:50,100
I won't work in space, no, I just won't work in space

348
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:54,740
I said it before, I'll say it again

349
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:56,880
I'll never work in space

350
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:57,380
I'll never work in space

351
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,660
They didn't want to take no for an answer

352
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:04,780
But there are a set of rules that I live by

353
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,300
Rule seven is always return your shopping cart

354
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,940
But rule five is don't do work in space

355
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,960
I won't work in space, no, I just won't work in space

356
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:24,460
I'll work from home and burn the midnight oil

357
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:26,880
But I'll never work from space

358
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:26,880


359
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:26,880


360
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:26,880


361
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,520
It's too cold up there

362
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:34,600
I won't work in space, no, I just won't work in space

363
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,080
It doesn't hurt, Bill

364
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,180
A lick of work never hurt no one

365
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,740
But I'll never work from space

366
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,080
Now I'm not proud of everything that went down after that

367
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:51,600
They really wanted to send me to the moon

368
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,280
Let's just say I didn't end up going to space

369
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:56,880
And I'm not proud of everything that went down after that

370
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:03,900
I won't work in space, no, I just won't work in space

371
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:08,500
I'll learn a trade, I'll toil away

372
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,280
But I'll never work in space

373
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:19,060
I won't work in space, no, I just won't work in space

374
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:23,400
I'll bust my buns and still have some fun

375
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:26,020
But I'll never work in space

376
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:33,440
I won't work in space, no, I just won't work in space

377
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,080
I'll swap the deck and write some scripts on spec

378
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,820
But I'll never work in space

379
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,160
I'll be gone forever

380
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,080
They say we live on forever

381
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,740
In the hearts and memories of those we know

382
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,880
And I don't have a heart

383
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,720
And I'm not programmed to have a soul

384
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,100
In my memory of the soul

385
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,860
In my memory of the soul

386
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:26,000
In my memory of the soul

387
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:53,920
And that was a piece called Moonbase Suite

388
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,880
by Reverend Morgan Glutentag.

389
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:59,480
I agree with the theme of that song.

390
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,920
I will not work or even party in space

391
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:05,740
if it involves vehicles made by Earthmen.

392
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,700
Before that, we heard a little commentary

393
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,060
by Reverend Negative

394
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,840
and some classic Firesign Theater

395
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,460
from their first radio shows.

396
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:18,160
Hey, I just thought of something.

397
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,480
Why are butts hidden behind us?

398
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,600
Why can't we have butts

399
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,040
on both sides?

400
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:29,380
Sure, that's like eyes in the back of your head.

401
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,880
These mud-gobbling giant worms

402
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:36,860
which live on the edge of volcanic vents

403
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,560
gorging themselves on massive, huge piles of mud.

404
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,740
Just like those tremor worms.

405
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:46,080
Just like the ones in Dune.

406
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,980
Only this mud is wet.

407
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,980
This is truly wet mud.

408
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:53,580
Not like the ones in Dune.

409
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,980
Not like the kind of mud we used to have

410
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,000
back when we were kids.

411
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,000
It was dry mud.

412
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,880
We used to have to make mud pies

413
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,720
and to make them stick together

414
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,980
we had to spit on them.

415
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,560
We'd have dirt in one hand

416
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,460
and a big pile of spit in the other hand

417
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,300
and we'd roll them together

418
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,180
until we had us a good mud pie.

419
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,500
And that was the only thing we had

420
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:14,260
for moisture back in those days.

421
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:15,900
Just spit.

422
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,780
We didn't have candy back then either.

423
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,240
We had to just take a bag of sugar

424
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,560
and carry it around.

425
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:23,560


426
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:23,560


427
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,580
We carried around a big old five pound bag of sugar

428
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,540
in our back pocket.

429
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,560
A big old tablespoon.

430
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,800
And when we needed some candy

431
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,900
we just stuck it into the bag

432
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,200
and just took about four or five big tablespoons

433
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:36,840
shoveled it down

434
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:39,800
and that was all we had for candy back in those days.

435
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,820
Each one genetically engineered

436
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,580
to make a difference.

437
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:47,660
Now when a worm dines on one of these babies

438
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,280
you gotta have

439
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,960
those worms have to have lamps

440
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,720
to see underground

441
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,280
when they're eating through the dirt like that.

442
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,020
They carry little like little miners helmets

443
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:01,260
that let them mine through the dirt.

444
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:03,200
They're chewing, chewing, chewing, chewing.

445
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:05,220
Chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp, chomp.

446
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:07,560
They chew away, chew away, chew away, chew away.

447
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:10,740
Oh, I can't see where I'm going said Mr. Worm

448
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:13,060
and he looked ahead and he had his little pointed

449
00:19:13,060 --> 00:19:15,880
yellow helmet on

450
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,820
shining the way into the back of the goose

451
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:21,440
as it were.

452
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,500
The terrific.

453
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:23,880
The end of the goose

454
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,700
was a Cretaceous flying reptile.

455
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,500
Flying.

456
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:27,940
They thought it was a reptile

457
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,280
but actually it was a bird.

458
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,620
It was a bird.

459
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:34,700
They found that it was only a simple bird.

460
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:36,280
It was a bird like reptile.

461
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,180
Its body was only that

462
00:19:37,180 --> 00:19:39,060
the size of a goose.

463
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:42,760
And yet its wings were 900 feet wide

464
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,360
at their widest proportion.

465
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,700
27 feet or 30 actually.

466
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:48,540
Where's Bozo?

467
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,780
Larger specimens recently discovered.

468
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,760
What the heck is...

469
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,700
It's the Twinkies.

470
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:52,920
Twinkie bike.

471
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:55,600
What a wonderful, wonderful Twinkie bike.

472
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,020
And so the Twinkie bike headed out

473
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,800
through the desert carrying the little show people.

474
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,320
They asked me about...

475
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:02,540
Twinkie bike, Twinkie bike.

476
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:05,160
They asked me about Twinkies on my show

477
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:08,000
and they asked what the ingredients were.

478
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,060
Of course all I could tell them was...

479
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:10,780
That's when I got fillies.

480
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:14,500
Golden sponge cake and creamy fillings.

481
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,360
That's all you need to know.

482
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,340
You don't need to know anything more than...

483
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:21,220
That is all on earth you know and all you need.

484
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,700
I will enter that into the...

485
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,500
I'm gonna get that.

486
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,300
...golden life.

487
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,580
That's good enough for Thor.

488
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,380
That's good enough for me.

489
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:27,780
The United States of sponge.

490
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:30,660
...a creamy soft whipped...

491
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:33,780
Yes little caller, you have won the United States of sponge.

492
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,600
...filling everywhere in the valley...

493
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,160
As we continue to look for your requested songs...

494
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:40,120
...from the valley of Brazil...

495
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:43,420
...the commercial songs of the United States of sponge.

496
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:47,320
...from within the confines of its donut-like home.

497
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,500
Thank you Philo, Hal and Doug.

498
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,520
Other Doug.

499
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:52,680
Did you know?

500
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,900
That at one time, very early in its history...

501
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:57,980
...the church of the subgenius was one-third Doug's?

502
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,900
In its first month, basically anyway.

503
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:05,880
From the new collection of old Fireside Theater stuff...

504
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:07,780
...dope humor of the 70s...

505
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:10,460
...here's one of my very favorite bits...

506
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:13,240
...from the Dear Friends show and album.

507
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,460
It's Phil Proctor mostly.

508
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,940
It's all bluff from top to bottom.

509
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,080
Here's Pat Bluff, former governor of the state of Arizona...

510
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,800
...who's with us on our show, Policeman Meet the Nation.

511
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:28,640
Yeah, just to me, studying it...

512
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,440
...it looks like the whole system of life is bluff.

513
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:35,380
A man just bluffs himself out of the cradle onto the floor...

514
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,300
...just bluffs his legs into carrying him around...

515
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,680
...when he gets sick of crawling...

516
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:43,920
...and he gets to it and yaps and bluffs his mama into carrying him.

517
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,100
Hey Sam, can I ask you a question?

518
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:45,320
Yeah.

519
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,920
What does that mean what you just said?

520
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,800
I didn't understand a word of it. It's poetic.

521
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,220
I worked it all out...

522
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:50,560
You did?

523
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,080
...over 65 years.

524
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,600
That's a distillation...

525
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:53,780
It's all bluff.

526
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,960
That's a distillation of 65 years of philosophy, Sam.

527
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,840
It ain't no difference, young nor old.

528
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,420
We just start right in to bluff somebody from the first...

529
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:05,100
...if it's only to yap when we're brought into the world...

530
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,080
...as if we hate it and wish to get out of it quick.

531
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,260
Sam, look at that fellow over there, right?

532
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:10,740
Yeah, he's Cor...

533
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,000
He's just gotten to Corrin, right?

534
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:12,760
Yeah, hi, look at him.

535
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,200
Hey, look at him.

536
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,420
Ain't that the biggest bluff of all?

537
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,320
Well, I think he gets...

538
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,800
...you know, he gets right along with some female girl...

539
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:20,160
...and he pitches her some yawns and some yams by himself...

540
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,820
...such a thing as the blush of the shame...

541
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,140
...to the features of George Washington.

542
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,460
Yeah, he makes her believe he's just what every fella...

543
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,920
...of her sense knows he ain't...

544
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,320
...and she, bluffing herself like mad...

545
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:32,500
...bluffs herself into believing she believes what he believes...

546
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:35,360
...she believes what nobody else believes about him...

547
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,940
...that he's filling her up with truth, see?

548
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:39,720
Now I understand what you're saying, Sam.

549
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:39,980
Yeah, sure.

550
00:22:39,980 --> 00:22:41,400
Now you're talking university talk.

551
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,960
Think about when they have kids, then.

552
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:44,440
The kids come along, right?

553
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:46,400
And he's got to bluff harder than ever.

554
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:48,940
But kiddies take a heap of bluffing, Sam.

555
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,140
They do.

556
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,040
They sure do.

557
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,140
I didn't say you got six of them.

558
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,680
You have to bluff six times as hard, then.

559
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:52,820
I know.

560
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:55,540
It drains every ounce of laugh force out of my body.

561
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,940
You have to buff their shoes, make sure they're shining.

562
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,440
Shine their head so the planes will see them and not land on them.

563
00:22:59,500 --> 00:22:59,560
That's right.

564
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:01,640
I had a plane land on two of my sons yesterday.

565
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,380
You did, eh?

566
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,660
Makes me laugh, too. I saw it.

567
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:04,720
Well, they're just plane kids.

568
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:05,360
Yeah, that's right.

569
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,420
Passing plane came right by, took the top...

570
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:08,200
Well, go ahead.

571
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:10,300
Anyway, you go on like this, Charlie.

572
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,320
Like I've been going on.

573
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,600
Like you've been going on...

574
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,380
...till death gets around, see?

575
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:14,760
That's all right.

576
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:14,920
You're sick.

577
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:15,640
Coughing.

578
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:17,400
Sick and coughing. Coughing is the word.

579
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:21,220
You can't bluff death, which is the reason you gotta get off the earth.

580
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,680
When you're fixed that way, other folks come along and bluff you, see?

581
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,600
What about your friends?

582
00:23:25,660 --> 00:23:28,160
Sam, your friends go around and tell you that they're...

583
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,980
You know, they heap a sorry.

584
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:31,560
And the kids come and they make you feel like you've treated them bully

585
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,620
and acted sugar and square with them.

586
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:35,760
The gal you bluffed in the interim, she gets around and snivels.

587
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,000
The doctor bluffs, the preacher bluffs, the president bluffs, the snifter bluffs.

588
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:40,840
Then death gets a drop on you.

589
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,260
Yeah, yeah.

590
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,320
You go right down and out.

591
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,100
Right down and out.

592
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,780
Everything's bluffed, sir.

593
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,620
To your left.

594
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:45,760
To your left.

595
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,580
Until you get up again in the muzzle of a gun like this.

596
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,140
Then your thumbs get up quick and you bluff yourself that bluff is one of them things

597
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:56,680
you'd hate like poison to hand out to a blind mule, whatever that means.

598
00:23:56,980 --> 00:23:57,600
Yeah, right.

599
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:58,920
But you agree with me, don't you?

600
00:23:58,980 --> 00:23:59,860
Because I got a gun on you.

601
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,960
You got a finger on me.

602
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:03,520
I respect a finger more than I respect a gun.

603
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,300
That's the point.

604
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:06,680
You can stick my eye out with that, but I've never seen anybody hurt with a gun.

605
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,980
I'm pointing you with this sharp fingernail.

606
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,320
Yeah, with a heavy ring on it, too.

607
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:09,480
All bluff.

608
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,060
So I really respect the heavy ring finger.

609
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:11,160
All bluff.

610
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:11,900
Yeah, right.

611
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:13,140
That's the ring of doom, though.

612
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:13,680
I know that.

613
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:14,220
I know that.

614
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:16,140
I know that.

615
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:16,880


616
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:21,960
The Church of the Sub-Seniors has revealed that the world will end onto a fifth.

617
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,880
1998.

618
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:28,300
Prepare yourselves, therefore, and send one bar to sub-seniors.com.

619
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,760
The legions are growing.

620
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:33,080
My name is Legion.

621
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,560
Yours is...

622
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,660
Hey.

623
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:36,400
Yours is...

624
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,700
Is Mr. Legion here?

625
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:39,680
Sir, you're...

626
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,220
Pageant Mr. Legion.

627
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:42,680
...the Keeper of Doom is dissapearing in five seconds.

628
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,000
Did you say your name was Legion?

629
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:45,620
Legion?

630
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:45,860
Sir?

631
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:48,720
No, I said my name was...

632
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,400
Repetition is the key to the bandaged head.

633
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,780
Repetition is the key to art.

634
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,140
Repetition is the key to redundancy.

635
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:02,380
Repetition...

636
00:25:02,380 --> 00:25:07,860
It is the key to learning and to dubstaff.

637
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:15,500
And as the great gates open up and the high priestess ushers Dave in...

638
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,540
...and the great light sings, she was a woman.

639
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,240
And she was the light that the dark she was wearing a lei and a sound dress.

640
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:28,380
And she said she was related to the great light singer Ema Sumac, if you could imagine

641
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,360
such a thing.

642
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:34,520
But there she was in her zip-up top, and her head was all zipped up, believe me.

643
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:35,780
There wasn't a part showing.

644
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:41,920
And there was no sunshine coming through the back door either, the way old Mammy and Pappy

645
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,700
down on the farm used to sprinkle.

646
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,480
She was quick.

647
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,480


648
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,480


649
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,480


650
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,480


651
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,480


652
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,480


653
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,480


654
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:45,480


655
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,560
to the mug, 100%.

656
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,480
But they said they were going to still

657
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,680
have to do a few things.

658
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,680
So she led us around. We had a few eggnogs.

659
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,740
We stood and watched the trees burn.

660
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,080
And then we

661
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:59,280
entered the actual inner center

662
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,240
center sanctorum of Domstown

663
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,200
itself. It was

664
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:03,720
beautiful.

665
00:26:07,600 --> 00:26:08,600
Look at those

666
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:10,900
gigantic sculpted

667
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:13,220
statues carved from the

668
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,280
native volcanic rock.

669
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,100
They look like

670
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,120
famous subgenius radio personalities.

671
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,040
What's that bald-headed one?

672
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,820
That's Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

673
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,400
And look, the one with the giant lips.

674
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,540
That's Dances

675
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,600
with Rockets. And that really handsome

676
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,580
one, isn't that supposed to be Reverend Stag?

677
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,500
The mountain itself, by God,

678
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,400
I just realized, it's carved

679
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:38,640
into a gigantic

680
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,300
gob's head.

681
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,880
The size of 10 Mount Rushmore.

682
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,400
Try this chocolate phosphate

683
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,100
drinking fountain. It's free.

684
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,480
Oh my God, it's delicious

685
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,280
and it's psychoactive, too.

686
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,540
I can feel my...

687
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:54,520
I can feel everything. I can feel my knees.

688
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,760
I can feel my sandwiches.

689
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,740
I can hear sandwiches in my back pocket.

690
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,840
They're speaking to me,

691
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,160
Stanley.

692
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,480
Learn from the sandwiches.

693
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,800
Feel of your sandwich,

694
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,060
Dave. Feel of it.

695
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:11,040
On and off the road

696
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:12,560
to Bob's

697
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:13,780
club.

698
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,940
We are marching

699
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,160
forward

700
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,440
blind.

701
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,080
He has gouged out

702
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,880
both our eyes.

703
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,300
And he's laughing

704
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,680
close behind.

705
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:33,580
He will sell us

706
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:36,000
back our eyes

707
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,560
when we join

708
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:39,880
his noble

709
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:41,480
plan.

710
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:43,880
For just

711
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:46,900
$19.95

712
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,440
and a taste

713
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:51,780
of our

714
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,220
woodland.

715
00:27:57,380 --> 00:28:00,340
On and off the road

716
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,960
with Bob,

717
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,780
he has handed

718
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,180
us

719
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,600
the wheel.

720
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:11,020
And he cuddles

721
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:11,880
up with

722
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:12,860
Bob.

723
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:13,340
Ah!

724
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,620
As he

725
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,220
counts

726
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,220
his

727
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:17,860
sal-

728
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:18,720
a-

729
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:19,340
feel.

730
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,140
Our eyes

731
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,440
are on

732
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,960
the road.

733
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:27,820
But Bob

734
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:28,980
forgot

735
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:30,600
to say

736
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,000
that the

737
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,800
steering

738
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,640
wheel went

739
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,660
fast.

740
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,020
The road

741
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:39,900
carries

742
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:41,020
us

743
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:42,180
away.

744
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:49,440
On and off the road

745
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,780
for Bob,

746
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:53,320
we forgot

747
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,940
why we came

748
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,800
here.

749
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:59,540
We have quit

750
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:01,700
all of our

751
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:02,440
jobs.

752
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,400
Like a headlight

753
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:08,180
frightened deer.

754
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,240
He has lit

755
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:12,680
the same

756
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:12,860
lights

757
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


758
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


759
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


760
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


761
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


762
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


763
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


764
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


765
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


766
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


767
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


768
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


769
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


770
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


771
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


772
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:12,860


773
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,080
with pipe.

774
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,360
And he's smiling

775
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,240
at us

776
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,220
now.

777
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:24,340
On and off the road

778
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:26,000
he's Bob.

779
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:28,660
He's our

780
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,920
bull dada.

781
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,060
We all

782
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:32,920
miss

783
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:33,660
now.

784
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,100
Woo!

785
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,020
That hurt, Bob.

786
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,260
Bob, where are you?

787
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:42,120
Stop it, Bob.

788
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,720
Please.

789
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:50,100
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy doing all the voices on his song On and Off the Road with Bob.

790
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:56,840
Incidentally, in his fake life, Bleepo is a character actor in Los Angeles named Bill

791
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,560
Cates, and he's really good.

792
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,820
And if you want him for a paying movie or show, I can put you in touch with him.

793
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:10,220
Before that, we heard a little ESO Swamp Radio with Professor Chas, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

794
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,960
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

795
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:18,680
But now, Puzzling Evidence offers a mental exercise for dealing with a very poorly recorded

796
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,720
sermon by the late Dr. Le Guin.

797
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:30,160
The very idea of offing yourself because of some stupid little problem like that makes

798
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:37,180
me think, well, what is a problem that's worthy of killing yourself?

799
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,980
So what I want you to do is imagine that you're a...

800
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:38,980


801
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:39,920
And remind me...

802
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:40,960
And remind me...

803
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:45,840
Imagine that you're in the car with the windshield wipers going, and you're listening

804
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:50,120
to this religious show on the radio.

805
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:51,900
Okay.

806
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:56,000
And you're wondering to yourself, who are these guys?

807
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:56,840
Gotcha.

808
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,860
Okay, I'm there.

809
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:00,200
I'm driving.

810
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,680
I'm beginning to visualize now.

811
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,260
Oh, what?

812
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:08,780
Don't take your eyes off the road, though.

813
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,000
And now I'm in the car with a guy.

814
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,000


815
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,000


816
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,000


817
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,000


818
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,000


819
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,000


820
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,000


821
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,960
I can see it.

822
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:13,700
I can see it.

823
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,860
I can begin to see the beginnings of it.

824
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:18,700
And...

825
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:24,640
Tranks and tucks and sump.

826
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,780
Yeah, that's the kind of stuff we used to listen to on the radio back in the old days,

827
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,120
driving around Texas.

828
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:32,640
You know, Texas.

829
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:36,660
I understand that Texas is about the size of Iraq.

830
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:38,240
Really?

831
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:38,680
Yeah.

832
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:39,940
Is that true?

833
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,980
So when they say, you know, Texas is about the size of Iraq.

834
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:40,980


835
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:40,980


836
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:40,980


837
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:40,980


838
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:43,260
They go in and see if you can find some nukes.

839
00:31:44,280 --> 00:31:48,680
My test would be, well, let's go see if we can hide a suitcase full of nukes in Texas

840
00:31:48,680 --> 00:31:51,700
somewhere and say, now go see if you can find it.

841
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:55,080
We only have the whole state of Texas to do it in.

842
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,880
You know, I think that...

843
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,600
That would work.

844
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,740
You could buy that...

845
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:05,700
You could build an invisibility chamber if you had to and put it into the...

846
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:05,900
Hide it in Texas?

847
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:06,480
And hide it in Texas.

848
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,060
You could put up by Amarillo next to Cadillac Ranch and then...

849
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:10,960
I'd take it.

850
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:11,500
I'd take it out to the...

851
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,100
You just wouldn't see it.

852
00:32:12,220 --> 00:32:18,380
To the Texas Triangle, which is kind of like a different version of the Bermuda Triangle,

853
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:19,700
but on land in Texas.

854
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,720
And I would just put it out in the middle and it would disappear.

855
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:22,660
Wow.

856
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:25,420
Until I needed to find it.

857
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,260
You like them young, Bob?

858
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,800
How old were you when you met Bob?

859
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,040
Bob?

860
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:39,080
Bob is innocent.

861
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,620
It's like they're trying to fill a twisted sadomasochistic fantasy.

862
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:54,100
Some people derive sexual pleasure through inflicting physical, emotional abuse.

863
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,940
Oh, God, no.

864
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:59,700
No, I swear to you.

865
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:01,780
Bob didn't do anything like that.

866
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:02,780
I'm sorry.

867
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:03,500
No, I'm not sorry.

868
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:03,500


869
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:03,920
Bob's cold.

870
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:04,940
Manipulative.

871
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,580
Bob is innocent.

872
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,420
Bob tells you how to think, how to feel, how to act.

873
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,880
Without him, you're worthless.

874
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,540
Nothing.

875
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,160
She knew Bob was involved, she would've confessed.

876
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:26,620
Bob didn't do it.

877
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,280
Bob is innocent.

878
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:32,540
Bob is innocent.

879
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,120
I went to medical school for two years.

880
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:44,320
Maybe Bob did this without you knowing.

881
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:47,500
Oh, God, no.

882
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,420
Bob is innocent.

883
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:03,040
Bob is innocent.

884
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,280
Bob is innocent.

885
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:13,900
Bob is innocent.

886
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:19,140
Maybe Bob's not a sadomasochistic thrill killer.

887
00:34:20,420 --> 00:34:21,220
Maybe he's just an asshole.

888
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,960
Probably, this is the only asshole we've got.

889
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,120
Bob is innocent.

890
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:38,920
Bob is innocent.

891
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,920
Bob was right about you all along.

892
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,240
No!

893
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,920
Oh, damn it! Don't lie to me!

894
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,280
Bob is innocent.

895
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:52,420
Bob is innocent.

896
00:34:52,420 --> 00:34:55,000
Maybe Bob's not a sadomasochistic thrill killer.

897
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,620
Probably, this is the only asshole we've got.

898
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:58,180
Probably, this is the only asshole we've got.

899
00:35:00,260 --> 00:35:01,660
Bob is innocent.

900
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:06,420
Bob tells you how to think, how to feel, how to act.

901
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:12,300
Bob tells you how to feel, how to act.

902
00:35:12,820 --> 00:35:13,760
Bob is innocent.

903
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,820
Bob is innocent.

904
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,060
Bob is innocent.

905
00:35:26,820 --> 00:35:28,620
Who were you when you met Bob?

906
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:35,200
Ahab had it coming.

907
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:38,760
He just wouldn't acknowledge it.

908
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:45,420
He refused to believe that he could be sprawled whole like a net,

909
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:48,440
swimming to the edge of the beer glass,

910
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,520
hoping for escape and one last drink,

911
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:57,680
refusing to accept his fate.

912
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,580
Ahab was farsighted, to be sure,

913
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:11,360
and the eye patch to cover his missing eye did not improve his outlook.

914
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,460
However, determination was his,

915
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,420
and he was determined to do what he was doing.

916
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:23,100
He shall have this giant thing, bigger than his own ship,

917
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,780
if only he could catch sight of it.

918
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:36,720
The whale is patient, pacing and calculating.

919
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:42,500
Forward, men, forward!

920
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:47,920
The captain yells, pushing the boat further,

921
00:36:48,420 --> 00:36:52,720
away from its prey, aimlessly chopping the waves,

922
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,720
like the only seen-on-TV onion chopper,

923
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:59,780
in 1999 with free shipping,

924
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,800
which the cook is, in fact, using below deck

925
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,940
to prepare what is to be the crew's final meal.

926
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,920
But don't get ahead of yourself,

927
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:13,740
as the tale has yet to unfold.

928
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:22,440
Well, there is a bunch of water,

929
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:26,060
and the ship is floating on top of it,

930
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:27,740
and...

931
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:31,480
Look out! There's a big goddamn fucking whale!

932
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:38,000
The nearsighted whale was merely coming in for a closer look.

933
00:37:39,220 --> 00:37:43,260
Ahab grabs the biggest pointy stick at hand

934
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:46,860
and jabs at the mighty curious beast's eye.

935
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:51,240
The sharp object does not penetrate

936
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:54,400
through the custom-crafted contact lens

937
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:58,920
provided by lens crafters in return for a cameo

938
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,160
in the dramatized remake of actual fictional events

939
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,020
that may or may not have happened.

940
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:15,240
The whale, nicknamed Toby, submerges and swims on.

941
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:23,660
Ahab plunges his spare sharp stick into the deck

942
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:25,060
and loudly declares,

943
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,900
Well, what's for lunch?

944
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,360
Good question!

945
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,840
That was the entity called Sheridan,

946
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:41,620
telling the story of Toby Dick versus Captain Ahab.

947
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:47,260
The weird spooky music before that was an old piece by the Elk Kaiso All-Stars

948
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,400
that fell through the cracks of the ship, and fell into the water.

949
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,000
I would not have gotten into the cracks of the ship

950
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:50,040
if it had not been for the sound of the water.

951
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:50,100
A few years ago, I was there in the middle of the ship.

952
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,100


953
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:50,100


954
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,620
I have heard it for a long time, and it was a great surprise.

955
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,820
I would have found it down in the crack.

956
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:53,920
It was a very good song for me.

957
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:53,920


958
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:53,920


959
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:56,320
And we'll listen to a most challenging instrumental,

960
00:38:56,560 --> 00:39:01,140
also by the Elk Kaiso All-Stars, after this word from our mentors.

961
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,640
You couldn't have felt worse with no sleep at all.

962
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:07,460
Yes, morning finds you limp as a rag and blue as indigo.

963
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,680
How you dread to face another day.

964
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,800
Achy, dull, yes, only half alive.

965
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:14,400
You feel and act like an old, old man.

966
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:18,840
yet strangely enough, the cause of your rundown condition is simplicity itself.

967
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,460
Yes, friends, simplicity.

968
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:23,400
And to take care of your simplicity problems,

969
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,100
to restore you to full vigor and health,

970
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:30,160
take athnesia with Pluto Water.

971
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,200
Good afternoon, friends.

972
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:48,160
I'm Charles Blank from the United States Census Bureau.

973
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:52,620
Are you the janitor of this building?

974
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:56,380
Yes, I'm Mr. Harris, the janitor.

975
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,720
Mr. Harris, is apartment three vacant,

976
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:04,960
or is someone living there?

977
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,880
My business is of yours, Mr. Blank.

978
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,600
I see.

979
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,940
I have to fill a questionnaire for the apartment,

980
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,860
even though no one is living there.

981
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:21,220
Can you answer a few questions?

982
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,660
I'm not talking to anybody.

983
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:31,480
Is apartment three intended for year-round or seasonal occupancy?

984
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:32,760
You nosy bastard.

985
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:35,100
Take your farm and get out of here.

986
00:40:36,260 --> 00:40:38,500
Is it for rent or for sale?

987
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:40,460
You're not getting anything out of me.

988
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:41,820
I don't like your look.

989
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,040
Would you stick to that?

990
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,560
How many living quarters, occupied and vacant, are at this address?

991
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:50,600
Hey, are you a stuck record or something?

992
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:51,220
Don't you understand?

993
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:54,540
I'm not giving you any of these questions to answer them.

994
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:57,620
Does apartment three have complete kitchen facilities?

995
00:40:58,080 --> 00:41:01,820
Complete kitchen facilities are a sink with piped water,

996
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:05,080
a range or cook stove, and a refrigerator.

997
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,360
Is it for that unit only?

998
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,740
Or are there rooms for another house?

999
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:12,760
How many rooms are in apartment three?

1000
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,220
Do not count.

1001
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:18,540
Bathrooms, porches, balconies, foyer halls, or...

1002
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:22,040
Hey, you giving my friend Harry any trouble?

1003
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,920
Is there hot and cold piped water in this building?

1004
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:26,500
Let's throw him out.

1005
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:29,000
Does apartment three have a flush toilet?

1006
00:41:29,220 --> 00:41:31,040
Yes, and you're going right down it.

1007
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:31,760
Come on with me.

1008
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:34,700
For apartment three only, or is it...

1009
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,240
No, you don't.

1010
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:40,720
Yes, millions of men and women are in the same lamentable plight today.

1011
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:43,400
And not one in ten can guess the cause.

1012
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,700
That's the insidious thing about amnesia.

1013
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,020
It drags you down, slows your mind,

1014
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:52,360
and robs you of your joys and pleasures,

1015
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:54,900
yet you hardly realize that you're slipping.

1016
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,360
You're right, Roy.

1017
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:57,280
Isn't that true?

1018
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:57,700
Whoops!

1019
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:00,840
The eye of light is looking right through you.

1020
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:02,160
God bless you.

1021
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:04,660
You know, the folks at French Lick Springs Hotel

1022
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,600
in French Lick, Indiana,

1023
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,020
that's America's greatest...

1024
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,060
French Lick.

1025
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:10,000
...health retort.

1026
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:10,860
French Lick.

1027
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:12,480
The home of Pluto water.

1028
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:13,660
It's known as...

1029
00:42:13,660 --> 00:42:14,280
If you...

1030
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:15,380
Call that a home, Ray.

1031
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:16,300
The light's shining.

1032
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:16,580
Go.

1033
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,100
That's true.

1034
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:17,560
That's true.

1035
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,000
That's true.

1036
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,560
You know, we have two excellent golf courses down there.

1037
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:22,380
Three.

1038
00:42:22,700 --> 00:42:23,140
Splendid.

1039
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:23,920
No, only two.

1040
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,720
Ah, but the eye of light sees three, Ray.

1041
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:27,820
It sees three.

1042
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:28,260
Ah.

1043
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:30,220
Wonderful, wonderful golf courses.

1044
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:30,500
I see.

1045
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:30,740
I see.

1046
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:30,980
Go ahead.

1047
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:31,500
Go ahead.

1048
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:33,180
The power's coming up through the table.

1049
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,100
Splendid, splendid riding facilities.

1050
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,480
You're a weird pastor.

1051
00:42:36,740 --> 00:42:37,180
Ride.

1052
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:37,940
Ride on.

1053
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:38,540
I'm on you.

1054
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:39,480
I'm with you.

1055
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:39,700
Ride.

1056
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,900
And lots of outdoor amusements...

1057
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:43,500
Yes.

1058
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,180
...are provided.

1059
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,020
Yes, but God's looking down on everything you do outdoors, friend.

1060
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:47,400
That's true.

1061
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:47,500
That's true.

1062
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:50,480
God's got his eye on your eye, so watch out and keep going, Charlie.

1063
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,200
Carry an umbrella.

1064
00:42:52,060 --> 00:42:54,660
Decide right now to turn the tables on old man gloom, huh?

1065
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:55,700
Turn them upside down.

1066
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:58,320
Take Pluto water every morning for ten mornings.

1067
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,080
Yeah, by golly.

1068
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:02,020
And see a new world in ten days.

1069
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,340
See two new worlds here, friend.

1070
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,120
Two new worlds.

1071
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,060
You're going to need to.

1072
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:05,940
Down, Pluto.

1073
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:06,320
Down.

1074
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:06,760
Larry?

1075
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,660
Well, by golly, God said...

1076
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,860
Look, Pluto's making more water.

1077
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,080
Huh?

1078
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:10,920
Excuse me.

1079
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,120
That's okay, St. John.

1080
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:13,960
And God said...

1081
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,340
This is when I was with God in Miami.

1082
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,320
He said, uh...

1083
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:25,200
Harry, be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it.

1084
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,320
Do you know what subdue means?

1085
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:31,880
Is it like sublet?

1086
00:43:32,020 --> 00:43:34,940
Hey, Harry, is that guy down there asking you questions again?

1087
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:38,600
No, dear friends, janitors of all the lonely houses in the world.

1088
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:43,520
I know you've had your bad times, and I know you've had your good times,

1089
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,800
doing things you didn't understand.

1090
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:48,160
God bless you, pastor.

1091
00:43:48,620 --> 00:43:50,040
But things are changing, friends.

1092
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:53,600
The eye of God is looking down upon you right now.

1093
00:43:53,660 --> 00:43:54,720
Who asked you, pastor?

1094
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,240
Look him back in the eye, dear friends.

1095
00:43:58,240 --> 00:43:59,280
I can't see.

1096
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,720
Either can God, dear friends, because love and radio is blind.

1097
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,600
Don't blink.

1098
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:06,860
Don't blink, dear friends.

1099
00:44:06,860 --> 00:44:07,580
My radio's on the blink.

1100
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:09,480
My radio's on the blink, dear friends.

1101
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:10,920
God, I love your eyes, Father.

1102
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:11,600
Eye.

1103
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:12,800
Just one eye.

1104
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:13,720
The eye of love.

1105
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:14,860
Spelled eye.

1106
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:16,220
The letter I.

1107
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:17,120

I believe the title of that is Bull Dada Instrumental,

1141
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,560

00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:12,480
The Audio File, which I found in the cracks.

doing Sympathy for the Devil

1259
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,880
in front of the Dobbs head painted by Jesus

1260
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,560
with the blood of virgins

1261
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:00,920
splitting all over the stage.

1262
00:53:01,100 --> 00:53:04,160
And we'll be chopping the heads off Christians

1263
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,720
to the beat of symphony for the devil.

1264
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:08,700
Oh, you guessed my name.

1265
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:10,580
This was printed in the Bible.

1266
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:11,480
Oh, yeah.

1267
00:53:11,620 --> 00:53:12,220
Oh, yeah.

1268
00:53:12,420 --> 00:53:14,660
I was puzzling you

1269
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,980
with the nature of my game.

1270
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,920
Oh, yeah.

1271
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:21,040
Oh, yeah, baby.

1272
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,440
I watched the gleam

1273
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:25,100
of the white kings and queens

1274
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:26,860
fought for ten decades

1275
00:53:26,860 --> 00:53:30,160
for the god-fearing man.

1276
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,040
I shot down

1277
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,240
who killed the Kennedys

1278
00:53:33,240 --> 00:53:35,460
when after all

1279
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:37,800
it was you and me.

1280
00:53:38,600 --> 00:53:41,720
Let me please introduce myself.

1281
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,620
I'm a man of wealth and taste.

1282
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,140
I ain't trash for troubadours

1283
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:52,540
who can kill before they reach.

1284
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:53,880
You don't know me, must yo know me.

1285
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:55,600
Help, help help oh, help, oh

1286
00:53:58,160 --> 00:53:58,600
Homie.

1287
00:54:01,600 --> 00:54:03,020
subgenius has got their own credit card,

1288
00:54:03,100 --> 00:54:05,440
their own car and their own oil company.

1289
00:54:06,120 --> 00:54:07,860
Oh, you never would have thought so

1290
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,180
just a few years ago

1291
00:54:09,180 --> 00:54:11,460
they were all broke, dead beat art bums.

1292
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:13,280
And now, look at them

1293
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,940
they were just like some poor little armib reference roller on the road.

1294
00:54:16,120 --> 00:54:16,720
They were fit for wealths.

1295
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,440
Four quarter liter peter on the road

1296
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:21,260
Un hijacked a lot ofc Parking overturned all little bodies

1297
00:54:21,260 --> 00:54:22,780
All little bodies get hit by cars

1298
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:23,420
and knocked off by a pool.

1299
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:24,940
the front bumpers of the famous Stang.

1300
00:54:25,960 --> 00:54:27,140
What? Stang is

1301
00:54:27,140 --> 00:54:29,320
responsible for this auto carnage?

1302
00:54:29,980 --> 00:54:31,200
Of course. He has a

1303
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,220
fleet of limos now that carry him all over

1304
00:54:33,220 --> 00:54:33,700
the country.

1305
00:54:35,100 --> 00:54:37,200
And those damn hillbillies who

1306
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,140
work for him just

1307
00:54:39,140 --> 00:54:41,300
love to crush little creatures on the road.

1308
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:43,280
Yep, that's what they do down

1309
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,180
there. They don't have any room at work for Stang

1310
00:54:45,180 --> 00:54:47,060
and crush little critters on the road.

1311
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:53,000
Yee-haw!

1312
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:54,920
That's what we say here.

1313
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:03,840
Who is this?

1314
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,960
Well, I don't know.

1315
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:08,320
You're playing the record.

1316
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,780
I was asking the trailer brides.

1317
00:55:10,980 --> 00:55:11,880
Yeah, oh, great.

1318
00:55:18,160 --> 00:55:20,200
Those little trailer twists certainly

1319
00:55:20,200 --> 00:55:22,880
turn me to one of those

1320
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:23,400
beat-ups.

1321
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:24,840
They will?

1322
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,740
Well, that's a different

1323
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:29,280
complexion on the matter of

1324
00:55:31,640 --> 00:55:33,200
other black tie

1325
00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:34,360
with my suit on.

1326
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,540
And now we have

1327
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:39,400
a slow dance for you, those of you

1328
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:40,080
that are couples.

1329
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:42,660
This is the mop-up

1330
00:55:42,660 --> 00:55:44,900
motor oil on the dance floor.

1331
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:46,560
We'll mop up the motor oil

1332
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:48,020
with these dancers.

1333
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:49,500
God bless them.

1334
00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:51,300
In a 72-hour

1335
00:55:51,300 --> 00:55:52,040
dance marathon,

1336
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,400
for the subgenius youth

1337
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:55,340
outreach program.

1338
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:56,980
I didn't search

1339
00:55:56,980 --> 00:55:57,820
for you always.

1340
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:03,600
I shot him up first

1341
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:04,940
because I'm so

1342
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:08,080
busy laughing to him.

1343
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:11,640
He is wanting his arm

1344
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,060
bathed in alcohol.

1345
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,680
And not just in Soma,

1346
00:56:14,900 --> 00:56:16,180
all over town.

1347
00:56:16,560 --> 00:56:17,960
What part of the routine?

1348
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:20,140
He's a war war war.

1349
00:56:31,060 --> 00:56:32,740
sorry my poor lights.

1350
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:32,740


1351
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:33,920
ovich.

1352
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:34,560
Just handed it to him with

1353
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,660
a black belt.

1354
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:36,920
Jenens is over there.

1355
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:37,100
You wonder how

1356
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:37,100


1357
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:37,140


1358
00:56:37,140 --> 00:56:37,180
I can tell valor from

1359
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:38,860
speaking here.

1360
00:56:38,860 --> 00:56:39,620
The lights are going out

1361
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:41,800
in the city.

1362
00:56:42,020 --> 00:56:43,600
The long day wanes,

1363
00:56:46,520 --> 00:56:48,040
the slow moon crawls.

1364
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:48,980
It's pockets are Ain't

1365
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:49,400
even coming close.

1366
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,780
Hell, if it's not up in the

1367
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:52,000
sky.

1368
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,000


1369
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,000


1370
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,000


1371
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:52,020
Call 408 Mason encouraging

1372
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:52,020


1373
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:54,220
slowly suffocating

1374
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:24,260
you ask me why I love her?

1375
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:25,860
give me time

1376
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,400
I'll explain

1377
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:30,160
have you drifted on a cold fog

1378
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:31,900
drifting over Kansas, sir?

1379
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:35,420
Bayoued over San Francisco Bay?

1380
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,400
have you heard the bellow

1381
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:39,740
of a Bob White calling

1382
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,860
in the diesel in the Appalachian mines?

1383
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:44,540
the look with awe and wonder

1384
00:57:44,540 --> 00:57:45,920
drifting way up high

1385
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,760
where men who braved a hard new world

1386
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:50,200
first stepped on the diesel

1387
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,200
in the city dock

1388
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:53,960
do you think of them

1389
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,920
when you stroll along a

1390
00:57:55,920 --> 00:57:57,840
rock way high?

1391
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,840
have you seen the mighty

1392
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,000
teet? have you seen an eagle

1393
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,700
roll along Missouri's shore?

1394
00:58:04,620 --> 00:58:05,820
have you felt it

1395
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:07,020
rage along the shore?

1396
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:09,800
is the word why I'm a reef?

1397
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,400
from Alaska's

1398
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,840
Everglades to Maine

1399
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:16,060
my heart runs out

1400
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:18,000
my pulse rises fast

1401
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:19,460
the might for domain

1402
00:58:19,460 --> 00:58:22,360
you ask me why I love her?

1403
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:24,760
I've a million Appalachian mines

1404
00:58:24,760 --> 00:58:27,940
my beautiful Appalachian mines

1405
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:30,000
beneath God's

1406
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:32,200
wide old fog sky

1407
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,860
and found

1408
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:36,740
my hood

1409
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:38,960
from shining

1410
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:41,900
sea

1411
00:58:41,900 --> 00:58:44,060
to sea

1412
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,520
sea

1413
00:58:46,340 --> 00:58:46,720
sea

1414
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,560
sea

1415
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:48,160
sea

1416
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:49,440
sea

1417
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:49,860
sea

1418
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,120
sea

1419
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:52,900
sea

1420
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:53,000
sea

1421
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:54,980
sea

1422
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:56,100
sea

1423
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:56,480
sea

1424
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:56,740
sea

1425
00:58:56,740 --> 00:58:56,800
a

1426
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,260
a

1427
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:57,260


1428
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:57,260


1429
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:57,260


1430
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:57,260


1431
00:58:57,260 --> 00:58:57,260


1432
00:58:57,260 --> 00:59:00,200
And so we come to the end of this broadcasting day.

1433
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:03,500
That was Bob's Shed on Me by the great Lee Murr.

1434
00:59:03,580 --> 00:59:09,360
All 1,815 hours of Slack are downloadable from subgenius.com

1435
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,820
where just the front page alone can take you to worlds you never dreamed existed.

1436
00:59:14,220 --> 00:59:16,220
Worlds like The Book of the Subgenius,

1437
00:59:16,340 --> 00:59:18,340
Neighbor World by Lone Cow Dave,

1438
00:59:18,740 --> 00:59:19,320
Eyelash,

1439
00:59:19,320 --> 00:59:22,080
our new subgenius sci-fi novel.

1440
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:29,440
Eternal Salvation, in the form of the huge subgenius ministerial ordainment kit.

1441
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:35,620
T-shirts, fertility masks, stickers, pins, doodahs, gee-gaws, gimcracks,

1442
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:39,300
and the six other subgenius radio shows,

1443
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:45,620
and subgenius online forums and fleecebook pages, the number of which is too damn high.

1444
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:48,720
Did I mention our holy church soap?

1445
00:59:49,320 --> 00:59:50,660
Triology Soaps.

1446
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,280
That's subgenius.com.

1447
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,820
And now you must praise Bob.
