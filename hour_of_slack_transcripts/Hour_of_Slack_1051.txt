Only a madman or a fool would intentionally set fire to one of our forests or woodlands.
Yet 90% of our forests are forested.
Most fires are started by the self-genius, Power of Slack.
They impede the production and transportation of critical defense supplies.
As I said, there is hope.
The aliens will come and if, assuming Bob has enough numbers, they will take us off to Planet X.
You know, come to think of it, no one's ever asked what happens on Planet X.
But it must be really slack from the pool.
And the Earth will be, the unfaithful will all be destroyed and we get to help.
And we, now so far, admittedly, every July 5th, we're out there hoping that this year is 1998.
We get up at 7 in the morning and out there at Brushwood every X day, faithfully waiting for the saucers like a bunch of Heaven's Gate nuts.
And I have found over the years, I've learned.
I've learned from gossip that the pagans at Brushwood, and they seem to think that we're going to do another Jonestown.
We've actually had them do spells to keep us from doing the terrible mass suicide.
They assume that every cult that knows how to use computers is planning.
But friends, you can relax about that.
That Jonestown franchise is worn out.
Jonestown 2.
That was a pale shadow.
It was all commercialized.
Jonestown 3 was a pathetic mockery.
It was just the whole product placement.
I mean, Jesus, like those Heaven's Gate people.
Friends, until we can break Jonestown's record, the Kool-Aid will just be Kool-Aid and the pills will just be pills.
We don't care how long it takes.
The Church of the Subgenius, friends, has a hundred years of attitude.
Meanwhile.
About those aliens.
You know, Charles Fort, the great, well, I'm not sure what to call him.
The great weirdo, Charles Fort, said, I think we are being fished for regarding aliens.
And we say yes, but sorry, Charlie.
We're not looking for humans with good taste.
We're looking for humans that taste good.
But I suspect.
I can no longer turn my back on Cadet Stinty.
The rigors of space travel have somehow twisted his mind.
He's gone crazy.
He's got the space madness.
And you can smell the dottle of the pipe.
Amino acids.
As it were.
The amino acids are playing tonight.
I wish they were playing.
Actually, probably in the CDs I have.
I have a bunch of.
Hours of slack.
In the archives.
Yeah, who knows?
I know there's some song.
I have best of Bob songs, number something.
Oh, he rocks.
Yeah, yeah.
We say yeah to X Day 9.
Yeah, boot capita.
That reminds me that this July 5th, 2000, whatever this year is, the world will.
Who knows?
I mean, it might be 98.
Actually, at this point, we're not really.
Banking on anything much ending except, you know, the free.
Well, how many people usually like that?
Is it become like the Burning Man in New York kind of thing?
No.
Although there is an interesting little beginning festival called Burning Wood, which is rather small so far.
I think there's only been one.
And that's it was the guy actually told us it was based on Burning Man and Starwood.
Yeah.
Starwood.
I never would have guessed.
In Yankee land out in the New York's in the woods.
Yankee land.
Brushwood, the clothing optional campground owned by our good friends.
Keep letting us do things there.
And it's Starwood's only like 1500 people.
And they don't burn a giant man.
Does this mean I'm the cowboy Dave?
Hell of a big pile of beautifully decorated wood.
Am I cowboy Dave?
Yes.
Yes.
And usually lonesome cowboy Dave is in a cage inside this burning.
Just like me.
It's not a Burning Man.
It's just a big pile, like I say.
But there's an actual man inside the pile of wood.
Oh, please.
So in a way, it's not nearly as big as Burning Man, but they do go the distance.
I understand the.
They're kind of like Burning Man boys in the old days when they used to really kill.
It's like a Burning Man cover band.
For art projects.
There are actually now is Action Girl.
Yes.
I was proud to say there are little Burning Man contingents in all 50 states.
Yes.
And Glass Madness was accosted recently by a sort of Bobby of Burning Man who went into a wonderful rant of high secrecy about, you know, he's going to have an event now.
It'll be a Burning Man thing.
You can make it.
But don't tell anybody.
And he'll give him the address just before it happens.
Right.
It was all.
Very, very hush hush.
Yes.
There are a lot of those hush hush festivals that remain hush hush to everyone except the founders who go around telling their friends and everyone they meet about them.
About what?
And that's the festival, man.
Things like Burning Man.
You missed it, dude.
Hundreds of little tiny weenies.
Yeah.
Burning Wood.
Or Wood Man.
Shooting festivals.
Burning Mandible.
Man Wood.
That's it.
Man Wood.
Man Wood.
Man Wood.
That was kind of a sexy festival.
Thank you.
The Wellman Wood.
The Wellman?
Yeah.
Well, Man Wood.
Man Wood.
Well, Man Wood.
What about Woman Wood?
What was that movie about the guy that grew up inside a TV?
Women don't have wood.
And he was all bent over when he got out.
When Elvis shot the TV.
And tried to also remove their wills.
When Elvis shot the TV, this guy jumped out.
And he went on to live a life in the real world.
He freed him from the prison.
But he was a TV guy living in the real world.
Living in the real world.
Living in the real world.
We just gathered information about what a NASA�
DNA sort of thing.
He can't read my mind.
Soχilll ra.
The planet most similar to ours in all the universe.
The Earth.
Therefore, our object will be to capture the Earth and colonize it with our own species.
Prepare the ship for an immediate attack.
Hit one of them, Bob.
Go to it, Bob.
Damn it, Bob. You've got to regain control.
To our mother star, Pyrrhus.
Our mission has failed.
We are in retreat.
Send spaceship number two immediately.
We found a deadly creature protecting the Earth.
Its name is...
Bob!
Yes, friend.
Bob is the one deadly creature protecting the Earth from everything but itself.
Thanks to Norrell Preff there.
Well, X-Day is coming very soon.
So we're playing holy recordings of the last X-Day drill,
which had Dr. Philo Drummond and Dr. Howell at it.
Also, some puzzling evidence.
KPFA radio show X-Day bits.
Also, from Starwood 25.
And Winterstar 06 sermons.
Plus some new music by Ed Fred and the collages of Krep and Lemur.
And now, Phineas Narco from NationalSynical.com.
Coincidence could be called the junk food of understanding.
It may be like an empty calorie or a dead end, but nevertheless you have it.
Of course, it can be indicative of what one is thinking.
Without one's complete awareness.
And may or may not be important.
But it is nevertheless accompanied by a feeling of importance.
Or a pleasurable and eerie significance.
The mind can be a significance junkie and gravitate toward a feeling of
this is significant and that it's on to something.
Because that's the sort of thing it's built to do.
This can lead you into some freaky areas if you don't manage to think about it.
And see them for what they are.
Namely, a statistical phenomenon indicative of expanded associational thinking.
Rather than something necessarily significant.
Even though Bob predicted that July 5th, 1998, the aliens would land, destroy all the humans,
and save the dues-paying subgeniuses.
It didn't happen.
Did we give up?
Did we let the Jehovah's Witnesses out-cook us and let them out-cook us?


Answer no!
We were right back here the next year, waiting for those saucers.
Just as if Bob never lied in his life.
We don't care about how true or untrue it might be, friends.
Because that is what belief is all about.
It's faith.
You don't use your mind to think about your religion.
You use your mind to think about Bob's religion.
And occasionally, friends, believe it or not,
we've seen subgeniuses who were disappointed.
When the aliens didn't show up.
Who were angry.
In fact, friends, I've...
Now, you know, we started this nice, friendly, mockery religion.
You know, I mean, it's a room full of people laughing most of the time.
How bad are we?
Yeah!
We have...
There are people who want to kill my ass.
Who hate me!
I've got a lot of hate mail.
And who is it from?
Not Christians.
I wish it was.
Starwood gets funny letters from them.
Not Christians.
Not the church of the subgenius.
Who do we get the funny letters from?
Former subgeniuses.
Who we deprogrammed ourselves.
When they found out that they weren't really going to be able to ride in a spaceship for $30,
they felt cheated.
Friends, we gave those people a gift.
If they but had the eyes to see,
they would realize that we gave them the gift.
The gift of disbelief.
So that the next time some smooth-talking guru comes along and tells them that, you
know, we have the beautiful, perfect world.
We're going to wipe the saucers.
All you have to do is cut your balls off and give us $900 a month.
Friends, it could have been Heaven's gate.
They should be thanking us for ripping them off.
Praise God!
So what's happening now, Reverend Stan?
Well, uh, it's a little bit of a mess.





We're tired of you as an audience.
The excitement is palpable.
We've become discouraged now.
I've just finished flipping and labeling the tapes.
That's my main duty the next day.
Tapes are flipped and labeled.
You know, you can buy many wonderful souvenirs to take back from you from this occasion.
You can take them back and look at them and remember your time out here at Rushmore.
Oh, we have such beautiful memories.
We have these commemorative Slim Jim sausages for sale up here.
You have our permission.
Come on up and check out the



Come on up and have a Slim Jim of your own.
Plus we have these strips of paper that I spend a lot of time tearing very straightly.
Save them.
They may come in handy for bookmarks or other things.
Well, like any other religion, we have these, uh, we have an us and a them.
And us is everybody we like, which is usually just ourselves.
And them is pretty much everybody else.
And, uh, we have lots of derogatory words for them, the Barbies and Kens.
Uh-huh.
The cage dwellers.
The little norm worms.
The conspiracy, the pink boys.
The...
Mediocratons.
The mediocratons, yeah.
We come up with new ones all the time.
And just to, and, you know, you know all that is, is just an ego boost.
It's not that we love Bob so much.
It's that we love the idea of everybody else going to hell.
And that is what religion is all about!
How many of you know that?
How many Buddhists do you know who you know that that nice Buddhist is thinking to himself,
I've got less ego than anybody else here?
You know who I mean.
The New Agers who try so hard not to act angry.
How you planning on getting him back to Earth?
We's kinda hoping you'd take him.
Ask him if we can get his chocolate and cigarettes.
If we take him to Earth, can we keep his chocolate and cigarettes?
We ain't got no need for it.
Okay.
Oh my God, don't be.
Yes, yes.
Yes, yes.

Yes, yes.
Yes, yes.
Yes, yes.
Yes, yes.

Yes, yes.
Yes, yes.
Right.
Yes, yes.
Yeah.
Yes.



Okay.

It had to be a great pun.
Let me talk to you.

Matt, remember?

Let's talk.
Want to see the镇ic grotto?
A sense of frequency?



The girl with the vagina made of glass
So perfect and pure
And gynecologically demure
And the way her buttocks choose on her shorts
Is very nice
Oh yes, it's very nice
And the way her perfect bosoms need no support
Oh yes, that too is very nice
And wherever she may go
All heaven surrounds her
Envy's green-eyed monsters confound her
Age-old myths and legends come true
Ancient prophecies all come to pass
All this and all because of you
The girl with the vagina made of glass
Ah-woo, ah-woo, ah-woo
Ah-woo, ah-woo
Ah-woo, ah-woo, ah-woo
Ah-woo, ah-woo, ah-woo

He stood about ten-three
His voice rang like crashing waves of a sea
He spoke of untold prophecies
And forgotten civilizations
How we as people are asleep
In a voice's true context
Visual views of humans being recharged
Like puppets on a stream
Quests for knowledge being sodomized in your dreams
Government cover-ups in a nutshell
Gunshots blast, children scream
Psycho repeated like bad dreams
We were taught not to fly
And our wings got clipped
I'm waiting on the sun to become as one with the moon
Tidal waves and thunderstorms are soon to rule the earth
He spoke of how some of us must find loopholes with the stars
New atmospheres
Somewhere that we can cultivate new hemispheres
All my lessons ran clear
War revelations
Murder in the mind of seven nations
Politicians with their fingers on the triggers
Indeed contemplation
No more conversation
Blood must be spilled
Enemies must die
So people shoot to kill
This life isn't for real
It's just for fun
It's just a depiction of the hereafter

To be, be, be an American astronaut.
Can't you see what it means to be, to be the American astronaut?
And don't you know that I love it so?
To be the American astronaut.
Please.
To be the American astronaut.
From the movie.
Uh.
By the Billy Nair Show.
Who are performing at 9X Day.
You can learn more about them at BillyNair.com.
Uh.
The amino acids are in the background here.
And they will also be at 9X Day.
But before that we heard Johnny Future.
And you can get Johnny Future by emailing johnny__future at yahoo.com.
And before that.
Manifest Destiny.
And I would fly in an old Stuka aircraft.
And land with my whistling landing craft.
Listen to these old guys.
I'm really tired.
Spread out my sleeping bag and take a nap.
This five hour show is blazoring my ancient memories.
Yes.
It is the tough time show.
Trying to store their memories.
This isn't in Fat Mouse.
To serve them.
We are serving up liquid oxygen.

Liquid chicken.
Yeah.
Liquid chicken slack.
If they were printed only for the nudist cult.
They would never exist.
Yeah.
Chicken grease and nudies.
And five years after you put the photos of the peep of the nude cultists online.
You can call 848-4425 and I'll answer your call right now.
They call you up and ask you to take them down because they gotta get a job now.
Call at 848-4425.
No.
Not well done.
Even those of you who have called several times tonight can call again.
So friends.
If you're ever going to get a job.
Don't take off your clothes at a subgenius event.
And stand in front of the cameras.
Too late now.
Hey.
Where is the young marine station?
Some instances but.
I think she's out of the marines now.

I believe him.
Has she returned to dog stock?
Huh?
Has she returned to dog stock?
Yes.
She was.
One of the faithful.
Oh yes.
Doesn't she sing songs and dance around?
She did in fact dance around the great fire.
And like an experience.
There is a hallmark to being a couple.
And yet she had never been to such a thing.
I thought that she was a reincarnation of some ancient wood puffer goddess.
Or pine sapper.
However it's been well stated that very few blind people join the nudist colonies.
The church of subgenius.
Or the nudist colonies.
Why would a blind person want to join a nudist colony?
They can't see who's looking at them.
They're only three or four.
There's a blind subgenius radio broadcaster.
Reverend Yukon Jack.
He's blind as a bat.
Actually much blinder because he doesn't have echolocation.
You know why flatulent smells right?
And he rebroadcasts all of the shows.
Liquid hour of slack.
And the echo would be up there.
Is this college radio?
Regular radio?
No this is pirate FM small radio.
Small circulation.
98!
98!

It's here now.
98 it's now.
Here's a man that really appreciates that new power.
Take a tip from me.
I'm a professional sailor from the future.
Today.
This is another forward step.
Remember you get power from 98.
What?
98.
98.
98.

98.
98.

98.

It's here now.
A thanks to Reverend Maynard Brainard.
And now back to Dr. Howell.
Dr. Philodrum and it was truly Reverend Ivan Stang at 8X Day.
Some patients with T-Series originating in the temple have intense religious wars.
Intense experience of God visiting them.
Sometimes it's a personal war.
Sometimes it's a more diffuse feeling of being one with the cosmos.
Everything seems suffused meaning.
The patient will say, finally I see what it's all really about.
I really understand God.
I understand my place in the universe because of the cosmic scheme.
Why does this happen?
Why does it happen so often in patient and temporal seizures?
I'm Dr. Philodrum.
I'm Dr. Howell.




The way we grow is to look at the past.
Very in the past.
Still give us strength for the super thing.
The red alarm, the roots of pride every time it rings.
It means it's time to go beyond the normal thing.
Pay attention and be prepared to do it right.
Do it right.
Do it right.
Do it right.

The super thing, the thing that makes you bigger than life.
Magnetic trumpets blowing.
Synthetic saxophones.
The evidence kept growing from below.
Mutant motivations.
Buried in the past.
Still give us strength.
The super thing.
Won't you tell me what it takes.
To do the super thing.
Won't you give me what it takes.
To do the super thing.

To do the super thing.
To do the super thing.
To do the super thing.
To do the super thing.

To do the super thing.



Well, folks, I guess this concludes our segment.
Believe us, we've enjoyed bringing it to you
just as much as you've enjoyed
having us bring it to you.
But now, the evening will take
new and delightful form.
We're not sure what goes on.
No, we want them to occur organically.
X-Day, surroundings.
Well, the best thing about X-Day
happens away from the stage.
So clearly you're still so close to X-Day.
Santos and Lindshift,
of course you're getting into some
really good 성 and fly will
b忙 like you never have before,
but you're literally missing it.
Okay, fingers crossed.
That, uh,
that kind of outweighs
it all, right now.
Next week 25AK is off.
Here are Alex Jones's

Saturday is Friday,

Except this year. It'll just continue forever and ever.
In fact, has anybody planned to take...
Yeah, I guess we've got to remember to take brushwood with us when the rupture happens.
Somebody's got to remember to do that.
Well, there'll be a new heaven and a new earth.
Well, but we'd like to... Some of us are collectors, Dr. Howard.
You know, a new heaven and a new earth is great, but we want that amazing, fantastic number 15 back.
Well, you might take the old brushwood to get with you, you know, sort of like a modern train layout.
You know, nothing like the new giant brushwood, which can contain a hundred universes like ours.
I have a copy with a torn cover.
You still have amazing fantasy number 15?
I have amazing fantasy 15 with a half-torn cover.
I had one, but I sold it to a crippled guy for $3.50 in 1969 or something.
I thought you...
Ripped it off a crippled newsie.
Yeah, I still have most of Spider-Man 1 through 50.
Here's the thing, man. What is the middle letter in Bob's name?
Is it a U?
No!
U are not in the middle of Bob's name.
O is in the middle.
What does O mean to you?
It means U-O-Bob.
Bob.
And Bob, you know, you don't have to love Bob.
But it's Bob's only one O short of boo, and you do love booze.
Everybody loves booze.
And we're into love.
This is a love church, but it's also a hate church because we're very practical.
We have a kind of a temper tantrum of hate, you might say.
It's hate.
We try to broaden our love by kind of squeezing our hate, distilling our hate into a perfect teacher.
A perfect essence of hate.
A hate through mockery of the false prophets, which, like I say, that's anybody we don't like.
We don't love.
We don't love.
We don't love.
We don't love.
We don't love.
Our record for this date is 1951.
Saturday morning with a chance of Saturday night.
It'll be plenty of Sunday.
Sunday night looking at Monday with a chance of early Monday.
The seven great lakes will eventually move into the northeast and bring New York City.

That's what we're doing
We interrupt our program to bring you a special broadcast

It's just a question of when

Reverend Ed Fred did that
And before that, some lean mer
Some preaching at Starwood
Some Devo
And some Phineas Narco
Coming up
Uh
What is on the schedule?
Now, Reverend Stang, tomorrow at this site
What will occur here when the shadows of evening steal across the sky?
What's the bird's eye lowdown on this hoedown?
Tomorrow is the big, big, big day, friends
The great day
I believe that, uh
Okay, nothing happens before one o'clock
Praise Bob and Stan
Oh, for God's sake, sure
Yes, of course
So you can sleep late, right?
But will there be, uh, woe tanning going on here?
There'll be, uh, like
I would say
Jamming
It's much like what's in that, that, uh
Although the schedule is a complete fiction
By coincidence, it's pretty close to what that, that will be
I believe it's like, uh
At one o'clock, we had called for the baptism in the pool
Now, wasn't really, truthfully, Reverend Stang
Wasn't that the previous year's schedule with simply having the dates changed?
Yes
Yes, and now I'm going to change them even more
That's what I thought
We're going to move the baptism up to two o'clock
Two o'clock
That's a slack-filled way to create a schedule, don't you think?
Uh, and I'm not sure who'll be performing the actual baptisms this year
I don't know if Dr. Leguim will be doing it
Jesus is not here
He's infiltrated the conspiracy so deeply
That he might as well be Satan
He is Satan now
Praise Bob
We need a man on the inside
I've always been on the inside for you
But I want you to know that
It's part of my job
So, in the, in the meantime, however
We'll have the baptism in the pool tomorrow
I guess I may end up having to do some of that
Gentlemen, the cheeseburgers have arrived
Don't worry, I'll wear my bathing trunks
So you won't be afraid to get close to me
Or, I can't wear my papal robes
I think I would drown
Then after that, we'll
I think it said we'd show movies
Uh, subgenius movies
Not conspiracy bad films
That's right, we'll be going up into the hospitality shed
That would be like after the baptism
Probably about three o'clock in the studio
Up at the top of the hill
That's just past the shower room
And that's where we're going
We're going to be going up to the

Love is a flipping, rolling riddle
Love is smiling when you hear them giggle
Those angels giggle when they know you're smiling
Love is running in an open field
Love is smiling and the happy way you feel
When you know you're smiling
So how can you keep from smiling
When you see yourself in the mirror smiling
Just about to say the name of the girl that makes you smile
Love is smiling
Love is thinking of when you die
Love is smiling
When she hears your name and she'll start to cry
She'll remember you smiling
Love is living in a magic land
Love is thinking of how you'll hold your hand
And you'll both be smiling
So how can you keep from smiling
When you see yourself in the mirror smiling
Just about to say the name of the girl that makes you smile

Jim, do you smell something fishy in the air?
I don't smell anything.
The Billy Mayer Show from the American Astronauts.
Again, also on one of their CDs, I think that is.
And now, hey, where's Bob?
There he goes!
He's feeling his ovarian re-trio.
That's a mighty good idea for you.
Just make sure you get loaded too.
Cooked.
Every morning and you'll hear Bob.
The future is now, now.
With each new tomorrow.
No more I'll face the heartaches of the past.
For now they are gone, gone.
Forever no more sorrow.
I hope that my happiness will last.
That was Neil Dick.
Now, Rel.
Hi.
I don't have a whole lot of time.
And I've kind of been running across the country.
Oh man, I don't know where to start.
They're going to triangulate on this position really, really soon.
Okay.
Okay, what we're thinking of as aliens,
they're extra dimensional beings.
They are not what they claim to be.
I'm sorry, the government knows about them.
And, and...
Is it the government or...
That was awful strange.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Blew up here.
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.
Am I on the air?
Belly up.
I presume.
I presume.
How can you presume?
How can I presume?
How can you presume?
How can I presume?
Okay, another question from the audience is...
Is this my drink?
Are all Yetis partially Cajun?
Well, an interesting question.
And perhaps one that comes from the land of the Cajuns,
or Acadians as they once were called.
But the fact is...
I see, I feel a certain amount of hope and hoping behind this question.
Yes, and it's hope that I'm not...
But I hate to dash, but I'm afraid all Yetis are not partially Cajun.
The Acadian people were French settlers of Canada who were displaced.
And they...
Their famous Cajun patois is a result of the language they originally spoke.
Their diaspora is detailed in the poem, Evangeline, by the immortal Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.
Uh...
You know, the forest, the murmuring pines and hemlocks.
You can read all about it, probably on the internet.
But Yetis are universally found around this Terraqueous globe.
And not really the native of any particular region,
except what is remote and away from the smelly, disharmonious haunts of humans.
Okay, thank you.
The response to this eternal empire is easy to recognize.
We say that
We have a real energy investigation,
Even today,
Outside the barely visible stars and the the molecules in the atmosphere,
It's been proven to be true, like one and one are two.
It's checked and double checked, a fact that can be backed.
Because it is, because it is a scientific fact.
It's a scientific fact that there are belts of radiation in outer space
which are a hazard for future space flyers to overcome.
It's a scientific fact, a scientific fact.
It has to be correct, it has to be exact.
Because it is, because it is a scientific fact.
Well, of course,
even scientific facts are not perfectly exact,
but they are as exact as it is humanly possible to make them at the time.
It's a scientific fact, a scientific fact.
It has to be correct, it has to be exact.
Because it is, because it is a scientific fact.
The fight and the dying mean there's no denying.
The wreckage, the bodies,
nobody left crying.
The lifting, the burning,
the world will stop turning.
The chaos, the violence turns to utter silence.
At the end of the world,
when the river has cleaned all the fields.
At the end of the world,
revelations will record with the seven seals.
At the end,
of the world,
the death to the eve of destruction.
At the end,
of the world,
when the earth goes into deconstruction.
The flames will rise higher, consumption by fire.
The world will burn to ashes in smoking hot gases.
Volcanic erosion and earth-core implosion.
A massive explosion, the doomsday is chosen.
At the end,
of the world,
there will be much devastation.
At the end,
of the world,
the galaxy will need a vacation.
At the end,
of the world,
a new asteroid field will be formed.
At the end,
of the world,
there's good reason to be alone.
That's right folks,
it's the end of the world.
But before you grab a seat,
bend over and kiss your sorry ass goodbye.
Because you're gonna fry.
That was Reverend Ed Fred at the end of the world.

Eve, I'm over here!
And I'm coming with you.
When we get away from here,
we'll be living among normal people again.
There is something strange in the air.
Don't you feel it?
Or is it that I'm just so sensitive?
Did you see what I see?
Holy smoke spread!
Wait a minute!
I need some coffee.
What can it be?
Can you tell me why Fish Face is so frantic?
Something terrible.
Hey Pat, that's impossible!
Damn it all, Pat, what's that?
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
It's up to you, Cornfield.
I'll be the lightning rod.
Will someone please tell me what's going on?
I don't understand what you mean.
Amazing.
Stupid.
And dull mechanical apparatuses.
Oh.
Infinitesimal.
Ah, yes.
The High Command.
With pleasure.
With pleasure.
With pleasure.
Idiots on Mars.
Right on microwave.
Hi, Bob.
Fred Steele.
Where did you spring up from?
But you hit me at a bad moment.
Wait, Bob.
There's something else.
He's a crazy kid.
Bob.
Execute the order.
We must calculate mass, size, and speed.
But Commander, but Commander.
But that's murder.
You've created a panic.
I've been here at your side for several years now.
As usual, the bigwigs have to try to find a scapegoat.
The Bigwigs are the ones who are the most dangerous.




I maintain nothing.
I ascertain there's only one opinion that interests me.
My own.
Oh.
One would say, ladies and gentlemen, that you are disappointed to learn that the end
of the world has been postponed.
I understand the PSI course is very grave.
We know damn well it's not true.
However, the people have faith in you.
Eve.
Eve.
Stand back, you madman.
Of course.
I'm not mad.














If the discipline is at my fingertips, is it a shame that I frankly admit that my

To think, just the two of you, that just to think I had a chance to take a игрle.




I'd go, air, air air.
At this point in time, I would be over the moon.
Next time, I would fly Οo Snowman instead.

What's your FE
This is war.
To unleash every propaganda need given with all of us.

and their means of tool disposal to tranquilize public opinion.
Bob, I love you, Bob. I love you, Bob.
Take me with you, Bob.
Up there?
The moment of neutralization.
The squadron commander is Bob.
I don't like the smell of this story.
Why? Because it's inspired by non-scientific motives.
Are you crazy? Hit one of them, Bob.
I'm not insane. Go to it, Bob.
Damn it, Bob. You've got to regain control.
You all go to hell.
This is terrible. Drawing out agony for the whole world.
Most things happen unexpectedly. Even the apocalypse.
Psychic, you know.
Where does she go?
These, this, and that, and that.
Deep inside.
Do you really think there is someone inside?
Oh, shut up.
Bob! Bob!
Bob! Bob! Bob!
I love you, Bob.
The number of people still astonishes.
Um, uh, uh, um.
More than two people died.
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
Nearly two million more lost their humanity.
Uh, uh, uh, uh.
This is me speaking.
Second minutes hours.
Experience the fine fragrance of snuggle.
Somebody get on the pipe.
Somehow, in some way, I not only went through the sound barrier, but I've gone back in time.
Stay in your own backyard.
You're still on Earth or on the ship with me.
Strange and complex sanity of man.
Stupid.
A telephone connected to nothingness.
The ultimate.
They're big.
They're tough and they're shrewd and they got eyes.
This is incredible.
This is really incredible.
Frankly, Grandfather, I think this whole thing is a bore.
Through sleep.
It's time for me to be the man.
Time, time, time.
Ah!
This time enough at last.
To each his own.
To penetrate!

Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!
Yeah!


Well, that's, uh, very interesting, uh, Viacom.
Oh, wait a minute. What's going on?
We...
All of us...
We are in hell.
We are so high.
We will be taking off in three minutes.
What in the name of everything holy is going on?
What's going on?
What's going on here?
What's going on here?
What that book says.
Where are we?
What are we?
Who are we?
Where are you?
Where's everybody going?
Who are you?
A couple of very unimportant items seem to have eluded me, like who I am.
Will you come out?
You're a bad man.
You're a very bad man.
Yeah, I'm a bad man.
You've got the answers.
You be dead!
You'd better start thinking happy thoughts.
You get real people with answers.
The time has come not to dissemble.
We're too close to the actual rupture for that.
That's right.
We have to make a clean breast of all our sins, uh, put our foulnesses and abominations right here on the table.
So you can see them and smell them.
You guys can go first.
This is the one song that you guys did all the way through.
It's the only one that Sveaks could remember the words to.
Hey everybody put your finger in your nose.
Kick a pick a rock and wipe it on your clothes.
I don't know how you feel one way or another.
Kick a pick a rock and wipe it on your clothes.
Kick a pick a rock and wipe it on your clothes.
Hey everybody put your finger in your nose.
Kick a pick a rock and wipe it on your clothes.
It's the only one that you guys did all the way through.
Kick a pick a rock and wipe it on your clothes.
Everybody doin' it
Pick a burger out and wrap it on your chewing hands
Everybody doin' it, everybody doin' it
Pick a burger, pick a burger
Pick a burger, pick a burger
Pick a burger, pick a burger
I'm with this huge list.
Pile this on me.
It gets to a point where I can't even move anymore.
Can't write.
Can't read.
Can't do anything except try to fight.
Don't you see?
Eddie, hang on.
I've been around in circles till I think that I'm my fault.
And if I take the step to the road, I'm walking down the wall.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.
