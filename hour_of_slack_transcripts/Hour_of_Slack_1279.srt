1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,160
I come from Thebes, and the women of Thebes are warm-blooded, passionate, and we know what we want.

2
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:10,720
What?

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,440
The self-genius, power of SWAT!

4
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,840
Bob!

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:17,460
Bob!

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,140
Bob!

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,120
Bob!

8
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,380
The secret is obvious.

9
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:21,240
Bob!

10
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:21,680
Bob!

11
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:22,000
Bob!

12
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:22,440
Bob!

13
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:22,640


14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,380
What you're about to see we call the Odyssey of Bob's 33 Cocks.

15
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,240
You're traveling through another dimension of dimension.

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,480
You're roughly 55 minutes from idle, Bob.

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,040
But what you've seen occur inside the cock of this Bob is no reflection on Bob.

18
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:52,260
It's a safe, well-engineered, perfectly designed Bob cock.

19
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:56,480
And the men you've just met are trained, cool, highly efficient cocksmen.

20
00:00:56,620 --> 00:00:59,220
The problem is simply that Bob is going too fast.

21
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,760
Bob's 33 Cocks

22
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:12,660
And that sound cutting Fernanda Leamer is pretty swift, too.

23
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:15,800
This is an unusual hour of slack.

24
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:24,320
It's the kind we only release on the Internet, and it only gets played by the most daring or perhaps unsophisticated broadcast stations.

25
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,580
For some time, we've been collecting certain sermons and hymns,

26
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:32,940
and we've been trying to find out what they're all about.

27
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:33,880
And we've been trying to find out what they're all about.

28
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:33,940
And we've been trying to find out what they're all about.

29
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:38,880
The kind that are just too profane and obscene for regular religious broadcasts.

30
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:43,000
And the basket of tracks is now swollen to bursting,

31
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:51,060
so this material must be spewed no matter its possibly offensive nature to the sensibilities of some wussy listeners.

32
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:58,340
This approach is also, by chance, for me, your host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang,

33
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,980
a much easier shot.

34
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,660
I'm not going to go to produce, because there's too much cussin' for me to even think about bleeping and censoring,

35
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:10,000
activities which take up to an hour out of my precious week.

36
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:15,460
This is the subgenius doctrine that, with censoring, just wouldn't work at all,

37
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:17,560
would not be true to Bob,

38
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,640
wouldn't be prudent.

39
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:26,020
We start with a parable told by Dr. Le Guim, one which became legend in subgeniusdom,

40
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,280
oft quoted,

41
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,780
to the extent that it became a meme,

42
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,480
and that took over the recent New York City Go-Fuck-Yourself De-Vival,

43
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:37,160
which incidentally went great.

44
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:40,520
It was one of the best De-Vivals ever, as you'll hear on future shows.

45
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:44,620
Speaking of which, on November 13th, we have the Detroit De-Vival.

46
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,400
But now, from 13th X Day,

47
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,520
the great Dr. Katahdin Le Guim.

48
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:01,340
There was a time back in 1996,

49
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,760
it was the very first X Day drill,

50
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:10,360
and there was this young subgenius fella,

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:14,480
who had heard all the radio shows and read all the books,

52
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,300
and, you know, he was totally into Bob.

53
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,500
He said, well, I'm gonna go out and I'm gonna make that video,

54
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,040
and I'm gonna go to that pilgrimage at the Brushwood,

55
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:24,260
to hang out with my subgenius brethren.

56
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:28,380
And so he drove all day, and he drove all night,

57
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,120
and day after day he drove, until finally, in the middle of the night,

58
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:37,220
he pulled down that dark New York road to where his campsite was.

59
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,900
And he got out of his car,

60
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,340
and he walked off into the woods to look for a camping spot.

61
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:48,160
And while he was walking out in the woods,

62
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,600
he crossed paths with a bear.

63
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,540
The biggest, nastiest fucking bear you ever saw.

64
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:59,640
And that bear raped him, and raped him, and raped him.

65
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,140
It raped him, and raped him, over and over again,

66
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:07,640
in every orifice, in every position that the bear could get into,

67
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:10,400
for seven years.

68
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:17,580
After that seven years was over,

69
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:18,860
the bear became exhausted.

70
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:23,360
He rolled over and pulled his now drooping bear penis

71
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,960
out of the young subgenius' ass,

72
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,800
its tip still dripping with glee.

73
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,320
And that bear wandered away for a long hibernation.

74
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:40,660
And that young subgenius got up,

75
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,820
and he was up on his wobbly legs,

76
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,740
and he began to walk, and he was like,

77
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,420
thank you Bob for having this ordeal be over.

78
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,260
And suddenly, he found himself surrounded by wolves.

79
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,520
And the wolves raped him, and raped him,

80
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,420
and raped him, and raped him.

81
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,620
They raped him over and over again,

82
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,500
in all of his holes, in all of the positions that the wolves could get into,

83
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:06,560
for seven years.

84
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:08,360
.

85
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,660
.

86
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,280
Finally, being too worn out to be of any pleasure to the wolves anymore,

87
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,640
the wolves scattered and ran off into the forest.

88
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:25,600
And that young subgenius began to walk,

89
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,500
and he walked, and he walked,

90
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,160
and finally he heard the sounds of people,

91
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,860
and he came out of the woods,

92
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:38,160
and was greeted by a large man in a black hat,

93
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,280
and he said,

94
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,140
Priest Collar.

95
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,180
.

96
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:48,160
And that man in the priest collar looked at him and said,

97
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,860
Brother, it took you a long time to get here,

98
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,820
but you're welcome here among us now.

99
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:54,900
.

100
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:58,020
And they raped him, and raped him,

101
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,980
and raped him, and raped him.

102
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:02,480
There were so many of them, they made new holes,

103
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,180
and they raped, and raped, and raped, and raped,

104
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,200
and raped, and raped, and raped those holes.

105
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,620
.

106
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,400
For seven years,

107
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,900
in every position,

108
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:15,780
.

109
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:18,980
in every combination,

110
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:20,700
.

111
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,020
finally,

112
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,260
he escaped from those people,

113
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,140
.

114
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,600
and he made it out

115
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,040
to Bailey Hill Road,

116
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:36,240
and was hit by a truck.

117
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,020
.

118
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,040
His body was picked up by the local police.

119
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:42,760
.

120
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:46,300
They took him down to the local mortuary,

121
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:46,920
.

122
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,840
where the mortician raped him, and raped him,

123
00:06:49,880 --> 00:06:51,780
and raped him, and raped him,

124
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,560
and raped him, and raped him, and raped him,

125
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,700
and raped him some more,

126
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,720
in every hole and in every position,

127
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,880
. and you can get into a lot of positions

128
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,420
when somebody's not complaining.

129
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:01,480
.

130
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:03,780
For seven years!

131
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:04,600
.

132
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,420
.

133
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,320
Finally, the mortician couldn't put the family off any longer,

134
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,660
and they put him out in a coffin.

135
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,420
.

136
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:15,820
And his family came to mourn,

137
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,500
. and they came through the chapel,

138
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,720
and they walked past his coffin,

139
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,860
. and they looked down at him, and they said,

140
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:23,820
. hmm.

141
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,640
. And they raped him, and raped him, and raped him, and raped him,

142
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:31,380
. they raped him, and raped him, and raped him some more,

143
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:34,580
. and spread out this immense chain of people,

144
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:35,000
. and this massive chain of rape,

145
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,120
. that spread across the land,

146
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:40,000
. and everyone died of dog and bear AIDS,

147
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:40,740
. the end.

148
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,260
.

149
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,080
.

150
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,000
.

151
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,180
.

152
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:47,500
.

153
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:47,560
.

154
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:47,600
.

155
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:59,260
. And when the bodies began to overflow the local morgue,

156
00:07:59,340 --> 00:07:59,540
.

157
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,440
. they were spread out among the other morgues in the county,

158
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:04,560
. and they were spread out among the other morgues in the county,

159
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,760
. where they were raped and raped,

160
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,340
. and raped and raped,

161
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,740
. and raped and raped,

162
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:10,340
. and raped and raped,

163
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:10,740
. and raped some more.

164
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,140
.

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,040
. And the moral of the story is,

166
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:16,440
. is that when you're driving around New York at night,

167
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,780
. always read the street signs,

168
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:21,440
. because you might end up at Baptist camp like he did.

169
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,280
.

170
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,380
.

171
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,380
.

172
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,180
.

173
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:44,240
.

174
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,260
.

175
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,700
Die muthafucka die.

176
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:48,820
Won't you die muthafucka, die.

177
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,860
Die muthafucka die.

178
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:57,200
Every body sing.

179
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,800
Die muthafucka die.

180
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,660
Won't you die muthafucka, die.

181
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:07,320
Die muthafucka die.

182
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,780
Die, won't you die, motherfucker, die

183
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:28,840
Die, die, die, die, die, die, die

184
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,200
Die

185
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,920
Die

186
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,920
Don't suck on the mic.

187
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:09,260
I've learned.

188
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,740
This vision of beauty on the stage,

189
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,460
this wonderful, wonderful, wonderful angel of slack.

190
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,220
Oh, jeez.

191
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:20,520
Don't lay it on too thick.

192
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,800
I'll deliver.

193
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,520
This is Suzy the floozy.

194
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,380
And she is to begin our ranchers for the evening.

195
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,680
So one more round of applause for Suzy the floozy.

196
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,360
Thank you.

197
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,080
Thank you.

198
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,860
Thank, thank, thank you so much.

199
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,040
You know, now there has been some criticism tossed my way

200
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,000
because, frankly, it's a little undeniable

201
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,160
that the floozy is starting to get old.

202
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,740
No!

203
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:59,460
Now, I noticed lately my lizard's been taking up

204
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,320
biting ass for shits and giggles.

205
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:03,540
He's kind of getting old, too.

206
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:06,480
And I've kind of noticed a sea change

207
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,300
in Dr. Lovett.

208
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,740
He seems to be, his love has ripened into vengeance.

209
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:17,200
And Stang, Stang's getting even more crotchety and ugly,

210
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,320
if you'll notice.

211
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:24,680
I mean, it's a natural progression

212
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,200
from compassion to compression.

213
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,820
Because when things get old, they get mean.

214
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:32,840
Yeah!

215
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,020
And I've been getting mean lately.

216
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:40,960
And I don't even have to channel even evil Suzy anymore

217
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,840
to get there, if you know what I mean.

218
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:46,860
Because I'm losing my looks, I'm losing my senses,

219
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:49,440
and lately I'm losing my mind.

220
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:55,440
But I plan on utterly embracing my hideosity.

221
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:58,460
Because I think there's room in the world

222
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:00,240
for another thing like I'm becoming,

223
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,640
because evil, after all, Edith Massey's dead,

224
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,040
so maybe there's room for something else.

225
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,620
Oh, there's room for me to totally let go,

226
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,080
because before I'm totally gone,

227
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:16,360
I'm here to seduce you.

228
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:22,820
I am here to stroke you.

229
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,940
Yes, I am here to exhort you to come over

230
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:32,260
and sit on the new face of the Church of the Subgenius.

231
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:34,580
Mine.

232
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,500
Because yes, it's true,

233
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:42,620
I stand before you with a mouthful of schism.

234
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,800
Look at it this way.

235
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:50,240
Staying here ain't done zilch point shit

236
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,420
in getting us off this planet, has he?

237
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,860
Look at him, look at him.

238
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:03,300
Well, why not just switch horrors in the middle of a stream?

239
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:06,440
Maybe that might help our luck some, I've been thinking.

240
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,700
I mean, in the middle of a steady piss stream,

241
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,400
try a new erection for a change.

242
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,840
Maybe that's what we need to finally get off.

243
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:21,340
Because I sure as Shynola can't be any more disaffected

244
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:24,360
than Commissar Stangevich's thousand-year plan here.

245
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:29,140
Because you know what I'm prepared to give you, seekers?

246
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:29,940
What's that?

247
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,440
Praise it!

248
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,080
Oh, dude!

249
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,300
I'm prepared to give you my heart.

250
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,240
Oh, man!

251
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,680
Whoa, field goal!

252
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,620
And if you give me your hearts,

253
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,500
if you give me your souls,

254
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,420
and let me hold your wallets for a little while.

255
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:57,140
For a processing, you understand.

256
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,940
Just don't think about that at all.

257
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,180
Think about this.

258
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:06,320
Yes, I'm laying it on the line, boys and girls.

259
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,640
You join my team, I'll give you a blow job.

260
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,360
After I carve a backwards S on your face,

261
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
so you don't think it's a five or something

262
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,120
when you look on the mirror, because I want to leave a trace.

263
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:24,780
So, hey, who's with me?

264
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:28,140
It's a chance to join my cult and get in on my ground floor.

265
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:33,100
So that's all I'm offering tonight, baby.

266
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,020
Who's going to follow me?

267
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,300
My tits are on fire.

268
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:36,620
Yeah!

269
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:36,620


270
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,120
Yeah!

271
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,340
Yeah!

272
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:39,900
Yeah!

273
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,260
Yeah!

274
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:40,560
Yeah!

275
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:40,800


276
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:40,980
Yeah!

277
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,180
Yeah!

278
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:42,080
Slack.

279
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,740
Anti-slack.

280
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:49,920
You know, there's been such good stuff on this stage.

281
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,620
Pardon me, you know.

282
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,760
There's been a lot of really good stuff on this stage.

283
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:58,960
I probably came three or four times in the past couple of days.

284
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,680
Easily just at the stage.

285
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,020
Not counting the shit in my tent, all right?

286
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,720
Because I've been...

287
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,500
You see, I am an uberfem.

288
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,280
I am an uberfem of the finest quality.

289
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:24,820
And I have been looking and looking and looking for that something special.

290
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,180
That certain something to finally get me off.

291
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:33,340
And you know what?

292
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,380
It's not what you're thinking or you're thinking or you're thinking.

293
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,120
Because I know what you're thinking.

294
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:40,580
You're thinking, she must be an insatiable fucking slut.

295
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,400
Well, this is true too.

296
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,640
But that's not what I'm looking for, brothers and sisters.

297
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:54,940
Because you can have a dick the size of the wall of fucking China.

298
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,920
And you can eat pussy like 13 motherfuckers.

299
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:00,900
But...

300
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,420
You really...

301
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:05,420
Really...

302
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:09,320
Really have to have a fucking hot brain.

303
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:11,660
You see, I don't necessarily want your cock.

304
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,720
No, no, no.

305
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,100
And you know, I like chicks too.

306
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,300
And I like pussy.

307
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,980
But that's not what I'm looking for.

308
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,280
What I want to do is crack that skull open.

309
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:24,240
And just grind on that fucking hot brain of yours.

310
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:35,620
I want to feel those synapses twitching in my synapses.

311
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:36,360
I want to feel those synapses twitching in my synapses.

312
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:46,720
I want to feel your neurons in my naughty bits.

313
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,400
Now this is why I'm up here.

314
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:54,140
Because you know what I'm looking for?

315
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:59,320
Is someone to sort of encourage this.

316
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,040
You know, I see some brains out here.

317
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,180
And I tell you, well you see...

318
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:03,280
No, no, no. That one's worthless.

319
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,480
Let me scan.

320
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,280
Jesus, y'all drink a lot more than I have.

321
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,180
Somebody needs to show me...

322
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:16,540
What they've got in that brain.

323
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:20,460
Somebody needs to show me this.

324
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,720
I want to hear...

325
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,860
I want to hear your hate.

326
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,340
I want to hear your love.

327
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,920
I want to hear your slack.

328
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,280
I want to hear your...

329
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,320
I want to hear your...

330
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,360
I want to hear your...

331
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:36,360


332
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:40,380
And I've got to tell you, I don't know why you shouldn't...

333
00:17:40,380 --> 00:17:41,400
Some of these guys have been okay.

334
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,840
This is open mic, you know.

335
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,600
I mean I don't expect fucking professional fucking ranters.

336
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:49,000
I don't expect you to blow my mind like Pope Black did.

337
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:53,140
I don't expect you to make me come in my undies like Susie the floozy did.

338
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,960
But for fuck's sake.

339
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,300
Let's really pull this off.

340
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,080
This is a challenger.

341
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,800
Thank you for watching.

342
00:18:41,700 --> 00:19:03,460
Thank you for watching.

343
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:36,200
Thank you for watching.

Thank you for watching.

Thank you for watching.

Thank you for watching.

Thank you for watching.

351
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:22,660
Thank you for watching.

352
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,160
Thank you for watching.

353
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,400
Thank you for watching.

354
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:46,120
Thank you for watching.

355
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:35,500
Thank you for watching.

356
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:59,340
Thank you for watching.

357
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:22,020
Thank you for watching.

358
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:22,020


359
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,700
Thank you for watching.

360
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,520
Thank you for watching.

361
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:28,340
Thank you for watching.

362
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,620
Thank you for watching.

363
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,920
Thank you for watching.

364
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,440
I'll make the same mistake too.

365
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:38,040
It's all right.

366
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:38,580
It's all right.

367
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,280
But really, really, really, really, really, you have to understand.

368
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,540
Please, please, please, please stop fucking pinks.

369
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:47,880
Please.

370
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:48,560
It's nothing.

371
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,640
It won't work.

372
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,440
It won't work.

373
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,540
They're not ready for you.

374
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:56,360
Do not spread your legs unless they've paid their $30.

375
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,140
Please.

376
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,020
Oh, Bob, damn it.

377
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:01,840
You just don't understand.

378
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:07,220
Understand all the pink is going to do is just take your slack.

379
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:10,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

380
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:14,080
You know, it might be fun for a little while because you're all fucked up.

381
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:18,440
But you know, he's going to take your slack in the end.

382
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:19,080
Or she is.

383
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:20,120
She will.

384
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,400
Them pink girls.

385
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:28,360
But please, please, please, before I go on to the next answer, please promise me.

386
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,360
If you want to.

387
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,080
To get it on with that pink boy or girl.

388
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:44,720
If you really, for whatever reason, are absolutely getting the biggest dick or clit hard on for that pink boy or girl.

389
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,420
Just pay their damn membership.

390
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,920
Just pay the 30 bucks for them.

391
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,240
You know, don't fuck pinks.

392
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:57,120
Now, I want you to repeat this because I need you to understand this.

393
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,080
This needs to go in your head.

394
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,700
So here's what I want you to say.

395
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,840
I will not fuck a pink.

396
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:08,780
I will not fuck a pink.

397
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:11,940
Let's try this one more time because I think it needs to get across.

398
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,600
I will not fuck a pink.

399
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,300
I will not fuck a pink.

400
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,600
This is a mantra that should be in your brain.

401
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:20,500
Die.

402
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,500
Motherfucker, die.

403
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:24,780
Motherfucker, die.

404
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:26,960
Motherfucker, die.

405
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:29,180
Die.

406
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:29,800
This is our beer.

407
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,500
But, you know, as an audience, you're pretty well lubricated now.

408
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:39,300
So this is going to be like throwing a hot dog down a hallway, you know?

409
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,640
Well, friends.

410
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,920
Hey, fuck you.

411
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:57,780
If you were to take a pair of what let's call it a chrono vision viewing goggles.

412
00:28:57,900 --> 00:28:59,800
They look kind of like x-ray specs.

413
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,700
But, you know, kind of.

414
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,460
Clock kind of things.

415
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:08,560
If you're going to put those on and you look back through history, you would see a long cycle of pink civilization.

416
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,280
You know, creation and destruction.

417
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,460
They get to a point where they almost have something good.

418
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:21,180
And then some dumb ass decides, oh, I'm just going to pull the lever on the entire pink civilization toilet.

419
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,320
And then they're back to square one.

420
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:29,960
But like some kind of turd floater, the pinks seem to survive.

421
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:44,540
Now, if you try to try to picture one of those evolutionary posters you see in you would see in biology class showing the evolution of the pinks from pond scum to a monkey to whatever the fuck they are now.

422
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,840
Now, take that image.

423
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:58,780
And if you would just look to the side, you would see the entire evolutionary history of the subgenie all the way back to the Yetis sitting in lawn chairs, drinking beer.

424
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,300
And every once in a while going.

425
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:03,020
What the fuck just happened?

426
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:06,280
I didn't think they were going to do that again.

427
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:10,840
Hey, Astro Piscis, pass me another beer.

428
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,540
Oh, shit, that hurt.

429
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,100
Because, I mean, that's the situation, friends.

430
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:22,120
In this in this world, we are merely cosmic observers in the Jack Kirby sense.

431
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,920
You know, hecklers, galactic SOBs.

432
00:30:26,140 --> 00:30:27,880
We're not here to do shit.

433
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,280
You know, the pinks might think they rock.

434
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:30,840
They might run everything.

435
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:32,320
They think they control the world.

436
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,860
They can try to give it a mediocrity shellacking.

437
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:51,740
But that doesn't get past the fact of the real the real strangeness, the weirdness of the world that's been seeping and boiling on this planet since, you know, since before, you know, they were even, you know, sentient life.

438
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:57,920
Back when they were pond scum, the Yetis in Atlantis were installing hyper dimensional Internet in Atlantis.

439
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,100
So, yeah.

440
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,280
So, yeah.

441
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:00,960
So, you know, we may take that.

442
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,860
Fuck that.

443
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,080
Okay.

444
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:07,240
And, you know, some people have asked me, you know, in all this and all this.

445
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:08,140
Well, well, McGee.

446
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:08,420
Okay.

447
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,500
Well, we're in all this.

448
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,380
Well, what is the Church of the Subgenius?

449
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:17,720
The Church of the Subgenius, friends, is a big ol' face and we're all shitting on it.

450
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:20,480
We're all taking a big ol' shit.

451
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:24,220
But it's okay because that man, Bob, can take it.

452
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:28,740
He can take it because he's too stupid to know that he can't.

453
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:30,260
So you can, you know, take it.

454
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:30,260


455
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,600
Take the shit on Bob's face.

456
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,660
You can beat him up.

457
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:33,320
You can cut it.

458
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:36,760
You can get it all the way down to the bone, to the very gray matter.

459
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:39,280
And you'll, you know what you're gonna see?

460
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,400
Another Dobbs head.

461
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,820
It's gonna pop right back out.

462
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:50,540
Because like, like a lizard's tail, Bob just keeps coming back and coming back and coming

463
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:50,800
back.

464
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,480
He's too stupid to know that he can't do that.

465
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:58,940
And so, you know, as all the pink deities, you know, wither and die.

466
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,720
Or are knocked off the shelf.

467
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:03,800
Or are subjected to various factory recalls.

468
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:09,740
We here at the Church of the Subgenius can rest happily knowing that every microsecond,

469
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:15,240
there is a fresh Dobbs waiting for us to give us slack.

470
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,220
Praise Bob!

471
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,480
Praise that, praise fuckin' Bob!

472
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,680
Praise that face!

473
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,060
Praise it!

474
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,300
Praise Bob!

475
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:26,700
And so, for these last few hours, as we are awaiting the saucers.

476
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,520
We can just.

477
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:37,740
Just rest in peace knowing that as the world's burning and as all this is going on, we can

478
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:44,840
still laugh and enjoy this cosmic evolutionary just joke that's happening throughout the

479
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:45,440
rest of the world.

480
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,760
Praise Bob!

481
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,160
Praise Bob!

482
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,020
Praise Bob!

483
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,860
Praise Bob!

484
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,540
Praise Bob!

485
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:54,220
Praise Bob!

486
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:54,240


487
00:32:54,260 --> 00:32:54,260


488
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:54,520
Praise Bob!

489
00:32:54,520 --> 00:32:54,540
Praise Bob!

490
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,520
Praise Bob!

491
00:32:58,360 --> 00:32:58,920
Praise Bob!

492
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,500
Praise Bob!

493
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,400
Praise Bob!

494
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:07,700
Praise Bob!

495
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:08,800
Praise Bob!

496
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:09,580
Praise Bob!

497
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,360


498
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:10,360


499
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:10,380


500
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:10,380


501
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,140
praise.

502
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,140


503
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,140


504
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:17,960
Praise Bob!

505
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:18,240
Praise Bob!

506
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:18,380
Praise Bob!

507
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:18,660
Praise Bob!

508
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:18,860
Praise Bob!

509
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:18,860


510
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:18,860


511
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:18,860


512
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:18,860


513
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,960
Praise Bob!

514
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,160
Praise Bob!

515
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,820
Praise Bob!

516
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,240
Praise Bob!

517
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:30,220
I ever joining Priestess Pisces in the vocalizing this time.

518
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:33,980
That band had Philo Drummond from the Swinging Love Corps,

519
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:36,580
Reverend Angry Larry from the Amino Acids,

520
00:33:36,660 --> 00:33:38,840
Reverend Suds from Monkey Hive,

521
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:41,940
and a whole cast of characters, my friends.

522
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:50,200
Priestess Pisces also did the Don't Fuck Pinks and Fuck Your Brain rants.

523
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,700
Now we will go to Dr. Howell, Dr. Philo Drummond,

524
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:57,180
Pope Black and myself in an unseemly discussion

525
00:33:57,180 --> 00:33:59,640
that had started out innocently enough

526
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,940
about the first subgenius feature film, Arise.

527
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:08,620
It was important to get this message out to the world's suffering millions.

528
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,960
Actually, Film Threat Magazine called Arise

529
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,080
one of the ten must-have underground videos.

530
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,160
Of course, they said that in the year of 1995,

531
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,540
so things may have changed.

532
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:24,500
Unless the Onion hasn't come to interview us,

533
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:24,880
yet.

534
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,560
I'm finding that really irksome.

535
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,560
They probably would consider anything they could get from us.

536
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,600
This week they interviewed Joan Rivers.

537
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:36,300
Now, what's with that?

538
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,460
Well, she's had a lot more Botox than you have.

539
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:42,180
Is that what it...

540
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,760
Have you seen her face lately?

541
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:46,300
I've tried to avoid it.

542
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:47,160
It's like a...

543
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,240
I'd do her.

544
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,180
Man, I'd jack off in her face in a second.

545
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,400
She is a tummler, as they say.

546
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:53,180
A fighter.

547
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:53,600
A striker.

548
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,100
I'd do it.

549
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,000
Just so I could say,

550
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,340
yeah, I'd jack off in Joan Rivers' face.

551
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,360
You can admire many obnoxious people

552
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:05,180
for their internal sense of strength and power.

553
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:05,840
Jackoff-ability.

554
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,440
Enables them to go on and on.

555
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,960
I was inspired by Pope David N. Meyer,

556
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:13,640
who bragged to me once

557
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,920
that he was going to date...

558
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:19,000
He was taking out a girl who was a Mormon.

559
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:21,240
And he actually said this to me on tape.

560
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:21,660
He goes,

561
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:23,720
This I vow to you, Reverend Stang.

562
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,580
I will spunk in the face of a Mormon.

563
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:29,360
That was what he was trying...

564
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,460
That was his motivation of dating a Mormon.

565
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:33,560
That guy, he has his priorities right.

566
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:36,700
And to this day,

567
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,520
I have never spunked in the face of a Mormon myself.

568
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,080
That I know of.

569
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,160
A moron.

570
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,100
Right, morons.

571
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,060
Well...

572
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,800
Look at this.

573
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,820
A brand new copy is worth 99 bucks.

574
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,040
Of what?

575
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:53,920
It's still in the shrink wrap.

576
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,000
Of the...

577
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:55,960
Arise video.

578
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,280
Boxed Arise video.

579
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:57,960
Brand new.

580
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,800
Still in the shrink wrap.

581
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,100
Same one that's in Swag Jack.

582
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,140
99 bucks.

583
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:05,660
Collector Shangri-La is selling it for $98.98

584
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,940
plus $2.98 shipping.

585
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,220
And the comments are,

586
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,620
Brand new in shrink wrap.

587
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,300
Rare and hard to find.

588
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:14,820
13 minutes remain to buy this item.

589
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:18,240
There's a topless young girl running around on the field out there.

590
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,700
Plus as an extra bonus,

591
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,280
you'll get a five minute video.

592
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:22,600
She doesn't get sunburned.

593
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:23,720
A five minute video.

594
00:36:23,720 --> 00:36:25,060
What about the mana,

595
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,060
the magical effluvium,

596
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:29,040
which is manifest by this object,

597
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,380
the unseen,

598
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,380
palpable radiation of etheric forces,

599
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,780
which emanates from such an important

600
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,960
and keystone early souvenir of subgenius thought.

601
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,860
What about that, eh?

602
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:42,940
Can that be measured?

603
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,060
Is it not an intangible,

604
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,100
like the sunlight on a baby's behind?

605
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,160
What?

606
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,900
Are you playing that background music?

607
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,020
What is that weird noise?

608
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:52,100
It's gone now.

609
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:52,440
Don't worry.

610
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:53,360
Those were crickets.

611
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:55,120
Just, that was all, uh, nothing.

612
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:55,720
Nothing.

613
00:36:55,720 --> 00:36:56,720
Yeah, don't ever give up.

614
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:57,720
I didn't hear anything.

615
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,720
I don't like to stress the

616
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,200
Don't ever give up your copy of Arise

617
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:02,040
dwindling time factor

618
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,880
because it looks like even the VHS

619
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,460
where the swag shack is concerned.

620
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:09,380
After all, time is a thing of dragonflies and angels.

621
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,900
The former live too little and the latter live too long.

622
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,360
But within a very short and easily achievable space of time,

623
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,460
you can transport yourself to the swag shack

624
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:23,580
and return laden like a fortune,

625
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,140
a fortunate trader,

626
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,480
triumphant with the spoils you have achieved.

627
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,620
We've talked about slack.

628
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,080
We've talked about anti-slack.

629
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,940
Yeah, because slack's whatever you make it.

630
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,100
Really.

631
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:39,760
You know, I mean, my slack might be watching gangbang porn.

632
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:42,380
That's all right.

633
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,400
Your slack might be watching furry porn.

634
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,800
That's all right too, though.

635
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,100
You know, that kind of creeps me out just a smooch.

636
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,220
But hey, it's your slack.

637
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:53,140
And you know what?

638
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:53,940
That's what that's about.

639
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,580
I ain't gonna fringe on your slack.

640
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,980
It's not my point.

641
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,140
Hell yeah.

642
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:00,840
You see, just because I've got tits in a cunt

643
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:03,680
doesn't mean I expect you to fucking worship me.

644
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:03,920
No.

645
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,360
Better not.

646
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:06,140
I don't.

647
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,440
But you know, I see a lot of that shit.

648
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:11,380
A lot of you boys falling for this game.

649
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:12,840
It's pinks. It's pinks.

650
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,240
You know, and they can say that they're subgenius,

651
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,420
but it's pinks. It's pinks.

652
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,200
Because you know what?

653
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:20,980
The great thing about subgeniuses is us uberfims are equal.

654
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,020
And you are equal.

655
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:24,360
You're equal to the uberfims, you boys.

656
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,260
It's the same.

657
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,460
You're blowing my mind.

658
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,620
We're all pinks.

659
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:32,200
No, I'm not blowing your mind, babe.

660
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,600
I'm not.

661
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:34,380
You know this.

662
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,760
You know this.

663
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,700
And really what this is gonna come down to is a simple fact.

664
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,040
We all want slack.

665
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,040
We all want to get off.

666
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:51,960
And we all want to get off of this planet.

667
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,000
Can I get off?

668
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:53,000


669
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:53,980
Can I get a praise, Bob?

670
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,720
Praise Bob!

671
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,740
I can't hear you, motherfuckers.

672
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,400
Can I get a praise, Bob?

673
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,960
Praise Bob!

674
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,500
Hallelujah.

675
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:04,180
Hey.

676
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,760
Sometimes you feel the spirit just sort of moving you.

677
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:12,220
And then you realize, well, you know, maybe you just drank too much.

678
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:13,760
John.

679
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,980
Motherfucker John.

680
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,220
Motherfucker John.

681
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:20,020
Look at the children dancing.

682
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:20,580
Motherfucker John.

683
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,000
It's time.

684
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:23,000


685
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:24,840
Motherfucker, die.

686
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,300
Motherfucker, die.

687
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,560
Motherfucker, die.

688
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:30,780
Motherfucker, die.

689
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:31,660
It's time.

690
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:32,900
Just stop breathing.

691
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:35,340
Close your eyes!

692
00:39:35,560 --> 00:39:36,240
It's time.

693
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:38,380
Motherfucker, it's time.

694
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,400
It's time.

695
00:39:40,860 --> 00:39:44,220
Motherfucker, motherfucker, motherfucker, motherfucker, die.

696
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:47,000
Motherfucker, motherfucker, die.

697
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,260
Motherfucker, motherfucker, die.

698
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,440
It's time.

699
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:00,420
I love song for all the subgeniuses

700
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,520
With the eminence of the world

701
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,880
Die, die, die

702
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,200
Motherfucker die

703
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,380
Motherfucker die

704
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,760
Boys and girls, I know there's a couple other ones out there.

705
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:20,280
In fact, I see one right now.

706
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:24,940
And let me, you know, give you a proper introduction.

707
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,660
Yeah, I can't get mine out of this fucking corset, I'm sorry.

708
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:35,200
This is, you're fairly new.

709
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,800
This is a first sex date, first time up here.

710
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:42,680
This is Admiral Tit.

711
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,160
Admiral Tit.

712
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:48,160
And you have something you'd like to share.

713
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,500
Thank you.

714
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:52,140
I have a lot of things that I'd like to share.

715
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,260
Share your tits!

716
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,780
I'm shy of cameras, I'm sorry.

717
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,580
Catch me later.

718
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,240
I'll be here all week.

719
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:06,960
I've seen some of the most impressive drinking I have ever seen.

720
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:11,420
And my family is full of alcoholics.

721
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,780
So that's saying something.

722
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:13,540
Fuck yeah!

723
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:14,340
Yeah!

724
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,540
So I have a little song I'm going to teach you.

725
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,700
You are going to help me sing it.

726
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,980
And it doesn't matter how fucked up you are, because I'm pretty fucked up right now.

727
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:25,560
Yeah!

728
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:29,060
So if I can remember the words, you can learn them.

729
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:33,260
Now, who here remembers that glorious movie, The Sound of Music?

730
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:34,740
Yeah!

731
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:36,760
Yeah!

732
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,520
Yeah, Maria!

733
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:40,440
Who here knows their ABCs?

734
00:41:40,820 --> 00:41:41,380
I do!

735
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:43,000
Okay.

736
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:43,920
I do!

737
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:48,680
So what we're going to do is we're going to practice a line, and then we're going to go into the real song, okay?

738
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,040
You'll know the first one.

739
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:53,480
Let's begin at the very beginning.

740
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,740
Come on, you drunk motherfuckers, you can do this.

741
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,500
It's a very good place to start.

742
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:05,460
When you read, you begin with A, B, C.

743
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:11,560
When you drink, you begin with beer, wine, mead.

744
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:13,880
Beer, wine, mead.

745
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:16,040
Beer, wine, mead.

746
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:18,300
Beer, wine, mead.

747
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,140
Beer, wine, mead.

748
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,440
Scrunch, rum, gin, rye, beer.

749
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:25,020
Beer, wine, mead.

750
00:42:25,260 --> 00:42:27,240
Scrunch, rum, gin, rye, beer.

751
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:28,720
Beer, wine, mead.

752
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:30,060
You drunk motherfuckers, I love you.

753
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:31,640
Okay, here's how it's going to go.

754
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,980
I'm going to sing it, and then you guys are going to help me, and we're going to sing it a second time.

755
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:40,740
And then you're going to go home and offend friends with all kinds of wonderful stories from here.

756
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,300
Ready?

757
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,760
Let's begin at the very beginning.

758
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:49,800
It's a very good place to start.

759
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:54,540
When you read, you begin with A, B, C.

760
00:42:55,060 --> 00:43:00,080
When you drink, you begin with beer, wine, mead.

761
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:02,280
Beer, wine, mead.

762
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:04,200
Beer, wine, mead.

763
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,220
Beer, wine, mead.

764
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:08,000
Beer, wine, mead.

765
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:10,960
Scrunch, rum, gin, rye, beer.

766
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:12,780
Fucking cotton mouth.

767
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:13,440
Okay.

768
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:16,540
Thank you.

769
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,580
Crazy end of the month.

770
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:19,780
Crazy end of the month.

771
00:43:19,780 --> 00:43:20,420
Praise Bob!

772
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:27,560
Beer is good and from a keg.

773
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:31,260
Wine is tasty from a box.

774
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:36,200
Meat is smooth and really sweet.

775
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:40,180
Scotch is best when on the rocks.

776
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:44,640
Gin, you mix it with some juice.

777
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,060
Rum, it fills you with good cheer.

778
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:49,760
Cheers!

779
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:53,600
Rye, it makes you very loose.

780
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:58,840
And that brings us back to beer, beer, beer.

781
00:43:59,060 --> 00:43:59,900
Beer, beer, beer.

782
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:03,360
Beer is good and from a keg.

783
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:07,060
Wine is tasty from a box.

784
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:11,660
Meat is smooth and really sweet.

785
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:15,580
Scotch is best when on the rocks.

786
00:44:16,780 --> 00:44:19,700
Gin, you mix it with some juice.

787
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:19,760
Rum, it fills you with good cheer.

788
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:19,760


789
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:19,760


790
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:19,760


791
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:19,760


792
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:19,760


793
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:24,020
Juice, rum, it fills you with good cheer.

794
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:28,360
Rye, it makes you very loose.

795
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:29,520
Rye, it makes you very loose.

796
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:33,900
And that brings us back to beer, beer, beer.

797
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:35,220
Beer, beer, beer.

798
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:36,760
You guys rock!

799
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:39,160
You guys rock!

800
00:44:40,660 --> 00:44:42,020
You guys rock!

801
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:42,620


802
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:46,620
Now we're getting the hang of it.

803
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:48,260
Hell yes!

804
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:49,020
Woo!

805
00:44:51,140 --> 00:44:53,080
Starting to get a little mm-hmm.

806
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:54,140
Mm-hmm.

807
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:54,980
Mm-hmm.

808
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:58,780
Hello my brothers and sisters in Slack.

809
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:00,840
Praise Bob!

810
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:05,900
I am the Reverend Dr. Priestess Princess Popus Pocket.

811
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,400
And I'm here to talk to you about a few things tonight.

812
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:13,560
There's one thing I really want to talk about.

813
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:16,700
And that is the end of the motherfucking world tomorrow!

814
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:18,200
And that is the end of the motherfucking world tomorrow!

815
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:18,240
And that is the end of the motherfucking world tomorrow!

816
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:19,720
Praise Bob!

817
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:21,700
Praise Bob!

818
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,440
Are you ready for the end of the motherfucking world tomorrow?

819
00:45:25,080 --> 00:45:25,680
Are you ready for the end of the motherfucking world tomorrow?

820
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:25,680


821
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:30,540
You paid your $30, and with that $30, you got two things.

822
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:32,660
You got the pleasure saucers.

823
00:45:32,840 --> 00:45:33,800
You got the pleasure saucers.

824
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:35,320
And you got luck.

825
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:36,800
And you got luck.

826
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:38,540
You got luck.

827
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:40,200
The luck plane.

828
00:45:41,140 --> 00:45:44,120
I am not going to rant at you. I am going to preach at you tonight.

829
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:47,880
I am not going to rant at you. I am going to preach at you tonight.

830
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:49,880
You people that are here tonight,

831
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,720
You are the luckiest

832
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,700
Yeti mutants on the face of the earth.

833
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:55,500
Yeti mutants on the face of the earth.

834
00:45:55,500 --> 00:45:56,620
Praise Bob!

835
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,120
You know there's all this speculation

836
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:02,020
and bullshit. Oh, you pay your $30

837
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:03,820
and you're getting on that pleasure saucer.

838
00:46:04,120 --> 00:46:05,000
I'm sorry.

839
00:46:05,460 --> 00:46:07,980
Unless you are in a Dobbs approved location,

840
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:11,080
odds are, you're not getting on that saucer.

841
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:11,340
odds are, you're not getting on that saucer.

842
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,300
The X's, they ain't no bus stop.

843
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:16,900
They're not going to go house to house to come get you to go to space.

844
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:17,260
They're not going to go house to house to come get you to go to space.

845
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,320
You lucky fuckers, you are here

846
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,800
and you're going on the saucers.

847
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:22,920
Praise Bob!

848
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:25,660
Can I get one more?

849
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,320
Praise Bob!

850
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,960
Tomorrow marks the end of all the bullshit.

851
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,820
We burn our hate.

852
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,920
It marks the end of all bad drivers.

853
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,160
The end of fucking Walmart.

854
00:46:35,580 --> 00:46:37,300
The end of the fucking world.

855
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:39,600
Praise Bob!

856
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,640
And it all comes back to luck

857
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:44,920
in your $30.

858
00:46:45,780 --> 00:46:47,540
And it's going to be a short rant tonight.

859
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:48,300
I do apologize.

860
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,740
But my luck has kind of turned and I think my throat

861
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:52,980
is going to fall out of my mouth.

862
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,220
So praise Bob!

863
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,040
Hail to luck plane!

864
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,140
And see you on the fucking pleasure ships!

865
00:46:58,820 --> 00:46:59,700
Praise Bob!

866
00:47:04,340 --> 00:47:05,380
Praise Bob!

867
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:05,860
Praise Bob!

868
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:07,480
Praise Bob!

869
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:08,160
Praise Bob!

870
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:08,620
Praise Bob!

871
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,760
Praise Bob!

872
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:12,800

I ain't very happy I broke in the way that he broke

881

You're a stain on the carpet

Your mom, your dad

883
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:06,560
Your dad should have pulled out early

884
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,500
I'm talking with Bonanza

885
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:15,800
Eating a banana

886
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:19,020
Slip on a peel

887
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:22,160
Choking on a pit

888
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:37,160
Alright, I'm going to test you a little bit of a rate

889
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:38,360
I don't know if you'll be able to hear me or not

890
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,260
But I got this thing that's about bad drivers

891
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:42,480
And the fact that they don't know how to drive

892
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,500
And they don't use their fucking signals nearly enough

893
00:48:45,240 --> 00:48:47,280
You know, you don't get taxed on that

894
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:50,860
You don't have to pay extra for your car

895
00:48:50,860 --> 00:48:52,740
To use that little thing there on the side

896
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:53,820
That tells you which way

897
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:56,520
Tells me which way you're going to go back and forth

898
00:48:57,220 --> 00:48:58,980
So use the fucking signal

899
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:00,940
We're not mind ringers

900
00:49:00,940 --> 00:49:02,280
We like to drive

901
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:03,600
I told people that are driving

902
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,780
Don't have brains in their fucking heads anyway

903
00:49:06,480 --> 00:49:09,360
Since I'm talking about brains and all the whole zombie thing

904
00:49:10,080 --> 00:49:11,720
Zombies really don't want to eat your brains!

905
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:14,860
See, when you go to the supermarket

906
00:49:14,860 --> 00:49:16,280
You don't just buy coconut

907
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,660
You buy coconut and it's already shredded up

908
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:21,980
Because it takes a lot of fucking work to get inside there

909
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:22,680
To get it out of life

910
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:24,320
Brain mass is on your melody

911
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:28,840
The zombie's going to eat you no matter what

912
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:30,460
It's not going to come from your brain

913
00:49:30,460 --> 00:49:32,100
It's going to come from your arm or whatever

914
00:49:32,100 --> 00:49:34,480
You dumb shit stick in their face

915
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:39,000
Oh, and all the guys from Rare

916
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:40,420
The big guys like

917
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:42,480
Like Jack O'Lantern

918
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:44,520
The big guys like

919
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:44,980
Like Kloss

920
00:49:45,760 --> 00:49:47,460
They don't have to worry much

921
00:49:47,460 --> 00:49:49,200
Because there's a lot of stuff to get through

922
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:50,880
To get to all the vital stuff underneath

923
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:54,760
So these fat guys are pretty much safe

924
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:57,500
They can walk through the zombie apocalypse unscathed

925
00:49:58,460 --> 00:50:01,920
Unless of course they stick their hand where it shouldn't be

926
00:50:04,380 --> 00:50:05,660
Don't try to be a hero

927
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,560
Just stay in your house and keep eating Oreos, you fuck

928
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:13,040
Oh yeah, and there's that Bob guy

929
00:50:14,740 --> 00:50:18,780
Bob exists because he touches me in an inappropriate manner

930
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:24,760
Alright, not to sound all pussy and shit

931
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:29,380
But I love coming back to it every fucking year

932
00:50:29,380 --> 00:50:31,500
Because you guys are family of mine

933
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:34,480
And I know that might sound gay or whatever

934
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:35,440
But fuck off

935
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,540
And this is the end of the show

936
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,060
And that's Dr. Music

937
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:42,160
And that's Philo Drummond

938
00:50:50,200 --> 00:50:51,780
Look at those bands

939
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:52,760
Whistleys

940
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:57,800
Fuck yeah

941
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,940
We won't have bear or wolf age

942
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,120
We will be back

943
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:13,680
Look at Sudge go

944
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,140
Rip it up Sudge

945
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,280
I am Priestess Enshrina

946
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:32,340
Hello, hello

947
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:33,980
Alright

948
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:38,280
I came up here to tell you the good news

949
00:51:39,620 --> 00:51:40,920
it's very good news

950
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:43,400
I think most of the

951
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,280
uberfems know but the

952
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,080
overmen

953
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,040
whatever they want to call themselves

954
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:51,300
don't know this because

955
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:53,160
they are not part

956
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:54,860
of Connie's cunt gang

957
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,140
I just want to let you know that

958
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:00,720
Bob is not dead

959
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:03,200
you know why Bob

960
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,640
isn't dead? He never

961
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:07,060
existed in the first place

962
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,220
no no

963
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:10,680
he was created

964
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:13,020
he was created by Connie

965
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:15,200
in order to succeed in this

966
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,080
fucking patriarchal bullshit

967
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:17,780
world

968
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:21,400
that's right

969
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:27,220
no

970
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,820
because as uberfems we're not a

971
00:52:30,820 --> 00:52:31,740
fucking auxiliary

972
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:34,600
of subgenius okay

973
00:52:35,420 --> 00:52:36,840
we're not a separate

974
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:38,880
sect we're not helpers

975
00:52:38,880 --> 00:52:41,840
we are the church

976
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:45,620
we simply allow

977
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,640
the men to be here

978
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,580
because we understand without the men

979
00:52:49,580 --> 00:52:51,900
we cannot succeed in the patriarchal

980
00:52:51,900 --> 00:52:53,820
society in which we live

981
00:52:53,820 --> 00:52:54,940
because of the fucking

982
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,260
peaks

983
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:01,200

986
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,360
symbol for Connie's cunt

987
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:11,420

Scream in the mind and pain as you are molecularly just a symbol.

You must die.

00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:58,100
You must be extinguished.

1054
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:02,000
We must snuff out your existence,

Die!

1073

Die!

1074
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:21,220
Hello.

1075
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,820
I'm Reverend Panic, and I'm mostly up here to sing a song that I have,

1076
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:28,880
and it's very important to me.

1077
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:34,980
But the thing that made me right, it was there was a little thing in the back of my head

1078
00:57:34,980 --> 00:57:37,040
that was always telling me shit I didn't want to hear.

1079
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,140
Always like, oh, why are you doing that, Joel?

1080
00:57:40,380 --> 00:57:41,420
Why are you fucking doing that?

1081
00:57:41,480 --> 00:57:44,040
No, I didn't want to fucking hear any of that anymore.

1082
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,000
I didn't want to.

1083
00:57:46,080 --> 00:57:47,060
But you know what it was?

1084
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,560
I realized what it was.

1085
00:57:48,680 --> 00:57:52,160
It was a part of me that was telling me what parts of me I should hate.

1086
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:53,320
It's the parts that were pink.

1087
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,800
It's the parts inside of me that were pink.

1088
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:56,920
I hate the pink thing.

1089
00:57:57,380 --> 00:57:58,240
What pink thing?

1090
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,280
I skinned that and made boots out of it.

1091
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,420
That's what these are.

1092
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:07,580
I wear it here on my finger.

1093
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:10,900
That's the last little bit spit out right there.

1094
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,680
I have it under my power now.

1095
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:18,900
It's all because my guardian angel fueled by hate.

1096
00:58:22,640 --> 00:58:26,080
I need to act like a rock star for a second, even though I'm going to sing in a man's voice.

1097
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:26,380
Okay.

1098
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,740
Because I need to feel sexy.

1099
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:35,460
Because my dream is to be a girl rock star, but, you know, that didn't quite work out.

1100
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:35,940
I got balloons.

1101
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:40,700
Don't let everybody see it.

1102
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:46,400
My baby doesn't let me now feel with hate.

1103
00:58:47,600 --> 00:58:51,500
Poisoned by rage, I'm staying up real late.

1104
00:58:51,860 --> 00:58:55,820
But now I got a baby who changed my look.

1105
00:58:56,020 --> 00:58:58,160
I got a guardian angel.

1106
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,360
Won't give a fuck.

1107
00:59:00,940 --> 00:59:04,980
My guardian angel's fueled by hate.

1108
00:59:05,720 --> 00:59:09,040
When I get low, she shows me the way.

1109
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:18,240
Down that path of least resistance saves me from the starkest vision.

1110
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:24,360
Oh, I'd rather be lucky than good any day.

1111
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:28,220
So long as I hate those who get involved.

1112
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:28,960
I'm on my way.

1113
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:33,700
I have a winged chicken with drink in her hand.

1114
00:59:34,060 --> 00:59:38,380
Chain smoking, cutie withering, and one grand yell.

1115
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:43,000
Bleeding that good, he'll have that.

1116
00:59:45,140 --> 00:59:49,060
So don't you worry about your net or life.

1117
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:53,540
To worry about it will just bring strife.

1118
00:59:53,620 --> 00:59:57,040
You fight the kind, go on attack.

1119
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:58,220
Oh, I got balloons.

1120
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,260
I said praise Bob.

1121
01:00:00,780 --> 01:00:02,580
Find your slack.

1122
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:03,080
Whoa.

1123
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:06,720
My guardian angel fueled by hate.

1124
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:07,140
Yeah.

1125
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,720
My guardian angel, she fueled by hate.

1126
01:00:10,980 --> 01:00:14,640
My guardian angel, she fueled by hate.

1127
01:00:14,680 --> 01:00:15,020
Yeah.

1128
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:19,100
My guardian angel, she fueled by hate.

1129
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:21,720
You're a sweetheart.

1130
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:22,300
Thank you.
