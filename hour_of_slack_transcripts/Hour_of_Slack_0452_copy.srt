1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:08,480
you are about to participate in a great adventure you are about to experience the awe and mystery

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,940
which reaches from the inner mind to the subgenius

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:24,240
all right all right well we're good we're not going to waste any time dear friends tonight

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:34,020
we're going to get right into it that's got to be the quickest title comeuppance ever on a hour of slack show

5
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:41,940
but it's because we have a lot of ground to cover tonight we're going to present to you an entire play

6
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:51,100
from brain rot radio theater in cleveland originally broadcast on wcsb cleveland

7
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,520
this amazing

8
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,100
uh

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:01,680
well why not just call it what it is it's a parody i suppose you might say called a clockwork

10
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:12,680
orangutan uh starring lonesome cowboy dave psycho pathfinder and scabby days those uh three

11
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:16,820
that that that anything for a laugh duo

12
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:23,960
and uh yeah we don't we don't normally just give a whole show

13
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:24,220
to a show that's not a show that's not a show that's not a show that's not a show that's not a show

14
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:25,380
a show that's not a show that's not a show that's not a show that's not a show that's not a show that's not a show that's not a show that's not a show that's not a show that's not a show that makes

15
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:25,380


16
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:29,160
but that's mostly what we are doing tonight partly because

17
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:38,880
we're not really here right now we don't have time to monkey with yet uh uh a uh a a fourth show all done in

18
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,660
one day yeah we're having to do the hour of slack now like a game show where you do uh

19
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,920
uh all weeks episodes in the only

20
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,560
one day

21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,540
saves time and money.

22
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:59,780
Well, those things are.

23
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,600
They're as real as Bob.

24
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,380
As real as Bob.

25
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,620
So anyway,

26
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,280
let's get right

27
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,400
on down into this

28
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,420
alternate universe created by

29
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:13,540
Brain Rot Radio Theater. I think that

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:15,060
pretty much

31
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,220
all subgenius listeners

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,820
will get it

33
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:20,860
sentence by sentence.

34
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,900
Although there may be some just

35
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,960
so young or

36
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,160
so

37
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,140
queasy that they never saw the

38
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:30,980
original Stanley Kubrick movie

39
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:31,900
that this is a...

40
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:34,640
Well, yeah, I'll admit it. It's a take-off.

41
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,760
You know, on the hour of slack,

42
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,760
we don't normally do

43
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,740
comedy. I mean, this is a

44
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,100
religious radio broadcast, but

45
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,780
well, in this case,

46
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,560
we have to make an exception.

47
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,000
And here it is.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,880
Good evening, and welcome

49
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,420
to Brain Rot Radio Theater

50
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:57,080
and the adventures of Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

51
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,540
Psychopath Finder,

52
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,260
and Scabby Dave's.

53
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,400
Imagine, if you will,

54
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,480
a world in the not-too-distant future.

55
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,100
A world infested with wilding youth gangs

56
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,500
and rampant social decay.

57
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,160
Imagine a world of harsh drugs

58
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,560
that send young minds

59
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,340
into fits of ultra-voyance.

60
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,020
A world where subliminal cold warfare

61
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:19,000
has created an underworld language

62
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,760
of Anglo-Russian gibberish.

63
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:22,100
Good evening,

64
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,020
and welcome to

65
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,600
A Clockwork

66
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,240
Orangutan.

67
00:03:50,860 --> 00:03:50,960
,

68
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:02,900
a world of

69
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:04,620


70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,040
There was me,

71
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,880
that is to say, Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

72
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,780
and my three droogs,

73
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,600
that is to say, Psychopath

74
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,460
Finder Boy Georgie, and

75
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,500
Scabby Tim Days, who is Days,

76
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,240
and the Invisible Spotty.

77
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,680
And we all sat down in the

78
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,180
Corova Milk Bar one Saturday,

79
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,380
wondering what to do with our

80
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,460
crabby raw soups.

81
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,200
The bar served Milk Plus,

82
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:30,400
that is, Milk Plus, Synthamask, and Veleslok,

83
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,720
the two vital ingrudies,

84
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,640
and before any night of

85
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:37,040
any soggy notchy of ultra-violence,

86
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,980
they stuffed a peat knife

87
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:42,160
in your soggy violence.

88
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,320
Okay, okay.

89
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,400
This is the announcer for

90
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,100
They get the picture.

91
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,740
You guys are in a futuristic-looking youth gang,

92
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:50,520
and you talk,

93
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:50,900
and you're funny,

94
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,100
and you drink synthetic drugs,

95
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:52,900
which make you violent.

96
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,320
Yeah, yeah, but you forgot to lay in more establishing stuff

97
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,760
like our cool outfits and all.

98
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,460
Yeah, but me pay 65 bucks

99
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:02,380
for this unseen bit of hot fashion.

100
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,060
Okay, okay, you guys are in the Milk Bar,

101
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,460
where statues of naked-

102
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,960
dispensed drugs from their breasts,

103
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:10,300
and you guys are all wearing white coveralls

104
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,900
and big, kicking Dr. Martin's boots

105
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:13,840
and bowler hats.

106
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,260
Except Spotty, who's wearing a beret.
