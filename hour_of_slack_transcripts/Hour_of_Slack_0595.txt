And there'll be no smoking in the gas chamber.
Dr. Raymer, please report to ICU. Dr. Raymer?
The weed of crime bears bitter fruit.
I didn't have it!
I wish I was a spaceman, the fastest guy alive.
What do they want? Where are they from? Where are they going?
I don't know.
The Second World War, and for the first time in the history of man,
nations combined to fight against nations using the crude weapons of those days.
The Second World War involved every continent on the globe,
and men turned to science for new devices of warfare,
which reached an unparalleled peak in their capacity for destruction.
And now, fought with the terrible weapons of super-science,
menacing all mankind and every creature on Earth, comes...
The Church of...
The Subgenius.
The Church of the...
Subgenius.
Subgenius.
Subgenius.
Subgenius.
You are about to experience the awe and mystery which reaches from the inner mind to...
The Subgenius Hour of Squatch.
You are all now starting the third man in the chaos of the conscience of Nicholos and Porqué.
We're friends!
Hey, that's right! We welcome you!
We're friends!
Yeah.
Ey, Silicones, are not insoles,
Cookies, cannot escape the power of the Spirit.

SUPER Team, you can never escape these clingy disciples.
IV.

It's been absolutely impossible to work through these earth creatures.
Their soul is to control.
A woman with a tattoo?
We interrupt this broadcast to bring you a special news bulletin.
All you of earth are idiots.
First, dear friends,
Einstein's Secret Orchestra
is performing live at the Starwood Festival.
It's really good to be playing here at Starwood
because most of the clubs that my band plays at
turn you into this.
A grimacing shadow of what you thought it was all about.
But you come here to Starwood
and you're like,
there's no TV sets around here.
And this song is kind of about a TV set,
so it doesn't really pertain to you,
but I'm sure you know a few friends who it does.
Oh, let me get the right preset on.
By the way, it's not mine.
But you might recognize it.
Hello, darkness, my old friend.
Welcome to talk with you again.
Because the vision softly creeped in.
Left its seeds while I was
sleeping.
And the vision
that was planted
in my brain
still remains
within the sounds
of silence.
And I placed the all my bits in my brain.
I could hear all the voices at once
and then they patted down.
And I was like,




I didn't hear the sound of my old spines.
In restless dreams I walk alone.
Narrow streets of cobblestone.
Neath the hill of an E street lamp.
I turned my car to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash
Of a neon light
That split the night
With my song
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence
Of silence

Of silence
reaction man you can't use these implants on us man I'm I'm so I'm so high
the whole world looks like that t-shirt that I can't fit into anymore
Oh brother guts you'll never make it out of this Halloween like a Salisbury steak
I'm convinced all right what after that halloo during that hallucination when I
gave you the second dose did you see this man this pipe smoking man during
your hallucination during any of that long series of lifetimes you hallucinated
living did anyone show you or did it you see in any way a picture of this pipe
smoking man but now that you mention it I had a number of dreams they were very
frightening dreams I dreamed I was on a lonesome road traveling off in the
dark
Yao

it's better than going to the Heystrike park it was a starry night I remember
that and then we came to a place where there were no stars at all
and uh for some reason I felt compelled to pull over, and as I did, I walk over
by the old aqueduct near route seven and look down into the valley and
And I saw a huge face, a huge face coming up over Blacktop.
And it was the biggest face I'd ever seen.
And, yeah, I can't get it out of my head.
I had dreams of it night after night.
And I see the face of Bob.
He gazed upon the naked face of Bob.
He was smashed under the stark fist of removal.
And as he crawled out from under, he knew he had been chosen.
He had been swept up in the spirit
and had been chosen.

And as he gazed upon the face of Bob,
he'd been swept into the very dots.
Each single individual dot of the halftone pattern
had captured a piece of the soul of Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
This is all pre-molecular, man.
I got the gist, man.
I got the gist of the whole thing.
This goes way, way deep, deep down beyond the DNA,
beyond the beginning, the protoplasm, the ectoplasm,
the cytoplasm.
It reminds me, I gotta go get a flash, man, in my arm.
Something burning is falling down through the sky.
Friday's John!
A witch's brew we made just for you.
Give away, I'll give away.
Give away, I'll give away.
Give away, I'll give away.
Give away, I'll give away.
Incredible adventure of men.
This odyssey of reaching out into space.
For the next hour, sit quietly,
and we will control all that you see and hear.
You'll be...
Oh, the pain.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.
You are...
You owe Bob...
You owe Bob...
You owe Bob...
$30.
$30...
A mere 30 clams, dear friends.
Ballets.
What's your gleet worth to you?
$30.
Is your gleet worth $30 to you?
Is the non-compromisational...

Is the non-compromisational...
Is the non-compromisational...
...the real-life gleet worth $30?
I'd...
Maybe not.
Maybe so.
I really don't care.
Most of you wouldn't even know if you had real gleet.
All you have is that synthetic conspiracy gleet that they feed you.
Just feeding you their fake gleet.
And, oh, you're just so happy to have that gleet.
Oh, they're gulping it down.
They're just...
They just love it.
They're lapping it up!
That's right.
They suck up...
Accent on the lap.
...gleet like a blowfish.
...gleet like a blowfish.
Yeah, they're...
They might as well just be a great big old gleet vacuum.
Man's best friend is the blowfish.
The blowfish provides many things for men.
It provides a safety valve.
A safety valve against too much gleet buildup.
Oh, yes, because you can build up that gleet.
And soon, it will back up into your very veins.
Back up into your brain pan.
Oh, yeah.
Color your judgment, you might say.
Or the foot gland.
Oh, it'll back up either way.
You'll be packing a real mean load.
That's right.
The poison of the flu nights, friends.
And there's only one way to excise that poison, to get it out.
And that's to write to Bob.
Well, that's the other way.
Oh, the other way, too.
Okay, there's two ways.
I didn't worry.
That's the way.
Yeah, okay.
Write to Bob.
That's the preferred way.
There's a cheaper way, but you really don't want to try it.
Write to Bob for free information.
It could be dangerous.
I tried to using Dr. Legume's pornography that he has hidden in his bathroom where I spent the night last night in his bathroom.
But you know what?
Dr. Legume's pornography was...
Spent the night in his bathroom?
Yeah.
His pornography was too normal for me.
I thought I'd keep the gun magazines there.
That's what I like.
That was it.
Gun magazines and what was it?
Big bore.
Oh, man.
I thought I'd keep the Puritan magazine and Golden Girls.
Oh, that's right.
You went to see that movie.
Muzzle Velocity.
You went to see that movie Mimic wearing a trench coat and nothing else because you were getting off on all that bug porn.
Bug porn.
I know about you and the bug porn.
I love bug porn.
Mimic have bug porn in it?
Yeah.
Big John.
Bugs and humans and things are doing that.
Oh, I didn't know that.
Yeah.
You missed the bug porn?
That's new, though.
That just came out, didn't it?
Yeah.
I didn't know that.


I thought you would have known about the...
Oh, man.
I can't believe.

I didn't know about that.
Bug porn, man.
I guess I saw...
I think I saw an ad for that on TV the other night, but I was all hopped up on Gleet and
I barely remember.
Yeah.
Yeah.
We were all hopped up on Gleet and...
It was my own Gleet, though.
...watching that.
It wasn't like I was...
I wasn't like taking the devil's Gleet or nothing.
No.
We wouldn't want to do that.
I wouldn't take it.
No Gleet shall pass these lips but Bob's and my own.
And the occasional bug Gleet.
Well, bugs don't exactly create...
I don't think they...
I'm not sure what exactly comes out.
Well, who knows?
Would you lick a toad just for a little Gleet?
No.
Well, toads, yeah, sure.
Toad.
But that's different from an arthropod or damn, you know, six joint exoskeleton damn thing.
I smoked one then.
The Prozac Free Radio Show filled with Gleet and music.
This is the Department of Crooks playing Nine from Las Vegas.
I'm not sure what that is.
Can you write it down for me?



We're going to show...
After that...
Not that we've actually just talked about anything for hours straight.

David Whene.
Never
What the ....
I don't think I should go on.

Everything for a reason
I mean who can guess the game?
What happens they can't see thecha
because it's so offensive.
Move them earthlings north.
Oh, man.
Ship those earthlings back.
Oh, this sounds almost racist.
It's pink-a-billy.
Pink boy, pink boy.
Pink boy hatin' me.
It's like hate songs.
It's subgenius hate songs and normal hate songs, both.
I don't suppose we can play any of those on the radio.
I don't know.
Judging from the quality of manner of subgenius hate.
You just offended the Pepsi company by playing that negative land piece.
By the way, Reverend Strange, I want to say,
I really like the music that you play on your shows that I hear tapes of.
Because I usually don't hear that music any other place,
not in Dallas, Texas, where I live.
Why would you hear it in Dallas?
I mean, it's Dallas.
Well, that's not funny.

How many of you can, at 35 years old,
sleep with 16, 12, 13-year-old girls and boys and animals?
Hey, this is the life.
I just hate everybody.
There's no need for me to like everybody.
Everything that I...
have in this world, I put back into number one.
I am number one.
I don't need to give anything to anybody.
You don't need to.
Do you have any idea how these people were born?
I'm not afraid.
I'm not afraid.
The difference in most products today is really in the skill.
I was sick, sick under death.
The revolution will not be televised.

How would you like to ool your cool with me, mon?
Huh?
All of the DJ's surely have taken a lesson.
Start talking trash and I'll come with my Smith and Wesson.
But they talk.
They have orifices that move and words come out.
Yeah.
That would be great.
Boy, I hardly ever get to do that.
We'll heal you, we'll sicken you, we'll marry you, we'll counsel.
We'll... counseling.
On ear subgenius counseling.
That's right.
We're ready to do that.
Call now for your free counseling session.
Well...
Do you have questions about your baby's health?
Your child's upbringing?
Ask a subgenius priest.
That's right.
We're family counselors here, Dr. Lecum and I.
We will be glad to tell you what you can put in your mouth and what you can't.
We've been studying the subject of what you can put in your mouth.
I imagine...
To suck or not to suck actually was the question.
That is truly...


...the question.
Some stop when they taste...
Whether it is nobler to suffer the...
Well, we won't go there.
I don't want to go to that place.
I can't go there.
I've heard...
My own wife started using that phrase recently.
I can't go there.
When did that appear?
When did you start hearing that?
I don't know.
When people started being really afraid, I think, of everything.
Hey, man, why don't you quit that job and like have a life for a change and have some...
I can't go there.
I can't go there.
I can't go to that place.
I can't go there.

That's like some encounter group therapy session thing.
Yeah, probably.
I guess.
Or educationese.
One of those...
Some overeducated college type people probably came out of that.
Came out of one of those, you know, pink nerd support groups you read about and hear about
on the daytime television.
And yet, in less than 11 months, there shall become a prophecy that shall come true.
300...
The saucers will come.
...15 days, dear friends.
Actually, I'm not sure.
I'm not sure exactly what day we're on, but it's roughly that.
Now, actually, I don't like nailing it down for the listeners, because truth in fact,
half of them really don't get it.
The half that do get it, they know.
You don't have to tell them, but the other half, I'd rather just leave it a surprise.
Yeah, we'd like to tell you, but we can't go there.
We can't play that tape, because you might be offended.
Yeah.
Might be.
Wah, wah, bam, bam.
We pray.
You'll be offended.
We pray that you would be offended.
If you have any decency, if you have any human decency at all, you would indeed be
offended.
I hope you are offended.
I pray that you are offended, because we love you, dear friend.
Bob loves you.
That's right.
Admittedly, he loves your money more than he loves you, but he does also love you.
You.
You.
The very you that I'm talking to right now.
You as an individual.
You, sitting there.
On the drugs, yes, we know what you did.
Three will kill an elephant.
Bob can take five.
Think about it.
That's right.
Especially if they're the American ones.
If it were the German ones, Bob would foolishly be dead.
Who do you trust?
A friend?
Man?
Certainly not myself.
What do I know?
Man made...
Man made God, but he used a monkey to do it.
Man made God, Bob made Frop.
Who do you trust?
Bob, of course.
You know, actually, lately I've been trusting in Bill.
Bill Hicks is my new short derp or saff.
You ever heard that so-called comedian?
The so-called truest work of art.
The worst words I ever heard poured from that man's mouth.
Yeah, you can't play him on the radio because somebody might be offended.
This guy listening to me right now would probably be offended.
He'd be too offended.
We wouldn't be able to play a Bill Hicks tape because he cusses, you know, and he...
He's an offender.
You would be offended if you were normal.
But, but, if you were a subgenius, why, you'd die laughing.
If you're a subgenius, the pills that we hand out on next day won't hurt you a bit.
They'll transport you to heaven.
But if...
Boy, I love talking about Kennedy assassination.
Man, that's my favorite topic.
You know why?
Why?
Because to me, it's a great archetype example of how the totalitarian government who rules this planet partitions out information in such a way that we, the masses, are forced to base our conclusions on erroneous...
Oh, I'm sorry.
Wrong meeting.
I thought this was the meeting at the docks, no?
Oh, shit.
That's tomorrow night.
All right.
Everyone followed that.
That's the frightening fucking thing.
Everyone here is going, uh-huh.
God damn it.
Are we that cynical?
Yes, we are, Bill.
We will dig any blow you give us.
Gah!
We, too, will be at the meeting at the docks tomorrow, you fucker.
How much money do you ever want to get in?
What would you...
Wow.
Cool.
But I love Kennedy, man.
I was just down in, uh, just up and where I was just in Dallas.
And, uh, you know, you can go to the sixth floor of the school book department.
The school's like, you know, it's a depository.
Do you know it's a museum called the Assassination Museum?
Do you know that?
True.
I believe, name that, after the assassination.
I...
I can't be sure of the chronology here but...
But it's really weird.
You can actually, um, they have the window set up to look exactly like it did on that
day and it's really accurate, you know, because Oswald's not in it.
Yeah, so.
Yeah, I don't know who did their research but I'm talking about...







painstaking detail.
It's true, man.
It's called the sniper's nest
and it's all glassed in
with the boxes sitting there
and you can't actually
get to the window.
And the reason they did that,
of course,
they didn't want thousands
of American tourists
getting to that window
each year, you know,
going,
there's no fucking way!
I can't even see the road!
Oh my God, they're lying!
It's a giant totalitarian
government that rules
the planet via the airwaves,
partitioning off information
in such a way...
There's no fucking way, man.
Not unless Oswald
was hanging by his toes
upside down from the ledge.
Surely someone
would have seen this.
Either that or some pigeons
grabbed onto him
and flew him
over the motorcade.
You know, there was rumors
of anti-Castro pigeons
seen drinking in bars
the night before the assassination.
Someone overheard them saying,
Coup! Coup!
All right.
Don't get on your
we-hate-puns high horse.
Fuck you.
That is the best goddamn pun
you will ever hear.
Oh, God.
Well, that's kind of
a rotten trick
to make a pun out of that one.
Did you hear what...
Oh.
Jacking with the...
But, you know,
Oswald...
I'll tell you,
it's interesting, man,
talking about Kennedy's
assassination,
because to me it really is
this incredible example
of something.
I don't know what yet.
It's pretty engrossing to me.
But people's attitudes,
it's just incredible to me,
you know?
People come up to me,
Bill, quit talking about
Kennedy, man.
Let it go.
It's a long time ago.
Would you just forget about it?
I'm like, okay,
then don't bring up
Jesus to me.
As long as we're talking
shelf life here.
Bill, you know,
Jesus died for you.
Yeah, it was a long time ago.
Let it go.
Let it go.
Forget about it.
How about this?
Get Pilate to release
the fucking files.
Quit washing your hands
and release the files, Pilate.
Who else was on that
grassy Golgotha that day?
Oh, yeah,
the three Roman peasants
with the $100 sandals.
Yeah, right.
We wouldn't be able
to play a Bill Hicks type
because he cusses,
you know,
and he's an offender.
You would be offended
if you were normal.
But, but,
if you were a subgenius,
why, you'd die laughing.
If you're a subgenius,
the pills that we hand out
on next day
won't hurt you a bit.
They'll transport you
to heaven.
But if you only thought
or hoped
you were a subgenius,
if your faith in Bob
was nothing but the,
the, the,
getting the joke of Bob.
Oh, I get the joke.
I must be a subgenius.
Well, go ahead
and take that pill.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
Just gobble it down.
Take a whole handful.
We want to watch your face
when it sinks in
that Bob really did love you
and you didn't give him a chance.
You thought it was all
just a big, funny joke.
Well, I'll tell you what.
When those brain worms
are chewing their way
through your eardrums
into your brain,
is that when you're
going to be going,
oh, I guess this is part
of that satire I heard
on that radio show
at one time.
Oh, I guess this must be
part of that millennium cult
comedy group that I read
about that one time.
Oh, yeah.
You'll be wishing.
You'll be, you'll be wishing
that you still thought
that joke was so funny then.
My mouth waters
in anticipation
of your pain.
In fact, I'm choking on the water
and spit in my mouth.
And even now.
My mouth is watering so much.
Help!
Help!
, help!
Help!
Help!
Help!
Help!

Even now.
Even now he's throbbing.
Throbbing in ecstasy.
Throbbing.
Throbbing with that drop
of anticipatory gleat.
Gleat.
Gleat.
Oh, oh.
Oh, but many stop
when they taste
the pre-anticipatory gleat.
That's, Ben, you better stop.
As well they should.
Because the germ, the,
the germ ain't in the gleat.
But what comes right behind the gleat,
man, it's packing a mean load.
That's true.
And soon shall come a day.
Disgorgeous, strange creatures.
Soon will come a day
when you cannot live without your daily gleat.
And you'll drop to your knees.
Oh, Jesus, give me this day my daily gleat.
Oh, God.
Good Lord, man.
Soon you're wandering the streets.
You'll be wanting to look at that person
who's walking on the other side of the street and think,
I wonder if he has any gleat.
Does he have gleat?
I must go and take his gleat.
And you'll stand behind an old man
in line at the supermarket and go,
He stinks of gleat.
He is gleat-ridden.
But it is diseased gleat.
It is foul.
It is a foul ichor that has disgorged from this old man.
And must I sit here and be offended by this offender
and smell him, smelling of him?
Ugh!
And yet you can't turn away.
For soon it no longer matters whether the gleat is poison or not.
You'll be willing to take that chance
just because you rationalize it to yourself.
Well, there's a 50% chance that his gleat is bad.
And I might end up taking it.
On a bad gleat trip.
But, but, but perhaps that gland is not half empty at all,
but half full.
Half full of gleat.
Uh, sure.
Go ahead. Give it a try.
Hey, man, too much is always better than not enough.
That's what Bob said.
Bob said, too much is always better than not enough.
I better drink this extra jug of Everclear.
I better, I better shoot up this extra wad of opium.
I better, uh, um,
suck down this extra five canisters of church air.
I might as well just swallow that one last load of anticipatory gleat.
Yeah, go ahead.
There's probably no germs in that.
There's probably no E. coli in that gleat.
Hey, hey, they probably serve that gleat up at Burger King.
Heck.
Yeah.
And, and eventually, you know,
Oh, man, just did a line of gleat.
you're gonna get caught.
You're gonna get caught eventually.
Oh, man, this stuff is legal.
Now, you'll get stopped down on the,
you'll, you'll get stopped by the police driving down the road,
I want your hands.
weaving.
Damn, I mean, I can't afford that.
And the cop's gonna look at you and he's gonna say,
I can't afford that.
Man, is that gleat dripping down your chin?
Ah, your whole car reeks of gleat.
And soon they're gonna drag out the gleat sniffing dogs
who are gonna come up and they're gonna sniff all around you,
trying to find out where that gleat is.
You can't hide this now.
And it won't matter where you hide the gleat
because the dog's gonna smell that.
No, no, sir, man.
You can pack it up your exit wound.
Haven't had any gleating weeks, sir.
Sir, I'm clean.
Townie, I'm clean.
Oh, next thing you know,
they're gonna be all getting together
in some old civic center on a Saturday night
and be like, hello, my name is Edward Strange
and I, I'm a gleat head.
I'm your slave.
Live from Hollywood High.
Live from Hollywood High.
Who else would be stupid enough to show up for the showdown?
That noise don't come from no ordinary bird.
Look what else is new for you.
It's here, it's here, it's here, it's here.
The secret that unlocks flavor.
Diamonds are a girl's best friend.
Everybody say amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Oh, oh.
Five, four, three, two, one, fire.
Do you believe there are such things as flying saucers, Colonel?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Empires and those civilizations,
they had a whole pantheon of gods,
none of whom really existed.
They had their concept of Zeus,
which was the Greek word for Jupiter.
Be part of the illusion,
because there are young people out there doing good things.
But you've heard so far.
What, what I believe is that there is one way, God's way.
The soul and the mind and the heart.
A penis does not make a person.
Then why aren't you more concerned with what's inside
and what the soul is instead of what's outside?
Let me...
Eyeglasses are forbidden by God.
We're talking about people here trying to cut off their genitals
to rearrange their God-given sex themselves with sharp instruments.
This...
You say God, there's God, whatever.
Yes.
God gave humans a brain.
He gave us knowledge to do whatever we want to do.
Who ordained you?
I had such a fierce, intense fight
with fire burning inside of me.
It just was so much that just wants to explode.
Well...
I've just totally run out of any kind of shtick
or any kind of imaginative thing to say, Dave.
I think we ought to just get real for a minute.
What did you have for dinner tonight, Dave?
Well, for dinner tonight, I had a six-pack of Gold's beer.
I had, uh...
Well, what was left of that stuff I had by the decomposed Brillo pad,
and I had, uh...
Someone offered me a sandwich, but I declined.
Well, I asked him to get real, and at least he got real.
Uh, Princess Wee, what did you have for dinner tonight?
What did I have for dinner tonight?
I think it was bug porn.
No, don't you remember...
I know, I was supposed to be real.
I forgot.
I'm sorry.
Reverend Stang, can you forgive me?
No.
Um...
Uh, uh, uh, no.
No, I cannot forgive you.
No, not this time.
And Bob will not forgive you,
because he does not think you have anything you need to be forgiven for.
He will merely excuse you for forgetting that, in fact,
you yourself cooked two hours ago, about three hours ago,
a fine repast of, I believe you called it,
Thai-Japanese-Scandinavian-Chinese-style curry.
Uh, vegetarian Italian-Chinese-Scandinavian curry.
With fish sauce.
With meat.
With tamari sauce.
Tamari and tamari and tamari.
Drip in this freaky paste hot sauce.
Endless drip sauce.
Through the last screaming syllabus of last year's college courses.
Engamated festerings.
Festerings.
And all the other things.
And all our report cards.
Uh, roast a path of plusty, lusty bug porn and bad breath.
Unto the final teardrops and bell ringings of a lost horizon.
Ah, yes, as the Liberty Bell cracks and California slides into the ocean,
and all the UFOs spin, crashing to the ground in New Mexico,
the subgeniuses, yes, link themselves arm in arm and march.
Arm in arm.
One by one, two by two, into the Atlantic Ocean.
Their bloated feet shining, their eyes set on some distant star.
They march like lemmings into the sea,
with their hearts full of pride,
knowing that in a short time, they'll have drunk their last Ceylon solution.
And as they all disappear beneath the waves,
only one, the first one, the leader, continues on across the ocean.
The pipe stick alone, sticking out up over the surface like a periscope,
a backwards pointing periscope,
as Bob swims and breathes through that pipe like a snorkel,
a flaming snorkel that never goes out.
Bob swims on.
His followers long since drowned, lost in Davy Jones' locker.
But Bob swims on and on and on.
And where, where is Bob going? Where does Bob swim?
Well, five weeks later, he washes up,
and...
England, where he looks for a bowl of fish and chips
and wanders off into the night.
There was no point in the end to the deaths of the millions who followed him,
and no point to this story of Bob's final fish and chip dinner.
But friends, you know those fish and chips, as bad as they are,
don't taste all that bad with vinegar.
The old Christ Bob.
Tears me up, man.
Don't just stare.
And friends, you do know that the church does make its own malt vinegar,
which is also suitable for douching before the ceremonial ointment.
And this fish and chip dinner set, this whole china set right here,
imported all the way from London, is only, at this time right now, $16.99.
If you remove the tiny little, the nano screws,
and the other little, and just send them back,
we're recalling each and every one of them.
They don't work, we don't care.
But as long as you send your 30 bucks to the Church of the Subgenius,
I think we can work out something with you.
Don't you think so?
I don't think so.
Don't you think so?
I think so.
I don't think so.
Do you think so?
And if you aren't completely satisfied with this church,
send it back, and we'll send you another one free of charge.

Ja Question.
souvenir after you're destroyed in the end times for being faithless. Ain't it great? He loves us
so and hates you. That man Bob, if man he be, he don't care about you, but he cares about me.
Devanda, come here honey. I met that guy again. You know that the chair Bob dog? Oh yeah, yeah.
He was rubbing my chacha so hard I started to overheat man. I told him it was free.
And then you know what happened? No. I ended up paying him. Oh you paid him? Yeah, I can hardly
wait for him to come back tomorrow. Oh I would pay him too. I ain't walking these streets for nothing.
Oh man, really, really? It was him? It was him. It was really him? You want me to introduce you to him?
Yes. Oh yeah, I can do that. He likes all of us. I mean he told me so.
