1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,260
Whoa!

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,520
Three, two, and one.

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,380
Now to continue with the tape recording.

4
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:12,960
Gangster Computer God Worldwide Secret Containment Policy.

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:17,860
Made possible solely by Worldwide Computer God Frankenstein Controls.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,960
A special lifelong constant threshold brainwash radio.

7
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:24,140
Quiet and motionless, I can slightly hear it.

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,480
Repeatedly, this has saved my life on the streets.

9
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,720
Four billion worldwide population, all living, have a Computer God Containment Policy Brain Bank brain.

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,640
A real brain.

11
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:37,160
In the brain bank cities on the far side of the moon we never see.

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,820
If I give you some money, will you come to my room?

13
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,680
If I give you some money, will you come to my room?

14
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:47,620
Why don't you ask me what it feels like to be a freak?

15
00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,160
You're a freak, man.

16
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:50,800
I have passion.

17
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,860
Passion, my friend, and I'm not afraid to cry.

18
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,660
Who are you calling strange?

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,820
Well, you're calling me strange, I know that, but why?

20
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:00,360
Who are you to judge?

21
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,120
What are your values, anyway?

22
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:07,300
I'm extremely right-wing, apart from in fashion, and I know how to cry.

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,760
I tell you, I really thought 1984 was going to be the end of it all, and you call me strange.

24
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,340
Well, up yours, man.

25
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:21,220
I only do this because it pays well, and because I'm deeply insecure, and you call me strange?

26
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:23,980
They seem like normal enough motivations to me.

27
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:25,160
Screw this.

28
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,460
I'm going ham.

29
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:26,960
Hang-gliding.

30
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:27,520
Ugh.

31
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:36,520
Time comes when silence is betrayal.

32
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:49,560
A new day has dawned.

33
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,060
A new day has dawned.

34
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,520
A new day has dawned.

35
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,100
A new day has dawned.

36
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,340
There's no force on this planet that'll keep me from...

37
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,120
I'm speaking the truth.

38
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:57,780
...from...

39
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,660
I'm speaking the truth.

40
00:01:58,980 --> 00:01:59,460
...from...

41
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,160
I'm speaking the truth.

42
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:00,560
...from...

43
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,100
They'll have to carry me out, feet first in a coffin before I'll shut up about the truth here.

44
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,640
...shut up about the truth here.

45
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,120
...shut up about the truth here.

46
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,620
...shut up about the truth here.

47
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:15,040
Let us find out today who is the real power behind government.

48
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:20,240
My brothers and sisters, the answer may surprise you.

49
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:23,680
It is you.

50
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,860
It is you.

51
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:25,980


52
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:29,720
It is you.

53
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,920
It is you, it is you, it's you.

54
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,120
The secret government will continue in a few moments.

55
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,820
It is you, you are the power behind the throne.

56
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:43,880
The secret government will continue in a few moments.

57
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,500
A new day has dawned.

58
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,660
A new day has dawned.

59
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:53,660


60
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,080
I realize me worldwide is a Frankenstein slave.

61
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:07,340
Usually at night, you go to a nearby hospital or camouflage miniature hospital van trucks.

62
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,440
You strip naked, lay on the operating table, which slides into the sealed computer god robot operating cabinet.

63
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:21,320
Because we are at the time in history where one big cycle is closing and another cycle is opening,

64
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:28,820
the duration of which will be 5,000 centuries on Earth, of unbroken peace, of universal peace.

65
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:38,100
And at the end of that cycle, we, our descendants, will be extraterrestrial visitors to other worlds, helping those planets.

66
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,320
That's our future.

67
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,660
And actually, it has already happened, because time doesn't exist.

68
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,860
Good hello again.

69
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,300
While browsing through an automated computer,

70
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:54,440
a cassette dispenser at a Czechoslovakian airport recently,

71
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,600
I suddenly noticed a name I recognized among the wares.

72
00:03:59,420 --> 00:03:59,560
Mine.

73
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:05,500
And a closer inspection showed this to be a bootleg cassette of some of my broadcasts.

74
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:08,340
I suppose they're out there right now,

75
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:13,740
huddled around a squawking international shortwave receiver in some filthy hut on Taiwan,

76
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,340
taping everything I'm saying on a low-end Payless cassette for Volume 2.

77
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,140
Well,

78
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,560
even though I'm not getting a cent for the sale of those bootlegs,

79
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:28,720
the rules of this show don't allow me to complain.

80
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,400
Yes, for better or worse, copyright free.

81
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,620
Raw material for your reuse.

82
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,580
With Sissy Spritz, it's hair for the future, not the past.

83
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,900
When you have great hair, people know you're a winner.

84
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,240
I'm gonna fly on my own hair tonight.

85
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,080
Sissy Spritz may cost dry mouth, dilated pupils,

86
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:52,500
paranoia, heart palpitations, and nosebleeds,

87
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,220
but your hair will be great.

88
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:53,940
Ah-ya!

89
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,680
One, two, three, four.

90
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,360
Ah-ya!

91
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:03,620
Ah-ya!

92
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:04,400


93
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:05,960
Ah-ya!

94
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:09,760
Ah-ya!

95
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:09,760


96
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,220
Ah-ya!

97
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:11,720
Ah-ya!

98
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,900
Ah-ya!

99
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,320
Ah-ya!

100
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,000
Ah-ya!

101
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:21,300
Ah-ya!

102
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:21,300


103
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:21,300


104
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:24,920
Thank you.

105
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:05,820
Thank you.

106
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,060
Thank you.

107
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:52,940
Thank you.

108
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,360
Thank you.

109
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,340
Thank you.

110
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,480
Thank you.

111
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:55,520
Thank you.

112
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,040
Thank you.

113
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,920
Thank you.

114
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,680
Thank you.

115
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:54,580
Thank you.

116
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,340
I will dispense this advice now.

117
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:00,940
Whoa!

118
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,960
I feel good!

119
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,680
Most illogical.

120
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,560
Shazam!

121
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,180
Lay your hands on the radio!

122
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,540
Lay your hands on the radio dan to home!

123
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,000
Where's my eggs?

124
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,140
No more eggs.

125
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,980
You're lucky you got your

126
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:21,920
A stack of sausages.

127
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,360
The menu says eggs.

128
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,420
I know, but we're out.

129
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,800
Ah, this joint stinks.

130
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,220
Oh, you're no bargain yourself.

131
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,740
God loves you.

132
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,180
Okay.

133
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,120
What the hell was that?

134
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,620
I am your father.

135
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,100
Take four red capsules.

136
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,100
In ten minutes, take two more.

137
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,220
Give me a receipt for the cash.

138
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,080
This isn't a holdup?

139
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:46,900
No.

140
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,220
Then what about the balance?

141
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,680
I'll owe it to you.

142
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:52,260
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

143
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,200
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

144
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,040
Oh, wipeout.

145
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,120
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

146
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:07,020
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

147
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,960
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

148
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,720
Oh, yes.

149
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,520
Oh, yes.

150
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,140
I can't get over it.

151
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,340
After all these years, I thought I knew you,

152
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,660
but you turn out to be a stranger.

153
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,840
If you only knew the power of the dark side.

154
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:29,260
Robbing and mauling people like some kind of a cheap hoodlum.

155
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,360
I have a brother who's a drug addict.

156
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,800
I'm very proud of him.

157
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,260
You want me to make an act of faith,

158
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,120
risking myself, my wife, my woman, my sister, my children,

159
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,340
on some idealism which you assure me exists in America,

160
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:43,420
which I have never seen.

161
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,560
What you represent to them is freedom.

162
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,880
What the hell's wrong with freedom, then?

163
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:49,680
That's what it's all about.

164
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:50,440
Oh, yeah.

165
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:50,960
That's right.

166
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,660
That's what it's all about, all right.

167
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,480
But talking about it and being it,

168
00:12:55,540 --> 00:12:57,060
that's two different things.

169
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:00,660
I mean, it's real hard to be free

170
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,940
when you are bought and sold in the marketplace.

171
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,400
Of course, don't ever tell anybody that they're not free,

172
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,100
because then they're going to get real busy

173
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:13,040
killing and maiming to prove to you that they are.

174
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:16,220
Oh, yeah, they're going to talk to you

175
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,080
and talk to you and talk to you

176
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,040
about individual freedom.

177
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,800
What they see of free individual,

178
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,600
it's going to scare them.

179
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,820
No, it don't make them running scared.

180
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,040
No.

181
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,320
It makes them dangerous.

182
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,340
Not an accident.

183
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,480
We are connected.

184
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:43,680
We are connected.

185
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,480
Red, the white Asian face.

186
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:47,480
Red, the green heart.

187
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,820
You're Asian.

188
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,020
You're alive.

189
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,200
You're alive.

190
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,320
And smash the system.

191
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,040
You're alive.

192
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:58,020
And help for a revolution.

193
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,280
A revolution.

194
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,660
A revolution.

195
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:02,120
A revolution.

196
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:03,400
Blast him!

197
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,280
Fire was me.

198
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:17,500
Fire was me.

199
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,640
Now I am.

200
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,800
A monkey.

201
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,920
A monkey.

202
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:26,240
Monkey.

203
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:27,280
Monkey.

204
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,480
And I am a monkey.

205
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,040
Don't.

206
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,280
Mollage is free.

207
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,340
We do not forgive.

208
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,840
We do not forget.

209
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,000
Expect us.

210
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:46,100
We do not forget.

211
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,180
This is the formula

212
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,720
for a nation.

213
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,300
Or kingdom decline.

214
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:56,540
Where did you two take this elevator from Shangri-La?

215
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,340
For no kingdom can maintain itself by force alone.

216
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:07,940
Force does not work the way its advocates think in fact it does.

217
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:15,100
It does not, for example, reveal to the victim the strength of the adversary.

218
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,180
The power of the force.

219
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,900
The power of the force.

220
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,000
The power of the force.

221
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:20,000


222
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,140
It feeds the desire for Easiness the

223
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,340
will to police.

224
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,500
of the adversary.

225
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:29,760
Me!

226
00:15:30,460 --> 00:15:31,340
I'll get him.

227
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,320
No talking behind my back.

228
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,440
This is so rich.

229
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:38,200
It was a stone's groove, my man.

230
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,940
The record player was still playing.

231
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,560
He's not dead yet.

232
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,180
But it's a head wound.

233
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:56,120
I do not call it a mistake.

234
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:03,460
I do not call it a mendacity.

235
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,380
I call it sin.

236
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,180
My family must survive.

237
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,580
Intelligent people don't just turn their backs on the rest of the world.

238
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:15,920
Under these conditions, intelligent people will be the first to try.

239
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,160
I still believe that we can do it.

240
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:21,120
Do with this country something that has not been done before.

241
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:32,960
The mothership has landed.

242
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,200
It's time to tear the roof off the mother sucker.

243
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,960
Elvis has left the building.

244
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,300
I'm not sure if it was him who ordered me to do it.

245
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:06,460
Well, your ploy may have ensure I don't kill myself.

246
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:06,720
There will be nothing cold, theoutm沒有

247
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:10,300
Great era liberalization and the worst Mint plan to use to build this country.

248
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:16,540
a tree to build a new vision far from the reaches of kingdom and foe.

249
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:23,300
As Christians some were burned riches and later took slaves to gain riches.

250
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:31,140
Still from near and far to America they came by thousands to court the wild.

251
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:38,980
She just patiently smiled and bore a child to be the vision and guiding light.

252
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:47,540
And once the ties with the ground had been broken, westward in saddle and wagon it went.

253
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:55,500
And till the railroads linked ocean to ocean, many the lies which had come to an end.

254
00:17:55,640 --> 00:17:58,520
We bullied, stole and bought our homeland.

255
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,120
Then began the story of the wild.

256
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:02,480
The slaughter of the red men.

257
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:09,980
Still from near and far to America they came by thousands to court the wild.

258
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:17,560
She just patiently smiled and bore a child to be the spirit and guiding light.

259
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:50,460
And once the ties with the ground had been broken, westward in saddle and wagon it went.

260
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:50,740


261
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,340
She just patiently smiled and bore a child to be the spirit and guiding light.

262
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:52,140
And still from near and far to America they came by thousands to court the wild.

263
00:18:52,560 --> 00:19:01,060
She just patiently smiled and bore a child to be the spirit and guiding light.

264
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,980
And still from near and far to America they came by thousands to court the wild.

265
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:08,980


266
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:15,800
And though the past has it's share of injustice, kind was the spirit in many a way.

267
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:20,300
But it's protectors and friends have been sleeping.

268
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:24,160
Now it's a monster and will not obey.

269
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:29,500
The spirit was freedom and justice.

270
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,140
And his keepers seemed friendly and kind

271
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,000
His leaders were supposed to serve the country

272
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,460
But now they won't pay it no mind

273
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:44,260
Cause people grew fat and got lazy

274
00:19:44,260 --> 00:19:47,640
Cause their vote is a meaningless joke

275
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,500
They can babble about law and order

276
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:55,960
But it's all just a nickle of what they've been told

277
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,800
Cause there's a monster on the loose

278
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,980
It's got our heads into a noose

279
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:05,340
And it just sits there watching

280
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,180
Our cities have turned into jungles

281
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:16,360
And corruption is straying on the land

282
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,900
The police force is watching the people

283
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,400
And the people just can't understand

284
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:27,000
We don't know how to mind our own business

285
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,780
The world's a mess

286
00:20:28,780 --> 00:20:30,560
It's got to be just like us

287
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:34,800
Now we are fighting a war over there

288
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,640
No matter who's the winner

289
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,560
We can't pay the cost

290
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,100
Cause there's a monster on the loose

291
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:44,580
It's got our heads into a noose

292
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:49,160
And it just sits there watching

293
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,280
America, where are you now?

294
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,460
Don't you care about your sons and daughters?

295
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:12,420
Don't you know we need you now?

296
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:16,260
We can't fight alone against the monster

297
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,340
America, where are you now?

298
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,380
Don't you care about your sons and daughters?

299
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,500
Don't you know we need you now?

300
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:32,360
We can't fight alone against the monster

301
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:36,380
America, where are you now?

302
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,580
Don't you care about your sons and daughters?

303
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:44,420
Don't you know we need you now?

304
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:48,260
We can't fight alone against the monster

305
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,000
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

306
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,060
That's the word he wouldn't catch, he's gone

307
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:19,220
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

308
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:21,400
And he's thinking of all them all

309
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,480
First he begs a few holes in a tree to see

310
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,380
Yeah, but Redwood's really mad

311
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,420
And it's nothing to him

312
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:28,760
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh

313
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,180
The back of your head.

314
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,520
Head.

315
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:34,480
Head.

316
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:35,100
Head.

317
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:36,020
Head.

318
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,480
Credits.

319
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,080
Yes, credits.

320
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,260
Where credits are do-do.

321
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:52,680
Do-do-do all the way down.

322
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,400
Except on Hour of Slack where everything is so wonderful.

323
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:04,700
And credit is due to Reverend Cool Hand Chris who did the collages we've been hearing.

324
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:09,200
Now, this is all in theory because I haven't actually put any of this together yet.

325
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:10,720
This is one of those shows.

326
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:19,220
Cool Hand Chris did all that Media Barrage collage type stuff from a million different sources, including Subgenius Ones.

327
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:25,840
And you can find his great videos and also music at, if you search for the...

328
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:30,280
The Cool Hand Chris Rocks.

329
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:31,560
Yes, that's it.

330
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,300
Cool Hand Chris Rocks.

331
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:36,620
Try that with one word and you'll find your way there.

332
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,280
The music, okay.

333
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,300
Of course, the Rudy Schwartz Project did Tampon Louie.

334
00:23:42,380 --> 00:23:42,900
Who else?

335
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:49,020
And of course, the Psychoskeletons did that instrumental called Known Allergy.

336
00:23:49,620 --> 00:23:51,080
An unknown instrumental.

337
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:56,400
And of course, the Rainmakers covered the Steppenwolf song Monster.

338
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,800
From their latest album called Cover Band.

339
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:09,360
And Lothar and the Hand People did the Woody Woodpecker theme.

340
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,800
That's a lot of ands.

341
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:14,080
And Lothar and the Hand People.

342
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,580
That's a lot of good stuff, too.

343
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:22,480
And now we'll cut to the part where we have already called Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

344
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:24,680
There it goes.

345
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,180
Like that?

346
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:26,220
Yeah.

347
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:27,280
But we'll be...

348
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,340
Cutting all this part out.

349
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,260
We'll make it seem like he just picked it up.

350
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:37,800
I have the correct address now.

351
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,860
I'm sorry it took me so long.

352
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:42,260
I didn't mean to cause any problems.

353
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,500
I'm sorry.

354
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:50,720
Well, you know it's not the clone of Dave when he says, I'm sorry.

355
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,000
And he is.

356
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:54,920
He's mighty.

357
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:56,860
But he's so...

358
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,200
Always so sorry.

359
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:01,060
Oh, yeah.

360
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:02,820
Dave, you're just too much, man.

361
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,720
You're over the top.

362
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,420
I'm not enough.

363
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:07,400
You're as me.

364
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,360
I try so hard.

365
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,900
It's your Dave-ness and your sorriness.

366
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:13,740
You're over the top, man.

367
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,080
You make me crack up.

368
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,180
So my weeping makes you laugh?

369
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,660
Yeah.

370
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,980
From your weeping lips will laugh.

371
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:22,760
Is that what he said?

372
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,220
You need to speak a little more clearly.

373
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:25,880
I think it was weeping witchy laugh.

374
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:26,500
Oh, no.

375
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,420
Oh, whoa, whoa.

376
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,120
Did it just happen?

377
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:28,620
No.

378
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:30,380
No, Dave.

379
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,140
You can't do that.

380
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,320
Okay.

381
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:33,740
I'll never do that again.

382
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,000
You don't ever do that again, man.

383
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:36,300
Just because.

384
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,920
Not the bubblegum garble, please.

385
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:38,460
Yeah.

386
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:43,580
Yeah, remember, even though we have hearing aids, our listeners are deaf.

387
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,920
Don't they have the implants still?

388
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,420
The all-important sausage we eat?

389
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,280
Not most of them.

390
00:25:50,280 --> 00:25:53,580
No, most of them are in their cars and they're deaf.

391
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:56,040
And they're listening to two stations at once.

392
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,740
One on their...

393
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:56,840
Oh, my God.

394
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:56,840


395
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:56,840


396
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:56,840


397
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:56,840


398
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:56,840


399
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:56,840


400
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:56,840


401
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:56,840


402
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:59,360
It's like a podcaster and one on their radio.

403
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:05,860
And that's when they're speaking about pods, they add some sort of small animals for growing

404
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,560
in their ears.

405
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,520
Pods?

406
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,100
Small animals glowing in my ear.

407
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,100
Remember, Dave, speak up.

408
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,740
Slap yourself in the face a couple of times.

409
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,520
I don't think they have a name yet for them.

410
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,580
It's small.

411
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:24,600
They reduced the pond or they, you know, stunk the swamp or created rich architecture of

412
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,020
a foreign bizarge.

413
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:26,320
Oh, God.

414
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:26,320


415
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:26,380
When I was a kid, I had a small pod.

416
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,440


417
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,440


418
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,440


419
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,440


420
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,440


421
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,440


422
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,440


423
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:26,440


424
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,820
Could be any number of those things

425
00:26:28,820 --> 00:26:30,440
I guess so

426
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,640
Goodness

427
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,500
I'm actually confused

428
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:37,660
Well that's because you're a peckerwood

429
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,500
Hey, hey, hey, hey man

430
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,260
No need to get personal

431
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:45,160
We don't need to drag race into this

432
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,140
We prefer

433
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:47,020
We prefer

434
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:49,560
We prefer to be called

435
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,120
Hobuckers, sir

436
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,480
If you don't mind

437
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,300
The notion of neon animals in my ears

438
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,020
Is just

439
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:59,500
The music in the background is from the movie

440
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,600
Dark City

441
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,100
Who did that?

442
00:27:03,260 --> 00:27:04,820
That was a very cute

443
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,840
Not cute, she's that stupid

444
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,580
That was a very deep, poignant thought

445
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,800
What did you say, Wee?

446
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,660
I forgot already

447
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,180
See, I made

448
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,780
I made sure of that

449
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:20,000
Hey, I have a rant here

450
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:21,800
That I can read to everyone

451
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,240
That I didn't write

452
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,220
So it

453
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,120
It might be pretty good

454
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:27,900
Could be, could be

455
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:28,880
I turned on

456
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:34,200
The Lonesome Scrub Genius Forum today

457
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:35,900
Where the

458
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,380
If you're an actual dues paying subgenius member

459
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:40,780
You can join it

460
00:27:41,340 --> 00:27:43,180
Because I'm the one who lets people in

461
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,400
I'm the one who knows your address

462
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,560
The gatekeeper

463
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,780
All those catechism people

464
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,720
But any, yeah, anyway

465
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:53,440
One

466
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,200
A real old time

467
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,280
Timey subgenius

468
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:59,120
I mean, he's been involved for 20 years at least

469
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,040
This is the professor pressure

470
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,380
He used to be pastor pressure

471
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:05,440
But now he's a professor

472
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,340
Such a wonderful subgenius

473
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,580
Great cook

474
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,820
Really, really generous

475
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:13,600
He comes to most X days

476
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,320
To wait for the saucers

477
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:16,760
Just as faithfully as anybody

478
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:19,140
His faith hasn't been touched

479
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,600
Anyway, he posted

480
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,400
He's naive and discredulous

481
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,000
Huh?

482
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,860
He's simply a great person

483
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,680
Oh, yeah

484
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:31,000
Anyway, this isn't real long

485
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,260
It's about half a page

486
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:32,820
He said

487
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:35,820
He titled it

488
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:37,060
What's Been Real

489
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,700
He says

490
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,280
An old friend of mine used to say

491
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:43,080
You see what you need to see

492
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,640
So I was curious about what some of you

493
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,380
Have discovered while contemplating the word of Bob

494
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,880
Maybe anytime you delve into a belief system

495
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,180
No matter how crazy you are

496
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,760
Or how crazy and convoluted it might be

497
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,140
Our minds begin to construct patterns

498
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,800
That become part of a web of beliefs

499
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,240
These beliefs shape how we feel, act and interact

500
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,920
A story you hear every now and again

501
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,780
Is how someone found the subgenius

502
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,200
And had something in them restored

503
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,300
I'm going to admit I'm one of them

504
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,200
For me, it's been a pretty interesting trip

505
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,600
Of many different colors and shades

506
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:23,220
For better or worse

507
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,640
You all...

508
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:25,180
And he's talking about the subgenius

509
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,820
He's talking to the subgeniuses

510
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:29,100
You all comprise the closest thing

511
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,080
I can think of as my tribe

512
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,520
The fact that at the root of this

513
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,240
Is the world's longest shaggy dog story

514
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:39,120
Doesn't change the truth hidden in the middle

515
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,300
Either accidental or intentional

516
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,240
One of the things I've gotten from this wild ride is this

517
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,160
When you think you got the joke

518
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,920
And then realize that if you think you got it

519
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:50,960
You don't

520
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,400
For me, that concept has been

521
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,160
One of my core principles

522
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:58,300
And it's helped me to regulate other core beliefs

523
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,720
No kidding

524
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:03,160
There is no joke, he joked

525
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:06,000
There is no belief, he believed

526
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,660
This is not a pipe

527
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,600
There's another one harder to pin down

528
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,360
Because it comes out of the idea

529
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,640
That there is a conspiracy to keep us held down

530
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:20,000
The problem is that there isn't just one conspiracy

531
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,140
But millions

532
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:23,620
There's no bloody head on it

533
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,160
It's just a jumbled down idea of a conspiracy to keep us held down

534
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:25,260
It's a jumbled down idea of a conspiracy to keep us held down

535
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:26,020
A clustered beep

536
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:30,120
A seething mass of tentacles punching our buttons

537
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:34,220
Big ones and little ones all competing for our life, liberty and happiness

538
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:37,000
Knowing this, or at least believing I know it

539
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,260
Made me realize how much of my soul I was selling

540
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:43,360
It was literally profound and life changing

541
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:46,820
I hadn't realized how loud the calliope music was

542
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:49,800
Until I got off that damn merry-go-round

543
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,940
Thanks Bob

544
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,280
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

545
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:54,840
Glitter

546
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,160
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

547
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,500
I don't know why there's a song in the background.

548
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,040
That's terrible.

549
00:30:58,060 --> 00:31:00,800
Anyway, that was Professor Pressure.

550
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,260
Praise Professor Pressure.

551
00:31:03,660 --> 00:31:05,740
May I offer some criticism?

552
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,540
In the middle, there was that part about the middle.

553
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:12,320
I thought he should have had that more in the beginning and less towards the end.

554
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:17,560
But outside of that, I would say it was very refreshing looking, very succinct,

555
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,960
and summing up the entirety of our being.

556
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:22,120
Of our problem.

557
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,220
And our solution.

558
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,060
Our solution is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

559
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,320
Faith in that man, Bob.

560
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:31,020
You don't have to even know what he's talking about.

561
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:32,540
Just have faith in him.

562
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:37,540
And the slack will come pouring upon you like snow melting off the roof

563
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:42,840
and unexpectedly creeping down in front of your dress, chilling you,

564
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,900
scaring you half to death.

565
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:45,860
That's what Bob is.

566
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,640
He's that drip from the icicle that suddenly hits you right where you're most sensitive

567
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,760
and makes you go, whoop!

568
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:53,860
Well.

569
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:55,520
I guess I'm going to notice this guy.

570
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,500
I have to agree with that, yep.

571
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:57,560
Buddy got that.

572
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,080
Buddy, the guard dog.

573
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,140
Buddy, the guard dog, he heard that drip hitting you.

574
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,100
Did you hear that?

575
00:32:05,380 --> 00:32:06,840
He punctuated it.

576
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,860
That's like an exclamation point.

577
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:14,040
There was a little bark up there.

578
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,800
He barked twice.

579
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:23,940
We used to have, oh damn it, would be howling or yowling in the background.

580
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:26,860
He's a little bit of a wuss.

581
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:26,860


582
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:26,860


583
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:26,860


584
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:26,860


585
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:26,860


586
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:28,480
Hey, it snowed in Texas today.

587
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:32,180
It's snowed in Texas today.

588
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,740
It's snowed in Texas today.

589
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:36,320
It's snowed in Texas today.

590
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,500
I thought about running down to the highway just to park near the highway and watch all

591
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:46,040
the car wrecks because that's what Texans do if there's a little bit of snow or ice.

592
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:49,920
Well, that's probably why we saw those white stripes on the road yesterday.

593
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:54,200
Yeah, there were mysterious, like extra white stripes in the road.

594
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,200


595
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,200


596
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,200


597
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,200


598
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,200


599
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,260
like four stripes in each lane.

600
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,400
And we Googled that.

601
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:01,360
We Googled it, and they said, it's just saline.

602
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,600
It's not chemtrails.

603
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,840
It's not Valium to make you, you know.

604
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,380
Make your car sleepy.

605
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:09,580
Yeah, it's just, it's not mind-controlled drugs.

606
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:14,860
It's just, it's a saline solution so that the ice,

607
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,360
instead of turning into hard ice, it'll be kind of mushy ice.

608
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,940
That was pretty good timing on their part

609
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:26,120
because we did actually get a very brief 10 minutes of sleety snow,

610
00:33:26,340 --> 00:33:30,660
which made all the prickly pear, green cactus look great,

611
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:34,860
but it was gone in an hour.

612
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,920
The snow was gone,

613
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:41,640
except in the shadow of the sacred subgenius shed

614
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,100
where the sun does not shine.

615
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:47,160
That's the place where the sun doesn't shine.

616
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,980
The snow is still there.

617
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,580
Yeah, the snow will be there.

618
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:51,620
It's going to be there all summer long

619
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:56,940
because the unholy shadow of the holy shed is like a,

620
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,880
it doesn't just hold back the sun.

621
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:03,100
It holds back all the warmth and radiation and human love.

622
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:05,620
And you go inside, and there's snow everywhere.

623
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,940
The walls and ceiling are covered with snow

624
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,280
that is permanent and never goes away.

625
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:13,160
And yet there's a heater on in there,

626
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,040
but none of it melts or drips.

627
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:19,180
It's like held in place by eldritch Lovecraftian magic.

628
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:19,820
It's magic.

629
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:23,580
Yeah, and I found, it was so magical.

630
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:27,400
Dave, yesterday I opened the box.

631
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:31,880
It's like the most nondescript box in the whole room.

632
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,800
It's the oldest, most beat up box.

633
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,760
You wouldn't keep anything important in there.

634
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:36,640
But of course.

635
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:38,460
I thought you kept thousands of nondescript boxes.

636
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:38,940
We do.

637
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,720
And this is the most nondescript.

638
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,520
Of course, that draws attention to it.

639
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:44,700
I knew there was something wrong with that.

640
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,300
It's the most nondescript.

641
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,260
The cops would instantly go to that one.

642
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,560
Anyway, inside this nondescript,

643
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:54,240
this nondescript box is the original one true Dobbs head.

644
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:58,600
The little yellow piece of clip art from the Yellow Pages,

645
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:02,880
a clip art book that Philo and I simultaneously found

646
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:07,040
in his clip art book and that all Dobbs heads,

647
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:12,080
all Dobbs heads are descended from this object in the shed.

648
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:12,540
Yes.

649
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:15,120
Now behind that object for the first time,

650
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,980
well, actually in the very back of the,

651
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:18,440
is he whispering?

652
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:19,720
Or is that the back of the book?

653
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:20,900
He's whispering.

654
00:35:21,020 --> 00:35:22,700
It must be the evil background music.

655
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:26,880
In the back of the back of the box under the last folder

656
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,560
was a memo from Bob that we'd never seen before.

657
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:33,300
No one.

658
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:36,180
I mean, we thought we thought we'd found them all, you know.

659
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,620
But it's like Hendrix tapes sooner or later.

660
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:42,140
A really killer one surfaces that you didn't know existed.

661
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,440
And it was a memo from Bob.

662
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:48,620
It's one of those steno notes from the late 50s or early 60s.

663
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,060
And here's what it said.

664
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,440
Get ready.

665
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,240
It's kind of shocking, but it'll make you feel better.

666
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:02,000
But we're only hurting the feelings of idiots.

667
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:04,840
That was the quote.

668
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:05,980
That was the quote, Bob.

669
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:08,500
But we were. But we're.

670
00:36:08,660 --> 00:36:10,720
Let me get this straight and get it right.

671
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:14,840
But we are. But we are only hurting the feelings of idiots.

672
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,060
Now, I guess that could be another bumper.

673
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:19,760
Yeah, that's not a good aping style.

674
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,860
This is an idiot.

675
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:26,020
You know, I know it's weird that Bob would say idiot because he's famous for

676
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,640
being practically brainless, but lucky, right?

677
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:31,480
And yeah, and it's often termed an idiot himself.

678
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:33,580
It doesn't make sense. It just doesn't make sense.

679
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,460
Well, but remember, Bob is beyond what we

680
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:40,960
think of as morality or good or he's beyond those things.

681
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:43,060
So be conscious of hurting someone's feelings.

682
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:47,340
That's that's well, it it may have been just the most innocent expression

683
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:48,060


684
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,760
But we're only a joke.

685
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:56,780
It could have been like a joke made to a stranger in a grocery store line.

686
00:36:57,020 --> 00:37:00,620
Well, the thing is, sometimes with your with your cans of grapes and stuff,

687
00:37:00,700 --> 00:37:05,300
it's going to rain tomorrow and you say, go screw yourself and get out.

688
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,300
I'll force you, Mark, like a dog.

689
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:12,000
And then somebody said, but we're only hurting the feelings of idiots.

690
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:13,920
Like, that's OK.

691
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:17,680
Like, I think Bob just honestly felt

692
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:20,700
that, well, that's just self-evident.

693
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,000
And so but we're only hurting the feelings of idiots.

694
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:26,740
And I guess it follows that that means it's all right.

695
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:29,040
But I don't care. He's right.

696
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:31,000
He's absolutely right.

697
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:34,680
If you think about it, if anybody gets their feelings hurt by Church

698
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:38,160
of the subgenius, that's exactly what proves they're an idiot.

699
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,680
Even lower than a subgenius.

700
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:44,540
And when we call somebody dumb, man, that's doctor.

701
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:47,560
We already have a pretty low bar.

702
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,160
When somebody goes below us, give me a break.

703
00:37:51,540 --> 00:37:53,220
You got to be putting me on.

704
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,360
It's like doing that famous holiday dance

705
00:37:56,360 --> 00:38:01,060
they used to do on the beaches in 1967, the Bimini Bimbo Limbo.

706
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:04,380
That's a very low bar to get under if she asked me.

707
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,580
I would never stand.

708
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,280
I never stand in line for that guy.

709
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,860
I don't take it all seriously.

710
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:10,880
That's how I get by.

711
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:16,340
You see, if I see Bob in my mind, I know something terrible could happen at any moment.

712
00:38:16,540 --> 00:38:17,360
I don't interpret.

713
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:21,980
I'm the same way that most of you do, because they see an image of Bob.

714
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:24,040
They think slack, slack.

715
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,280
Everything's going to be so merciful and sweet.

716
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:30,340
Everything like a little diamond dog vagina.

717
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,520
But after the day,

718
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:35,040
calm down, Dave, calm down. It'll be OK.

719
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:38,460
If Bob's not here now, I don't think you're safe.

720
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:41,640
I don't I don't think he hasn't been tracked anywhere near Ashtabula.

721
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:46,380
Well, if he didn't have, you know, going into the, you know, going into the,

722
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,680
you know, Dr. Sinister saw him in Cleveland once.

723
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,340
So I'm getting hit by a car.

724
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,720
Yeah. And then he was right back.

725
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:55,640
Right.

726
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:57,960
Suddenly back in the pipe shop again.

727
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,340
So we're crazy.

728
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,260
Totally not.

729
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:05,460
I remember him talking about the time that he actually and I and he actually I believed it.

730
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,480
Yeah, yeah.

731
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:14,460
It's conceivable that that story got played on WCSB again tonight because they were for our slack.

732
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,920
They can't play this.

733
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,880
Live as we're doing it.

734
00:39:17,940 --> 00:39:22,600
They have to play it live on off of a CD about three months later.

735
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,920
They record. They were playing the New Year's show

736
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:30,320
when we both when we all called into to the doctor's Sinister's show on New Year's.

737
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,220
And they were playing what?

738
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:35,160
So I was playing that now and they were playing.

739
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:39,400
So now it's the second time the poor Cleveland listeners had to hear that show.

740
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:44,660
But they're chained to their radios at nine o'clock p.m. Sunday.

741
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:46,020
So. And.

742
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,160
All the way through all the way through to like two in the morning.

743
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:54,040
They're pretty much pinned like, yeah, like butterflies on display struggling.

744
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:54,640
But they're alive.

745
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,720
They're in there on the display.

746
00:39:56,740 --> 00:39:57,660
And they're struggling.

747
00:39:57,760 --> 00:40:02,660
You're going, please turn off the hour of slack and radio synesthesia and radio.

748
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,320
Please, please.

749
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,460
I can't take it anymore.

750
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,060
But you can't turn it off because that's

751
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:11,340
part of the signal that prevents you from reaching for that dial.

752
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,640
Metaphorically, that you're pinned.

753
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:15,800
You're pinned.

754
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:18,640
It's almost not metaphorical.

755
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,200
Well, yeah, of course not, because that's why we're crying right now,

756
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:28,260
because you are so many troops over there in Parma, the West Side areas.

757
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:32,700
There's so many in here, including I don't know about Galveston or Sweet,

758
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:36,560
Sweet Galveston, Tejas or San Antonio.

759
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,720
Those places are so far away.

760
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:42,640
They're like three normal sized states away from here.

761
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,400
Everything is that far from here.

762
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,080
Except Granbury.

763
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,320
Granbury is pretty close.

764
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,140
I've been I've been saying that this was the edge of the hill country.

765
00:40:51,300 --> 00:40:53,380
And I looked it up and I've been I've been lying.

766
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:56,200
It's not the hill country is way, way south here.

767
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,700
It starts sort of around Austin and goes west.

768
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,620
Enchanted Rock and Fredericksville.

769
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:02,680
All right. That's right.

770
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,260
It is hillier than here.

771
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:06,500
And they do have

772
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:14,020
some bigger rocks like the one giant piece of granite the size of the moon.

773
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:15,780
It's poking out of Texas there.

774
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,860
That's a cool place, man.

775
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:21,600
That is the Enchanted Rockets, this giant pink granite dome

776
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:27,420
that sheds every five billion years, little bits slide off the dome.

777
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,860
I'd love to ride one down, but.

778
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,440
Yeah, let's go.

779
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,920
But the weather's going to be great.

780
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:39,300
Oh, wait, I have to do a job.

781
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:39,920
So do you.

782
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,840
Darn it. Yeah, but don't slip off the backside.

783
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,920
Do you. Yeah, that's right.

784
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:49,800
If you go to Enchanted Rock, first off, don't go today.

785
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:51,060
It's 32 degrees.

786
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,280
You're going to freeze you.

787
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:53,820
You're going to catch your death cold.

788
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:57,620
You freeze to death and you might fall off the backside.

789
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:04,280
Later, we discovered that there is a backside to the Enchanted Rock.

790
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,180
Oh, yes, it is enchanted on the front side.

791
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:12,080
But then if you go around to the backside, there's a hole.

792
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:13,220
There really is.

793
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:14,080
There's a.

794
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:14,720
There's a cave.

795
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:18,400
In fact, I found some pictures of us in it.

796
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:20,880
Only you weren't one of us then.

797
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:23,900
It's in the 70s.

798
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,600
I've been dwelling in the 70s all day because I found a bunch of.

799
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,160
Like you've got flared bell bottoms on your underpants, like you're wearing,

800
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:36,860
especially got like a wax massage and singing those Tony Orlando songs.

801
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:39,220
Well, how do you know?

802
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,240
Stuff like that.

803
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,440
How do you have that's uncanny that he.

804
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,540
We don't have we're not doing a teleconference.

805
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,320
I think it's he's just psychic.

806
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:53,340
I can I guess in my mind I can see like a pair of white patent leather.

807
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:57,220
OK, does does my hair look just like it did in the 70s?

808
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:58,600
Pretty much.

809
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,180
Yeah, actually, he smells it.

810
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:02,880
Do I still smell like patchouli?

811
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,520
Yeah, you smell like patchouli oil.

812
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,320
You smell like I smell like Buddy.

813
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:10,580
But

814
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,360
areas.

815
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:13,380
I've.

816
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:15,460
I've had a hey, hey.

817
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,560
Oh, my my sister had the the list.

818
00:43:18,660 --> 00:43:21,160
We'll have to read it next time because I'm using it.

819
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,240
I don't know.

820
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:24,160
I'm afraid to mess with the phone right now.

821
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:27,460
But my my sister texted me her definitions

822
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:30,580
of the hair patterns in different areas of dogs.

823
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:36,020
Like, for instance, the fifth is the little whorl on the chest.

824
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:42,380
And then the fifth is the one around the tank and so forth.

825
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:44,060
She had all these different names.

826
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,520
She has defined them.

827
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,680
And we will share that next next week or next rerun or something.

828
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,400
Yes, they all have.

829
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:55,280
But what I was going to say, Dave, OK, they're making this documentary movie.

830
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:55,920
Right.

831
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:59,160
About the early days of Church of the subgenius

832
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,560
that which has kind of irritated some

833
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:09,040
later day saints who didn't come along until, say, 1990 or 91,

834
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,280
because the movie makers aren't as.

835
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:13,840
Interested in what happened then.

836
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,580
It was like the very early years when everything was really crazy.

837
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:23,120
That's the focus before it before, you know, the craziness was all legislated.

838
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:27,260
And, you know, there's a certain order to how when how you launched a bleeding head

839
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:30,240
of all this rigmarole, you know, a bunch of.

840
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,920
They started to lose the spirit.

841
00:44:32,980 --> 00:44:37,280
So they're focusing on the early stuff and they're desperate for early photos

842
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,140
of especially me and Philo, but they also interviewed Sterno and Onan.

843
00:44:42,380 --> 00:44:43,740
And then a lot.

844
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:45,380
And I'm going to force them to get G.

845
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:46,960
Gordon Gordon anyway.

846
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:48,820
So we had to find old.

847
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:51,420
It's up to me to find the old photos.

848
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:53,700
And I kept saying, oh, we got tons of them.

849
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,500
Well, maybe, but they weren't real good digital copies.

850
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:04,640
And so I've been finding the old originals and negatives and scanning them.

851
00:45:05,960 --> 00:45:11,120
And God, I was so stupid looking in the 70s.

852
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:13,240
I know the feeling.

853
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:15,600
I was so stupid. I was cute.

854
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:18,360
I was so handsome. I can't believe it.

855
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,460
I thought I was ugly.

856
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:23,180
I honestly as when I was 20 years old, I thought I was ugly.

857
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:25,880
When I was 16, I thought I was ugly.

858
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:29,260
Was cute as I could be a slim and cute.

859
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:33,380
But I was stupid looking in every one of those pictures.

860
00:45:33,460 --> 00:45:35,600
I just looked like an idiot. No.

861
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:41,420
Yeah. And I'm going to end up with a time lapse of pictures of myself looking like

862
00:45:41,420 --> 00:45:44,440
an idiot from age of two to now.

863
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:48,080
There's not one picture of me looking like

864
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:51,040
a serious author with a pipe or anything like that.

865
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:53,600
It's all like, well, there's pipes in it,

866
00:45:53,660 --> 00:45:56,140
but it's always looking like an idiot with a pipe.

867
00:45:56,300 --> 00:46:00,680
No, there's a lot of great serious pictures of you, including your high school graduate.

868
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,700
You think it'll hurt the feelings of idiots?

869
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,080
You're mean to yourself.

870
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:06,580
Lean into the mic.

871
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:11,240
I think we are devolving right now into our maternal

872
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:13,960
instincts and protecting our husband's elbows.

873
00:46:14,180 --> 00:46:15,140
Mr. McStay.

874
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,000
I'm simply being honest.

875
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,040
No, when you see these particular pictures, you'll go, oh, my God.

876
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:25,340
They must have thought they was real cool to be that stoned or that drunk.

877
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,200
Yeah, I mean, the smile gives it away.

878
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:31,160
A lot of the smiles, your smile when you have pictures of yourself in the 70s and

879
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:35,560
80s and stuff, you go, what the blank, you know, this is like.

880
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,000
And you start laughing real hard.

881
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:40,100
For some reason, my eyes are always behind that smile.

882
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:41,080
It's like totally.

883
00:46:41,420 --> 00:46:44,120
He is an idiot or was an idiot.

884
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,320
Well, I don't know.

885
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,840
I mean, it's just like you can you look at that and you go, yeah,

886
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,700
that guy's a sub genius, all right.

887
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:54,220
And the weird thing is, I look so much like my nephew.

888
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,440
I always thought my nephew looked like an idiot.

889
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,820
And I don't think that's weird.

890
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,720
Anyway, it's not.

891
00:47:00,840 --> 00:47:01,720
Not everybody does.

892
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:04,560
So does my nephew look exactly like my nephew?

893
00:47:05,720 --> 00:47:08,420
Oh, the things that we don't know for certain.

894
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,600
It's just so perplexing.

895
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:11,180
That's why I'm glad I'm not.

896
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:15,320
A true member of the church is subgenius because I'd be slapping my forehead all

897
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,020
day going with that, but what do you mean you're not a true man?

898
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:19,840
You mean you're not?

899
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,800
You didn't send in your thirty five bucks.

900
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,780
It was only twenty bucks when you were.

901
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:26,160
I bribed you with twenty bucks.

902
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,080
You said keep it. I'm just kidding.

903
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,960
That's because I didn't want you on the saucers with me because you to tell

904
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:36,760
the truth, man, you the cigarette smell just I just didn't want you on this.

905
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,020
So full of baloney.

906
00:47:38,060 --> 00:47:39,280
That is the biggest lie.

907
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:40,160
He's going to give.

908
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:41,640
Give somebody a free membership.

909
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,980
That's when you give some.

910
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,520
That's the saddest thing.

911
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:49,600
I mean, I hate to tell you that, man, but it's like if I give somebody a free

912
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:53,860
membership, that's that's as good as me saying, well, at least I don't have to deal

913
00:47:53,860 --> 00:47:57,720
with you on the saucers because you never had sent in the thirty five bucks.

914
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,140
So I actually did.

915
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:04,300
I actually sent the thirty five bucks to subgenius foundation, which I own.

916
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,600
But I didn't even have to come back to you.

917
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,660
Just like your Germanic.

918
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,420
And he said you were going to send a picture of what's his name?

919
00:48:13,880 --> 00:48:15,900
Scotty and oatmeal through the windows.

920
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:17,420
My kids are doomed.

921
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,620
Somebody else bought somebody else bought memberships for my kids.

922
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:25,560
But if they didn't really buy it, you can't let that happen.

923
00:48:26,680 --> 00:48:27,960
Yeah. Don't tell him.

924
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,620
We don't have to worry about him hearing this hearing it on the show.

925
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:36,040
That won't have spasmodic dancing, unfortunate rhythms and everything like that.

926
00:48:36,100 --> 00:48:39,640
You got some of these children have to be put in the proper atmosphere.

927
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:44,800
Like for kids with autism or, you know, different.

928
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:48,420
And I beg to differ with you.

929
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:57,060
You gifted all of your nieces and nephews with memberships for Christmas about ten

930
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:00,800
years ago, all of them were given your children.

931
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:02,540
Well, I'm going to have to edit all this

932
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:06,500
out because they're going to all be offended that I kicked them off the saucers.

933
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,020
But they just they.

934
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:12,640
They don't like the you know, they always want to watch the movie.

935
00:49:12,740 --> 00:49:13,500
I don't care about.

936
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,740
They don't want to play my video game.

937
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,580
You always just want to play their video games.

938
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:18,620
Too bad.

939
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:23,040
But they didn't read the first page of Book of the Subgenius or the first page

940
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,780
of the first pamphlet, their tough luck if our site gives them a headache.

941
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,480
Well, so be it.

942
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:30,520
That's funny.

943
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:35,340
My daughter actually says she has been saying this since she was about five.

944
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:39,380
But that as soon as she starts

945
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:41,220
sharing the hour of slack, she gets a headache.

946
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:46,320
And she I mean, she it's not she's not trying to hurt my feelings.

947
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,100
She's serious.

948
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:51,540
Well, doesn't that make you feel better?

949
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:52,580
Just think of it.

950
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,100
It's not an involuntary spasmodic reaction.

951
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:56,640
She thinks it sucks.

952
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,860
I mean, no, I mean, that I know she.

953
00:50:01,920 --> 00:50:07,120
But there was a time when she was she was actually helping Jesus.

954
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:12,280
Jesus, our our our our erstwhile business partner.

955
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,360
And she was helping him with a mail out or something.

956
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:19,660
He had a crappy revival recording in the background.

957
00:50:19,780 --> 00:50:23,180
I think it's me and like him preaching and she's listening to that.

958
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:24,140
It wasn't very good.

959
00:50:26,020 --> 00:50:30,400
I don't know why it was even on and she goes, you know, to tell the truth,

960
00:50:30,500 --> 00:50:32,500
I don't think I'd be very interested in this stuff.

961
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,740
You know, from hearing this, I'm like, that's OK.

962
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:39,620
She was it was a really crappy one.

963
00:50:39,780 --> 00:50:41,060
No one ever bought it anyway.

964
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,260
It was one that I released to the people.

965
00:50:43,380 --> 00:50:46,340
Some people in Madison recorded a

966
00:50:47,160 --> 00:50:50,400
some ranting we did in a bar, but it was a bad record.

967
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:52,080
The people in the bar were all talking.

968
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:54,920
They weren't listening to us and they had they were marked to

969
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:00,860
that it was like it sounded like to a couple of drunks yelling and

970
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:06,460
and Reverend Velveteen Sly was there there's a whole it does have some some

971
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:06,860
cool.

972
00:51:07,120 --> 00:51:12,520
Ranting by her and Sister Heidi and, you know, some unusual stuff that's not in

973
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,400
most of our old tape that revival then fire.

974
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:16,980
Yeah. Divide and fire.

975
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:21,180
That was ironical because the night the night after we had that

976
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,480
unfortunate revival, oh, somebody stole the bleeding head.

977
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,540
We had a really good replica.

978
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,000
It was a replica, but it was a detailed replica bleeding head.

979
00:51:31,180 --> 00:51:35,660
Somebody stole it from the bar and we were horrified.

980
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,060
The next.

981
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:40,120
We got up the next morning and read in the paper that that bar burned to the

982
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,320
ground that night right after our show.

983
00:51:44,060 --> 00:51:47,720
I don't suppose it could have been that fire juggling that Circus Apocalypse did.

984
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:49,640
But or was that before their time?

985
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:50,720
Yeah, it was.

986
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:54,420
That was before they're trying to put the blame for the fire on the guys in the side.

987
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,660
Show that's all you give a gobble.

988
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,280
Give a gobble. You are one of us.

989
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,300
Oh, man. I've actually seen it.

990
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,080
We accept you.

991
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:05,360
I've seen a couple of close calls and they have set up at the Carnegie.

992
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,040
In

993
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:11,240
Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Circus Apocalypse.

994
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:14,380
I hadn't even gotten to preach yet.

995
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:19,000
Circus Apocalypse did their fire juggling act and the fire alarm went off and we all

996
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:24,700
had to go outside in the snow and legumes stood there on the steps of that Carnegie

997
00:52:24,700 --> 00:52:29,140
place with a bullhorn bellowing like something out of Planet of the Apes.

998
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:29,440
You know,

999
00:52:30,860 --> 00:52:32,360
I'm not killing.

1000
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,040
So the video of that.

1001
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:37,080
That was interesting.

1002
00:52:37,740 --> 00:52:39,700
Yes, I bet I could find that.

1003
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:43,800
But we can't use it because like him is angry at the church.

1004
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:46,420
He says everyone in the church is jerks now.

1005
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,620
Not two years ago.

1006
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:51,900
Right about that part, at least the very, very end of what he said.

1007
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:54,180
Everybody in the church is jerks.

1008
00:52:54,520 --> 00:53:03,320
But he should use the wrong nominative case because he said everybody in the church is are his creeps or is.

1009
00:53:03,700 --> 00:53:05,020
Well, actually, he used a word.

1010
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:05,880
I don't want to.

1011
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:08,740
I don't want to censor because it's very difficult to trim.

1012
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:14,880
Well, yeah, you're if you're talking about his stage vegetables, as they used to call it in France.

1013
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:21,400
The backside is that they're every let's just say everybody in the church is subgenius is a backside.

1014
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:24,540
Well, two years ago, I've got this.

1015
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:27,800
He did a teleconference and told everyone

1016
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:30,400
at X Day who was sitting there, all 20 of us.

1017
00:53:30,460 --> 00:53:35,880
He goes, you know, if you get into where you think everybody around you is.

1018
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:39,380
Backside, probably you're the backside.

1019
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,640
So just quit being a backside.

1020
00:53:42,180 --> 00:53:43,940
I quit being a backside.

1021
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:49,020
And if I was there, I'd make sweet love every single one of you girls.

1022
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:49,920
It was pretty funny.

1023
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:56,200
But he has now contradicted himself and is saying that everybody is a backside in the church is a genius.

1024
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:03,580
It's like, well, I certainly don't wouldn't know how to even begin to answer such a primordial supposition.

1025
00:54:03,780 --> 00:54:04,400
Especially for.

1026
00:54:04,580 --> 00:54:05,720
We're all backsides.

1027
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,860
Professor. Yeah, we all are.

1028
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:10,540
But we're all we all have a front side to why not?

1029
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,000
Both.

1030
00:54:12,660 --> 00:54:17,800
We're all enchanted rocks or magic stones or walking backwards.

1031
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,260
Yeah. Everybody is a star.

1032
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:26,120
Of course, most stars can't support life or planets with life.

1033
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:30,260
The vast majority of stars would destroy you instantly.

1034
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,120
Everybody is also a backside.

1035
00:54:34,540 --> 00:54:35,680
Yep, everybody is.

1036
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:36,980
And has one.

1037
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,680
When I climb your.

1038
00:54:40,140 --> 00:54:42,560
You're a gleaming white hump.

1039
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:44,740
You're gleaming white hump.

1040
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,220
Dave wrote a new song.

1041
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:51,640
Dave is so creative.

1042
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,160
He just they just jump out of him.

1043
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,880
He's from that 60s book of candy.

1044
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:57,460
It's called Gleaming White Hump.

1045
00:54:58,220 --> 00:55:03,140
Oh, I've read that about ten times by Terry Southern, my fellow Texan.

1046
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:04,700
Gleaming White Hump.

1047
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:05,520
No, there's.

1048
00:55:06,060 --> 00:55:07,640
The dwarf had a gleaming white hump.

1049
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:11,520
But he's a Mexican gardener, isn't he?

1050
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:13,860
But or is that a different dwarf?

1051
00:55:13,860 --> 00:55:15,980
He was portrayed by Ringo Starr, wasn't he?

1052
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:16,740
Yeah, right.

1053
00:55:17,780 --> 00:55:18,940
Yeah, that was.

1054
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:21,900
That's before Ringo Starr was a professional football player.

1055
00:55:21,980 --> 00:55:26,940
Just think of all the intense pressure there was on him last Sunday when the

1056
00:55:26,940 --> 00:55:30,140
Super Bowl game was going on and everybody's.

1057
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,300
I thought he was an Olympic.

1058
00:55:31,300 --> 00:55:35,000
And then they had a riot afterwards and people were screaming, Viva Zapata and stuff.

1059
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:37,540
And then they had a riot.

1060
00:55:37,540 --> 00:55:38,760
Because they didn't want to go home.

1061
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:41,700
They knew they were really born across the border in Mexico.

1062
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,200
But Ringo's my favorite Beatle because he

1063
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,400
was in all the coolest, much cooler movies than any of the other Beatles were.

1064
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:51,080
Like Caveman, 200 Motels,

1065
00:55:51,860 --> 00:55:56,540
The Magic Christian, just to name three unbelievable classics.

1066
00:55:57,240 --> 00:56:02,100
Well, actually, Caveman is pretty bad, but he met Barbara, his wife to be Barbara

1067
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:05,840
Bach on the set of that movie, which I've never seen.

1068
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:08,760
Even even though it has dinosaurs in it, I've never seen it.

1069
00:56:08,980 --> 00:56:10,080
I've just seen clips.

1070
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:15,280
So I know it's stupid, but anyway, Ringo's cool, though.

1071
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:16,340
Yeah, Ringo's cool.

1072
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:17,540
I mean, he might be a jerk.

1073
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,580
He might be a backside, but he was in some

1074
00:56:19,580 --> 00:56:24,360
funny movies and he played Frank Zappa with a liver puddley an accent.

1075
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:29,660
I remember the Pud overtures.

1076
00:56:30,120 --> 00:56:34,900
That was a terrible, terrible blight back in the days of ancient Londonium when they

1077
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,840
used to draw the oysters right out of the Thames River.

1078
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:42,240
They just go over there and they just grab a handful and put them on the bucket fire

1079
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:48,020
and stone it up just like there was some kind of huge old garbage man or something.

1080
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,440
You know, that's why I never joined.

1081
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:58,040
I would never tell my child to join the Navy or any other police force unless they

1082
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:04,120
had the proper equipment and were forced freedom down different tubes.

1083
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,000
I just I'm again.

1084
00:57:07,060 --> 00:57:10,300
I think you'd be a really good, responsible parent that way.

1085
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:10,620
Dad.

1086
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:16,520
Well, I think you've got me all emotional inside right now.

1087
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:18,520
Oh, just for saying that.

1088
00:57:18,580 --> 00:57:19,380
It makes me sad.

1089
00:57:19,420 --> 00:57:21,640
I want to cry and get happy somehow.

1090
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:28,320
You see, friends, when you're a member of the Church of the subgenius, you're in a

1091
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:33,480
tribe of backsides who hate each other. Yes.

1092
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:34,000
Us.

1093
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:40,180
Our friends, as the late great Chaz Smith said, are so fucked up.

1094
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:46,200
Now, you said that for the for the other audience rather than the politician.

1095
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:49,980
Oh, I'll have to bleep it for the broadcast audience.

1096
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:54,540
Do you ever use a horn sound like a bicycle?

1097
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,320
I don't want to.

1098
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,960
No, I usually either.

1099
00:57:58,060 --> 00:58:01,440
He's I send you sometimes I send you the censored chest.

1100
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:02,760
I know.

1101
00:58:02,820 --> 00:58:04,680
I think I usually send him the uncensored.

1102
00:58:04,900 --> 00:58:06,120
The ones that they go.

1103
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:13,640
I usually use just an irritating noise, but like a wrong answer buzzer.

1104
00:58:14,020 --> 00:58:19,940
Although sometimes we use the word Bob for to replace a cuss word.

1105
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:23,840
And lately I've been using Trump or trumping.

1106
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:27,680
Yeah, I remember the days of Trumping things.

1107
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:31,900
Get your trumping backside out of here.

1108
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:33,720
Oh, no.

1109
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:34,540
I'm known as Mr.

1110
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:35,100
Trout.

1111
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:39,580
I'm going to up here.

1112
00:58:39,660 --> 00:58:43,500
I'm going to I'm going to trump up your Bob.

1113
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:46,380
What a trumping backside.

1114
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:47,400
Yeah.

1115
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,960
Do you think you're in your trumping backside?

1116
00:58:51,100 --> 00:58:51,700
Trumpy

1117
00:58:53,420 --> 00:58:55,940
is like one of the people.

1118
00:58:56,800 --> 00:58:57,580
All right.

1119
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:00,020
Oh, he's one of Mr.

1120
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:03,240
Trump could could conceivably hiding his.

1121
00:59:03,720 --> 00:59:07,760
His ethnic background, like he slobbered on one of those Q-tips and sent it back

1122
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,360
to the factory where they do the demographic for you.

1123
00:59:11,120 --> 00:59:16,360
And if he was to look at his view to find out who's one of the lizard people.

1124
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:17,640
What?

1125
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:19,960
And he was a lizard.

1126
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:21,960
He had reptilian blood.

1127
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,760
Oh, oh, oh, you believe in that conspiracy.

1128
00:59:24,860 --> 00:59:26,420
They're really fish people, man.

1129
00:59:26,700 --> 00:59:27,620
Give me a break.

1130
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:31,540
Well, then maybe they're the children of the old ones.

1131
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:32,800
They live in the deep.

1132
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:35,040
They'll go back to the sea someday and leave us.

1133
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:36,120
Oh, yes.

1134
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,760
He's up here alone with the humans.

1135
00:59:39,340 --> 00:59:41,460
Hey, look, Dave, we have to the show's over.

1136
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:43,220
We have to go. It really is.

1137
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:44,720
The show's over. It's OK.

1138
00:59:44,840 --> 00:59:46,740
It's P.O. Box 807.

1139
00:59:46,800 --> 00:59:48,100
Glen Rose, Texas.

1140
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,760
Seven six zero four three.

1141
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:52,140
That's how you find

1142
00:59:53,380 --> 00:59:55,300
where to send your

1143
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:59,120
confirmation card when you're confirmed.

1144
00:59:59,320 --> 00:59:59,600
Yes.

1145
00:59:59,600 --> 00:59:59,880
Dave.

1146
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:05,220
And this has been our site number one thousand six hundred and sixty one.

1147
01:00:06,600 --> 01:00:13,980
Not bad with our guest, except he's not he's really just like a he's a host.

1148
01:00:15,020 --> 01:00:16,340
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1149
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:20,060
That's the that the that the phone phone man.

1150
01:00:20,140 --> 01:00:21,500
He doesn't have a head.

1151
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:22,400
It's just a voice.

1152
01:00:22,920 --> 01:00:24,840
And the neck by neck.

1153
01:00:25,340 --> 01:00:27,660
I learned some cowboy.

1154
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:28,320
And.

1155
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,420
Yes, we and we heard from Buddy just very.

1156
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:34,420
I don't know if you can hear him of the background.

1157
01:00:34,520 --> 01:00:37,680
He made a lot more sense to the whole three rest of us.

1158
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,180
Well, if you're a dog.

1159
01:00:41,020 --> 01:00:41,920
All right.

1160
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:45,440
And so if you're any sense of being here, Wolf and Roof.

1161
01:00:45,540 --> 01:00:50,820
And so we must sadly sign off and sign away our souls.

1162
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:56,520
That's a sign from heaven not stored in any souls.

1163
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,300
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1164
01:00:59,600 --> 01:01:08,060
Our salvation and our slackness all rolled into one big grinning head.

1165
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,680
Half tone dots.

1166
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,080
With a trademark sign next to it.

1167
01:01:16,200 --> 01:01:18,240
Little R inside a circle.

1168
01:01:18,280 --> 01:01:19,640
Actually registered trademark.

1169
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:20,760
Praise Bob.

1170
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:21,960
Praise Bob.

1171
01:01:22,280 --> 01:01:23,140
Praise Bob.
