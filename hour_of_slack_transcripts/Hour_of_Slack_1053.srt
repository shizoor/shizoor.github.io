1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,680
Do the family a favor and remind mother to get a can or two of Spam when she shops tomorrow.

2
00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:08,740
This delicious meat packed in a handy can is grand to eat.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,720
Easy to serve, cold or hot.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,080
Tomorrow, ask for Spam.

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:15,540
Listen to this.

6
00:00:15,820 --> 00:00:16,920
It says...

7
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,880
The Self Genius Power of Spam.

8
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:23,300
Wait a minute.

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:24,040
I don't get it.

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,040
What does that mean?

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,560
It means that what is...

12
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:26,960
That's all?

13
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:27,780
That's right.

14
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,060
That's all I wanted to know.

15
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:29,160
Oh.

16
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:31,080
The whole thing sounds rather dull.

17
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:31,920
Maybe.

18
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:32,660
And maybe.

19
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,040
Yeah.

20
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:33,480
And maybe.

21
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:33,900
Yeah.

22
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,500
And maybe I'm getting a little tired of this conversation.

23
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,000
Suppose you get out of here.

24
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:39,320
Goodbye.

25
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:40,340
Oh.

26
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:41,600
All right.

27
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:49,980
Hello.

28
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,200
What's with this phone call?

29
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,900
Just wanted to tell you that...

30
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,040
I wasn't thinking...

31
00:00:59,060 --> 00:00:59,460
Thinking of leaving.

32
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,160
Yes.

33
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,720
Okay.

34
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,340
Bye.

35
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,300
Okay, boss.

36
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:03,560
Anything you say.

37
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,120
Now, let's say where were we.

38
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:09,140
You know, in a great many businesses and trades,

39
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:12,240
a man's or a woman's hands are exposed either to weather

40
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,800
or to such things as paint, grip, nicks, vaseline,

41
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:17,360
chemicals in a baby's chaps or skin.

42
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,200
But I reckon I won't have to worry about that

43
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:21,520
now this machinery has arrived.

44
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,260
Ah, yes.

45
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:28,760
Thanks to Leemers Machine.

46
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,140
We can proceed with the...

47
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,080
Well, the entunement of the Exist broadcast

48
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,060
that was intercepted by Frater Soddi.

49
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,860
Or Frater S-O-D-D-I.

50
00:01:59,060 --> 00:01:59,740
Oh, the kids.

51
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:04,200
Oh, the kids.

52
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:05,520
Hello.

53
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,580
Hello.

54
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,460
Hello.

55
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:11,880
Hello, my savior, J.R. Bob-Dot.

56
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,920
You're the slickest salesman in town.

57
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,760
From the burg of Cleveland to Mount Leisure,

58
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:22,100
the conspiracy will surely be knocked down.

59
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,800
Praise J.R. Bob-Dot.

60
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,700
Now...

61
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,040
Now, I'm going to...

62
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,020
This is Reverend Rainers Rainard from the Department of Transmutation.

63
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,440
You're listening to the Hour of Slack.

64
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,920
Scientology is just too Bob-damned expensive.

65
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,280
Bob.

66
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,940
How about conspiracy?

67
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,800
How about conspiracy?

68
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,520
How about conspiracy?

69
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:55,620
How about conspiracy?

70
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:04,640
This is the last show I'm putting together before I leave for 9X Day, my friends.

71
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:13,640
Therefore, this may be, for all we know, the last recording that the Church of the Subgenius leaves behind for the doomed world.

72
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:22,900
Rather than rerun recordings of past X Day drills that you have now missed forever,

73
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,780
I've elected to read some selections from the new Subgenius book.

74
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,360
Chances are the book will never actually make it to the bookstores,

75
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:37,480
because after X Day there probably won't be any more bookstores.

76
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,340
Not on this planet, anyway.

77
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:54,120
And so, friends, we'll start with the middle of Chapter 5 here of the Subgenius Cyclopedia of Slack.

78
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,740
The Bobliographon.

79
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,080
Bobliographon.

80
00:03:58,200 --> 00:03:58,800
Little.

81
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,280
Chapter here about the conspiracy.

82
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:11,060
And now it's decades later and everything has deteriorated on schedule.

83
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:16,880
We know the enemy far better than we did before, and here's how you recognize him.

84
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:28,860
It's anybody who says that you must be part of their clique, or their clinch, or their church, or their country, or their species, or their planet.

85
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,040
In order to have slack.

86
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:35,100
Anybody, that is, except us.

87
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,260
For we alone bear the knowledge of the ultimate secret.

88
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,060
The true truth.

89
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:49,480
No matter our age, gender, education, weight, gullibility, or number of sex organs or personalities,

90
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:56,080
our very deepest sub-subconscious memories are shared in common.

91
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,020
And what they collectively tell us.

92
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,960
Isn't pretty.

93
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:06,040
In fact, it's enough to make you want to turn your stomach inside out again.

94
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,900
We pay the conspiracy to take our money away.

95
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:14,340
That's what it's all about.

96
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,420
That's their job.

97
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,220
It's what the conspiracy is.

98
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:20,840
It's not so much that they rule over us.

99
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,280
It's that we live, breathe, and eat the conspiracy.

100
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,100
It's what we live in.

101
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,020
The conspiracy is the fishbowl.

102
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,020


103
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,520
The bowl and the water we swim in.

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,320
They don't consciously take our slack away.

105
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,500
They trample slack without ever knowing of its existence.

106
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:43,380
But this will, in fact, lead to their downfall, my friends.

107
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:50,860
For even the unthinking 10,000 year war on slack must grind to a halt.

108
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:56,480
When, thanks to their slack ignorance, the world economy finally caves in on itself.

109
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,020
The free world is the only place where we can live.

110
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:01,140
The free world is grossly overpriced.

111
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:06,640
There's really only one airline left, but that's okay with them because they own it.

112
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:11,140
There's really only one publisher left, but that's okay because they own it.

113
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,840
Only one TV network left.

114
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,960
Only one internet provider.

115
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:21,540
Only one actual political party, but that's all okay because they own it.

116
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,940
Everything is under control.

117
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,320
Right.

118
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:39,420
The craziest 1890s steam engineer, train engineer in the world is at the helm of our spaceship Earth, my friends.

119
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:46,020
Our entire planetary vehicle is careening out of control with a drunken madman at the wheel.

120
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:50,880
A bunch of drunken madmen fighting over the wheel and none of them are Bob.

121
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,980
What then is to be our destination?

122
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:56,520
The moon?

123
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,600
The future?

124
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:00,820
No friends, I'm afraid it's Hooterville.

125
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:07,300
Our future under the conspiracy is a bad sitcom that never ends.

126
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,720
Already most cities are like something out of a science fiction movie, an old science fiction movie.

127
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,360
The further north you go in any city, the more it becomes like a clockwork orange.

128
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:22,320
On the south side, it's more like Blade Runner.

129
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,960
And out in the sticks, road work.

130
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:32,860
The mass media news, that's not even like science fiction anymore, but tacky surrealism.

131
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:43,360
We're being adjusted to accept the idea that at any moment, anything can happen, including the unimaginable and the impossible, but mostly the unlikely.

132
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:51,560
And once they've gotten you to believe one impossible thing, you can get yourself to believe damn near any impossible thing.

133
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,940
Such as that it's all for your own good.

134
00:07:56,300 --> 00:08:00,100
Are you prepared to be really paranoid?

135
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,580
A little pre-paranoia never hurt anybody.

136
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,500
Don't worry about being called a kook.

137
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:13,080
We used to call the John Birchers kooks, them and all those other rabidly right-wing anti-communists,

138
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:19,020
when they were hollering that the Trilateral Commission and the Council on Foreign Relations would take over the world.

139
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,320
But by gobs, they were right!

140
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,700
The kooks were right!

141
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:32,200
Totalitarian commies did take over the world, disguised as right-wing industrialists, disguised as Christians!

142
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:44,340
We called the Christians kooks for worrying about the mark of the beast that the Antichrist would make everybody wear on their hand and their forehead.

143
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:47,540
Well, guess what, mocker?

144
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:51,920
There is a mark of the beast on your hand and on your forehead.

145
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,200
The one on your hand?

146
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,620
Is your thumbprint.

147
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,580
And thanks to face recognition software, the one on your head is your face.

148
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,440
You don't need a barcode tattooed on your forehead.

149
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,880
Your face is the mark of the beast!

150
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:16,460
They've been scientifically perfecting their various contradictions for centuries.

151
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:21,180
We're like some gland owner's dumb-asticated dogs,

152
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:25,500
so well trained that when one bargain basement bin Laden

153
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:30,220
drizzles stale pee on the shriveled little bush in our front yard,

154
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:37,140
we all instinctively start howling and slobbering and peeing all over every bit of foliage for miles around,

155
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,900
while our owners laugh at us.

156
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,840
Using television, they taught us a whole new language whereby

157
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:51,080
war in the Middle East really means two-for-one sale at Walmart.

158
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:59,360
Even the tiniest, most seemingly insignificant details are set up to make less sense.

159
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:08,940
Ever noticed that everything in a store costs say, $19.95 or $19.89 instead of just a straight up $20?

160
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:18,320
When they say only 69 cents, we both know that they've really just taken our perfectly good 70 cents and wrecked it.

161
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,060
Bob prophesied.

162
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:23,920
It's gonna be a bummer, man.

163
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,620
Prophecy fulfilled!

164
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:32,820
And so we're now told about a new mutant disease every month.

165
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,200
If we're lucky, maybe one of them will cure hypochondria.

166
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:42,320
Jesus said you will hear of SARS and rumors of SARS.

167
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:48,540
What nanobots lurk in the government's smallpox shots, my friend?

168
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,060
How much will we have to pay later to have a vaccine?

169
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:51,740
We'll have to have them removed!

170
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:59,540
Already the conspiracy has government pee inspectors analyzing your urine every time you flush,

171
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:09,260
tracking you via your toilet so that, for instance, you can be sued retroactively for lying to the insurance company about your drug or vitamin use.

172
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:19,700
The next step, of course, will be identity theft via urinary traces of your DNA and psychic stench.

173
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:29,560
Every time you flush an unapproved chemical, whether you peed it or not, you might as well be signing away your children to the slave camps of tomorrow.

174
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:33,860
It's all become so dirty.

175
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:44,120
The inevitable fad of reality TV finally came full circle with the ongoing Oil War miniseries.

176
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,700
But it's all so sterile.

177
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:49,680
One almost misses chillin' with the Cold War, which was so terrible.

178
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:49,680


179
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:50,460
But somehow cooler.

180
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:57,220
But as long as they can make you worry about how you smell, whether your poop stinks,

181
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,740
if you're wearing the right deodorant, whether or not your stomach will get you through the day,

182
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:07,720
the endless conveyor belt of cheap crap will distract you from real slack.

183
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,620
Sometimes they want you to fight them because it's an impossible battle that you can't win,

184
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:18,680
leaving you exhausted and defenseless and in need of more cheap crap.

185
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,620
Oh yes, it's all very paranoi-ing.

186
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:29,300
It started with breathalyzer tests, then they moved up to pee-alyzers, then vote-alyzers,

187
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:33,500
and now they've even got a machine that can tell if you're thinking.

188
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:35,500
It's called a TV.

189
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,640
If it's off, you're guilty.

190
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:48,460
It's said that less than a hundred people control all the big corporations, armies, governments, and the mass media in the world,

191
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,660
and that none of them are the same.

192
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,560
None of them are into Bob.

193
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:54,020
Actually, it's less than ten people and they all do know Bob.

194
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,860
But you have never heard any of their names.

195
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,460
If you know his name, he's not one of the puppeteers, just one of the puppets.

196
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,520
You never see the puppeteers.

197
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,280
You can't follow the strings up that far.

198
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,880
If you could, it'd be easy to cut them.

199
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,740
But nowadays, there are puppets that can work other puppets,

200
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,180
and it's puppet working puppet as far up the line as you can see.

201
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:21,480
Even the puppets don't know where they are in the hierarchy.

202
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:26,940
Only the ones who aren't operating a marionette themselves know exactly where they are.

203
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:28,100
The bottom.

204
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:35,160
And you, dear subgenius reader, are probably not engaged in pulling anybody's strings right this minute.

205
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:39,240
It's economic Darwinism.

206
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,760
Survival of the richest.

207
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:44,480
The decks are manufactured already stacked for the winners.

208
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,080
The guys who put the evil in evolution.

209
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:50,600
Talk about not wanting to make waves.

210
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:54,040
They finally got things just the way they want them.

211
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:58,720
The times they were a-changin', but that may end.

212
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:03,620
Now that the rich are firmly rich and the poor are securely poor,

213
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,360
the conspiracy as a whole would benefit if all change were to stop.

214
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:12,180
And we must not let this stopping begin.

215
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:17,220
We must spend our time getting slack.

216
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:21,260
Because time itself may be running out.

217
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,180
Oil shortage.

218
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,480
Water shortage.

219
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,220
Air shortage.

220
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:30,580
Those are nothing compared to what the conspiracy would like to see.

221
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:33,440
A huge shortage.

222
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,940
Because it's gradual, people don't even notice the world ending.

223
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:44,740
When that day finally comes on which everything locks up and freezes in place,

224
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:47,200
those who have fallen into line as they were going,

225
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:52,360
we're told, will shuffle through the slaughterhouse door from apathy into oblivion.

226
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,100
Even if you survive, you'll find yourself worse than dead,

227
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,840
in a world composed of vacant, glad-handing geeks and vicious motorheads,

228
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,520
and liking it.

229
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:09,260
But for now, the high officers of the Fatherland Homestead Security Corporation

230
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:15,520
have decreed that you are at the center of a conspiracy of slack.

231
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,480
And that's what we're going to do.

232
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,960
Are they right, friends?

233
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:27,500
I've been a communist for the FBI for quite a while.

234
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,860
But I'm always uneasy about these FBI goons.

235
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,240
I've been me for quite a while.

236
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:37,120
I feel a chill colder than the bluish November talk.

237
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:41,200
Sleepers in the party are supposed to sleep when the sleeper wakes.

238
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:41,900
How?

239
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,480
I'm going to sleep in this room.

240
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,600
I'm going to sleep in this room.

241
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:55,780
Hello?

242
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:57,220
Who are you?

243
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,000
I can't talk over the phone.

244
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,480
What did you say your name was?

245
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:01,440
Matthews.

246
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:02,100
What is it?

247
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:03,960
I said it was Matthews.

248
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,920
Just what do you mean by that?

249
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,320
I mean Matthews.

250
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:08,580
Does that mean Matthews?

251
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:09,140
Mm-hmm.

252
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,000
Perhaps?

253
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,620
Perhaps.

254
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,240
Why?

255
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,500
You get lost.

256
00:16:13,260 --> 00:16:14,840
But first, goodbye.

257
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:15,780
Goodbye.

258
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,020
Think about it.

259
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:21,840
The boy.

260
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,540
Whoa.

261
00:16:22,640 --> 00:16:23,760
Whoa, no, no.

262
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:24,140
Please.

263
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:25,740
It'll be fun.

264
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,380
This time I'll be looking in.

265
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,140
But you came.

266
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,620
For sure.

267
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,760
No.

268
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:39,560
Mrs. American Housewife, are you fat?

269
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,160
Because need fat, need fat.

270
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,180
Every drop essential.

271
00:16:42,380 --> 00:16:42,760
Help, help.

272
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:43,520
Need fat now.

273
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:44,880
Save vets.

274
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,460
Here's the Central United States.

275
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:51,820
Tuesday, western New Mexico could expect to be moving into New England.

276
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:57,660
As it does, we can expect eastern Minnesota to cross Iowa all the way to northern Louisiana.

277
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:03,460
Now, watch for Arkansas as far north as western Nebraska Wednesday and again on Thursday.

278
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:09,200
We could also see the Texas Pecos region along the western face of the Rockies.

279
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:14,180
By Thursday afternoon, most of the Central United States will be in Texas.

280
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:18,940
And Wednesday and Thursday, western Nebraska will be around those Great Lakes.

281
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,940
Across the nation, that's adventure.

282
00:17:22,220 --> 00:17:32,480
Thank you, Fernanda Nende-Lemur, for the forecast, the space-time forecast, and the silent forehead.

283
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:43,300
And thanks to Artemia Salina and Reverend Maynard Brainerd for various sound accumulations also used in this show.

284
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:52,000
Meanwhile, those excess transmissions, or whatever they are, mind-control carrier waves, I don't know.

285
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,260
You'd have to see Frotter S-O-D-B-I-E-I-E-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I.

286
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,160
I don't know.

287
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:35,620
I don't know.

288
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,520
I don't know.

289
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,560
Now, I'm not sure if it has a...

290
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,200
Did that sound like Allah to you?

291
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,540
Yes, I think it did.

292
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:49,580
Laughing yoga, laughing exercise for the heart and mind.

293
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,980
What you can do, just laugh.

294
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:52,400
Very easy.

295
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,440
Don't feel shy.

296
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,000
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

297
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,300
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

298
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,560
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

299
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:58,560


300
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,300
Hee-hee-hee.

301
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,560
Hee-hee-hee.

302
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:03,480
Hee-hee-hee.

303
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:04,280
Hee-hee-hee.

304
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:04,760
Hee-hee-hee.

305
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:04,980
Hee-hee-hee.

306
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,580
Hee-hee-hee.

307
00:19:05,620 --> 00:19:05,960
Hee-hee-hee.

308
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,360
Hee-hee-hee.

309
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:07,620


310
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,640
And I am happy, I am relaxed.

311
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,440
I am happy, I am relaxed.

312
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,220
I am happy, I am relaxed.

313
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,360
Boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo.

314
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,740
You can laugh without sound.

315
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,680
Your lungs, heart, kidney, colon, spleen, pancreas.

316
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,800
Start dancing.

317
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,160
How?

318
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,180
Pah!

319
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:35,920
Pah!

320
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:39,900
facility

321
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:46,040
I fill working surgery

322
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:46,120
up to car involved

323
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:52,380
The shake down started a long time ago but who will go into the dome and who will stay

324
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,140
out is being decided today.

325
00:19:55,620 --> 00:20:00,460
When the cultural gestalt-o asks you for your papers buddy, will you resist?

326
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,300
Sure do not want to get caught resisting.

327
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:04,020
Available.

328
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:08,620
They've got this new drug called Camp X-Ray that they give you that makes you think you've

329
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:11,260
been held in prison for months without ever being charged.

330
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:16,000
And they have an even worse drug called False Slack that makes you think you've been sitting

331
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,180
in your house watching imaginary people's fake lives on TV for years and years instead

332
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:23,280
of living a real life of your own.

333
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,780
You can only see the retardation for what it is after you've removed yourself from it

334
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,300
for a while.

335
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:35,480
The less TV you watch, the more obvious it is the brainwashing when you do watch it.

336
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:40,780
The conspiracy knows you know this, so they pretend that they aren't even pretending

337
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:43,120
that it's not abysmally stupid.

338
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:48,560
They crank out programming that is deliberately so dumb that you find yourself thinking,

339
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:51,620
I can't believe how stupid this is.

340
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:52,940
People watch this?

341
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:00,280
This is so fantastically stupid that I think I could sit here forever, transfixed, marveling

342
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:03,060
at how stupid people must be to watch this.

343
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:12,080
Those incredibly dumb shows are their way of openly, brazenly gloating at what cows we

344
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:12,380
are.

345
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:19,640
Break free of the Matrix, screams every cable TV sci-fi thriller after these messages.

346
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:26,840
Gil Scott-Heron said the revolution will not be televised.

347
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:27,800
Well, he was wrong.

348
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:30,260
Not only was the revolution televised.

349
00:21:30,260 --> 00:21:32,180
But Nike sponsored it.

350
00:21:32,260 --> 00:21:36,300
Television unfortunately was not revolutionized.

351
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:40,480
So the whole thing ended up as just another show.

352
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:47,240
Friends, we subgeniuses are proud to be called kooks by the rest of the media if that keeps

353
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:49,320
us out of the same boat as them.

354
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:58,360
But these kids these days with their cheap, gee-gawing, crusted broomsticks, all these

355
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,240
youth rads and gimme-bots.

356
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:03,360
A bunch of kids, they're all now doing jobs of whining and yowling about how their new

357
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:07,240
conspiracy has worse jackboots than the old one did.

358
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:10,260
But the only thing that's really changed are the haircuts.

359
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:15,480
Oh the governments change eventually, but each time you just get more government.

360
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,440
And more haircuts.

361
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,400
Serious protesters and some drunks.

362
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,580
Hey, gripe.

363
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:29,820
That the Subgenius Foundation Incorporated.

364
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,220
The subgenius foundation.

365
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:30,220


366
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:34,020
Didn't do enough of the right thing about the war.

367
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,780
Well we tried.

368
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:39,960
We visualized world peace, but all we got was a lousy t-shirt slogan.

369
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:46,880
If you believe in conspiracy theorists, friend, the smartest thing any of us could do right

370
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,700
now would be to study survivalist manuals, flee this mass media hallucination, buy cheap

371
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:58,060
land in the Yukon and hide in a dome with a stockpile of canned food, a Dobbs head and

372
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,780
a frot pipe.

373
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,420
And practice your aim.

374
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:06,600
Otherwise learn to give the best oral sex in town from inside a barrel.

375
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:12,360
But we don't trust the conspiracy theorists anymore than we trust the conspiracy.

376
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,680
Most of them are conspiracy conspiracy theorists anyway.

377
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:19,020
We trust only subgenius revealed truth.

378
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:25,460
And that says that the entire conspiracy, us included, is but a parasitic fungus on

379
00:23:25,460 --> 00:23:27,000
the skin of the overmind.

380
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,760
That the human race doesn't exist.

381
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,760


382
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,760


383
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,760


384
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:28,760


385
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:34,160
That the whole world is itself a virus, an infestation like fleas, and that the host

386
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:36,240
will soon be dipped.

387
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:40,700
Any political argument is thus rendered tragically moot.

388
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:47,480
Knowing this, friends, the subgenius adheres only to patriopsychotic and narco-materialism,

389
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:51,840
which is by definition, uh, well, each person defines differently.

390
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,080
A mysterious conspiracy theorist who claims civilization has earned her his lives.

391
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:09,160
He pushing the herkes multitudes into one another.

392
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,100
All that dumb當ここ Pekin decides to do is Molly that Joe Gavin would never OLIVURE

393
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,300
five saints

394
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:14,300


395
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,420
you的

396
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:16,560
bliver

397
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,140
you guys are meant to be

398
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,120
Weirdos

399
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:59,260
In the 1920s, British visitors were already struck by oil's pervasiveness in American culture.

400
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:05,760
Two of them, E.H. Davenport and S.R. Cook, set down this 1923 comparison.

401
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:13,600
Travel but a little in the country and you will gain the impression that the modernism of the United States flowed from its oil wells.

402
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,120
Outwardly, oil occupies there the place of oil.

403
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:19,060
The place which coal occupies in Great Britain.

404
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:51,980
Outwardly, oil occupies disk space in Surendra arrack.

405
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,540
It is

406
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:04,060
It is

407
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,400
Phineas Narcos

408
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:24,500
National Cynical Radio

409
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,660
on nationalcynical.com

410
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:30,680
carries that thing

411
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,020
called the blurble mix

412
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,640
but not the following

413
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:36,960
which Reverend Maynard Brainerd

414
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,140
carries across

415
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:40,340
to a number of succeeding

416
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,760
lemur discoveries

417
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,880
with the breast in his hand

418
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,580
he slowly shuffled away

419
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,260
into the darkness

420
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:49,600
and soon was lost from sight

421
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,420
I'll never forget the strong affection I had for the breast

422
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,180
and the mummy

423
00:26:53,180 --> 00:26:55,060
no, no reason to go there

424
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,680
how's that?

425
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,280
yes, I don't understand it

426
00:26:58,280 --> 00:27:01,160
exactly, let's forget the whole thing for now, alright?

427
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,500
participating subjects

428
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,160
adversely affected by accessory organs

429
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:16,060
now accessory organs

430
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:16,540
are

431
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,120
that give you

432
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,300
scientific throat

433
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:19,600
and not nose

434
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,600
the medical specialist stated

435
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,060
it is my opinion that accessory organs

436
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:25,760
were throat and not nose

437
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,440
keep listening

438
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,880
why am I going to love greasy water?

439
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,460
because greasy water is easier and faster and pleasanter

440
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,120
but I hate greasy water

441
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,100
then I repeat

442
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,940
greasy water is amazingly fresh and pleasant

443
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:44,140
but I really love greasy water too

444
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,080
then I repeat

445
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,320
greasy water is

446
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,040
one pleasanter

447
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,700
two easier

448
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,540
three billowy

449
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:49,020
two

450
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,760
three

451
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,740
in patriopsychotic anarcho-materialism

452
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:10,680
state sovereignty isn't nearly enough

453
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:12,980
that would be a good start

454
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:15,220
the Soviet Union broke up good

455
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,300
then by God's name

456
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:22,560
it's time for the USA to break up into the disunited states and then to break up a lot more.

457
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:26,020
Household sovereignty is what we're talking about.

458
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:34,220
Friend, if you study chimpanzees or kindergarten children for a week, politics will suddenly make sense.

459
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:40,020
You must let petty primate politics bring you down to their level.

460
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:45,420
Rise above it. Inflate. Blow yourself up and float.

461
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:53,680
Placidly high above the middle of the road from whence you can survey how silly they all look.

462
00:28:55,540 --> 00:29:05,740
The system, friends, is a self-perpetuating idiocracy that utilizes the foolproof, time-worn, good cop, bad cop technique

463
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:09,940
to convince you that one side of the conspiracy is your buddy.

464
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:15,220
The big con gives you your own little con enemy to hate,

465
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,280
and your own little...

466
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,380
con friend to join.

467
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:23,820
It's set up so that we'd appear to have only the two basic options,

468
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:30,180
both of them slackless and neither of them there for any reason but to control us.

469
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:36,240
In theory, the US alone should offer almost 300 million political options,

470
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:43,860
but, needless to say, they eliminated all of those in order to hide the only possible correct option,

471
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,780
which is, of course, the word of Bob.

472
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,620
The term liberal and conservative are both practically meaningless.

473
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,200
Like Bible passages, they can mean so many different things that they cancel themselves out in internal contradictions.

474
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,060
Each side uses the other, however, as an excuse to remove different kinds of slack.

475
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,220
One robs this kind of slack, the other robs that kind of slack.

476
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:13,960
Whichever steals the most from you forces you to side with the one that steals less.

477
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,280
And then, they have you exactly the same.

478
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:22,680
Exactly where they want you, on one of their sides, believing one half of the conspiracy.

479
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:29,080
But we want Big Brother out of both the boardroom and the bedroom.

480
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,940
It was very much like stepping into a Salvador Dali painting.

481
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:40,620
Okay?

482
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,780
It... instantly everything was surreal.

483
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:45,800
Um...

484
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:52,000
Where it puts his brain, where it puts his memory, where it puts his mind, his thinking ability, everything else.

485
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,020
What do you mean, why didn't she call?

486
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,520
She gave up after she got her $130 phone bill or whatever the hell it was.

487
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:33,220
Is she a 합니다?

488
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,440


489
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,440


490
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,460
Think about it, all that keep going around or me, sure, we could always have a S가 left, lol.

491
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:36,260
Seriously.

492
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:36,260


493
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:36,260


494
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:36,260


495
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,920
Wh-What?

496
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:38,860
The beach.

497
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:39,380
Where is it?

498
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:39,420
I'm homeschooling, fr?

499
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,100
Got it, I know.

500
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,100


501
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,100


502
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,340
Wait, I had no idea.

503
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:42,380
Lots of people too.

504
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:42,380


505
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,380
You could never change, man.

506
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,680
He didn't know what to do.

507
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:08,920
Pretty much I agree with everything the last gentleman said.

508
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,100
That's the problem with America now, is the media makes blanket statements.

509
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:18,440
The only thing they have to rely on is that Bush lied.

510
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:23,060
Well, if he had lied, that's fine, but now we're in there for the long haul.

511
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,300
Well, what should we do to him for lying?

512
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,040
I don't believe it was lying. I believe it was false intelligence.

513
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:41,060
Wait a minute. How could it be false intelligence if he was told in October of 2002 that there were no weapons of mass destruction?

514
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,900
He's told that by Iraqis, foreign...

515
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:46,820
...minister. Now, how is that faulty intelligence?

516
00:32:47,180 --> 00:32:50,180
You can't trust the Iraqis as far as this. You can't trust...

517
00:32:50,180 --> 00:32:51,640
He was working for us, sir.

518
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,520
Wow.

519
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:54,180
He was told... Excuse me.

520
00:32:54,400 --> 00:33:02,540
What about the fact that Tony Blair's equivalent of the CIA said in July of 2002 that Bush had already decided to go to war?

521
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,300
What about that?

522
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,160
Well, I stand behind him 100%.

523
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,840
Well, you don't have to say that. You said he wasn't lying.

524
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,600
You said it was faulty intelligence.

525
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:10,240
Wow.

526
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,540
I just told you that the intelligence communities told him...

527
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:13,880
Wow.

528
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:15,120
...there were no weapons of mass destruction.

529
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:18,380
Well, it's... Well, there's still a threat.

530
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:20,860
What was... What was their threat? To whom?

531
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,060
To us, to the Americans.

532
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,440
Oh, good. Show me what the threat was.

533
00:33:24,620 --> 00:33:27,760
They have no weapons of mass destruction. What threat did they represent?

534
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,520
Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein.

535
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:33,040
What was the threat? What could he do to us?

536
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:34,720
He could do a whole lot.

537
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,340
Like what? Like what?

538
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:40,200
Like sending me... Send another airplane over here. Who knows?

539
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:43,740
Excuse me. You mean Saddam Hussein was responsible for September 11th?

540
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,320
No, I didn't say that. I said...

541
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,240
Well, you said he could send another plane over here. Who sent the first plane?

542
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,080
Well, Osama bin Laden did.

543
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,900
Oh, did Hussein have anything to do with that?

544
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:52,760
But I wouldn't...

545
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:56,020
Oh. So what threat did he represent then, sir? What could he do to us?

546
00:33:56,420 --> 00:33:57,820
He could do a number of things.

547
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:03,540
Like what? Like what? Like what? Like what? Like what? Give me an example.

548
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:07,320
Well, he could send someone over here to blow us up.

549
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:11,780
He could. What was he going to send him in? With what? And who was he going to send?

550
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,120
He could send anyone.

551
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,540
Really?

552
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:14,520
Anyone.

553
00:34:14,780 --> 00:34:18,100
And what? And it doesn't matter that the CIA said...

554
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:19,220
It's more than abuse. I won't...

555
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:24,500
So we went to war because he might be able to send someone over here?

556
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:28,620
Well, he... There's someone over here to blow us up.

557
00:34:28,880 --> 00:34:30,860
That's why? It's why we went to war, sir?

558
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:36,680
Well, and I... Well, and I... I stand behind 400...

559
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:39,600
What? You stand behind? You haven't given me a reason for war yet, sir.

560
00:34:39,700 --> 00:34:41,800
The President said we had to go to war...

561
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:42,520
...because it was a...

562
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:42,960
...climber and...

563
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,660
present danger? What was the clear and present danger?

564
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:51,160
There's someone over here that blows up. How could he harm us

565
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,140
if he couldn't harm people in his own country?

566
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:59,320
Okay, thank you, sir. It's so nice to hear an intelligent conversation on talk radio.

567
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,460
Subway tokens of the mind.

568
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:07,600
Okay, so here is another

569
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:12,120
question for Dr. Howe

570
00:35:12,120 --> 00:35:16,360
or Reverend Stang, if he sees fit.

571
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:20,120
Well, what would it be? It says, I know the answer

572
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:24,360
is 42, but what is the question that the answer

573
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:26,740
of 42 is actually the question of?

574
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,520
Yeah, do you want to take that one? I'll take it.

575
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:33,940
Can I have a shot at it? Sure.

576
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:37,100
The question is,

577
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,280
what is 2 times 21?

578
00:35:42,460 --> 00:35:44,900
Well, that's one of the many questions.

579
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,760
That's the first one that came to my mind.

580
00:35:48,820 --> 00:35:52,800
42. But 42 is the answer to the ultimate question.

581
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,340
That's why this... Oh, yeah, I forgot about that one.

582
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,100
Yeah, the you know question.

583
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,980
You know, life, the universe, and everything. You know.

584
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,500
I think it's just the first number that pops into people's heads when

585
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,700
they... somebody wants to know a number.

586
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:16,080
And statistically, if you took a sample of a large enough population,

587
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:20,700
you would find that the number that comes up most frequently

588
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:25,380
and out of a hundred, when people think of a random number,

589
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,360
is the number 42.

590
00:36:31,660 --> 00:36:37,480
See, now, the people that skew that number are the ones that believe 37 is that number.

591
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,460
They're the ones who bring the skewness way out to the edges,

592
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:46,040
rather than allowing us to freely luxuriate in the...

593
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:52,980
Or perhaps you are only saving the appearances in the best traditions of medieval scholasticism.

594
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:58,400
Oh, I have a Douglas Adams and subgenius trivia contribution.

595
00:36:59,140 --> 00:36:59,660
Excellent.

596
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:07,060
I... Douglas Adams, when... was signing hitchhiker's guidebooks in Dallas, Texas,

597
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,000
in the 80s, at a bookstore.

598
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,780
And I went to the bookstore and stood in line.

599
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:11,800
And when I got there, I said,

600
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,720
I don't really have anything for you to sign, but I wanted to give you this book,

601
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,540
because I thought you might enjoy it.

602
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,280
You know, it's just... whatever.

603
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:23,360
So, he took book of the subgenius and was very polite and said, thank you.

604
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:30,220
And a few years later, one of his books has had a chapter that took place on planet Bob.

605
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:31,920
Hmm.

606
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,060
That's all we know.

607
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,940
So, you think he finally read it, finally, after...

608
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:42,020
That's the only possible way that Douglas Adams could have wanted to name something the

609
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:42,620
name Bob.

610
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:43,580
Coincidence or conspiracy?

611
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:49,980
It's such an unusual name, so unlikely to just come into somebody's head that I can't

612
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:51,480
imagine it would be coincidence.

613
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,640
It's amazing.

614
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:54,400
Yeah.

615
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,680
It's totally amazing.

616
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:56,600
And a big...

617
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,920
Kind of makes you wonder, doesn't it?

618
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,760
Clean, fresh, moist.

619
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,300
A fresh, new, moist way to smoke.

620
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:06,920
A fresh, new, moist way to smoke.

621
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:06,920


622
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:06,920


623
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:06,920


624
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:06,920


625
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:06,920


626
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:09,500
A fresh, new, kind of moist cigarette.

627
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,980
The smoothest thing that's happened to smoking.

628
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,160
With just enough smooth smoke, but not enough to blur the moist taste.

629
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:22,200
The reassurance of super moist smoke.

630
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,480
There's no better smoke.

631
00:38:26,060 --> 00:38:30,160
Discover the smooth satisfaction of this new kind of cigarette.

632
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,960
Fresh, moist.

633
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,020
New way to smoke.

634
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:56,960
New Amendment Gold Cloak Backab prestigeed this in 2012 onively.

635
00:38:56,960 --> 00:39:05,720
Has worked out a full tobacco barrel with réflexive and pooled smokyistol in rebellion

636
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:05,720


637
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:06,200
product of reviving smoking, fever, even bigger carbon communities by keeping them

638
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:06,920
safe by testing pratique in his D ello.

639
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,120
It's a rough way to go, isn't it?

640
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,420
Yeah.

641
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:12,820
At least narcotics didn't kill him.

642
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:13,720
Didn't it?

643
00:39:17,380 --> 00:39:21,800
The story you have just heard was changed to protect...

644
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:22,260
Bob!

645
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:22,720
Bob!

646
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,360
Bad Bob?

647
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:29,900
Ladies and gentlemen, you probably read in the papers last week that Bob tore a muscle in his right leg.

648
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:35,260
Oh, gee, Bob, I hate to see you in such misery.

649
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:36,680
Does it hurt much?

650
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,220
Yes.

651
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:40,840
Why?

652
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,260
Oh, is it really that bad, Bob?

653
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:46,840
Yeah.

654
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:49,180
Bob!

655
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,500
Bob, you saw my...

656
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,240
Bob, you saw my...

657
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,380
Bob, you saw my...

658
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,120
Didn't it?

659
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,000
Recently, we heard of another interesting use of neoprene.

660
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,500
A California couple used a block of neoprene,

661
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,640
and the couple rubbed back...

662
00:40:06,940 --> 00:40:07,220
and forth.

663
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,680
Back and forth.

664
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,940
Back and forth.

665
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:16,040
Because this unique use of neoprene is another example of better things for better...

666
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:19,700
This neoprene is neoprene.

667
00:40:21,380 --> 00:40:24,380
Because in the neoprene, there are chemicals,

668
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:28,000
and the couple rubbed back and forth through chemistry.

669
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:31,740
Well, the fundamental part of the American way is our neoprene rubbers.

670
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,620
That's a simple historical fact.

671
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:35,840
F... F... F... F... F... F...

672
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:36,160
F... Limer.

673
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,080
Fernanda Nandi Limer did that.

674
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,180
A bunch of that.

675
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,160
Reverend Maynard Brainerd, however, smoked the moist cigarette.

676
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,060
And we heard Dr. Howell and Dr. Philo Drummond,

677
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,680
yours truly in puzzling evidence,

678
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:53,660
on the KPFA sub-show there.

679
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,920
And, before that,

680
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,540
the wonderful cut-up of talk radio idiocy

681
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:02,360
is called Blow Us Up,

682
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,600
and that's from Phineas...

683
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,400
Phineas Narco,

684
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:09,160
Reverend Phineas Narco of NationalCynical.com.

685
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,840
More on tomorrow,

686
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,500
coming up soon in More Ways Than One,

687
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,220
is by Norrell Preff.

688
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:34,700
This is PR.

689
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,440
From PR News in Washington, I'm closed.

690
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,360
The United Nations Committee has recommended

691
00:41:44,360 --> 00:41:47,580
that the United Nations be tortured by Chicago police

692
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,880
during interrogation.

693
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:51,940
Taking a look at figures from Wall Street,

1-4-5-2-1-5-5-6-6-6.

695
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,220
This is PR's Bad PR.

696
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,180
PR News.

697
00:41:58,380 --> 00:41:58,780
PR News.

698
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:02,660
The Vatican wants public Mexican sexual abuse,

699
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:03,600
and pray for the public.

00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,460
Prayer and penance.

701
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,240
The Vatican wants PR News in Washington.

702
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,660
PR comes from PR stations.

703
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:23,420
No clue of that they would wind up in this.

704
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:26,580
When you see the guy who does the torturing,

705
00:42:26,660 --> 00:42:28,460
um, you see this?

706
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:30,740
What we're going to do with this is we're going to start,

707
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:32,420
you know, peeling your skin off.

708
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:33,360
He just does it.

709
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:34,300
Which is real?

710
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:35,160
Just do it.

711
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:36,400
Get you into it.

712
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,060
You go right to the action.

713
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:38,420
Why?

714
00:42:38,620 --> 00:42:39,940
Drilling on live teeth.

715
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,980
Yeah, improvised on the fly.

716
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:43,260
You know, what will work?

717
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:44,140
What can we do next?

718
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:45,000
Use your imagination.

719
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,020
Holy cow.

720
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:47,360
Holy cow.

721
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:51,200
We're all at the same level when it comes to extracting information.

722
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,140
There's something going to happen.

723
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:55,080
We just don't know where, what, when, and how.

724
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:58,000
At a low level, uh, uh, uh,

725
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,360
at a low level, uh, uh, uh,

726
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:03,440
torturing people for days and days and days and days,

727
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,540
and months and months and months.

728
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:06,040
Made them wish they were dead.

729
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:07,700
For 30 years, I tortured people.

730
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:08,740
For 30 years, I tortured people.

731
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:11,480
More on tomorrow.

732
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:12,420
More on tomorrow.

733
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:13,160
More on tomorrow.

734
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:16,620
Divide and conquer works.

735
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:17,720
We should know.

736
00:43:17,940 --> 00:43:22,500
The countless smaller conspiracies, each with their own target captive audiences,

737
00:43:22,820 --> 00:43:27,220
stay so busy fighting amongst themselves that the good old boys at the top with

738
00:43:27,220 --> 00:43:30,520
their pals in organized crime have nothing to fear.

739
00:43:30,820 --> 00:43:33,320
The minorities and weirdos competing,

740
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:37,760
against each other, while the man laughs and the burning man burns.

741
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,180
But all the while, Bob,

742
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:46,700
frops and laughs, trout fishing from his rowboat of tranquility in a placid lake.

743
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,080
While back on Wall Street, his assets values skyrocket,

744
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:55,680
powered by nothing more than his sheer unthinking slack power.

745
00:43:57,180 --> 00:44:01,440
You can choose to fight some specific branch of the conspiracy tooth and nail,

746
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:03,500
or you can choose to avoid the

747
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,440
entire thing by becoming a conspiracy of one.

748
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:11,200
As Bob said, it's your conspiracy.

749
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:14,120
You can make it as big as you want.

750
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,680
Always remember, according to Dobbs,

751
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:22,600
any politician who does not have a subgenius membership card in its pocket is

752
00:44:22,600 --> 00:44:24,180
absolutely not to be trusted.

753
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:29,220
Any politician who has a subgenius membership card in its pocket is

754
00:44:29,220 --> 00:44:31,780
absolutely not to be trusted.

755
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:40,680
Perhaps the republic goons and the demo cretins are already engaged in total self-destruction even as we speak.

756
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,480
Wouldn't that be nice?

757
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:49,280
Even so, they'd only be replaced by two more equally treacherous bear traps for suckers.

758
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:54,360
The refertarian party maybe versus the liberform party.

759
00:44:54,580 --> 00:44:58,020
Certainly not patrio-psychotic-anarcho-materialism.

760
00:44:58,140 --> 00:45:01,860
Anything but that, then there'd be no conspiracy at all.

761
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:03,580
And if it weren't for the conspiracy, then there'd be no conspiracy at all.

762
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:03,580


763
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:03,580


764
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:03,880
And if it weren't for the conspiracy,

765
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:06,820
we would be the normals.

766
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:11,860
We patrio-psychotic-anarcho-materialists of the

767
00:45:11,860 --> 00:45:16,540
evangelical free-fropping sex branch believe in divergity.

768
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,440
Whoever kills the other guy first wins.

769
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,520
Every yard a kingdom.

770
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:27,680
Just as diversity is essential to a biosphere or a porno mag,

771
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:33,320
there must always be liberal and conservative numbskulls to balance each other out.

772
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:39,340
As long as the great pendulum of history keeps on swinging and isn't stuck on one side,

773
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,580
that's a good sign.

774
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:47,720
The scurrying earth-fools seem to require these distractions as they scamper about performing

775
00:45:47,720 --> 00:45:50,740
their silly little mammalian puppet acts.

776
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:58,260
But we must learn to rise above the false little conspiracies dangled like easy answers

777
00:45:58,260 --> 00:46:01,880
before our blinder tubes, oh our true geese.

778
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:03,560
There's only one way to solve this problem.

779
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:04,700
Only one true conspiracy.

780
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,400
The conspiracy of the normals.

781
00:46:08,360 --> 00:46:12,300
As Bob said to Onan Canabite in 1980,

782
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:19,400
How many conspiracies does it take to totally oppress all subgeniuses everywhere for all

783
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:19,980
of history?

784
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,600
One.

785
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,680
Mutants must agree to disagree.

786
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:33,320
Mutant A can look the other way when El Presidente conducts secret wars and loots savings and

787
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:35,740
loans, makes deals with terrorists, etc.

788
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:41,440
And Mutant B can look the other way when El Presidente sneaks out with his illicit girlfriend.

789
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:49,180
But what in the name of God did all those brave soldiers die for in all those wars,

790
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:49,620
friends?

791
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:55,320
For the freedom of little old ladies in frustrated units to castrate everyone who happens to

792
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:58,140
somehow still possess normal sexuality?

793
00:46:59,160 --> 00:46:59,680
The freedom?

794
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:03,540
For crazy fundamentalists to decide what happens behind everyone's back?

795
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:03,540


796
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,780
And everybody else's closed bedroom doors?

797
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:06,920
The freedom?

798
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:13,840
For huge cartels of American drug dealers to addict children to the most insidious drugs

799
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:19,780
while destroying the lives of adults who use medicines that happen not to be patentable?

800
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:27,560
Did all those brave American soldiers die just so that a secret royal gang of fat bald

801
00:47:27,560 --> 00:47:30,560
white guys could make yet more money?

802
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,080
No.

803
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:43,320
And friends, the answers to these questions lie in further chapters of the subgenius cyclopædia

804
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:49,600
of slack, the Bobliographon, which is a book that is not out, but it's finished and being

805
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:58,340
published, as we speak, we just did corrections on it, from Thunder's Mouth Press.

806
00:47:58,380 --> 00:47:59,680
It won't be out until...

807
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:00,580
...August.

808
00:48:01,620 --> 00:48:21,120
November. Friends, the background music was by Doctors for Bob. The original Doctors for Bob of Little Rock, Arkansas. Sternodocs, Key Caver, Martin Big Smoke Pitts, Dr. Gene Splice primarily there. And I believe also Linda in some cases.

809
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:33,180
Friends, you're listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack. If you want more information on the Church of the Subgenius, just look at www.subgenius.com.

810
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:48,360
And now, friends, to the collages of Reverend Norrell Preff, of which you can get more of that at norrellpreff.com.

811
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,160
And the great...

812
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:54,640
Mr. Fernandinendi Lemur Praise Bob.

813
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:17,260
Mr. Fernandinendi Lemur Praise Bob.

814
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:28,180
Mr. Fernandinendi Lemur Praise Bob.

815
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:32,420
Now back to our story of Tarzan and how Pipe will make this land fertile.

816
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,160
Perhaps I can help them till help comes.

817
00:49:39,400 --> 00:49:42,480
Why, I might, sir. I'm the original hot kid.

818
00:49:42,740 --> 00:49:44,120
You are the devil.

819
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:45,880
All right.

820
00:49:46,280 --> 00:49:49,180
That's a good idea. I like the way you operate.

821
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,940
It's so relaxing. Or it is relaxing.

822
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,700
Oh, no, that could never be relaxing. That state.

823
00:49:57,120 --> 00:49:58,460
What state is that?

824
00:49:58,500 --> 00:50:00,320
What? The state is Dobstown, friend.

825
00:50:00,380 --> 00:50:02,620
It's the stuff that dreams are made of.

826
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:05,300
It's what makes Tinkerbell and the Lost Boys fly.

827
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,840
It powers the Starship Enterprise.

828
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:08,720
Look, look.

829
00:50:09,100 --> 00:50:13,300
It's the hidden code in Windows and Mac OS.

830
00:50:13,520 --> 00:50:15,800
The children are all smiling through the windows.

831
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:17,100
Look, they're waving to us.

832
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,440
It's the cancer-causing, teeth-staining, smelly, pukey habit.

833
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:23,080
It's the drug that helps you find God.

834
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,620
Be he hairy thunder, be he...

835
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,200
And they look like they're all enjoying those drugs.

836
00:50:27,340 --> 00:50:28,160
Oh, I'm sorry.

837
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:28,960
No, it's okay.

838
00:50:29,220 --> 00:50:30,780
It is your brain on drugs.

839
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:33,780
It is 99, 44, 100% pure.

840
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:38,240
It is where there is a lake in which resides the sword Excalibur

841
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:39,700
kept by the Lady of the Lake.

842
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:41,480
It is where all the flowers have gone.

843
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:46,260
It is the home of John Dillinger's real male appendage.

844
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:49,080
It is a mystery wrapped in an enigma,

845
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:52,120
smothered with sautéed mushrooms and onions

846
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,740
and a savory, delicious gravy.

847
00:50:53,900 --> 00:50:54,620
It is home...

848
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,380
It is home to both Lemurians and Cenobites.

849
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,820
It is very near the coast of Hanalei,

850
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:01,860
nearly also to the land of Fredonia.

851
00:51:01,980 --> 00:51:05,000
It is the world's largest producer of manna,

852
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:07,520
ambrosia, froth, and the green stuff

853
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,520
you inject into the brain to reanimate dead tissue.

854
00:51:11,640 --> 00:51:15,140
Yes, Dobbstown is the residence of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

855
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:16,520
part of the year.

856
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,440
It is both creamy and crunchy.

857
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,600
It tastes great and is less filling.

858
00:51:20,740 --> 00:51:24,020
It is margarine and it is butter.

859
00:51:24,080 --> 00:51:24,600
It is butter.

860
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:24,600


861
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:24,600


862
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:24,600


863
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:24,600


864
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:24,600


865
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:24,600


866
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:24,600


867
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:24,600


868
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:24,600


869
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:24,600


870
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:24,600


871
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:24,600


872
00:51:24,600 --> 00:51:24,600


873
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:25,180
You realize that, friends?

874
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:30,880
They have promised us that which is like this or also that.

875
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:34,020
But no, it is margarine and it is butter.

876
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,260
A manic planiform of boiling juice.

877
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,840
If it were to fall into enemy hands,

878
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:39,820
it would mean the destruction of us all.

879
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:41,980
Thank God Bob is in charge.

880
00:51:42,320 --> 00:51:46,440
Because at Dobbstown, it's golf courses, fiddlers green.

881
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,840
It's where UFOs are not just a fact of life,

882
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:50,680
they're the law, gosh darn it.

883
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,560
It's beyond the ken of moral man.

884
00:51:53,560 --> 00:51:56,380
It can take a sunrise, sprinkle it with dew,

885
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,480
cover it in chocolate and a miracle or two.

886
00:52:00,120 --> 00:52:02,680
It's where bad little girls and boys go.

887
00:52:02,940 --> 00:52:05,500
It's where something is happening all the time,

888
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:07,060
most of it unsolved.

889
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:10,020
It is where one may find the dark tower,

890
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,060
wherein lies the emerald of ultimate knowledge,

891
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,060
the sword of ultimate power,

892
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:17,140
and the credit card with no limit,

893
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,620
guarded by the Black Knight and his hideous troll army.

894
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,540
After passing through the forest of darkness in the desert of hell,

895
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,360
despair and retrieving the medallion

896
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:28,640
that hangs about the neck of the dragon's narg.

897
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:33,380
Yes, friend, it is the misfolding of uncalculations.

898
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:35,360
It's the unfolding of miscalculations.

899
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:39,300
It is a place where science and magic aren't the same thing at all.

900
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,060
Oh, no, friends, it was never a colony of France.

901
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:46,120
No, Dobbstown means having all the pets you ever wanted.

902
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:47,300
Imagine that, Baz.

903
00:52:47,460 --> 00:52:48,900
All the pets you ever wanted.

904
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,480
Thousands and thousands of cats and dogs and puppies and...

905
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:53,440
A million millions!

906
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:54,700
Puppies and newts!

907
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,300
Yes, your own...

908
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:59,420
You can have a newt farm, and Dobbs will give it to you.

909
00:52:59,540 --> 00:53:01,980
It's where a thing of beauty is a joy for a while.

910
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:05,820
It's a dissonant fifth vortex disrupting the harmonic convergence.

911
00:53:05,960 --> 00:53:08,740
It was described by Darwin, who destroyed his notes,

912
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:11,220
convinced he was suffering from DTs.

913
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,880
Its government never tries to be helpful.

914
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:18,320
No, in Dobbstown, it is the dawning of the height, weight, hair, and eye color of Aquarius.

915
00:53:18,580 --> 00:53:21,820
It is not... spelled backwards.

916
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:23,520
It is Brigadoob.com.

917
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:23,520


918
00:53:23,540 --> 00:53:25,100
It is the

919
00:53:25,100 --> 00:53:32,320
most famous book in the world.

920
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:42,900
It's where the Tunguska meteorite came out after bouncing around inside for a while.

921
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:43,880
Somewhat the worst for wear.

922
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:46,000
It's where the early worms...

923
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,860
I'm almost done with this now.

924
00:53:47,120 --> 00:53:49,180
It's where the early worms gets away.

925
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:49,840
Yes.

926
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:53,020
Yes, Dobbstown reaches from the inner ear to the outer limits.

927
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:55,160
It doesn't make the bondage gear.

928
00:53:55,240 --> 00:53:56,720
It makes the bondage gear better.

929
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,780
It is for when you are too lazy to kill yourself.

930
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,100
It is where there are no lawyers.

931
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:03,100
Imagine that, friends.

932
00:54:03,220 --> 00:54:03,700
Yes.

933
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:05,840
In Dobbstown there are no lawyers.

934
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:08,000
Yes.

935
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:14,700
Dobbstown is where you can make your imaginary friends fight to the death or live forever.

936
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:18,680
It is between the dark and the daylight when the night is beginning to lower.

937
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:22,340
It is where neither heredity nor environment matter.

938
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:22,900
Yes.

939
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:23,520
Yes.

940
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:23,520


941
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:23,520


942
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,240
It is where the lamb and the lion don't just lie down together.

943
00:54:27,580 --> 00:54:29,060
They have sex.

944
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:33,860
It is proof that hell is full and the dead walk the earth.

945
00:54:34,300 --> 00:54:36,480
This is by Reverend New Monet.

946
00:54:37,100 --> 00:54:42,220
And this is in the new upcoming book of the subgenius that is coming out, friends.

947
00:54:42,260 --> 00:54:44,480
The Cyclopedia of Slack.

948
00:54:44,580 --> 00:54:45,660
Remember that word, friends.

949
00:54:45,740 --> 00:54:50,460
P-S-Y-C-H-L-O-P-A-D-I-A.

950
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:52,560
Yes. Cyclopedia of Slack.

951
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,600
Slack. The Bobliographer.

952
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,860
No, the Boblia...

953
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,380
Yes.

954
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:57,140
I can never say it.

955
00:54:57,240 --> 00:54:58,440
The Bobliographer.

956
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,900
I've got to get used to that word because it's a new kind of book, friends.

957
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,140
It's a new word with new meanings.

958
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:11,560
Actually, friends, it's made in a smaller format than the previous subgenius holy books.

959
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:12,980
Oh, but with a larger brain.

960
00:55:13,020 --> 00:55:17,400
It's the 7 by 9 inch format, more like your family Bible.

961
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,000
It's about the thickness and hardness and girth and length.

962
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:31,040
Speaking of which, Cynthia Plastercaster has a nice website up with pictures of the Hendrix cast and various other guitar players.

963
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:32,500
Their harnesses?

964
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:33,020
Yeah.

965
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:33,760
Their harnesses?

966
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,480
Yeah, they all look pathetic next to Hendrix.

967
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:38,140
Hide my daughter's ears there, please.

968
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:38,960
Hendrix?

969
00:55:39,960 --> 00:55:41,200
That was the guy...

970
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:42,980
CynthiaPCaster.com.

971
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:46,480
It's really quite an interesting rock and roll history.

972
00:55:46,780 --> 00:55:50,920
Well, some of them had actually polyhedrons or what is it, tetragrammatons?

973
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:51,820
Oh, yes.

974
00:55:51,820 --> 00:55:52,480
Yes, well...

975
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:53,440
They're fun day sandwiches.

976
00:55:53,580 --> 00:55:55,520
They're advanced ones, but they didn't let those out.

977
00:55:55,620 --> 00:55:56,520
They didn't let those out.

978
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:03,740
Reverend Bleepo Abernathy was heard there with the lonesome cowboy Dave,

979
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:07,800
who is also heard in the background music on these credits, by the way.

980
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:13,860
A guesting and gusting with Princess Wee and myself on a live hour of Slack

981
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:21,160
recorded recently at the beautiful WCSB studios at Cleveland State.

982
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:26,680
Reading from the new book, a section by Reverend New Monet.

983
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:32,540
And you are listening to Lonesome Cowboy Dave playing in the background of

984
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:37,660
The Hour of Slack, episode number 1053.

985
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:48,300
And now, uh, Lemur and Frater SODDI will take you out.

986
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:55,060
We'll see how boring I am.

987
00:56:55,260 --> 00:56:55,540
Huh?

988
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:57,360
Try me and find out.

989
00:57:01,220 --> 00:57:02,000
Hello, operator.

990
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,480
I'd like you to put me through to the United States counter spies.

991
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:11,000
Agent Braden to Harding, San Francisco field office.

992
00:57:11,100 --> 00:57:11,820
Braden to Harding.

993
00:57:12,180 --> 00:57:13,240
Counter spy field office.

994
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:14,840
Hello.

995
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,100
Hello.

996
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:17,560
Hello.

997
00:57:18,420 --> 00:57:18,940
Hello.

998
00:57:19,980 --> 00:57:19,980


999
00:57:21,240 --> 00:57:21,760
Hello.

1000
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1001
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1002
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1003
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1004
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1005
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1006
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1007
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1008
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1009
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1010
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1011
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1012
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1013
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1014
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:21,800


1015
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:23,160
Peters, I'm fine, Mr. Harding.

1016
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:23,580
Oh, good.

1017
00:57:24,540 --> 00:57:24,980
Hello.

1018
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:25,720
Hello, Peters.

1019
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:26,880
How are you, Mr. Harding?

1020
00:57:27,580 --> 00:57:28,300
Go ahead, Peters.

1021
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:28,840
How?

1022
00:57:29,120 --> 00:57:29,660
All right.

1023
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:30,020
Goodbye.

1024
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:31,040
Well, Chief?

1025
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:32,040
Yes.

1026
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:32,940
Yes, Chief.

1027
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:40,480
Yes, Chief.

1028
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:51,060
Tune in every week to Counter Spy on Counter Spy.

1029
00:57:53,560 --> 00:57:54,280
Okay, Chief.

1030
00:57:54,420 --> 00:57:55,900
I'll be standing by at the St. Louis airport.

1031
00:57:56,100 --> 00:57:57,220
No further instructions, Braden.

1032
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:05,580
Oh, yeah.

1033
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:23,320
Oh, my God.

1034
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:24,700
Oh, my God.

1035
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:24,960
Oh, my God.

1036
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:25,700
You cat.

1037
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:26,980
Cat.

1038
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:27,960
A cat.

1039
00:58:28,180 --> 00:58:28,860
Cat.

1040
00:58:28,860 --> 00:58:29,520
Cat.

1041
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,120
A cat.

1042
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:30,780
Cat.

1043
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:32,240
A cat.

1044
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:32,800
A cat.

1045
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,460
A cat.

1046
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:34,360
Meow.

1047
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:45,100
Oh, now, John, you've got to control your cat.

1048
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,480
Is she sleeping?

1049
00:58:46,620 --> 00:58:46,980
Yes.

1050
00:58:51,920 --> 00:58:52,520
Easy.

1051
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:55,520
Hey.

1052
00:58:56,480 --> 00:58:58,100
Want to see the sunrise?

1053
00:58:59,420 --> 00:59:00,640
Just once more.

1054
00:59:04,260 --> 00:59:04,860
Dad.

1055
00:59:08,660 --> 00:59:09,260
Dad.

1056
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:12,160
What's on that piece of paper?

1057
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,120
I don't know.

1058
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:15,960
Oh, uh, excuse me.

1059
