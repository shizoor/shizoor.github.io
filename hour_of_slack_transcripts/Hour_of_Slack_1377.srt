1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,620
Remember.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,360
We're sitting together listening to this.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:09,340
And this is prison.

4
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:10,180
Remember.

5
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:12,220
We're sitting-

6
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:12,800
Remember.

7
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,840
You need me, and I have come.

8
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,020
Hi Bob.

9
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,000
Yeah.

10
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:21,520
Bob.

11
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:24,860
Ever change?

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,460
Yes sir, I like subgenius.

13
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,500
No sir, I don't like pink boys.

14
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,340
Yes sir, I love Bob.

15
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,240
No sir.

16
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:35,700
No sir, I do not want to stop Bob.

17
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,640
I just want to give my fish to the thousands.

18
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,960
Yes, deep fried as it is.

19
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,580
They brought out the best in Bob's fish.

20
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,640
And laid it upon the other water and fowl and little stinky things.

21
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:56,200
And everybody saw, and everybody ate, and it was kind of nice for all those people.

22
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:05,220
And Bob, I have a wonderful sound that's made when you emerge from space and come to this, my dwelling place.

23
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:15,580
Dear Bob, each night while I'm asleep, I hope to my house you will creep and poke your pipe in through the wall, so I'll be burned remembering all.

24
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,020
Dear Bob, it's time to close my eyes.

25
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,120
Remember now.

26
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:22,500
It's no surprise if I should be found dead someday.

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:25,200
I'll think that you were in the way.

28
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,180
Oh, gimme Bob.

29
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:31,920
Confusing that face.

30
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,080
With my own.

31
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:38,600
Can't remember my place.

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,140
Advice to younger subgenii.

33
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:51,240
If you should be unfortunately lucky enough to meet Bob and talk to Bob.

34
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:55,180
Never ask the question.

35
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:55,940
Why?

36
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,240
I stand here a victim of the influence of Emmanuel Bobstein.

37
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:02,820
Guilty on all counts.

38
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,920
I'm glad I was caught.

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,700
I was mentally deranged.

40
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,160
Now I am cured.

41
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:11,420
I ask only for you to accept my love of

42
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:15,380
The subgenius power of slack.

43
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:18,000
Bob's balls melted my garters.

44
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,300
The subgenius must have slack.

45
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,540
Tell me now.

46
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,740
Do they belong in you or in you?

47
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:49,340
However much the sonra coupe Iron Man would morgen

48
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:49,480
Gather a game

00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,220
The C predictor

53
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:21,000
Welcome to church, boys and girls.

54
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,520
This may sound like noise, friends, but this is church.

55
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,520
Make sure that you feel the spirit.

56
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:49,980
The fighting Jesus looked out over the bridge of the Exist battle saucer, Blood of Christ.

57
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:53,780
He looked and laughed. He laughed and looked.

58
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,940
He looked and looked. He laughed and laughed.

59
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,020
He was finally going to have his revenge on the natives of Dust Moat 89 AB.

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:12,320
Aboard Jesus' flagship, dozens of killer theologians, the shock priests, were busy at their weapons terminals.

61
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:21,180
On the power decks, the proper orgone cycles were being timed by mass fornications between the ritual crew and the cancer beings from Theta Z.

62
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:23,860
An invasion-ready state existed.

63
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,700
The ship and the 900 others floating over the doomed planet, Earth.

64
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,080
Jesus was in a psychopathically elated state.

65
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:37,820
His face resembled many of the perverse icons the humanoids of the Dust Moat painted of him.

66
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,560
They prayed to these for the salvation of their souls, as if they had any souls to save.

67
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,440
As if anyone would want to save them, which they didn't.

68
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,820
A whole disgusting religion now centered around his murder.

69
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,920
They had to gall to nail him up.

70
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,360
They had to kill him, but he was a common criminal, and then paint pictures of him enjoying it.

71
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,120
And they thought he loved them for it. That he was forgiving.

72
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:05,820
Oh, the anticipation. He was sick to his stomach with glee.

73
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:09,140
He would show them the true face of pain and sin.

74
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:17,260
It had taken him 2,000 long years to return here, and now he would pay them back for the scars he still carried in his hands.

75
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,160
Sweet stigmata.

76
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:24,220
Even the slightest thought of the scars made them glow red through his fear.

77
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,580
However, hisición's

82
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,240
the Horus Aeons, the dark bodies.

83
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,100
And at time and a half, too.

84
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:54,420
It was expensive to ravage a planet.

85
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,620
No matter.

86
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,340
That which comes had finally arrived.

87
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:04,060
And on Jesus' birthday.

88
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,520
What do you think, Dad?

89
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,200
His second-in-command, Jim Jones, stood by with the final attack coordinate, Codices.

90
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,680
A holographic map of Earth rotated slowly next to Jones in midair.

91
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,140
On its surface, grids of the natives' planetary defenses were lit up in green.

92
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,700
Ones, some depicting their pathetic communication structures in violet.

93
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,180
All in scale, quite pretty, actually.

94
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,000
A colorful net surrounded the sphere.

95
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,320
It would soon enough be dark.

96
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,760
These children wait for us below, Jesus.

97
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,600
We will walk among them and we will smile.

98
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,920
At your moment.

99
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,160
A choice, of course.

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:53,020
Jesus studied Jones' puffy, tired face in the pink glow of the neuron banks that ran around the walls of the mighty dreadnought and shuddered.

101
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:59,720
He was no stranger to resurrection of the undead, but whoever had brought Jones around again had slipped up.

102
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,400
Something was missing.

103
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,560
Something else was added.

104
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:03,660
Something.

105
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:11,000
Jones had been forced on him by the Djinn bankers who had financed this angelic war fleet.

106
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,700
Damn them.

107
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:16,040
He never forgot the price they had demanded for this mercenary raiding fleet.

108
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:24,540
Jones' constant reminders of their influence and expectations irritated Jesus no end.

109
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,240
Not to mention the annoying habit Jones had copied from dogs.

110
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:34,180
The twisted creature insisted on smoking a pipe, even here near the sensitive nerve relays.

111
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:37,500
Jones might have been left dead a little too long.

112
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,880
He moved with a constant jerk and always poked at his throat.

113
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,180
He never removed it.

114
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:49,220
He removed his sunglasses and he still took massive injections of methamphetamines, even though they no longer had any effect on his regenerated shell.

115
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:56,160
You know, Jimbo, said Jesus, the best part is that they think there's an afterlife.

116
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,560
That's why they strung me up the first time.

117
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,060
They think like bugs down there.

118
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,060
I'm well aware of that, Commander.

119
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:11,940
It bothered Jones to be back on Earth so soon after his failure with the social programming research post.

120
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,940
He had been running there.

121
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,640
It wasn't really his fault.

122
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,920
The administration change at Central merely cut off the funding for it.

123
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:20,820
He was forced to abort the experiment.

124
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,600
Then we'll have to wait before we find out what this is all about.

125
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,660
Not entirely.

126
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:29,560
The papers we found in Harding's laboratory explain why they're building the hydrogen bomb.

127
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,620
Its explosion was intended to deflect the rotation of the Earth enough to send it out of its orbit and spinning off into space.

128
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,260
Those zombies must have been as crazy as they looked.

129
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,300
It may sound ridiculous, but it's theoretically possible.

130
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:44,260
Yeah, we're safe now, for the time being.

131
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:48,200
But there are undoubtedly more of those power-mad creatures loose on other planets.

132
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,980
So it'll take constant vigilance on our part to ensure the safety of this world.

133
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,780
Yes, we subgeniuses must save this world from the humans.

134
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,280
That scenario, which would sure make a good movie scene someday,

135
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:12,080
is from the unfinished novel World Without Slack by St. Paul,

136
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:16,200
by Wilmer Vredes, printed in our book Three Fisted Tales of Bob,

137
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,540
which is now available only for free and only on subgenius.com.

138
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,140
That was me as a child reading it.

139
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:28,160
Before that, the Welcome to Church boogie was several fisted tales of Connie

140
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:32,720
with Pisces, Suds, Angry Larry, Philodrummon, Senator Speck,

141
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,260
Reverend Hazel of the Windmills, and Bishop Stick,

142
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:40,540
improvised live at 15X Day on July 5th after the world failed to end.

143
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,160
As was the case with the film, the film was a success.

144
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,160


145
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,160


146
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,160


147
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:46,600
The following pre-recorded live radio with Dr. Hal, Papa Joe Mama,

148
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,440
and yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang.

149
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,480
What if there is a form of life in space?

150
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,180
Not on some planet, but just drifting.

151
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,140
Not life as we know it.

152
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,040
With intelligence, yes, but pure energy with no organic structure.

153
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:00,680
Invisible.

154
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,360
Invisible.

155
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,320
Now the rocket passed through the past.

156
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,860
Fade out.

157
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,060
It entered the rock.

158
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:04,760
Horrible.

159
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:11,060
We actually played most of that media broad stuff on Hour of Slack.

160
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:15,820
And it seems somehow so innocent and poignant.

161
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:16,340
Are we on?

162
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:17,900
Yes, I suppose we are.

163
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:18,860
We are on.

164
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:29,460
And it's the Hour of Slack number 1370-something after July 5th, 2012.

165
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:34,500
It actually is July 5th, conspiracy year 2012.

166
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,420
Maybe that really is the year.

167
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,440
Who knows?

168
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,960
We got up this morning.

169
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,200
The three of us were certainly there.

170
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,760
Dr. Hal, Papa Joe Mama.

171
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,340
We were here.

172
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,540
Waiting for the saucers in the beautiful stone circle.

173
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,480
You couldn't find a more appropriate place.

174
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,180
And so were the most faith-inspired of the faithful.

175
00:10:59,140 --> 00:10:59,700
Waiting.

176
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,260
Actually, I counted 48 people.

177
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:03,640
48.

178
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,140
48 of the faithful.

179
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:11,480
They would have achieved the best staterooms and the most cushy treatment.

180
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,880
Our extraterrestrial buddies.

181
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:19,740
But as fate would have it, they're off again on another interstellar junket.

182
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:28,460
Too absorbed in their own affairs to dip their wick on planet mud ball even once.

183
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,720
The drunks who stayed in bed last night did the right thing.

184
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,420
It's that simple.

185
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,640
Once again, Bob rubbed it in.

186
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,720
We don't know what year it is.

187
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,160
We don't know what day it is.

188
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:44,560
We don't know what planet it is.

189
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,580
We don't know.

190
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:50,200
We know not what hour he shall come.

191
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:57,660
Yes, no man knoweth when the master will knock three times on the ceiling if he wants us.

192
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:02,260
So this is all in accord with what we understand and believe.

193
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:11,180
But, of course, I will admit freely that there is a slight annoyance at this cloud of incomprehension.

194
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:12,160
Of incomprehension.

195
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:14,980
In which we must all labor.

196
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:20,020
If only what was hidden could be made revealed.

197
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,320
Alas, this year it was not to be.

198
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:28,220
Yet we soldier blithely on, do we not?

199
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:34,860
Well, Dr. Leguim did point out that it's been 17 X-Day drills.

200
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:41,000
He was starting to almost suspect that there was some sort of a scam involved.

201
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:41,920
As if...

202
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:46,320
A holy man like Bob might lie or be wrong.

203
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:50,960
Well, if you look at the actual details of the prognostications,

204
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:55,560
it says the worthy subgenies will be ruptured.

205
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,200
Oh, don't go down that route, Papa Joe.

206
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,400
So when you get to there, well, it only makes sense.

207
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,720
We're all stuck here, still waiting.

208
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:05,980
Some of us have the fear that if all the impurity is burned away,

209
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:10,100
there won't be anything left of even the most faithful subgenius

210
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,160
but a small, smoldering subgenius.

211
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:12,520
Spot.

212
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:13,580
Spot.

213
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:21,140
Lo siento, no hablas francés.

214
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,200
Pero, pero, ¿dónde está Bob?

215
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,940
¿Qué? ¿Qué dices?

216
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:29,240
¿Dónde está Bob?

217
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,120
Bob.

218
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,220
¿Dónde está Bob?

219
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,160
Bob.

220
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:42,160


221
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,300
¿Dónde está Bob?

222
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,420
¿Dónde está Bob?

223
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:01,700
Él no es en El Salvador.

224
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,380
Buenos Aires, Perú.

225
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,520
¿Dónde está Bob?

226
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,700
¿Dónde?

227
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:10,980
Necesito.

228
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,060
Yo necesito.

229
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:12,380
Bob.

230
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:13,640
¿Dónde?

231
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:14,720
¿Dónde?

232
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:16,140
¿Dónde está Bob?

233
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,140
Yo necesito Bob.

234
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,220
Bob.

235
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,780
¿Dónde está?

236
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,520
¿Dónde?

237
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,000
¿Dónde?

238
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,060
¿Dónde está Bob?

239
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:35,280
Before the musicians get up here to make really horrible music,

240
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:39,280
I would like to first introduce to you

241
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,160
the former CEO,

242
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,280
the CEO of the Subgenius Foundation,

243
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,400
your overlord and leader,

244
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,900
Dr. Totten Lagoon.

245
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:56,140
Dr. Totten Lagoon.

246
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,940
Dr. Totten Lagoon.

247
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,780
Dr. Totten Lagoon.

248
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,240
Dr. Totten Lagoon.

249
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,060
Dr. Totten Lagoon.

250
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,560
Shut the fuck up or you'll get more Elvis.

251
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,680
Dr. Totten Lagoon.

252
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,740
Dr. Totten Lagoon.

253
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,160
Dr. Totten Lagoon.

254
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:14,680
Dr. Totten Lagoon.

255
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,980
Dr. Totten Lagoon.

256
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:19,620
Dr. Totten Lagoon.

257
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,040
Dr. Totten Lagoon.

258
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,540
Dr. Totten Lagoon.

259
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:29,720
Dr. Tottenавantically.

260
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,580
Dr. Totten Lagoon official.

261
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:33,580
The MTV, USA,

262
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:34,020
it's distance,

263
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,780
nostep,

264
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:35,780


265
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,560
No glass in skeletons to seal BC.

266
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,960
That's behind the board,

267
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,140
WW TO FRO Philadelphia 500.

268
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,500
The bill always follows the Ст.

269
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:48,760
In that same retarded subgenius fashion, the pinks are supposed to fry on X day and fuck

270
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:52,060
me running instead, here we are frying instead.

271
00:15:54,420 --> 00:16:01,540
While they sit in air conditioned cracker boxes in the Bronx and LA and London and Krakow

272
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:09,280
thinking how special and awesome they are and how smart they are, these pinks would

273
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:17,940
never fall for the idea that a bunch of wackos hold the key to their salvation because they'd

274
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:21,760
never believed that some insane Armageddon might wipe them from the face of the earth.

275
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,140
But even if we didn't hold that key, their safety is an illusion.

276
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:36,260
When Vesuvius wiped out Pompeii, those ancient wops learned that lesson.

277
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,000
.

278
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:45,480
When a tsunami and an earthquake wiped out half of Japan, the Japanese learned that lesson.

279
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:52,980
When a tornado wiped out a whole Missouri town, they learned that lesson and that wasn't

280
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,620
even the worst one in history.

281
00:16:56,120 --> 00:16:58,680
All this disaster talk makes me feel fuzzy.

282
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:04,360
I remember when Hurricane Katrina hit.

283
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:06,980
I saw the footage of all the people who died.

284
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,440
I saw all those bodies floating in the water.

285
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:13,580
I remembered some pink asked, why would God do this to them?

286
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,500
My reply to that idiot was, because God likes alligators too.

287
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:28,760
Yes brothers and sisters, Jehovah One loves crows and vultures and worms and jackals.

288
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:36,780
Funny thing though, if you kill all the bugs, the birds die and then the plants die.

289
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:43,580
If you kill all the plants, the animals starve and the humans die.

290
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:49,860
But humans have no natural enemies other than us.

291
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,440
They have no natural enemies.

292
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:57,460
If the humans die, everything else gets a free lunch.

293
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:02,060
What better metaphor for slack than a free lunch?

294
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:06,660
We all got slack from free lunches here just this weekend.

295
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:06,960
We're all here to help.

296
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:06,960


297
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:06,960


298
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:06,960


299
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:06,960


300
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,540
This is we.

301
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:16,740
Sure lots of subgeniuses, including me, revel in the notion of wiping the stain of humanity

302
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,440
from the face of this planet.

303
00:18:19,180 --> 00:18:21,180
But that's not really what it's all about.

304
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,620
Vengeance is just a free lunch.

305
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,760
It's how we will get slack from giving slack to the earth.

306
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,040
To give the animals their free lunch.

307
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,040
Woo!

308
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,960
To achieve this goal.

309
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:36,960


310
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:36,960


311
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,280
We must prepare.

312
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,260
We must load our knives and sharpen our guns.

313
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:50,600
Many subgeniuses have said, Dr. Legume, he's a bully.

314
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,780
He's an asshole.

315
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:54,740
He's vicious and heartless and cold blooded.

316
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,080
He hurts people and he's power mad.

317
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,160
Power mad.

318
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,940
Well it's true.

319
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,260
I'm mad and I has power.

320
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,800
I has amazing power.

321
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,220
I can make people forget what they say and make them remember things that never happened.

322
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:15,900
People cancel their vacation plans when I snap my fingers.

323
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:19,100
I am made of living fire.

324
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:22,760
I am destroying the church of the subgenius single handedly.

325
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:24,140
I am a flame warrior.

326
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:24,860
I am a bully.

327
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:25,600
An asshole.

328
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,520
I am the ban instigator watchdog.

329
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,300
I rape you in your constitutional rights.

330
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:36,780
When I drop the anti-gay.

331
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:36,780


332
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:36,920
Ban word.

333
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,280
It breaks.

334
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,220
I'm the big cheese motherfuckers.

335
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:44,500
I'm the humongous.

336
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:48,600
I wipes my arse from Genesee to Revolut.

337
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,420
I can wash brains.

338
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:51,960
I'm the puppet master.

339
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:53,600
I'm a rat bastard.

340
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,240
My sundial says it's hammer time.

341
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,180
Pisces tits bounce at my command.

342
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,020
Bounce.

343
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,360
I ain't lying.

344
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,720
I ain't lying.

345
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,580
I cut the cheese and I cut the mustard.

346
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:13,000
I cut the bologna.

347
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,960
You gotta stand on the moon to see my male pattern baldness.

348
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,140
I have 17 balls.

349
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:24,180
I was born in the heart of an H-bomb and I dropped the F-bomb.

350
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,440
I sleep in the middle of the highway.

351
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:32,100
I drink gasoline with a hand grenade chaser.

352
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,420
I die for fun.

353
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,720
I'm a rat soup eating mother fucker.

354
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,720


355
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,720


356
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,720


357
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:36,760
I'm a rat soup eating mother fucker.

358
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,880
My dick has racing stripes.

359
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:40,240


360
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,780
I banned all your friends.

361
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,580
I am the big boss of this area.

362
00:20:47,920 --> 00:20:52,300
I'm the organ grinder and stangs my dancing monkey.

363
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:59,440
I am the king of butt hurt.

364
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,780
And that having been said, we come to the subject of today's sermon.

365
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:08,280
the butthurt of the subgenus.

366
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:12,100
The bearer of this card

367
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:16,020
is a righteous and ordained overman uberwoman

368
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:20,840
and is entitled to all privileges usually granted a holy person.

369
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,940
Sounds like a pretty sweet deal

370
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:26,240
until you really think about it.

371
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,880
You see, with that privilege also comes the burden

372
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:33,620
usually granted to a holy person.

373
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:36,720
That burden may very well be the scorn

374
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,660
of those who think you're full of shit.

375
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,460
That burden may very well be getting the shit kicked out of you

376
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:48,080
by rival cultists or turned away by your own family and friends.

377
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:52,320
Mahatma Gandhi, Martin Luther King,

378
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:56,580
Osama Bin Laden, all holy men.

379
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:57,980
And what did they get?

380
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:00,400
Shot the fuck up is what?

381
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,080
John the Baptist?

382
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,680
Beheaded?

383
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,500
The Catholic Church alone

384
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,340
has over 10,000 martyred saints,

385
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:15,940
many of whom were executed in colorful, creative,

386
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,540
and no doubt hilariously entertaining ways.

387
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:24,420
The founder of the Mormons, Joseph Smith,

388
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:27,560
and his brother Hiram were killed by a mob.

389
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:30,720
And as much as we'd all like to,

390
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:33,560
let's not forget America's most popular holy man,

391
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,080
Jesus H. Christ.

392
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:37,740
Dragged through the streets, beaten, tortured,

393
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:39,420
stabbed, and nailed to a cross.

394
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,920
As a final example,

395
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,960
I offer you all the big kahuna himself,

396
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,180
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

397
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,440
Your subgenius minister's card reads as follows.

398
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,080
The bearer of this card

399
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,300
is a righteous and ordained overman uberwoman

400
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,600
and is entitled to a life of service.

401
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:03,600


402
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:11,140
all privileges usually granted a holy person in the subgenius church you are promised eternal

403
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:18,040
salvation or triple your money back you're promised a package of cool propaganda and that's it

404
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:25,320
the rest of what you get are all privileges not rights the church in no way shape or form

405
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:31,380
promises that the foundation proper will support or endorse any of your wacky schemes or ideas

406
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:36,680
art projects drug addiction and or alcoholism or lifestyle choice

407
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,760
you're not promised to say in how the church is run you're not promised admittance to the

408
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:48,720
x-day event you're not promised membership in any of the online groups you're not promised

409
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:53,020
the respect for your opinions from anyone and you're especially not promised that everyone

410
00:23:53,020 --> 00:24:00,560
will be nice to you i'm a big fan of the who but just because i bought all their albums doesn't

411
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,360
mean that i can go with you you're the one that gets the most money i don't mean that i can go

412
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,960
over to Roger Daltrey's house, sleep on his couch, fuck his groupies, and tell him

413
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:07,820
how to put on a rock and roll show.

414
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:19,100
All Dobbs ever asked you for was 35 bucks and most of you paid even less

415
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:24,760
than that. You got what you paid for and anything beyond that is a privilege

416
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:31,120
granted by the benevolence of Dobbs fellow servants. We serve Dobbs.

417
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:38,160
We are not your parents. Those of us who are perceived as members of some higher

418
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:45,260
echelon have attained our status because we work hard, we fix problems, we give.

419
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:51,040
We gave our money as a tithe from Bob. We give our effort, we give our sweat, we fix

420
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,140
problems, we create the mythos, the art, the music, the videos,

421
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:54,740
we create the mythology, the rules, the art, we

422
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:54,740


423
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:54,740


424
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:57,580
We provide ideas and work hard to bring them to fruition,

425
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:04,520
as opposed to those who just sit and stare and demand to be spoon-fed the slack they feel entitled to.

426
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,680
When I joined this church, I got a membership pack and a minister's card.

427
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:12,280
That's what I paid for.

428
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:19,860
There was no X-Day, there was no Facebook or Yahoo groups, and devivals were few and far between.

429
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:26,120
The only sub-geni I personally knew were the ones I indoctrinated myself.

430
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:32,160
If you wanted to correspond with another sub-genius, you mailed them a letter.

431
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:38,460
You sent them smoke signals.

432
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,760
A lot of us still do.

433
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:47,580
All of the facets of the present sub-genius church, the present community,

434
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,780
the events and friends that you have made,

435
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:52,900
from attending them, these did not just happen.

436
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:57,100
These assets were built by the heroes of the sub-genius church,

437
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:02,780
the saints, the doctors, who all understand that slack is returned tenfold,

438
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,680
only to those willing to give all the slack they have.

439
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,880
People like Stang, Princess Wee,

440
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:12,840
Susie the Floozy, Papa Joe Mama,

441
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,540
G. Gordon Gordon,

442
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,880
Nikki Death Chick, Pisces and Suds,

443
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,740
Reverend Pockets, Two Beans,

444
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,920
even sweet little Pantiera,

445
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:27,380
pitch in to make X Day and the sub-genius church the best church ever,

446
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,180
as do many others who I regretfully don't take the time to name here.

447
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:37,900
Many of you like to sit and just dig on the happenings,

448
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,460
and you know what?

449
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,280
That's fucking awesome too.

450
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,920
We get our measure of slack by doing this for our friends.

451
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,840
But to bitch and complain that you're not a sub-genius church,

452
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:49,840


453
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:49,840


454
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:49,840


455
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,360
and you're not provided the slack you feel you're entitled to,

456
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:56,540
or worse, taking it from someone who does deserve it,

457
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,580
when you have put no slack of your own into the great slack pot,

458
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:04,280
that is the very definition of asshat.

459
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:11,800
That makes you an ungrateful slack vampire.

460
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,100
If you lose your shit and start raving like a deluded idiot,

461
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:19,760
just because mean old bully Dr. Legume was rude,

462
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,660
rude to you, and pointed out your obvious asshattery on the internet,

463
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:27,560
then you might as well just burn your card right fucking now,

464
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:31,480
because while Bob loves you, the rest of us think you're an asshole.

465
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,500
You don't need the sub-genius church, you need a mother.

466
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:41,280
And if you see me as a mother figure, your father was a fag.

467
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,480
We don't owe you our support, endorsement, or our fellowship.

468
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:53,180
We will not sit idly by while you publicly attempt to buttfuck us.

469
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:58,020
You got your minister's card, you can go be a sub-genius by your goddamn self,

470
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:01,520
somewhere far from mean people who won't stroke your dick.

471
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,060
Membership has its privileges, but like I preached to you today,

472
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,380
it also has its burdens.

473
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,740
And a few as a sub-genius would rather add to that burden than to generate slack,

474
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,460
than my message to you, Mr. or Mrs. Butthurt Slacks,

475
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,420
the sub-genius is as follows.

476
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,340
Go fuck yourself, you worthless candy-ass cunt.

477
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:32,580
You're not sitting in the irradiated wreckage of your flood-ravaged town.

478
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:36,100
You're not picking through your tornado-blasted possessions

479
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,940
looking for your dead child.

480
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:43,400
You're not some fossilized guinea, frozen in perpetual pants-shitting terror

481
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:46,440
inside a 2,000-year-old lava rock.

482
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,460
Puzzling evidence that you're not a child, but a child.

483
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,260
You're a child that's shot dobs in the head.

484
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:56,340
Consider yourself lucky if a little butt hurt is your heaviest burden.

485
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:57,960
Praise Bob.

486
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,900
Praise Bob!

487
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,620
Everyone give a hand for Dr. Lagoum!

488
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:29,720
I'm not the one to blame.

489
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:29,720


490
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:30,340
I won't be the first.

491
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,820
Keep me out of your revolution.

492
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,660
I won't be the first.

493
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:35,240
Keep me out of your revolution.

494
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:47,340
Policeman's a prick.

495
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:51,300
Drug dealer's a dick, who should you pick?

496
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:01,900
Somebody try to sit on me, I smell like onions, I know

497
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,860
Bob can help you, Bob can help you, Bob can help you

498
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:24,160
I won't be the first, keep me out of your revolution

499
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,640
I won't be the first, keep me out of your revolution

500
00:30:33,420 --> 00:30:38,280
Policeman's a prick, drug dealer's a dick, who should you pick?

501
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:46,840
Bob can help you, Bob can help you, Bob can help you

502
00:30:49,740 --> 00:30:52,880
Bob can help you, Bob can help you, Bob can help you

503
00:30:55,580 --> 00:31:01,700
I don't know why, it's, I mean, my wife, she fell down and they've had to pick her up and her leg's okay

504
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:06,080
And something, you can't get something for nothing, you know, if it ain't one thing, it's another

505
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:12,980
It, you know what I'm talking about, it, it, it, it ain't one thing, it is gonna be another

506
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,520
It may be coming back on that opposite reality chain, you know, the one coming back the other way

507
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:19,640
It's like a big eight, it's like a big eight, if it weren't for nothing

508
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,220
In contrast, you know, we'd be like nothing too compared to it

509
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:26,820
And, and you can't know nothing unless you know everything

510
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,780
But you can't know everything unless you know nothing

511
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:32,700
I mean, people say crazy things, they, they get down there and they say

512
00:31:32,700 --> 00:31:37,420
But the Hades, the Hades and the unseen world and the abode of the lost

513
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,480
And they say that ain't real and, and I seen it down there on the seventh level and I, I

514
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:45,960
The mystery, the mystery, the mystery, it just, it just tears us apart

515
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,760
The mystery, and if we can just say, I know, I know that we can make it back

516
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:56,760
Believe it or not, that was me in 1980

517
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:59,980
I was a bit more superstitious back in those days

518
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:06,920
Before that, the song, I Won't Be the First, was by the Psychoskeletons

519
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:12,060
Their work can be found at soundclick.com slash the psychoskeletons

520
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:15,940
Before that, Dr. Legumes, truly inspiring song

521
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,920
Rant, the Butthurt Subgenius

522
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:22,100
Stay tuned for another great sermon, this time by Father Joe Mama

523
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,840
But first, from Lemur, PR News

524
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:30,960
From PR News in Washington, I'm sometimes in the Penn State locker rooms

525
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:33,620
Lawyers say PR News abused him

526
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:37,920
PR's likely to blame for that attack on a popular PR reporter

527
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:42,320
PR News claimed they attacked because people engage in immoral activities

528
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:43,700
PR's bad

529
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:45,940
At last, Chuck on Wall Street

530
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:46,900
5713

531
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,540
Federal safety regulators say they're investigating more than a million complaints about PR News from Washington

532
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:57,820
UN Envoy Kofi Annan says he wants bloodshed

533
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:02,640
The former UN Secretary General was saying he wants bloodshed next week

534
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:11,420
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration rolled to a 121-106 win over PR News in Washington

535
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,960
It's not for us to know

536
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,480
No, we can't say who's pink and who's a subgenius

537
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,760
We can say who bought their subgenius ID card

538
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,860
But we can't say what their genetic history is

539
00:33:23,860 --> 00:33:29,760
The very beginning of getting squared away and ship-shaped with the church of the subgenius

540
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:33,600
Is making this simple elementary monetary transaction

541
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,940
Well, sir, I know, and you all know, that one thing that you can never get enough of is

542
00:33:42,940 --> 00:33:47,120
More edifying subgenius dogma and theology

543
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:58,040
And that is why, limping and halt, you have all come here to hear even more of the same subgenius succotash

544
00:33:58,040 --> 00:34:05,780
And as it happens, the Savonarola of the church of the subgenius, perhaps even the Torquemada

545
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:08,800
Is sitting directly to my right

546
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,920
And he has a rip-snorting shirt on

547
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:15,200
And a sermon to lay upon you

548
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:19,620
Of hellfire, damnation, and far worse

549
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:23,780
And I think to set the stage for what follows

550
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:28,360
We must now attend to the words of Papa Joe Mama

551
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:36,040
On this X-Day, Drill Day, July 5th, 2012

552
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,140
In the year of our Lord

553
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,300
So mote it be

554
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,580
Recovering as we are from these whole series of storms

555
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:48,600
Many of which have been described as the storm of the century

556
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:55,020
Some of us may have also noticed that there's been a lot of wildlife to come out after the storms

557
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:57,060
To feed on me personally

558
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:03,080
You go out past the grounds of the gravel and dirt roads here

559
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:07,520
You may see the asphalt that awaits you as you hit the first roads of civilization

560
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:11,200
You may see the many, many worms that have crawled out

561
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,560
And what happened to them

562
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,120
And such was the inspiration for today's sermon entitled

563
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:21,440
The Subgenius Diet of Worms

564
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:28,280
Because dear friends, so many people spend their lives inching further and further away from Bob

565
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,440
Yet they don't even realize it until it's too late

566
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:35,100
They don't have the vision to recognize their mistake

567
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:38,280
They don't have the wisdom to realize what they are doing

568
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:42,000
And they don't have the faith to correct their mistake

569
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:46,840
It's one of life's greatest tragedies repeated day in and day out

570
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:50,900
How many of you have taken a walk after that storm and seen in the wet morning

571
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:54,060
And noticed all those worms crawling about on the pavement

572
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,720
They come out at night when it's cool and wet

573
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,340
And they mate with other worms

574
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:01,540
But then, then the sun comes up

575
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:02,880
And the dampness dries

576
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:05,080
And millions if not billions

577
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,220
Are trapped on the pavement unable to escape

578
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:11,440
If it wasn't for all the sidewalks and roads

579
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:14,520
Well, they would just crawl back into the ground

580
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,620
No problems whatsoever

581
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:18,220
For millions of years it worked fine

582
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:21,540
But thanks to so-called civilization

583
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:24,920
Covering most of the ground with cement and asphalt

584
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:29,440
A basic pleasure like mating becomes a life or death experience

585
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,120
Every year the risk increases

586
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:33,560
More and more payment

587
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:35,080
They won't quit bulldozing

588
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,900
And paving over this planet until the seven seas are covered

589
00:36:37,900 --> 00:36:40,020
That's their definition of progress

590
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,000
To be sure

591
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,320
There's still plenty of opportunity to find open ground now

592
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,840
But the lowly worms have a handicap

593
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,160
For they lack vision

594
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,900
If you walk along the road

595
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:56,620
You'll see hundreds of them dried up like twigs

596
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,840
Just inches away from the edge of the pavement

597
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,420
They could be mere microns from escape

598
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,080
But without vision they lose whatever hope they have

599
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,480
So they give up

600
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,560
Shrivel up

601
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,520
And die

602
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,080
Or worse yet

603
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:11,980
They change directions

604
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:14,420
And go perpendicular to the edge

605
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:16,160
The road can go on for miles

606
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:20,000
There's absolutely no hope they will ever reach the end

607
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,700
But they don't know that

608
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,580
Because they are misguided

609
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,800
Most humans

610
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:28,560
The pinks

611
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,820
Why they are just like worms

612
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:34,160
They leave their natural state

613
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,320
They abandon their caveman ways

614
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,720
And their yeti heritages

615
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:42,360
And they venture forth into the sterile world of the conspiracy

616
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,240
They surrender their freedoms

617
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,340
To dig any direction

618
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,740
In three different dimensions

619
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,700
Up and down

620
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:49,400
Left or right

621
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,240
Backwards and forwards

622
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:51,700
To do anything they want

623
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:54,320
And where there are no rules

624
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,580
No regs

625
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:56,400
And no laws

626
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:59,220
And yet they trade all that freedom for a flat

627
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:00,340
Conforming

628
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:01,780
Two dimensional world

629
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,160
An artificial world

630
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,400
Built by and for

631
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,660
The conspiracy

632
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,660
Oh yes

633
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:10,000
They can still crawl left and right

634
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,340
Back and forth

635
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:12,560
And

636
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,780
Well let's be fair

637
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,760
They can still get up

638
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,660
As long as they lie down

639
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:18,560
And take it in the butt for the conspiracy

640
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,120
Fortunately

641
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:22,560
We still can get down

642
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,220
By going back to Bob

643
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:25,540
They

644
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,820
They would have us live close to the edge

645
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:29,360
But Bob

646
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,500
Can give us that opportunity to take the plunge

647
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,480
But alas few have that vision

648
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:38,440
We can't blame humans for wanting to explore

649
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:40,700
To see what the conspiracy has to offer

650
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:43,540
The more you look at the other religions

651
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,480
The better the subgenius religion looks

652
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,460
And everybody knows

653
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:50,040
That Bob is all for expanding your mind

654
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,680
Be it with books

655
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:52,180
Or adventure

656
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,460
Or pharmaceuticals

657
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,800
The only bad experience

658
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,120
Is the one you were too afraid to try at least once

659
00:38:58,800 --> 00:38:59,800
But unfortunately

660
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:01,300
Most folks

661
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,020
And I mean millions

662
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:05,400
Perhaps billions lose their way

663
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:07,300
Until it's too late to find their way home

664
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,320
The conspiracy has blinded them

665
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,160
With bullshit

666
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:11,800
And now they can see

667
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,760
Where they are going from

668
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,040
And whence they have come

669
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,400
But time is relative my dear friends

670
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:18,960
That night of pleasure

671
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,660
And that morning of afterglow

672
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,500
Must have seemed like it would never end

673
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,260
To the worms in the street

674
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:27,900
Until the sun started beating its pathway

675
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,480
Up into the apex in the sky

676
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,680
Boiling their blood

677
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,280
The worms

678
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,900
Didn't know what the sun was

679
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:34,480
They didn't believe it existed

680
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,000
Because they couldn't see it

681
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,060
They couldn't feel it

682
00:39:37,060 --> 00:39:38,320
They couldn't feel the discomfort

683
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,200
Until it was too late

684
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,780
Does that remind you of something friends?

685
00:39:43,060 --> 00:39:44,060
Like hell?

686
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:45,980
Yes dear friends

687
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:48,600
One of the conspiracy's greatest tricks

688
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,500
Was making us think

689
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,320
Hell was beneath the earth

690
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,460
When in reality

691
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:54,840
It was right there on the surface

692
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:56,500
And we were living in it

693
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,700
Years may pass

694
00:39:58,700 --> 00:39:59,520
Before you realize

695
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:01,280
Your life is evaporating away

696
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,440
Oh it's nothing sudden

697
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,580
That would be too obvious

698
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,040
No it's gradual

699
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,600
You die slowly

700
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,020
By degrees

701
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:13,140
How many people here now

702
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:15,140
Are starting to feel the heat

703
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:17,280
One degree at a time

704
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,480
That degree

705
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,740
Well it may be

706
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:20,660
Too many bills

707
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,460
Or too many bad relationships

708
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:24,260
Or too many jerks at work

709
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,300
You might have a combination platter

710
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,120
Of several different things

711
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,060
Like a flat tire

712
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:30,640
An obnoxious telemarker

713
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,420
Or an unexpected parking ticket

714
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,840
Or a sudden tax audit

715
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:34,380
You name it

716
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:35,400
The possibilities are endless

717
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,380
And there you are

718
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:37,880
Completely naked

719
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:40,320
In the middle of the conspiracy parking lot

720
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:42,740
With high noon approaching fast

721
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,360
What are you gonna do?

722
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:45,440
Run?

723
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,780
You can try running friends

724
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:48,720
But chances are

725
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,180
You'll just go further down that same road

726
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:53,560
Even if you backtrack where you started

727
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:55,160
If you're like most folks

728
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:57,180
You ventured way too far out

729
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:57,980
To make it back alive

730
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:58,760
You're a goner

731
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,620
But by the grace of God

732
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:00,760
You're a Bob

733
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,200
Go ahead

734
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,000
Ask him for a miracle

735
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:06,060
You just might get it

736
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,420
Only an act of Bob

737
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,080
Can cover that burning light

738
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,720
With a thick blanket of clouds

739
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:14,480
And release the cool liqueur of slack

740
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:16,020
To rain down on you

741
00:41:16,020 --> 00:41:17,640
And your fellow subgenius mutants

742
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,740
Only Bob

743
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,840
And the gravitational pull

744
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,760
Of a few exes orbiting death stars

745
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:23,780
Has the power

746
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,960
To make the pavement buckle

747
00:41:25,960 --> 00:41:27,140
And split

748
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:29,640
And like Moses in the Red Sea

749
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,380
Rip

750
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:30,620
The pavement

751
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:30,620


752
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:30,620


753
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:30,620


754
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:30,620


755
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:30,620


756
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:30,620


757
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:30,620


758
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:30,620


759
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:30,620


760
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:30,620


761
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:31,340
In twain

762
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,220
Thus providing you and your friends

763
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:35,680
A second chance at salvation

764
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:38,160
Will you have the wisdom

765
00:41:38,160 --> 00:41:39,360
To take that chance

766
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,340
Or will you

767
00:41:40,340 --> 00:41:43,000
Like a true conspiracy stooge

768
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,460
Crawl away in the other direction?

769
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,140
Of course

770
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:49,200
This amazing miracle

771
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,100
Will be described

772
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,240
As a disaster

773
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,340
By the conspiracy

774
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:54,600
Oh we had a terrible flood

775
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:55,300
And an earthquake

776
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,060
It was the storm of the century

777
00:41:57,060 --> 00:41:57,640
They'll say

778
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:58,780
Millions of dollars

779
00:41:58,780 --> 00:41:59,600
Worth of rose

780
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:00,600
And precious pears

781
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:00,600


782
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:00,600


783
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:00,600


784
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:00,600


785
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:00,600


786
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:00,600


787
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:00,600


788
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:00,600


789
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:00,600


790
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:00,920
And a pavement

791
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,060
Will destroy their claim

792
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:03,580
And hundreds of lives lost

793
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,960
Or perhaps just twelve

794
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:06,920
Think about that statement

795
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:07,760
Lives lost

796
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:09,220
Were they really lost?

797
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:12,040
Lost by the conspiracy perhaps

798
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,140
But found by Bob

799
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,560
A successful life

800
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:17,260
To the conspiracy

801
00:42:17,260 --> 00:42:18,940
Is one spent slaving away

802
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:19,880
To their wants

803
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,760
And their desires

804
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:23,100
A life that wears itself down

805
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:24,720
And grinds itself out

806
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,820
Exchanged the vitality of life

807
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,100
For stiff artificial objects

808
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:30,560
We're told we cannot live

809
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:30,860
Without

810
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:31,920
Then

811
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,120
When the pathetic person is dead

812
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,920
And shriveled up like a raisin

813
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,320
Then and only then

814
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,760
Does the conspiracy return

815
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:40,180
The body to Mother Earth

816
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,900
And how do they do it?

817
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:43,940
Why they lock it in a box

818
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,020
And they place it in a cement vault

819
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:46,900
Beneath the grass

820
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,260
Surrounded by earth

821
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,240
But not touching it

822
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,120
Or better yet

823
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,400
Burned to a crisp

824
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:52,240
In a crematorium

825
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:54,820
And in either instance

826
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,280
The body is embalmed

827
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,000
That is to say

828
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,400
Cut open and hollowed out

829
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,260
Because dear friends

830
00:42:59,260 --> 00:42:59,940
We all know

831
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:01,040
If there's one thing

832
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,520
The conspiracy can't stand

833
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,900
It's a person with guts

834
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:08,560
Oh, did I forget to mention

835
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:11,560
Both options cost thousands of dollars

836
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:13,060
How typical

837
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,380
Bob, on the other hand

838
00:43:15,380 --> 00:43:16,560
Only wants you to be free

839
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:17,800
No fuss, no muss

840
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:19,740
And the only fee he charges

841
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:22,320
Is a one-time $35 love offering

842
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,540
How much more obvious

843
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,480
Can the choice be?

844
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,920
Are you going to let yourself

845
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:28,800
Be turned into a dried-up mummy?

846
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:29,920
For some kind of

847
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:31,140
Conspiracy hell on earth?

848
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,740
Are you going to live life

849
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:33,820
As a conspiracy worm

850
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,740
Crawling along on your belly

851
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,600
Dodging those goose-stepping

852
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:39,820
Hard heels of the conspiracy boots?

853
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,100
Or

854
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:44,060
Or are you going to live a life

855
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,720
Of a reproduction cycle

856
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,080
Of a Martian peen worm

857
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:50,340
Living inside a bob-dob's pants pocket

858
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,040
Just below the surface of the zipper

859
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:53,940
Living and squirming and mating

860
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,240
As if your very life

861
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,020
Depended on it

862
00:43:56,020 --> 00:43:56,520
Which it does

863
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:59,720
The choice, friends, is yours

864
00:43:59,720 --> 00:43:59,920
The choice, friends, is yours

865
00:43:59,920 --> 00:43:59,920


866
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,640
I just hope you chose wisely

867
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,500
And avoid that hot highway

868
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,760
To hell

869
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:08,940
Here and at the word of my praise, Bob

870
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:09,240
Amen

871
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,760
Praise Bob!

872
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:13,520
Praise Bob!

873
00:44:13,560 --> 00:44:14,680
Praise Papa Joe Mama!

874
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,400
What an incredible sermon

875
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,600
And what a great-sounding recording

876
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,700
Hail Papa Joe Mama

877
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:23,660
Thank goodness Dr. Philo Drummond

878
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,000
Has not arrived here yet

879
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:26,060
Nor G. Gordon Gordon

880
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,540
They will in the fullness of time

881
00:44:28,540 --> 00:44:29,920
For the purest of souls

882
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,340
But the purity of Papa Joe's words

883
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:34,040
Came through loud and clear

884
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:38,800
Without any snarky second meanings thrown at him

885
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,220
We can put those in in post

886
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,520
We'll add those in

887
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,440
Along with the zoings and the boings

888
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,220
And the various other things

889
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:48,880
If only Dr. Legume's rant last night

890
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:50,080
Had worked out so well

891
00:44:50,820 --> 00:44:53,120
Half of it wasn't there

892
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:53,860
Well, I was there

893
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:59,340
And I heard the rants of G. Gordon Gordon and...

894
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:00,340
That's incredible.

895
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:05,880
Both were totally in line with subgenius doctrine.

896
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:08,180
And yet totally contradictory.

897
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,200
Yes, that's the beauty of it.

898
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:13,040
They contradicted each other completely, all the way down the line,

899
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,440
and yet each rant was doctrinally perfect.

900
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:25,320
Because of the contradictory nature, they force the subgenius spirit to expand like an amoeba,

901
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:27,060
to accommodate them both.

902
00:45:27,060 --> 00:45:30,560
Like the single hand clapping.

903
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:35,380
If it makes sense, then it's not making the sense that it's meant to make.

904
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:39,200
You just need long fingers and a fat palm for that.

905
00:45:39,480 --> 00:45:40,940
It's like Schrodinger's cat.

906
00:45:41,100 --> 00:45:48,320
There's a dead cat and a live cat and a half-dead zombie cat and a fat live cat and a skinny live cat.

907
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,120
And someone has to feed them all at seven in the morning.

908
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,540
And so here we are.

909
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,360
Well, we got up at seven in the morning.

910
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,340
And we waited.

911
00:45:57,820 --> 00:45:58,380
Earlier?

912
00:45:58,700 --> 00:45:59,200
Yes.

913
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:01,640
I had to get up at six.

914
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,660
When it was actually cool here at Wisteria.

915
00:46:06,860 --> 00:46:08,620
Believe it or not.

916
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,860
Those of us who weren't jamming and ranting last night, late into the night, we gathered.

917
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:15,700
We waited.

918
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:16,680
We did the countdown.

919
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:19,500
We did the countdown again like we always do.

920
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,040
We came up with the silly excuses like we always do.

921
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:25,620
And?

922
00:46:25,780 --> 00:46:26,340
And?

923
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:26,340


924
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:26,340


925
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:26,340


926
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:26,340


927
00:46:26,360 --> 00:46:31,680
We continued to march on in pure faith like we always do.

928
00:46:32,520 --> 00:46:36,240
Once again, Bob proved to us we don't know Jack.

929
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,000
I often think.

930
00:46:38,020 --> 00:46:38,780
Much less Bob.

931
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,820
And so all we can do is wait for his signal.

932
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,300
Wouldn't it be just like Bob to have the real X-Day one day after X-Day?

933
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:51,120
Just to see how many subgeniuses just threw up their hands and gave up.

934
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,560
To see who the real quitters were.

935
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:53,580
That would be typical.

936
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:55,300
And maybe really to tell.

937
00:46:55,340 --> 00:46:55,440
Why not?

938
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,280
To really tell.

939
00:46:56,360 --> 00:46:58,160
He might have to make it like two days afterwards.

940
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,960
Because the hangover is not even really over one day afterwards.

941
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:05,620
So two days after X-Day, that's probably when the real X-Day is.

942
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,100
Or even better, do it on Christmas.

943
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:08,700
Or Hanukkah.

944
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:09,500
Perhaps.

945
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,360
Or perhaps even July 3rd.

946
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,220
A whole almost year after X-Day.

947
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:24,920
I don't know if we should have it on some conspiracy holiday that's eternally bound into spending large sums of money.

948
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:31,400
Because just in the unfair way things are, there would be less for Bob and his ministry.

949
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,020
After these pointless potlatches had been totally satisfied.

950
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:40,420
Although it should be pointed out that real money means nothing to Bob.

951
00:47:40,560 --> 00:47:44,980
He just collects it as a token of your appreciation for what he has to say.

952
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:48,640
What is not sponsored with money has no value to you.

953
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:50,180
To him it's like air.

954
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:53,340
He just breathes and he inhales it and exhales it.

955
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,400
Mattress ticking.

956
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:57,600
It's a bit like the Asian version of what they call ghost money.

957
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,500
They collect it and then they throw it in the furnace to burn incense.

958
00:48:00,620 --> 00:48:01,940
Yes, it's called hell money.

959
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:11,380
It's given in the afterlife so you can spend and have a nice car, a deep freeze, a flat screen TV in the world to come.

960
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:13,260
Bob will accept your check.

961
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:14,840
He'll even accept your credit card.

962
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:16,700
He won't accept hell money.

963
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,240
He does prefer $1 bills over a $20 and a $10 and a $5.

964
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:24,380
It's just because it's more fuel to put in the furnace.

965
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:30,100
It's more fuel to put in the furnace to help fuel the steam rooms of the saucers.

966
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:33,740
A lot of people think these excess saucers are some high-tech deal.

967
00:48:33,980 --> 00:48:34,940
They are massive.

968
00:48:35,260 --> 00:48:38,080
They're the size of a planet, but they're still run on steam.

969
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,300
It's a standard steam engine.

970
00:48:40,540 --> 00:48:42,820
It's a pretty clean white of...

971
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,420
Very eco-friendly.

972
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,660
Yes, it uses a very common element in the universe, water.

973
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:54,200
And the parameters are high-tech, but the execution is low.

974
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:54,380
So, it's a very common element in the universe, water.

975
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:59,400
Which is something that the most advanced civilizations go for.

976
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:01,940
Because fewer things to go wrong.

977
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,960
Fewer over-complicated moving parts.

978
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:06,760
Female-to-female connections.

979
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:08,240
And that sort of thing.

980
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:14,360
So, while $1, $35 contributions are the highest coin of the realm,

981
00:49:14,580 --> 00:49:16,920
coins themselves are not as appreciated.

982
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:19,500
If you come in with 35 jars of...

983
00:49:19,500 --> 00:49:22,260
Mason jars of pennies with 100 in each jar.

984
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:23,860
Especially submerged in honey.

985
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:25,760
Yeah, that doesn't go over too well.

986
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:26,240
Yes.

987
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:31,620
I guess that one fellow did bring in his urine in jars, but that was Howard Hughes.

988
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:32,260
He was urinating for a better life.

989
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:33,820
So, we made a special exception for him.

990
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:39,260
But the higher the denomination, Fred, the hotter that spiritual flame.

991
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:42,500
You know, it was a quid pro quo deal.

992
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:48,140
You know, things aren't going well for you.

993
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:52,280
And your life seems a little run down and the future looks a little shabby.

994
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:53,840
Maybe you should ask...

995
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,260
Ask yourself, what have I done for Bob lately?

996
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:03,580
Because remember, friends, this church is not just a church about having a few grins.

997
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,380
It's about giving.

998
00:50:06,440 --> 00:50:11,060
And you should always, when times get rough, tithe to the church.

999
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,000
And make Bob tip that luck plane in your direction.

1000
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:16,840
It'll make you shout hallelujah.

1001
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,960
Yes, friends, do not fear the reaper.

1002
00:50:21,740 --> 00:50:23,300
Fear not tithing.

1003
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:24,100
To Bob.

1004
00:50:33,500 --> 00:50:33,580
To Bob.

1005
00:50:42,260 --> 00:50:42,340
To Bob.

1006
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:51,360
To Bob.

1007
00:50:53,040 --> 00:50:53,080
To Bob.

1008
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:53,140
To Bob.

1009
00:50:53,160 --> 00:50:53,200
To Bob.

1010
00:50:53,220 --> 00:50:53,260
To Bob.

1011
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:53,840
conspiracy

1012
00:50:58,220 --> 00:51:01,320
He was a great man

1013
00:51:25,700 --> 00:51:27,100
Oh

1014
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:42,640
No, no cross Toledo avoided by mosquitoes and the big chain

1015
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:50,420
That deals in Bolivia

1016
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,040
All

1017
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,980
friends in the crib

1018
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,860
Oh

1019
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:23,060
Oh

1020
00:52:23,060 --> 00:52:23,820
Oh

1021
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:23,820


1022
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:24,020
Oh

1023
00:52:24,020 --> 00:52:25,360
Oh

1024
00:52:31,520 --> 00:52:32,860
Oh

1025
00:52:32,860 --> 00:52:34,060
Oh

1026
00:52:34,060 --> 00:52:35,520
Oh

1027
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:35,840
Oh

1028
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:35,840


1029
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:37,440
Oh

1030
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:37,440


1031
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:37,760
Oh

1032
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:37,760


1033
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:37,760


1034
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:37,760


1035
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:37,760


1036
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:37,760


1037
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:37,760


1038
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:37,760


1039
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:37,760


1040
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,580
One day in Moscow

1041
00:52:39,580 --> 00:52:43,640
He went down to Gurkha

1042
00:52:46,300 --> 00:52:48,820
Long gone I come

1043
00:52:54,360 --> 00:53:05,620
I'm not going to lie to you, I'm going to lie to you, and you and I.

1044
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:21,600
God, a man with love, a man with love, a man with love.

1045
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:54,560
And just for 35, you can be by his side, and you can take a saucer ride.

1046
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:05,600
And then you'll see, how to get to the top.

1047
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:10,580
Just like for free, if you just follow.

1048
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:27,460
God, a man with love, a man with love, a man with love.

1049
00:54:41,740 --> 00:55:05,160
And you can be by his side, and you can take a saucer ride.

1050
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:05,680
Yeah!

1051
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:17,300
Bob.

1052
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:24,920
In San Francisco.

1053
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:29,400
A long, long time ago.

1054
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:33,360
He met his end.

1055
00:55:44,460 --> 00:55:46,900
But he lives again.

1056
00:55:47,220 --> 00:55:47,240
Yeah!

1057
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:05,640
You know, he lives again.

1058
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:05,640


1059
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:05,640


1060
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:05,640


1061
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:08,620
He might think about how rich he is, because then people might think he doesn't need the

1062
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:08,880
money.

1063
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,420
But he doesn't need the money.

1064
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:12,740
It's not Bob who needs the money.

1065
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:13,120
It's the follower who needs to get it.

1066
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:16,580
He doesn't need the money, but Bob's ministers need the money.

1067
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:22,220
Because they are not as purely along the path of luck as Bob is.

1068
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:29,540
Bob doesn't need money or anything else, but his ministers need every help that they can

1069
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:32,340
get to follow with their halting steps.

1070
00:56:32,540 --> 00:56:35,600
The footprints of the world.

1071
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:35,600


1072
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,200
The world's most slackful man.

1073
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,060
And the lowest of the low subgenie, the followers,

1074
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,680
they are the ones who benefit the most by giving.

1075
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:43,640
That's right.

1076
00:56:43,640 --> 00:56:45,500
What are the popular shows these days?

1077
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:48,000
The Bob show, Hour of Slack?

1078
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,460
Puzzling Evidence, Ask Dr. Howell?

1079
00:56:51,620 --> 00:56:52,920
No, it's The Biggest Loser.

1080
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,460
Bob's Slack Time Funhouse?

1081
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:54,780
Nay.

1082
00:56:54,980 --> 00:56:59,060
No, it's like America's American Idol.

1083
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:00,840
Dancing with the Stars.

1084
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:01,420
Yeah.

1085
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:02,920
Scooby-Doo.

1086
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:05,320
But we're going to be dancing among the stars.

1087
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,380
Not even the classic Scooby-Doo, but the crappy version.

1088
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:12,360
I don't think any version of Scooby-Doo may be called classic,

1089
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,200
but perhaps I do.

1090
00:57:13,300 --> 00:57:16,820
Not even the one with Casey Kasem as...

1091
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:20,280
Well, a certain perverse ability to...

1092
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:23,000
There's no sense in trying to save the pink.

1093
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:27,440
Bob did not instruct us to try to save everyone.

1094
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,860
Only 144,000.

1095
00:57:29,860 --> 00:57:32,240
They can only be saved when they are no longer pink.

1096
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,200
144, 44.40, something like that.

1097
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:35,580
When everyone...

1098
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:41,140
Every tint of pinkness has been burned away with the acids of subgenius revelation.

1099
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:48,140
Like the island of Dr. Moreau's House of Pain, it must be excoriated with extreme prejudice.

1100
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:50,820
The beast flesh must be driven back.

1101
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:53,820
Some people say, well, why didn't they use some anesthesia?

1102
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:55,340
Because that would defeat the purpose.

1103
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:56,980
We don't want to make it easy for them.

1104
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:58,240
They have to feel the pain.

1105
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:01,960
Well, Moreau said it didn't matter if an animal felt pain.

1106
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,160
Well, pinks are animals.

1107
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:05,480
Yes.

1108
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:08,920
But, you know, they have an animal body.

1109
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:12,180
But we're trying to inculcate a spiritual body.

1110
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:17,060
And that spiritual body is the Church of the Subgenius.

1111
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,780
We are merely among its thousands of limbs.

1112
00:58:20,040 --> 00:58:22,220
Mere cells in the greater body.

1113
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:26,400
Of which this show, The Hour of Slack, is but one of its radio outlets.

1114
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,400
In fact, it is the but one.

1115
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:34,940
And you can learn everything about the Church of the Subgenius and the other sub-shows from Subgenius.

1116
00:58:35,540 --> 00:58:35,580
Subgenius.

1117
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,180
Subgenius.com

1118
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:41,940
Thousands of previous shows, including Bob's Slack Time Funhouse from WREK, Atlanta,

1119
00:58:42,260 --> 00:58:47,620
and Puzzling Evidence from KPFA Berkeley, can be downloaded by following the links there.

1120
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:52,980
The song earlier, A Man Called Bob, was by several fisted tales of Connie,

1121
00:58:53,120 --> 00:58:57,220
like this background music, made up on the spot live at 50 Next Day.

1122
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:01,740
The rant before that, on tithing, was by Dr. G. Gordon Gordon.

1123
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,320
We'll be back next week forever.

1124
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:05,340
But now,

1125
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:06,640
we must sign off.

1126
00:59:06,780 --> 00:59:08,440
Take it away, Connie.

1127
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:12,600
At this day in beautiful North Texas comes to an end,

1128
00:59:12,660 --> 00:59:15,000
we hope we've been a pleasant part of your day.

1129
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:22,260
We strive for quality and are happy to display this National Association of Broadcasters seal of good practice.

1130
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:25,640
We hope you've had a good day, and that you'll join us again tomorrow.

1131
00:59:25,980 --> 00:59:26,620
Good night.

1132
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:33,120
Friends, we're glad you listened to this show,

1133
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,320
and we're even more glad that some listeners,

1134
00:59:35,340 --> 00:59:39,420
have donated enough to help us keep on going for another couple of months.

1135
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:44,420
Not just this show, but subgenius.com and all the other archive sites.

1136
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:51,540
But if you truly love Bob, and want some of that slack back to rebound to you,

1137
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:59,040
you should go to subgenius.com front page, or especially the radio page, or the catalog store pages,

1138
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:02,340
and help out financially as best you can.

1139
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:05,320
Now, we know what it's like to be on the radio,

1140
01:00:05,320 --> 01:00:06,720
on the brink of total poverty,

1141
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:10,360
and we don't want any subgeniuses to make their own situations worse.

1142
01:00:10,760 --> 01:00:13,380
But some of you still have jobs.

1143
01:00:14,480 --> 01:00:16,680
Even five bucks makes a big difference,

1144
01:00:16,820 --> 01:00:20,200
even if it's only once a month from enough of you.

1145
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:22,620
50 bucks makes an even bigger difference.

1146
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:25,940
All we're saying is that,

1147
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:29,320
blow jobs could go the way of Steve jobs,

1148
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,100
if you don't pay dogs.

1149
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:35,000
We also take checks and money orders to,

1150
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:36,880
subgenius foundation,

1151
01:00:37,360 --> 01:00:42,240
P.O. Box 181417,

1152
01:00:42,860 --> 01:00:49,360
Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1153
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:54,560
Thanks for anything you can do to help let there be slack.
