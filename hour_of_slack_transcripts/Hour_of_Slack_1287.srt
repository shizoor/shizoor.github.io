Gorgeous. Beautiful.

13
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:48,820
Genuine. Great.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,480
Huge. Most. Greatest.

15
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,000
Great. First. Magical.

16
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,760
Legendary. fame. Large.

17
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,100
Costly. Faster. Magic.

18
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:59,600
Relatively. New. Older.

00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:00,180
gement.

21
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:01,300
Genuinely beautiful.

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:02,000
Giant.

23
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:02,640
Perfect.

24
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:03,400
Cool.

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:03,900
Special.

26
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,460
Cheered.

27
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,140
Elaborate.

28
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:05,420
Easy.

29
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:05,900
Ultimate.

30
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,340
Best.

31
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:06,820

Nice.

Quicker.

36
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:10,420
And much more.

37
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:20,500
Ah, yes, dear friends, it is rerun time again, but you'll be glad to know that we're not

38
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:28,220
going to just do the same old three Christmas hour of slack show reruns in a row.

39
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:35,880
No, I'm going to compress it all into just this one intensive total rerun show, except

40
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,760
that actually it's not.

41
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:47,360
The whole first half will be largely peppered with a new Christmas sickness for the holidays

42
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,720
and holy days and the hole-in-head days, as it is for some people.

43
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:58,100
Actually, I have to work double time because it's the season of salad.

44
00:01:58,220 --> 00:01:58,340
Selling.

45
00:01:59,100 --> 00:01:59,140
Selling.

46
00:01:59,160 --> 00:01:59,440
Yes.

47
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:05,560
Oh, you wouldn't believe what the elves have done over at the subgenius catalogs.

48
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:10,380
But anyway, happy whatever you do.

49
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,360
Yes, this music in the background is somebody named Kenny Wayne Shepard.

50
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:25,400
Yeah, there's an album called Merry Axmus and Guitar Axmus.

51
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,540
It's cool, man.

52
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:27,800
Cool.

53
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,840
And praise Bob and the whole world.

54
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,480
Oh.

55
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:33,600


56
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:57,560
I'd like to find the guy who done me wrong and stuck my butt up on this Christmas.

57
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:58,200
Christmas.

58
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,680
Christmas tree.

59
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:28,180
Christmas tree.

60
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,800
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree.

61
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,040
Yeah.

62
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,060
Will you stop it?

63
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,600
Woo!

64
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,120
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

65
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:49,260
When this angel heard chop-a-pa-pop-a-chop-a-pop-a-pop, a dreadful fear went right into my heart.

66
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,080
Those pine tree needles sting me.

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,460
Ram-a-jam-a-ram-a-jam-a-ne-ma-ding-dong.

68
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,120
You'll never know.

69
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,680
You'll never know how much that smarts.

70
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,800
So who put the stump in my romp-a-bomp-a-bomp?

71
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,460
Who took and jammed it in my ram-a-lam-a-ding-dong?

72
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,460
Who stood the wood where I boop-sheep-boop-sheep-boop?

73
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:13,140
Who put the stick up my hip-a-dip-dee-dip?

74
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:17,900
Who took that bush and crammed it in my tush?

75
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:22,120
He made this angel beg for mercy, please.

76
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,020
I might squeeze him too tight.

77
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:27,700
It's that.

78
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,660
It's that psychedelic time of the year.

79
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,460
Do you know where your brain cells are?

80
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,580
It's already 9 p.m.

81
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,640
Don't go looking out in the backyard to dog-aid him.

82
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:43,640
Don't go walking down to the bar because old Frankie died last night in the backyard.

83
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,280
I mean, I'm in the apartment store.

84
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:50,720
Oh, can I borrow the brain cells tonight?

85
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:53,340
Yeah, he brought back the chainsaw.

86
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,460
Oh, yeah, and I ain't gonna let you use the brain cells till I get the damn chainsaw fixed.

87
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:00,040
Get back in my arm the way it was Tuesday.

88
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,480
Now, you boys be good, and I'll give you some of this here apple mango pie.

89
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,520
That dog's running off with them brain cells.

90
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,060
Can you do something about that, boy?

91
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,600
I'm gonna have to, I'm gonna have to...

92
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,360
Said in his name.

93
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:18,080
Said in his name.

94
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:18,200
Said in his name.

95
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,820
Said in his name.

96
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,880
Said in his name.

97
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:33,300
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.

98
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,420
No!

99
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,100
Eric Cranston!

100
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:51,920
Eric Cranston!

101
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:52,800
Eric Cranston!

102
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:53,620
Eric Cranston!

103
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,300
Eric Cranston!

104
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,680
What Wynn has manufactured with Sally is fun.

105
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,840
The fate of a child.

106
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,780
Spend all the money you've got.

107
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,920
Spend all the money you've got.

108
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:22,600
The Christmas Trough.

109
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,720
I've lost my freaking mind.

110
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,120
Oh, look.

111
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:28,680
Dave's dressed like Santa Claus.

112
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,840
He's like a cowboy Santa.

113
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:33,440
How jolly.

114
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:39,420
Oh, Jazz is giving, gives Dave the show pills.

115
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,920
Boy, I really need one of those.

116
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,120
What am I going to do about laundromat in this suit, though?

117
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,360
I need the show bath.

118
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:47,540
The show de-lousing.

119
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,880
Oh, Dave doesn't even have headphones yet.

120
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,080
That's enough of that.

121
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,740
Oh, he's got headphones.

122
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:53,780
I have some.

123
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,360
I have the part of my pancreas that I'd like to show you now.

124
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:59,680
It's been increased in size to...

125
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,460
Oh, your pancreas looks lovely, Dave.

126
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,460
Look, it's swelling.

127
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:07,580
I have the capability of a man of 190 IQ's brain.

128
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,020
I'll put more pills out for everybody.

129
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,040
Oh, those pills.

130
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:16,720
They make my mouth feel like it's on fire.

131
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,880
And my brain feel like it's a puddle of liquefied crystals.

132
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,700
I'm shocked.

133
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,160
It's funny.

134
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:24,800
I'm sorry.

135
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,300
The red pills are really good.

136
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:30,840
I like to take the red one and the blue one.

137
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:32,220
Yes, the red one and the blue one.

138
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,600
At the same time.

139
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,700
That way you go in and out.

140
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:36,820
The warp mix is easy.

141
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:40,840
It's so high, you can't go over it.

142
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,200
Angels we have heard on high

143
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:47,900
Singing about mountains through

144
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,560
And those mountains in reply

145
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,860
Sing we wish for you to be free from fear and fear

146
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,120
Sing broken words so far away

147
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,180
Think we are oops

148
00:07:58,020 --> 00:08:00,180
But we...

149
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:00,660
bakery

150
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:01,220
are not

151
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,580
The Tennessee

152
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,380
are not

153
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:06,460
Yours

154
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:06,680
Tell us

155
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:06,680


156
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:06,680


157
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:06,680


158
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:07,360
I love you

159
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,360


160
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,360


161
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:07,400
Little by little

162
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,240
Hurray

163
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,280
'll stay

164
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:17,420
Big

165
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:17,620
a man

166
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:17,660
I'll stay

167
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:17,660


168
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:17,660


169
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:17,660


170
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:17,660


171
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:17,660


172
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:17,840
Until tomorrow

173
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:17,840


174
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:17,840


175
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:17,840


176
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:17,840


177
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:17,840


178
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,280
Nor know

179
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,840
bén

180
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:22,840


181
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,860
Why

182
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:23,860


183
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:23,860


184
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:23,860

00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:23,860


188
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:23,860


189
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:23,860


190
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:23,740
Additionalี้

191
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,460
Barbie dolls.

192
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:41,100
Women rape and memorialize their lives by role-playing with Barbie.

193
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,240
Barbie dolls.

194
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:53,060
We have devised a marketing scheme for children's toys.

195
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,040
It will empower us to resist us.

196
00:08:57,780 --> 00:09:05,640
You will use your church as a vehicle to bring these toys before the power.

197
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,240
It will be called Bobber for Kids.

198
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:22,800
But how will the battle of good against evil be represented in your marketing schemes, human?

199
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,240
Good has lots of muscles.

200
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,520
Good.

201
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:27,400
Good.

202
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:33,400
The primitive earth societies should accept this value judgment.

203
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:52,780
Good will have free physical attributes according to human desires, sexual desires, latent in children, brought out through the vehicle of this so-called good.

204
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:52,780


205
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,700
All farmer told me is why is that church?

206
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,860
Better is not good.

207
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,460
She's new, from Kenner.

208
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,620
Where illusion is the ultimate weapon.

209
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:03,660
We must buy our toys.

210
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:06,680
Yes.

211
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,000
The old subgenius toy marketing scheme.

212
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,760
Recorded there at Dockstock 1984.

213
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,940
And me and Palmer Veedies.

214
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,500
Angels We Have Heard on High.

215
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,560
It was by...

216
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,800
The Philistines.

217
00:10:24,140 --> 00:10:33,640
The collage called All the Money You've Got is from the great Obtuse Christmas collage album, which you can get for free.

218
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,720
Get this...

219
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,700

That's Obt...

222
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,480
Excuse me.

223
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:45,680
Ah, yes.

224
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,420
And next up, The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

225
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,760
The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley & the Philistines.

226
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,180
The Real Story of Christmas by Michael Shelley.

227
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,440
Once upon a time, there was the baby Jesus.

228
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,940
And he had two eyes made out of coal.

229
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:10,120
And he was stuck up a partridge in a pear tree.

230
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,760
And he wanted his two front teeth.

231
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,940
And he got McDonald's gift certificates.

232
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,320
And he had a dog named Santa's little helper.

233
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,420
And he took all the presents.

234
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,820
from Whoville

235
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,060
and his friend Yukon Cornelius

236
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,620
came with the three wise guys

237
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,740
and he wanted to play the drums

238
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,340
and be the little drummer boy

239
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,520
but he couldn't

240
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,460
he wanted 10s and 20s

241
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:40,120
10s and 20s

242
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,380
and he got McDonald's dish certificates

243
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,220
and he got Zuzu's pedals

244
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,820
and that's the real story of Christmas

245
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:59,100
Take the halls and miles of holly

246
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,040
Tears of the season to be jolly

247
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,820
Don't we know I'll get a barrel

248
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,520
Roll the engine, you'll take care

249
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:19,400
La la la la la la la la la

250
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:22,120

00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,460
So separate, so separate, so separate

253
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:29,160
New from Tonka

254
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,700
Now you are in my evil clutches, Bob

255
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,280
I'll use this MTV bombardment to turn you normal

256
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:36,540
Shut up, pink boy!

257
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,060
No way, I'll never sell out to the conspiracy

258
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,120
Taste a little of my rocket pipe, alien tool

259
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:47,220
Bob Dobbs comes with rocket pipe, head launcher, janger device

260
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,500
All I got is a fighting Jesus and other action figures sold separately

261
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,140
Some assembly required, batteries not included

262
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:51,880
This toy falls apart

263
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:52,100
It's hard to get it out of the box

264
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:52,260
Every day

265
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,000
He-Bob and the Bastards of the Universe

266
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,400
Too much is always better than not enough

267
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
The creatures in Queen Barbara doll

268
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,620

269
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,580

00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,260

275
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:11,920
Santa Claus

276
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:21,000
Well, Tommy knew exactly what he wanted for Christmas

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,100
He wanted to be a man who could do anything

278
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,180
He wanted an electric train

279
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,240
He had the whole thing in his mind

280
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,360
Even to the table where he was going to set it up

281
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,820
He had the whole thing in his mind

282
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:48,800
He had the whole thing in his mind

283
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,920
He would dream so hard

284
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,500
That the whole thing would come to life

285
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,100
Like before he died

286
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:52,560
Like before his eyes

287
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:56,060
Like before his eyes

288
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:01,880
Like before his eyes

289
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:07,180
Like before his eyes

290
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,280
Like before his eyes

291
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,480
Of course, Tommy was a pretty strong wisher

292
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,740
And what he started wishing for

293
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:15,660
Was a pretty fancy looking train set

294
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,360
With locomotives and freight cars

295
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,440
And a station and a gateman

296
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,080
And a station and a gateman

297
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,680
With a coach

298
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,840
With a wrong sign

299
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,580
With a light on

300
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:30,740
With his power

301
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:30,740


302
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:31,360
covariating

303
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,400
And what made ben graph

304
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:32,880
Wonderland

305
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:32,880


306
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:32,880


307
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:33,300
For perfects

308
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,180
He could make everything

309
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,740
With driving

310
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,500
With perfects

311
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,120
Baby get the annihilation

312
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:42,120


313
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,400
And that's all

314
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:43,400


315
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:47,180

319
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,000

Bye

321
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:51,980
Bye

322
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:53,360
But Tommy knew what he was wishing for.

323
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,700
It is turnover.

324
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:00,260
The time of the year when all things sell.

325
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,800
The end of the year sale.

326
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:02,580
Oh, yeah.

327
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:06,380
So come and get it, everyone, and just buy our products.

328
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,220
Now, are we, is Christmas, I'm a little confused about what Christmas is all about.

329
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,600
Are we celebrating the birth of Santa Claus or his death when they nailed him?

330
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,920
Well, that's the ancient, ancient subgenie.

331
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,700
But the presence of genie, try to make sure that we have our inventories cleared by now

332
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:26,560
and sell everything to the pigs.

333
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,780
Oh, yes.

334
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:31,560
Once a pagan holiday and now a shopping season.

335
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,860
And it was something else in between there.

336
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:40,220
Before it was, after it was a pagan holiday and before it was a shopping season,

337
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,440
it was something else, but I think they started to war over it.

338
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

339
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,100
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

340
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,960
Happy holidays.

341
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,480
And see you after Christmas.

342
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:29,520
Bye.

343
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,440
Bye.

344
00:17:48,920 --> 00:18:06,940
Friends, try to imagine somewhere in the snowy north, the Santibob trudging mindlessly through the Himalayan snows, driven by strange forces to complete his nameless errand.

345
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:21,480
And he may show up at your house, my friend, if you've been a bad subgenius or a halfway subgenius, or if we keep getting tangled up in these other shows and having strange microphones.

346
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:27,220
How did that paternity suit ever turn out between Dobbs and Santa?

347
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:28,360
And who?

348
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,460
His dad.

349
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:30,540
Santa dog.

350
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,320
I don't know.

351
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,120
I don't think it was...

352
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,140
Yes, but St. Nicholas, this is fact.

353
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,480
St. Nicholas.

354
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,280
St. Nicholas punched another bishop in the nose and bloodied his nose.

355
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:42,120
Really?

356
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,580
The historical St. Nicholas?

357
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:47,640
Over the trinity of God.

358
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:51,900
The original St. Nicholas in Turkey?

359
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:54,740
Who the hell is God?

360
00:18:55,080 --> 00:19:01,420
Who the hell is God?

361
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,120
Who the hell is God?

362
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:05,060
S. Dobbs one day.

363
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,860
That's the question we should be asking.

364
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:12,700
Suddenly, a lightning bolt struck from nowhere on that bright sunny day.

365
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:17,460
Bob did a backflip, and from that day on, he too was a believer.

366
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:22,600
And from the snowdrift truck, a little child bearing flowers emerged.

367
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,080
Chip, what else is on the table?

368
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,040
Each one a dirty flower.

369
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:25,940
St. Nicholas.

370
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:26,780
Sip.

371
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,320
Sip.

372
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:36,460
The historical Santa Claus is originally lived, as the caller knows, as a bishop in...

373
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,260
Was it Constantinople?

374
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,120
Yeah, like one of those...

375
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,520
It was an ancient Byzantium.

376
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,920
Yeah, Asia Minor in general, yeah.

377
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:56,680
Yes, and he was known for sneaking into the rooms of young women and leaving gifts.

378
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:01,980
Light-sized lumps of gold, complete with a fake beard and a CIA Wall Street credit card.

379
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:05,240
A saint he was, the girl said.

380
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,460
St. Nicholas invented...

381
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,120
He invented the CIA.

382
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:08,240
That's good.

383
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,720
You got it, brother.

384
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,680
He snuck into people's houses through the chimney.

385
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:12,840
You got it, brother.

386
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:13,320
He knew when they were sleeping.

387
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:15,280
He knew when they were awake.

388
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,020
You got it, brother.

389
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,760
But like the CIA, he was...

390
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:19,240
That's Foucault, baby.

391
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:20,200
He was protecting them.

392
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,680
Foucault knew that St. Nick was a creeping, stinking spy.

393
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:24,180
What?

394
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:25,720
He knows when you've been sleeping.

395
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:27,280
He knows what you've been eating.

396
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,160
Hey, man, my kids still believe in St. Nicholas.

397
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,180
And who keeps that belief alive in their fevered, sick little brain?

398
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,140
True, and for him, so is...

399
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,320
Madison Avenue, of course.

400
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:36,440
Sure.

401
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,960
No, the surveillance community under your direction.

402
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,880
And the Reynolds Tobacco Company.

403
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:43,720
Miller Bear, you know.

404
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:43,960
He's a very powerful being.

405
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,580
If you're bad, he punishes you.

406
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,340
If you're good, he rewards you.

407
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,880
He's probably the closest thing to Jesus walking the earth.

408
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,800
He's the closest thing to Big Brother there is.

409
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:55,480
He rewards those who knows when they are smiling when they're awake.

410
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,400
I think, really, if you want to make a deal, you have to do it with, you know...

411
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Could Dr. Claus, in fact, be the wandering, quote, milkman?

412
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,920
Rumored to have fathered our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

413
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,380
Well, we find it a very likely possibility from the falsified documents we have here.

414
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:19,180
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on Bob's feet.

415
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,920
You better watch out.

416
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,440
You better not...

417
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,900
You better not tell them, tell anyone.

418
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:34,160
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

419
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,980
Rumored to have fathered our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

420
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:55,840
He's a broken man, this chocolate twas.

421
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,300
Gonna find out who's no longer in there.

422
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:04,180
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

423
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,480
Rumored to have fathered our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

424
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,780
You better watch out.

425
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:11,780


426
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:12,440
He knows when you awake.

427
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:17,960
He knows when you're in bad or good.

428
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:20,780
So be goodness, goodness sake.

429
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,620
Oh, you better watch out.

430
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:28,600
You better not tell, you better not tell them, tell anyone.

431
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,920
St. Nicholas is coming to town.

432
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:45,940
Rumored to have fathered our savior, J.R. Bob Dobbs?

433
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:45,940


434
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,580
And also the fluffy beard that often grew on our feet.

435
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:47,580


436
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:47,780
We better not tell anyone, tell anyone.

437
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:47,780


438
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:47,780

00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:58,400

Real plants?

452
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:10,480
Biological agents who only take 15%?

453
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:14,460
You think that our species functions are bad?

454
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,900
Oh, it's a great day, all right.

Santa Claus is real.

Santa Claus.

476
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,060
He was a huge, beastly, bulging man.

477
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,000
He was so real, how come we didn't get squat last year?

478

No L.

545
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:43,120
Before that some year old ESO and Michael Shelley did that real story of Christmas from

546
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:48,060
the Tarkin Records All Star Holiday extravaganza.

547
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,140
I'm playing a lot from that.

00:28:49,320 --> 00:29:00,460
So check out www.triage.com for that one also the Tarkin Records is also on www.triage.com

556
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,000
cie

557
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:41,960
The Weirbobs and Ima, those who have the psychosis that convinces them that they are the Santa Bob.

558
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:44,820
Or that they're Santa Bob by night.

559
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,120
And they go shuffling through the snow on their nameless, hideous errands.

560
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:57,520
The grin of Bob and the beard of Santa Claus and the pipe of the Lord stuck on their face.

561
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,720
They stop using the locks of their doors and they just kind of float into the keyhole.

562
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,240
Oh, friends, it's tough.

563
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,120
And, you know, just going to church ain't enough.

564
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:12,600
You've got to send your money to the Santa Bob.

565
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:21,720
As a matter of fact, the people across the street from me told their kids that Santa Claus bills them for the toys he brings.

566
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:22,680
Can you believe that?

567
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:30,520
The kids were asking if their parents, maybe Santa Claus will bring us two He-Man erector sets.

568
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,880
And the mom said,

569
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,240
No, no, he won't because he bills us.

570
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:35,240
We can't afford that.

571
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,200
Santa Claus sends us a bill after Christmas.

572
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,980
Yeah, but at least he totes the note.

573
00:31:50,260 --> 00:31:52,560
Let me go.

574
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,980
Let me go.

575
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:58,740
Let me go.

576
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,780
Let me go.

577
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,220
Let me go.

578
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:01,280
Let me go.

579
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,460
Let me go.

580
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:01,820
Let me go.

581
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:01,820


582
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:01,880
Let me go.

583
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,640
Let me go.

584
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:10,460
Let me go.

585
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,760
Let me go.

586
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,580
Yeah, think with Santa!

587
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:26,800


588
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,060
Yeah, you've got to kind of get a little 01E4!

589
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:31,020
Do you understand?

590
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:31,400
I think that's what it says.

591
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,280
And amazing.

592
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,860
More from Corporal Blossom.

593
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,520
I am really impressed by their editing work.

594
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:52,460
And that's on Corporal Blossom and the Mutated Christmas is on the Illegal Art label.

And whose birth do we celebrate with this new century?

614
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:28,080
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle but Satan claws?

615
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:31,380
Who was nailed on that great manger cradle but Satan claws?

616
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,340
Paul Bunyan

617
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:35,280
and his mother, Big Sister,

618
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:37,520
created the conspiracy.

619
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,120
Before there were malls, there was no such thing

620
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:40,660
as Christmas.

621
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:44,080
There was a down-home

622
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,840
Norman Rockwell style

623
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:47,780
it's a wonderful life

624
00:38:47,780 --> 00:38:48,720
type of Christmas.

625
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,960
It was a

626
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,120
kite-flying Coca-Cola

627
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:55,640
drinking Christmas, not a

628
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,080
crack-smoking, rubber-snapping

629
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:58,560
Christmas.

630
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:01,960
It was a

631
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:05,460
when your little brother

632
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,460
fell through a hole

633
00:39:07,460 --> 00:39:08,520
in the ice sling

634
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:10,400
and you went and saved him.

635
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:13,140
You didn't laugh at him and huff some more glue.

636
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,320
It was a wonderful

637
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,320
life back then.

638
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,220
But today

639
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:27,060
Christmas has lost its meaning.

640
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,300
Scott, you made your choice.

641
00:39:37,100 --> 00:39:38,360
When you rejected my word,

642
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,640
you rejected me.

643
00:39:40,780 --> 00:39:42,260
And to your eternal soul

644
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:44,280
you have found

645
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,740
that only could you afford

646
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,320
to give to God that which was

647
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,280
his, but you could not

648
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,620
afford to do otherwise.

649
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,740
The Senate still

650
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:54,900
stands.

651
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,240
In the outer darkness

652
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,280
where there is wailing and

653
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,120
gnashing of feet.

654
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:04,560
Sir, please give me just one more

655
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:05,540
chance, sir.

656
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,800
I don't want to go to hell, sir!

657
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,020
Sir, no!

658
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:10,080
No!

659
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:13,080
I don't want to go to hell!

660
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:14,560
No!

661
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,140
And the children

662
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:25,160
say you could laugh and play

663
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,080
just the same.

664
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,300
The tail-bearer will be at the

665
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:29,700
judgment.

666
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:56,380
Oh boy!

667
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,360
So you knocked mine out too hard you'll if I ever again slee lve him.

668
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,360


669
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,360


670
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,360


671
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:01,360


672
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,560
Strange lights appear in the skies all over the world.

673
00:41:15,860 --> 00:41:19,340
The wife of a carpenter experiences virgin birth,

674
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:23,500
and a baby is born with a head that glows like a fluorescent lamp.

675
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,260
Dare I ask it? Yes.

676
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,960
Was the infant Jesus neither man nor God,

677
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,540
but merely one of the countless aliens that visit the earth each and every day?

678
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:37,560
The answer? Yes, definitely.

679
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:41,160
Take that and shove it up the tube marked certainty,

680
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,260
in the fuzzy place called the Twilight Zone.

681
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:48,540
Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die.

682
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:52,980
The night Santa went crazy,

683
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:56,500
the night Saint Nick went insane.

684
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,940
Realize he's been getting the hang of it.

685
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,420
He's had enough of the

686
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:09,220
Well, the workshop is gone now, he decided to vomit.

687
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:13,520
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet.

688
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:17,460
And he tied up his helpers, and he held the elves hostage.

689
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:21,260
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage.

690
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:25,500
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger,

691
00:42:25,720 --> 00:42:29,560
and a slashed up Dasher just like Freddy Krueger.

692
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:33,180
And he picked up a flamethrower and a barbecue blitzer

693
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:37,240
And he took a big bite and said it tastes just like chicken

694
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,540
The night Santa went crazy

695
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:45,180
The night Kris Kringle went nuts

696
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:49,460
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole

697
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:52,920
Without stepping in reindeer guts

698
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:57,340
There's a National Guard and the FBI

699
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,640
There's a van from the eye, we're just loose

700
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:07,480
And helicopters circling round in the sky

701
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:12,580
And the bullets are flying, the bodyguards rising

702
00:43:12,580 --> 00:43:17,040
And everyone's dying to know who's Santa why

703
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:21,160
My, my, my, my, my, my

704
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,180
You used to be such a jolly guy

705
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,020
Yeah!

706
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:30,460
You're now a real-life superhero

707
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:31,980
What's out there, mama?

708
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:36,620
He knows when you're sleeping

709
00:43:36,620 --> 00:43:39,780
He knows when you're awake

710
00:43:39,780 --> 00:43:43,740
He knows when you're down or good

711
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,920
So be good, for goodness sake

712
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:49,760
You better watch out

713
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,160
You better not cry

714
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,520
You better not pout

715
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,560
I'm telling you why

716
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:57,320
You better not cry

717
00:43:57,340 --> 00:44:01,060
Santa Claus is coming to town

718
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:06,520
Santa Claus is coming to town

719
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:13,760
Have yourself an advanced Dogmatic Christmas

720
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:19,140
A song thing called Santa is Coming by F. Gillespie

721
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:22,360
Or Gillespie and F. J. Coot

722
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:26,020
ElectricElf at Loop.com

723
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,900
Can tell you more about that

724
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:28,300
But now

725
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,200
Who gave the Lord the Claptrap?

726
00:44:30,280 --> 00:44:33,480
Who made him talk in funny riddles so that we cannot understand?

727
00:44:33,960 --> 00:44:38,720
Who made him so succinct and blind that he is actually blind my one little finger?

728
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:41,400
Yeah, we're now officially in the Jesus season

729
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,880
The time of the Lord, of the fat man of the crab

730
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:46,700
How many before you reach your limits

731
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:47,740
Jesus season

732
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:48,660
Jesuses?

733
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,960
Yeah, how many can you bag?

734
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:51,820
How many messiahs can you bag?

735
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,020
Hail Jesuses

736
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,660
If you're doing it in season...

737
00:44:54,660 --> 00:44:56,000
If you're doing it out of season...

738
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,680
If you're doing it out of season, you need a special permit

739
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,520
Oh, you never do one

740
00:44:58,520 --> 00:44:59,200
And you can only take one

741
00:44:59,200 --> 00:44:59,720
Yeah, but I mean now...

742
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:00,800
You never bag the Lord in C

743
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:03,600
You bag the Lord in B-flat so you get that kind of rough sound

744
00:45:03,600 --> 00:45:06,140
But when they're in season, it's every God for himself

745
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:08,260
This is the season for the fighting Jesus

746
00:45:08,980 --> 00:45:09,380
Obviously

747
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,260
We are between a rock and a hard place

748
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:18,180
Did you know the Lord walked through Chaldea in the old age and he got a very, very hard foot?

749
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,440
And he got elephantiasis of the rectum

750
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:24,640
You know, it's not something well known by many Christian scholars

751
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:25,620
Messy, messy, messy disease

752
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:28,080
But I think the phrase in Hebrew was

753
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:36,920
I kind of like those stories where the Lord dies and then comes here to America and settles, you know, tames the West

754
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:40,240
I like when he moves into a trailer park and the cowboys...

755
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:43,520
Jesus fought for the Confederate Army

756
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:48,160
The Texas Ranger, Jesus, Texas Ranger

757
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:51,300
Johnny Rebel was a Jesus

758
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,980
I could see Jesus for the Navajo police, for maybe the Hopi police force, about to leave the country

759
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:55,980


760
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:57,940
Billy Jack was the Indian Jesus

761
00:45:57,940 --> 00:45:58,520
Man

762
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:03,540
The white brother who came to instruct the Indians how to be liberal

763
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:08,360
Well, what about old Peacemaker, the Jesus of the Iroquois who was actually Huron?

764
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:10,380
You didn't know that, did you?

765
00:46:10,460 --> 00:46:10,980
I got you!

766
00:46:11,640 --> 00:46:12,380
Thin rye

767
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:12,840
Jesus!

768
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,080
Elrond

769
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:18,140
I got a Jesus like no other Jesus you've ever seen

770
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,120
Oh, it tastes like butter

771
00:46:19,120 --> 00:46:21,100
A new Jesus, a different Jesus

772
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,780
It tastes like crappy Jesus

773
00:46:23,340 --> 00:46:23,860
A future Jesus

774
00:46:23,860 --> 00:46:25,840
A pipe smoking Jesus!

775
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,240
Jesus!

776
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:29,720
Hey, Dave, you know where it is

777
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:31,360
Go kick that window open

778
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,520
I already kicked it, I'll kick it again though

779
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,960
Kick it good this time

780
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:40,200
We don't mean nothing by this Jesus and God

781
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:45,000
We thank you for all the nice things you've done for us this Thanksgiving

782
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:45,440
Clap it!

783
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:50,540
We appreciate all that and we're just trying to insult your fan club, that's all

784
00:46:50,540 --> 00:46:55,820
That's why we do this blasphemy stuff, but we knew that you knew that because you're in all the...

785
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:57,240
All things and everything, right?

786
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:57,720
Jesus?

787
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,400
Right, I could hear him say that

788
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:07,520
Praise God and Bob and Jesus and Connie and Collie and the devil and the atheists

789
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:07,520


790
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:09,340
Could you see Jesus as a terrorist?

791
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,400
And science

792
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,080
Well, that's the life of Brian, isn't it?

793
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,280
And Greek mythology and Norse mythology

794
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,860
Listen to the sounds of hell

795
00:47:25,820 --> 00:47:29,300
And his reindeer are really wicked

796
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:33,540
Wrapped in wrapping paper

797
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:37,060
We're gonna break our necks

798
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:40,760
Got a rocket in my pocket

799
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:43,820
On a sleigh ride to heck

800
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,520
Sleigh ride to heck

801
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:51,100
Sleigh ride to heck

802
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:54,400
Sleigh ride to...

803
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:55,820
Heck

804
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,160
The elves are full of cheer

805
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,780
The kids are tucked in bed

806
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,160
Santa ain't coming

807
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,640
We're on a sleigh ride to heck

808
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,080
Their dreams are filled with toys

809
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:18,680
But they're out of luck

810
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:24,380
Cause Satan's taking Santa on a sleigh ride to heck

811
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:25,140
Sleigh ride to...

812
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,220
Heck

813
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:29,000
Sleigh ride to heck

814
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:32,720
Sleigh ride to heck

815
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:36,260
Sleigh ride to...

816
00:48:36,260 --> 00:48:37,720
Heck

817
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:40,820
Sleigh ride to...

818
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:40,820


819
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:50,340
The greatest scary Christmas song ever, friends, from his new album, Don't Trust Whitey, James Kocielka, Superstar.

820
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:51,780
James Kocielka, Superstar.

James Kocielka, Superstar.

823
00:48:56,640 --> 00:48:59,420
You know, see a subgenius has so much faith

824
00:49:00,260 --> 00:49:06,200
that he not only can accept somebody making fun of Bob, stomping on a picture of Bob,

825
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:07,200
he'll do it himself!

826
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:10,640
He has so much trust and faith in Bob.

827
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:13,360
Bob is such a good friend that he can insult Bob.

828
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:18,000
Now we subgenii, I hate to get on my soapbox in the middle of a bunch of entertaining tapes,

829
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:23,760
but we subgenii may be bad, but our way of bad is holy!

830
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:29,560
is holy compared to the evil of some not all at all by any means but so many

831
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,920
American fundamentalist charismatic save evangelicals etc in general of course

832
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:41,420
they and their corresponding types in Iran Russia Libya South Africa etc if

833
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:46,800
you ask me are actually the ace of the devil's sleeve wolves and sheep's

834
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:52,520
clothing friends just like Jesus warned about my we're Jesus and Bob like we say

835
00:49:52,520 --> 00:49:57,720
are old drinking buddies got nothing against Jesus it's just his fan club and

836
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:02,580
now we are saying that Bob is the ace of God's sleeve he's more like the smear on

837
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:08,180
God's handkerchief just like you or me but the uptight rival cults they don't

838
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:13,580
think God has a handkerchief I know cuz God's perfect he doesn't even sneeze

839
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:18,380
we're made in his image except that we have all these nasty parts attached to

840
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,760
us we have to go in the secret room

841
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:21,780

842
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:29,500
do awful things but God he's clean and pure according to them oh and he's male

843
00:50:29,500 --> 00:50:34,180
but he doesn't excrete juices and sweat and smelly stuff out of him like we do

844
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:39,960
because we sin oh yeah we all sin we're bad we're worthless we're no good to God

845
00:50:39,960 --> 00:50:43,080
unless we sign a contract with his agent

846
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:51,740

00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:21,760


871
00:52:26,560 --> 00:52:36,520
I'm dreaming about the kids you guys have.

872
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:44,580
And everyone can come back, right?

873
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:56,740
May your days be long and short.

874
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:12,200
And may all your dogs spend new lives.

875
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:22,140
Bye bye.

O holy night, the stars are brightly shining, it is the night of our kiss and youth's birth. Long lay, long lay the world in terror and repining, the pit and the stone-bounded twelfth.

880
00:53:45,260 --> 00:54:06,400
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices, beyond our grace, a new and glorious morn. Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices, oh night divine.

881
00:54:07,500 --> 00:54:15,160
O night when Christ was born, O night, O night.

882
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:45,220
O night divine.

883
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:08,620
O night divine.

884
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:28,200
Is it the nativity of Santa Claus that we're trying to celebrate here, or is it the horrible death of the Santa Bob, the Santai Bob, as he's been referred to in some early pre-scriptures?

885
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:47,760
O night divine.

894
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:25,640
It's all Christmassy right now. There's a bright green bob in the window and Christmassy lights.

895
00:57:25,900 --> 00:57:27,940
Is there a light out there? Is DJA out there?

896
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,600
And devilish artwork that's Christmassy.

897
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,820
No, that's something just left for DJA.

898
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:42,800
It's all Christmassy. It's all wrapped up in a perfumed ribbon-wrapped present under the tree.

899
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:45,060
Open the door all the way through.

And the sugar plums.

901
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:49,820
Something's up the chimney hole and Satan is his name.

902
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:51,400
Yeah.

903
00:57:51,640 --> 00:57:52,840
Or Santa, I mean.

904
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:54,340
Otherwise, gosh.

905
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:58,340
I guess we have to wait till Santa comes, Dave.

906
00:57:58,620 --> 00:58:00,040
Oh, beloved Santa.

907
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:03,380
I have wanted to put your bag down for a minute.

908
00:58:03,500 --> 00:58:05,820
Besides, it's always so ready to let him be.

909
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,480
What?

910
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:08,420
For so long.

911
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:12,040
Hey, Bob and Mary X-Men!

912
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:27,860
I've never seen your imagination get nucleus vierus before, preca email.

913
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:29,380
Huh?

914
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:30,680


915
00:58:30,680 --> 00:58:30,680


916
00:58:31,060 --> 00:58:31,500
Be careful.

917
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:31,600
You're not happy withドэ carries space there.

918
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:31,680
I like your idea oflaw Kant's bury the ship ship into the cable car and then shut him up.

919
00:58:33,140 --> 00:58:36,380
And Andrew, what's your idea oflaw?

920
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:38,400
No, I don't want toolesay to__

921
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:38,880
You're trying to lie to me.

922
00:58:38,880 --> 00:58:39,380
Maybe this is a prank.

923
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:39,380


924
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,720
Crap.

925
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:45,240
You're not going to dump off 30,000?

926
00:58:45,240 --> 00:58:46,980
Don't go there, don't go there.

927
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:59,380
Long cow, babe, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?

928
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:09,020
Don't despair, just because it's Christmas.

929
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:17,220
Children there are so gay at Christmas.

930
00:59:20,580 --> 00:59:28,140
All the children on the street hope they get something good to eat.

931
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:32,220
But for me, it's not so great.

932
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:38,020
Fuck Christmas! Fuck Christmas! Fuck Christmas! Fuck Christmas!

933
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,000
Fuck Christmas! Fuck Christmas! Fuck Christmas!

934
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:42,760
Fuck Christmas! Fuck Christmas! Fuck Christmas! Fuck Christmas!

935
01:00:09,020 --> 01:00:10,140
To you!

936
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,920
Merry fucking Christmas!

937
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:37,740
Merry fucking Christmas!

938
01:00:39,180 --> 01:00:41,640
Merry Christmas

939
01:00:41,640 --> 01:00:45,300
Merry Christmas

940
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:38,420
Merry Christmas

941
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:40,240
Merry Christmas

942
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:49,680
Merry Christmas
