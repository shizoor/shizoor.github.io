Bob, would you help me, please?
Bob!
Bob, what do you mean, Bob?
The thing wasn't weird.
Well, you pulled it too hard.
Well, it's a good thing I don't believe in ghosts.
Neither do I, but...
Let's get out of here anyway.
Bob, who attended a party in the country last night and on the way home, took a detour.
Most of us on waking in the morning know exactly where we are.
The rooster or the alarm clock brings us out of sleep into the familiar sights, sounds, aromas of home and the comfort of a routine day ahead.
Not so with our young friends.
This will be a day like none they've ever spent.
And they'll spend it in the...
Some genius power.
Roll the siren.
Is this a test?
You're trying to find out how much of this we can take before we turn into blabbering idiots?
Honey, look, there's bound to be an explanation.
What? What?
Uh, grass.
No.
Grass?
Just calm down.
Here.
Grass?
Grass.
Grass?
Grass?
Grass?
Grass?
Grass?
Come on, get up now. Come on.
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Uh...
Well, I knew you were swacked, but really...
Uh...
Uh...
Oh, boy.
Oh, I didn't have that much...
Ah.
Hoo-hoo!
Where are we, Bob?
Where are we?
Where'd everybody go?
There isn't anybody.
Just us.
Oh, come on.
There isn't a person or a thing alive in this town.
There isn't a person or a thing alive in this town.
There isn't a person or a thing alive in this town.
You just assembling an organism.


We're being watched.
No.
Now you're getting delusions.
Nothing in this town is real.
The house we slept in.
This child we can't find.
That squirrel...
stuffed with sawdust.
Show me one thing that's real.
Bob is real.
That's where they must be.
They're in church.
Maybe they're praying.
Was that a delusion?
Here's the church.
There's the steeple.
Open the door.
Open.
Is this some kind of a joke?
Is this some kind of a joke?
Church.
I don't get it.
Bob, where are we?
I had hoped we were in
the self-genius
power of
the world.
Well, we're not.
I don't know what it is.
A trick, a joke.
I don't get it.
Nothing moving.
Nothing real.
How did we get back there?
Why?
Why, this...
This isn't grass.
This is a...
It's a prop.
Maybe we're dead, Bob.
Maybe this place is hell.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.




What a nutty little tongue.
And how.
I still wonder how we got there.
Well, somewhere along the line,
your drinks caught up with you.
And you got lost.
And we ended up here in
Centerville.
I suppose it's the kind of screwball thing
that I would do.
How do you put up with me?
I don't know
I guess I just have a weakness for screwballs
Well, you certainly have a good one
Well, well
No
No
Well
Maybe it's not the same Centerville
Centerville
A real nice place to raise your kids up
Centerville
It's really neat

Be careful with your pets, dear

Daddy
You brought them all away from Earth
Oh, can I play with them, Mommy?
After lunch, dear
Right now, put them back
No
Go on
The moral of what you've just seen is clear
If you drink, don't drive
And if your wife has had a couple, she shouldn't drive either
You might both just wake up with a wail of a headache
In a deserted village
In

Bob, please don't try to find out anything more
Let's just keep going
I wake up in the morning
And I'm not feeling too good
I hit upon my pipe
And I'm better than I should
Take another hit
And turn on the TV
Go into the kitchen
Find something to eat
Take another trip
As I'm blowing out the smoke
Thank you, everyone, for providing what I have
I step out on the street
Going to an interview
With an alcoholic cop
Who has just been on the deuce
The day is bright and warm
And I'm smoking on my pipe
The singing, mocking bird
Moves me over to the right
He sits right on my shoulder
Squeaking louder than I can hear him say
My thoughts
Give us both a token
He tells me what he wants
But he grabs me by the hair
And we're flying through the air
To the pyramid of the red-head millionaire
In the pyramid
In the circular room
Arrhythmically pulsed
To a floyd turns
I meet the iron lady whose attention
I want to know
I'd want to know
Somehow
She said
If you have the time
We could party
In the piney woods
If you come with me
I could make you free
Make you free
I wake up in the morning
And I have a cup of tea
I read the funny papers
And I'm laughing happily
The iron lady comes
And she takes me by surprise
She leads me to the sea
Where a city will arise
Drifting from the ocean
In cascades of waterfalls
It's a delicate black city
Biggest thousand shopping malls
Walking from the ocean
As a big and mighty man
With a smile upon his face
And a pipe is in his hand
He reaches in his pouch
And hands me lots of herb
With the compliments
That it is quite superb
My lady turns to me
She says
You've seen a lot today
But you can still see more
If you load it off away
If you have the time
We could party
In the piney woods
If you come with me
I could make you free
Whoever smokes a pipe
Shall fly away in it
Whoever digs a pit
Shall fall in it
Whoever smokes the pipe
Shall fly away
So that nobody seems toOMe










Fly away free
Love me
Love me
In my private�
World
Love me
In your private
World
Love me

That's where I acquire
Love and care



But it tries to know



Why do you think Kentucky Fried Chicken changed their name to KFC?
The signs were a lot cheaper to paint.
You know the real reason, actually, I heard?
Because they wanted to take the word fried out of their name back when, you know,
because frying food is not good for you.
Actually, I heard that they wanted to take chicken out of their name
so nobody could sue them for not actually using chicken anymore.
Urban legend.
Really?
Well, I mean, just ask the PETA people.
They think those are real chickens.
Parts of it, anyways.
You know, if it's got a thigh bone.
They have chicken trees now, don't they,
where it's just a sort of a vegetable-like creature with no head that just...
Yeah, they've gone beyond urban chicken.
Yeah.
A sort of a root chicken and all these...
He's checking breasts and legs and...
Meat that grows on trees.
Actually, those trees are a very complex symbiotic relationship, actually.
For example, you know, you have to have extra large amounts of nitrogen-fixing bacteria
in the soil there as well, you know,
just to make sure that they can get enough protein from the air.
Well, and they haven't been able to get rid of the skin yet, right?
I mean, they don't have feathers,
but the meaty fruit, as you might call it, still has this sort of skin.
It's a barky.
It's a barky skin.
It's a barky skin that has to be removed.
See, all you've got to do is take a chicken genome,
or one of the chicken genomes,
and implant it into the tree,
into the primordial cell, the first cell, the original cell.
They've been doing that for two years now.
Mm-hmm.
That's where most of the chicken in the supermarket comes from,
chicken trees.
Mm-mm-mm.
Somebody else had the idea for cow trees,
but people just couldn't...
They wouldn't stomach that.
They wouldn't...
Well, you know, that's the kind of tree that, like,
they're saying we should plant more trees to curb the greenhouse effect.
Right.
A cow tree would do the exact opposite.
Right.
They'd be breaking wind and knocking themselves over simultaneously,
and it wouldn't be good for the logging industry or any of us.
Hello, you're on the air.
Yeah.
What are you guys talking about?
What's it sound like we're talking about?
We're talking about meat trees.
We're talking about genetic engineering, man,
something that's very important.
It's very important to humanity right now.
You should be paying attention.
What do you mean by meat trees?
We're talking about trees that grow flesh on them.
Haven't you heard?
No, I...
Explain.
You never heard of a chicken tree or a beef tree?
Professor, you sound kind of quiet, actually.
Well, they outlawed the beef trees.
Now, what's the status of the pork tree?
Are we still getting...
They won't make mammal...
They won't make trees with mammal flesh
because there's a law in the U.S. against it,
although I understand that in...
Yeah.
Yeah.













In foreign countries, they're about to legalize it.
Legalize it?
Yeah, legalize beef and mutton trees.
Legalize it?
Apparently, it's not that hard to do,
but the presence of little tiny mouths and eyes
and beaks and things here and there
along the branches of the tree freaks people out,
so they don't advertise much
that that's the way they do it.
They'll say farm-raised chickens and...
I can't wait.
What does that mean?
I can't wait until long pig is available.
Well, it already is available for a limited time only
at your favorite supermarket,
but it's not real, real long pig.
There were human genomes introduced into the pig
so that it has a longish flavor,
but it's not real long pig yet.
Some of those swine are kind of cute.
Mm.
Well, they have pretty legs.
I don't know how they did it,
but they'll have these...
They look mostly like pigs,
but their hind legs will look like Betty Grable's gams.
And it's kind of a shock, you know?
It makes you uncomfortable to look at one of those.
Like, I went to the state fair in Texas
where they had some of these new crossbreeds
between humans and farm animals.
And...
Well, in some parts of Texas,
that just happens naturally.
Right.
Well, on the other...
That happens in parts of Ohio, too.
There's a lot of people who look increasingly like pigs,
but I'm talking about these genetically engineered pigs,
and those are the only kind I've seen, actually.
Ever.
The pigs that have been...
have some human...
Because apparently human and beef doesn't...
That combination isn't that tasty,
but pork and...
Yeah.







I mean, they're close enough together that...
If you get the human and beef combo...
I know some Chinese restaurants that can do it pretty well, actually.
Kind of like the whole Four Seasons dish or whatever, you know?
Yeah.
Chinese chefs have been there once in a while, too,
but, yeah, sometimes they're long on the long pig,
and sometimes they're a little bit short, but, yeah.
It's a taste treat for this time of the year.
Yeah, it makes my mouth water.
I haven't enjoyed it in a while, but I remember.
Mm-mm.
Good.
Turd duck, man.
I wonder why...
I will not eat any food that starts with the word turd.
If they can take the turducken and just rearrange the parts of that name,
then I might be interested.
Like turd key or something, or...
Man pig turducken.
With a big apple in his mouth.
I can't believe that they would...
Is that an unwitting society?
Can you...
You know, if we thought about it, even in a satirical way,
somebody in Brunei or Saudi Arabia has tried it.
Or Japan.
Some rich dude with the money.
If we think of it, somebody has already tried it.
Well, we should start thinking of things that save our own skins, then.
What about the one...
Well, no, because some other guy will just save his own skin first.
See?
You gotta...
If you think about it, don't let yourself know you thought about it,
because somebody will steal the idea.
You gotta keep it secret, even from yourself,
until you're ready to put it right into production.
I was just thinking maybe Ulysses was the progenitor of the man pig race,
because wasn't it Circe who was like a pig,
and she was like really hot or something like that?
Do you know anything about that, Dr. Sinister?
I know you know a bit of classical literature.
Oh, gosh.
The name sounds familiar.
But I can't remember.
Are you talking about the Circe?
Circe?
Circe.
The circus?
The Circus Soleil.
No, I'm talking about a pig in mythology,
who, you know, the sirens were singing to him,
but a pig did allure Ulysses to some sort.
No, he would get lured, and then they would turn him into pigs.
But he killed the swine.
He did kill the swine because he knew it wasn't really a hot babe,
I guess.
He came to his senses and killed it.
That was after he was done with it.
Yeah.
He was, you know, it's like, well, how many of us have awakened in that sleazy motel room
and looked over and went, oh, my God, what was I thinking?
No, it hasn't happened to me.
But how many of us has it happened to?
Raise your hands.
I don't know.
You're asking.
How many of you wish it would, at least that much would happen to you?
If only.
If only that would happen to me.
If you could actually.
I don't care how much regret I have afterwards.
I just want it to happen once.

Who is your friend?
It's the amino acid.
The amino acids did that from their CD, Destroy the Warming Sun, theaminoacids.com.
By the way, they will be doing their last performance at X Day 14, but then that will
be everybody's last performance.
This is Hour of Slack number 1302, and that song was called 13013.
Say, did you know that we did an episode number 1301.3?
A 20-minute show between our regular weekly shows?
And you can only hear it by going to subgenius.com, because it is the most offensive thing your
ears will ever hear.
Before the amino acids, some radio synesthesia with host Dr. Sinister from WCSB Cleveland.
Before that, the song Stone was by the group Rainbow, friends of Reverend Topper.
And the long Twilight Zone bit was...
Wrecked up by yours truly, Reverend Ivan Spang.
The theme of this episode is, again, monsters.
But that covers more territory than you might think.
We're looking for people who like to draw.
There's a lot of art critics out there.
People want to be art critics.
Oh, yeah.
We have critics.
But we're not art critics.
We're looking for people who like to draw.
Drawing on a pipe.
Drawing on a pipe, daddy.
Yep.
Drawing on a pipe, Bob.
Yep, we like to sit back and hop, sissy.
You know what I'm saying?
Like, take the whole idea until the brain starts to melt and come out the ear canal.
Now, don't stick those tubes too high up in the ear canal and you can cause some pretty
bad sniffage.
You know what I'm saying?
Yeah.
Makes your sinuses go.
Back of your eyes.
Corrode, I guess, is the word.
Best word for it.
Corrode.
Eyes are corroding.
Grod in the scrote.
Friends, yes, we grow some great concepts deep down in the scrotes of our bodies where we
store our real soul.
You know what?
Did you know?
Did you know that the soul is stored in a hairy sack?
Yes, it is.
Between the thighs of your pet.
That is so not true.
Your pet, depending on what kind of virtues it may have.
If you don't have a pet, you ain't got a soul or a good receptacle for it.
It may have to just hover around you.
You could find yourself a rabbit or a beatnik.
They like dogs or cats best.
Tomatoes is good, but, you know, they'll go bad on you and they don't talk.
No.
No.
Oh, wait.
Here they are.
They're talking, though.
Oh, yes.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
Oh, look.
They're going out to sea.
They're in the little boat now.
How long we been out here, man?
I don't know, man.
I'm rooting for them.
I can't remember.
I can't remember anything.
It seems like we've been out on this boat forever.
I can't take any more seawater.
I'm this old, parched, and hydrated.
I keep drinking.
You'll be all right.
It looks like an island in the distance.
Here.
Just look.
It's a little bit.
It's a little bit.
It's a little bit.

I don't see.
It's a mermaid.
Yeah.
Hey, this is Merlin Island.
That's a mermaid's city.
What is this stuff?
Yeah.
She's beautiful.
Oh, my God.
She's so lovely.
Give me back up on the raft, man.
I must get to the mermaid.
I want to see her.
I'm hurt.
Oh, no.
Me first.
Me first.
Oh, she's so cute.
She was a sight for sore-eyed men.
Oh, she smells.
That fishy smell.
She's swimming rapidly.
Oh, wait.
Wait.
What's happening?
She's changing.
She's changing.
Too late.
She's too late.
My God, man.
Man, that's a big one.
It's no mermaid.
This is a creature that should have died 10,000 billion years ago.
Oh, from the smell of her.
I think she did.
My God.
By all rights of man.
Oh, my God.
I'm going to get those teeth.
This foul thing should not exist.
Oh, my God.
What have we done?
What is this?
All right.
Look.
Look.
It's getting up.
It will not die.
It refuses to die.
We must kill this thing.
Yeah, we got to get out of here.
What we got to do, man?
This religion we've created, it is turning against us.
That's what it is, man.
Stitched together as it was.
It's a monster of the air.
It's your own religion, you fool.
Look into the mirror.
No.
No, I refuse to admit it.
Yes, I admit we stole from dead religions.
Yes, I admit we dug up the corpse of Buddha, Jesus, and every other great teacher.
Yes, we did it.
And abused them.
Yes, threw them over our dash.
And had at them.
We buggered these other cults and would be world leaders.
And we took the best.
We took the best from them.
And we sutured it together into this great thing.
The great thing.
The church of the subgenius.
Yes, for we shall overcome the fools and the pig boys and the little pig men and the big pig men.
We will heal them.
This is our messiah, Frankenstein.
Oh, sorry.
Where are my medicines?
I need more of the drugs.
The drugs, you see.
The drugs seem to light up my brain.
I saw in an instant the power.
The power I had.
The power of slack.
The slack in my little finger had more power.



Yes.
Than the president.
Than the premier.
Even perhaps, yes, even more power than Bob.
Could it be?
Could I be the chosen one?
He was the nexus of the universe in his mind.
Yes.
And so I trudged on into the night.
Sand was slipping in the wind.
Away from the drug.
With his robe glowing.
Away.
He sauntered on.
Worse and worse.
Thinking that he had become the one.
I am.
The unit.
That one.
The vestige of.
The name.
The focal point of all universal forces.
The vessel of the universe.
Yes, I, Reverend Ivan Stang.
I was the great genius.
The brilliant writer who etched his flammable words onto the very skin brain of the followers.
And yet.
The great swollen sack confused, man.
What?
The drifting angel of infantilism.
What is that silly voice?
Oh, that's my conscience.
A few maggots.
That's disgusting.
I can ignore that easily enough.
A rested idea.
Of our courts.
But hey, come on, Aaron.
But I need to feed.
A brain such as mine must have more power.
It must have nutrients.
Yes.
The souls of others would be good.
Yes.
The brain stems.
The medulla.
Can I help you, sir?
You've been staring at the freezer case for a long time.
No, actually.
Why don't you?
The manager asked me to see if I could help you.
Yes, you could help me.
You could help me.







Help me, sir.
Please come back here into this dark alley.
Further back here into this little closet.
Here into this broom cellar.
All right.
Now take this.
I've noticed.
You're moving me along in this story much too fast.
Oh, look.
Oh, look.
A little girl has come in.
I'm out.
So I'm so.
Act normal.
The makers of new ideas for an old, tired mankind bring you Hitler's hand soap made
from real hands.
And by Tokyo Rojo, the amazing new hair cream that makes you shine like FDR's scars.
Come that man is wearing that from me.
What happened?
What?
Look how he's wearing all that goofy clothes and shoes.
Look, he's got white and brown shoes.
What's wrong with him?
His shoes got like brown in front and white around his side.
Or to try to convince the Taliban to hand over Osama bin Laden.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.








I, all right.
I understand.


Yes you can.
And not to embarrass me.







Are you there?


And Snake seems more satisfied this way.

Hey dude, coming through

In his truck
Pedal stuck to the floor

Everybody gets it right
Later is now
Sooner or later
Everything comes to light
Later is now
Light a gold on the phone
Dish in dirt till it hurts

Nasty vlog, it's a job
Making trouble pays it well
I walked outside
It hit me on the dome
If you don't want trouble
You should stay at home
In the big blue sky
Above the deep old city
I looked up and saw
The man a big and bold
Later is now
Tomorrow is a replay
So tonight
I'll try to sleep
I'll deal with it later
I'll deal with it later
I'll deal with it later
Later is now
Sooner or later
Everything comes to light

Everybody feels the fire
Wasn't this life
Isn't the harvest
Won't this freedom

And my sleep

Later is now, is now, is now, is now, is now, is now
But that was the normal stature.
Well, wait just a second.
For a Palestinian of Christ's era.
Just a second.
Wait a minute.
Just a second, Mr. Plachette, if you might.
I'm only telling you what Mr. Ricci has found as a result of these studies on the shroud.
I think you're reaching for it, personally.
But go ahead.
Well, may I continue?
Continue, sir.
All right.
All right, continue.
Be cogent, please.
I'm being perfectly cogent.
You're the one who's...
Now, he was...
Jesus was a shade under five feet, four inches.
What shade?
And probably weighed...
I'm not going to play games with you.
And probably weighed about 155 pounds.
And that was, as I tried to say before, a normal stature for a Palestinian.
Bull's pizzles.
In Christ's time.
Bull's pizzles.
Well, this is...
That's just the way it is.
Go ahead.
You're young.
You have a great career ahead of you.
Also, Ricci believes that Jesus was beaten while bent over a low pillar by two soldiers
using three-pronged whips tipped with lamb's or dog's bones.
What a bummer.
Which left gaping...
That's our religion, folks.
You did...
Why...
Is this communist here for any particular reason?
Columnist.
Columnist.
I'm sorry.
Go ahead, please.
It's the fifth columnist we've had in here today.
That's right.
The marks from the shroud indicate that Jesus was scourged at least 98 times.
Are you accusing Jesus of being a Marxist, then?
Is that what you're trying to say?
You keep trying to inject politics into this,
and I'm trying to tell you that this is not a political thing.
That's why I object to having this columnist over here.
Now, the bar of the cross...
Sometimes that just has to do that.
...weighed between...
Excuse me.
...between 66 and 88 pounds.
Yeah.
And was tied with a rope to the shoulders, arms, and left ankle.
Now, that caused Jesus to fall over on his face, and he broke his nose.
And this is also indicated in...
Jesus.
Broke his nose?
Yes.
I didn't see that in the Frau Lippo lippy...
No, the Bruno Wald's got it, though.
...in the Cleveland Museum of Art.
Mark on the shroud.
There's a picture of the shroud right here,
which I'd be glad to hold up for your audience.
Go ahead.
Here.
This is...
Look.
Oh, my...
This looks like...
...a plastic bag.
Well, a shroud was like a plastic bag.
They used plastic bags on the Vietnamese dead.
I don't see anything funny about that.
And they quick-freezed them, too.
That just happens to be a fact of life.
Cryogenics me a river, right?
Yes.
Well, I'm not going to go on with this.
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.
That was the Firesign Theater
from their first Radio Hour Hour episode, January 1970.
Available thanks to Reverend Taylor Jessen,
and SealandRecords.com,
who assembled all of the old Firesign Theater radio shows
into a book and disc package called Duke of Madness Motors.
Very few copies are left.
See FiresignTheater.com.
Theater spelled Ritt style.
All radio subgeniuses over 30
owe their very lives to the Firesign Theater,
and as of now, we're going to start repaying them as best we can.
Before that,
Met Devo from their new album,
and before that, some old Hour of Slack 955
with lonesome cowboy Dave.
Now, back to monsters,
as discussed on the 13X Day stage last year.
I look out upon this field of faces,
this huge crowd,
and I think, how many?
How many here?
When they saw that monster movie,
was there a single one here
who was rooting for the humans to kill the monster?
I think not.
I think almost everyone here did the opposite
of what they were meant to do,
and they went,
oh, great, the monster's destroying the town.
I hope he makes it to the next town to destroy that.
At the end, of course, invariably,
at the end of a Hollywood pink movie,
the monster gets killed.
At the end of Independence Day,
which Hollywood released,
on X Day 1996,
at the beginning of our first X Days,
who won?
The humans.
With some foolish computer code
that any alien could see right through in a nanosecond.
How likely is that?
An America online virus
saved the humans from X Day.
Oh, yeah, according to Hollywood.
The one monster movie I've seen
that shows hope
is the Cloverfield Monster,
which is...
At the end of which,
you know that thing's not dead.
All that's left of New York
is the code name Cloverfield,
because there's no way else
to truly describe the horror of what happened.
Yeah, they had to...
That was a movie that ended with hope,
the hope that every human died
and that monsters inherited the earth.
Because are we not those monsters that they fear?
We're not.
Where are the monsters walking among them?
The movie's even more subtle than that, Stan.
Some of us, it's obvious,
like Reverend Skull over there.
You can tell just by looking at him,
he's one of the monsters.
Then there are others
who are a bit more subtle in their monstrosity,
such as the big boss of this area,
Reverend Back It On Up.
You'd never think that she was,
aside from the gigantic cranium,
you'd think she was a human being.
You'd hardly look twice at her.
Well, actually, most people probably,
a lot of guys do.
Yeah, speak for yourself.
Sneak a second look.
But let's not get bogged down in the doctrine here.
We were trying to address the hearts and minds
and glands, really.
Forget the minds.
They're pointless in this church.
But the glands,
the feeling of slack.
Because isn't that what it is?
It's a feeling,
feeling that everything's right.
If your cigarette,
you're a cigarette smoker,
you can only get that feeling with another cigarette.
But if you're a cigarette smoker who's a subgenius,
you got your cigarette and your Dobbs head.
That's ominous music.
A plate of dead insects and cigarette butts.
Not the most appealing meal I've ever seen.
This makes me feel like biting someone on the neck.
Well, I wouldn't give in.
Oh, no wonder it's Dracula music.
Dracula.
Who's Dracula?
Who's Dracula?
Who's Dracula?
Who's Dracula?
Riding little skeletons and guys in capes.
No wolfman, no creature, no mummy, no silly stuff.
He's not just any vampire.
What about a giant 90-pound spider?
Really extra spooky.
Well, yes, there is that feed.
Liches from the graveyard.
So what about Alien versus Dracula 2000?
Now you're talking.
I want to have like War of the Alien Creatures
against War of the Alien Creatures.
I want to have War of the Earthly Creatures
and have all the aliens on one side
and all of the Earth monsters on the other side.
What Earth monsters?
Like Frankenstein and Dracula and all the creatures.
All the famous monsters that didn't come from outer space
versus all the famous monsters that came from outer space.
All of the six-foot-high posters of Frankenstein
that sold for a dollar in the back of the console.

You'd have to have dinosaurs
that would be part of the Earthly Monsters.
But you could have, you know, like the alien.
The alien.
The various aliens.
Maybe to them, you're the monster.
E.T. would be on the monster.
Yeah, like that one.
That ghastly alien with an eyeball
staring out of a massive twisted...
The thing that wouldn't die.
I mean, the crawling eye would be on...
The crawling eye, yeah, right.
That was an invasive monster.
What about mutants?
But the abominable snowman would be on the Earth creature side.
New challenges on War of the Earth.
They'd be on the human's side, really,
or the side that will keep the humans alive.
The side that would be of Earthly origin
versus the side that's a...
Well, what about genetic mishaps?
That's Earthly origin.
They do happen, but with constant vigilance.
They would be on our Earthly origin side,
monster side.
So right now, we have an idea
that's searching for a plot.
If you've got a good plot to go with our idea,
we'd like you to call right now at 510-844-3355.
There's press extension 4
and ask for...
Pull over to the side of the road to pee
and then get out of your car.
Ask for Larry,
the plot point,
and Larry, the plot boy.
Larry, the plot boy,
is waiting for your call right now at...
www.plot.com
And as you stand there...
510-848-4425
...to a rather interesting person...
Call now...
...to this cascade of mail...
And give Larry, the plot boy,
a reason for existence.
He's sitting over there...
...tweeting his phone.
He needs you to call right now.
Larry, the plot boy,
is sitting there wasting your money.
We're paying him to sit there
and answer your call.
Plot boy is...
You know, this just isn't working out puzzling.
I think we're going to have to fire plot boy.
Oh, no.
Already?
He was only hired eight minutes ago.
Well, you do it this time.
I'm tired of being the ax man for this show.
More dead bugs and cigarette butts on the plate
and a dead mouse, too.
If I had a nickel for every plot boy
I fired for this show,
I'd be a millionaire.
I'd be a millionaire.
I'd be a millionaire.
Here's one of the alien creatures
that lives on the planet.
He's tugging at his head like it's in pain.
Ridiculous.
She was terrified
and now she doesn't answer the door
but her car is sitting in the garage.
She was out
or in bed with the flu
or...
Maybe she was abducted by aliens
for all we know.
The alien pees.
In the bushes.
He staggers.
His behavior is erotic.
I'm erratic.
He can't focus.
Yes, he is.
Negative art man.
And that is the mountain from hell.
And the sky of orange in the place of the doomed people.
And there are the plantages that grow on this horrible planet.
And there...
Oh, look!
There is one of the alien creatures that lives on the planet.
He's tugging at his head like it's in pain.
We're lucky to have the benefit of this long-range zoom.
We can zoom...
I'm a hideous, hideous, foul demon.
And he is.
Like some movie, horrible, horrible movie creature.
There he is, just sort of walking.
Yeah, I think they walk.
And then they creep.
Creepily creeping away.
The Star of the East was in the vicinity of the Falkland Islands.
And the look I sighted a large sperm whale three miles away.
Two boats were launched.
And in a short time, one of the harpooners was unable to spear the fish.
The second boat attacked the whale, but was upset by a lash of its tail.
And the men thrown into the sea.
One man being drowned.
And another, James Bartley, having disappeared, could not be found.
Well, the whale was killed.
And in a few hours was lying by the ship's side.
And the crew were busy with axes.
And spades.
Removing the blubber.
Well, they worked all day and part of the night.
Boy, am I tired.
Next morning, you know, they attached some tackle to the stomach.
Which was hoisted up on the deck.
Get off of my stomach.
The sailors were startled by something in it.
Which gave spasmodic signs of life.
Where are my spasms?
And inside was found the mission sailor.
Doubled up.
And unconscious, yes.
He was laid on the deck.
And treated to a bath.
A sea water.
Which soon revived him.
And he remained two weeks a raven lunatic.
But at the end of the third week, he'd entirely recovered from the shock.
And resumed his duty.
Being swallowed by a whale.
That's far out, man.
And didn't die either.
No.
Down in the belly of the whale.
Thank you, Jesus.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Jesus.
That's an amazing story.
It all has to do with the Bible here, isn't it?
Isn't that a great story?

Isn't that beautiful, all right?
I got some stuff up.
This is all in a chapter of, uh, of, uh, book called The Year of the Whale about Jonah.
Mission Control for 201109 has mission completed.
You shall not be able to escape from the realm of the whale.
Push.
Push.
Push.

Push.
Push.
Push.

Push.
