00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,920
Wisdom and tune in again next Sunday at 10 o'clock, and now it's time for the hour of slack.

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,460
Yes, dear friends.

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:11,360
Hey.

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,420
Hey, you over there.

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,560
Want to buy some show?

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,340
Yeah, we got some good show.

7
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,180
Hey, what's the matter?

8
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:24,540
What's the matter, man?

9
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,440
Aren't you into show?

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:29,600
Well, once again, we're here in mono.

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:30,860
Oh, no, we're not.

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,640
If I jiggle this little knob.

13
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:35,480
Stereo.

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:46,840
Well, I wish I could say hello to the young lady who was downstairs as I was coming in here.

15
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,160
She was doing business out on Fitzhugh.

16
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:57,420
I mean, I don't know what she was selling, but she walked up to me like she wanted to sell me something.

17
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,540
But I told her I was in a hurry.

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:00:59,860
It's.

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,820
Too bad.

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,340
But.

21
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:04,600
Oh, yes, dear friends.

22
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:06,880
It's.

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,180
Like I say, we got some show.

24
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:10,640
Got some show.

25
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:14,620
If you want it, you can call up here, but we won't put you on the air.

26
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:15,800
We can't.

27
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,620
It's 823-7490.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,560
I know.

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:28,760
And once again, they've changed the buttons around on everything here, but I bet that if I push this one, we won't explode immediately.

31
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,640
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

32
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,780
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

33
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,520
I have some magic!

34
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,060
No trouble.

35
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,060
Hear me?

36
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:54,760
Recording?

37
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,180
Everything's going fine.

38
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,260
No trouble.

39
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,100
And now you are ready for the final 200,000 mile voyage to the moon.

40
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:09,480
Stop right there.

41
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,820
Intensifying our prospects' desires, and that's when the wheels of action begin to move.

42
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,820
Sorry for jumping in, doctors.

43
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,480
Go on.

44
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:23,920
Dr. Dobbs is known worldwide as a foremost spokesman for Christian and family values.

45
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:27,820
He has a plan to attend this rare personal appearance of Dr. Dobbs.

46
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,980
He's the second in the past four years.

47
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,180
And he's the first in the past 20 years.

48
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,660
And he's the second in the past 20 years.

49
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:43,680
Even if you never intend to write your name again, one sure way to impress folks is to stay a little bit over their heads, because it was better than looking stupid.

50
00:02:43,820 --> 00:02:52,440
It's natural that we followed the circle around and around and around, helping to create a nice round world of confusion and misunderstanding.

51
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:55,520
Resist the temptation to feed your ego.

52
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,960
Well, we take our initiates and we string a little tendon between the two.

53
00:02:59,960 --> 00:02:59,960


54
00:02:59,960 --> 00:02:59,960


55
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,940
And we drag them three times around the radio station before beginning.

56
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:06,680
And then we dip them in the sacred waters of S.L.A.R.C.

57
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,860
And what exactly does this do for them?

58
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:17,220
Well, it causes them to forget everything they've learned, and it prepares their mind for the slate-like impression, the imprinting of the true subgenius.

59
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:23,760
Welcome, dear friends, to the subgenius hour of S.L.A.R.C.

60
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,500
S.L.A.R.C.

61
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:25,140
S.L.A.R.C.

62
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,860
S.L.A.R.C.

63
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:27,400
S.L.A.R.C.

64
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,340
S.L.A.R.C.

65
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:28,940
S.L.A.R.C.

66
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:29,440
S.L.A.R.C.

67
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:49,860
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind.

68
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:55,860
Every time you say, see, hear, or think.

69
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,940
That's your key phrase.

70
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,480
It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

71
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:13,500
Repent. Quit your job. Slack off.

72
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:21,180
Driven to the brink of false sanity by the conspiracy's false reality?

73
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,760
The puncture of a crumbling world.

74
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,160
Then this may be for you.

75
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,240
Eternal salvation.

76
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,040
To triple your money back.

77
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,540
The Church of the Subgenius.

78
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:48,660
Bring you another 33 minutes of condensed, eraglic functions.

79
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,100
Ah, yes.

80
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,580
This is some swinging music.

81
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,640
Thanks, Reverend Byron Werner, for this.

82
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,440
Great album.

83
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:01,300
Space Age.

84
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:01,960
Bachelor Pad.

85
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:08,700
Friends, tonight, for various different reasons, as always, you should listen in headphones

86
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:14,440
because the special interactive holophonic stereo whip-around effects, which will permeate

87
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:15,440
about half the background.

88
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:15,760
Oop.

89
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:16,980
Excuse me.

90
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,800
You never know how many tape decks I may have running on this one, Robert.

91
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:23,800
What?

92
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,100
Oh.

93
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,680
Well, we're cool here, friends.

94
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:29,940
That's all.

95
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:36,240
As I was saying, we've got, uh, there's certain dangers inherent in listening to the Subgenius

96
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,460
Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.

97
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,360
Uh, this music, uh, not necessarily included.

98
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,440
I'm listening to that swinging.

99
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:45,380
Hoo.

100
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:46,140
Yeah.

101
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:53,340
Um, anyway, we, we create special effects with an Ultimac Color Tone Brainwave Synthesizer.

102
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,860
You may have been reading about those lately.

103
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:55,460
They're illegal.

104
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:59,300
Uh, they trigger a total physical separation.

105
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,800
They trigger a total physical separation by stem cleavage of the left and right brains.

106
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,900
Um, that's cerebral mitosis to you science fans.

107
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:12,360
Creating a forebrain-hindbrain sync lock, if you can dig on that.

108
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:14,680
And that's the whole reason for this show to exist.

109
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:20,500
This is a brain disconnection show, which operates on a simple, new, break-thinking principle

110
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:26,660
by which your brainwave patterns are gradually forced into resynchronization with this tape's

111
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,700
underlying messages.

112
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:28,840
And...

113
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:29,780
instructions.

114
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:31,900
So...

115
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,020
What?

116
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:33,340
Oh!

117
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,340
Oh, no, not again.

118
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:36,580
Oh.

119
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,520
A bug of noise whizzing past your ears.

120
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:40,620
So, okay, that's what we do.

121
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:44,260
Let's take the old cotton wad that comes with this station and clean it out.

122
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,320
And cautiously...

123
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,340
You did get a cotton wad with your station?

124
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:49,640
I think it's almost the first of the month.

125
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:53,920
They come every first of the month when they put acid down the hall of the station to

126
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:54,940
make sure they kill it.

127
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,580
Diversionary platforms which might be producing that.

128
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:58,580


129
00:06:58,580 --> 00:06:58,700
Discourse.

130
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:58,720
Discourse.

131
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:58,720


132
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:58,720


133
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:58,720


134
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:58,720


135
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:58,720


136
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:58,720


137
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:58,720


138
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:58,760
Discourse.

139
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,520
That kind of trash.

140
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,980
And there's only one a day, so be very careful where you use that cotton wad.

141
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,720
Salt and mortar.

142
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,420
And now, the noble subgenius knight comes up over the hill and gets ready to slay the

143
00:07:09,420 --> 00:07:10,660
ugly dragon of the conspiracy.

144
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:13,220
See, there it is with the longy eyes.

145
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:15,700
So easy this time.

146
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:20,820
Yeah, you can always tell which one is the right side, which one is the left side of

147
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:21,080
the screen.

148
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:22,640
Practice makes skillful.

149
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,960
Oh, no.

150
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,820
Ugly truth.

151
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:36,600
Well, I guess I'm going to have to spend the day out in Las Colinas today sweeping floors

152
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,780
in a beautiful recording studio to pay the bills.

153
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:40,740
Working for Bob.

154
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,900
That's right.

155
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,020
But there he is now.

156
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:43,320
What Bob was.

157
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,360
Which one's the real Bob?

158
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,760
Which one's the conspiracy Bob?

159
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:48,860
He's been shot.

160
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:54,440
How many times have these callers given up attempting to get on non-radio?

161
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:58,360
Well, Bob was shot again by them.

162
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,400
The Californians.

163
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:02,500
And we don't know what exactly he wants to do now.

164
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,260
Here's a film of that shooting now.

165
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:08,820
Bob, as played by Bob, appears behind the doctors on stage.

166
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,760
Gary Capofram begins shooting.

167
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,280
All right.

168
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,600
God.

169
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,860
If I can.

170
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:13,320
I'll let.

171
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,640
Shooting.

172
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,380
He's shooting this.

173
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:14,860
There.

174
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,480
There.

175
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:15,780
No.

176
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,680
Okay.

177
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,560
Just about.

178
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,880
Light rays of power.

179
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:20,640
There.

180
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:21,800
Oh, friends.

181
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,940
It's more of those air pirates trying to get into the show.

182
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:31,720
All these other shows trying to horn in on the original true hour of slack,

183
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,960
which hasn't existed for nearly as long as some of those other shows.

184
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:40,180
But as I was saying, friends, some other warnings,

185
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:44,640
along with the earplugs that you should have received when you turn the show in.

186
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:52,420
Each subgenius show, by the way, is one note in one great vast Doctors for Bob song.

187
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,080
That's Doctors for Bob are a subgenius band.

188
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,680
And this show is a note in their song.

189
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:01,180
And the crescendo of that song will come at the end of creation.

190
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,940
So do not over medicate yourself with this show.

191
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,380
You should, however, listen more than once.

192
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:17,380
These are complex shows, more carefully orchestrated and more scientifically accurate than any previous form of art or expression in all of mankind's history.

193
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,280
Do not operate heavy, heavy machinery while under the influence of these shows.

194
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:24,680
Car listening is legal.

195
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,000
But not.

196
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,440
Recommended for first time users.

197
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,060
Do not in any way attempt to dance to these tapes or shows.

198
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,120
The demons you see during the initial hallucination sequences are not real.

199
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:38,580
If you become frightened, try not to give up the scene.

200
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,660
No scene on the show lasts any longer than a minute or so.

201
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:47,320
So don't panic during the hell scenes and a surface from the show slowly at the end of the hour,

202
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,220
because coming out of the show is sort of a total rebirth experience.

203
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,620
If you can do it successfully, that is.

204
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:55,060
If you have trouble.

205
00:09:55,060 --> 00:10:06,340
Re-entering the earth plane after this show, focus on Bob and chant his name and then try to remember your own name and chant that for a while and don't eat for a couple of days after the show.

206
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,860
So I think this is going to be.

207
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,240
I love this music.

208
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,660
It's like cartoon music.

209
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:25,040
Well, anyway, I'm as usual, prepared an elaborate subgenius show tonight with all of our tapes and then decided to throw them out.

210
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,140
And instead went through my record collection and pulled out.

211
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:37,360
Songs by other subgeniuses of different cultures to vastly different cultures.

212
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:43,200
Songs against the conspiracy, and that's what the Church of the Subgenius is all about.

213
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,640
Fighting the conspiracy.

214
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,540
And I'm not going to try to define the conspiracy for you.

215
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:54,600
You either know what we're talking about and know it's the truth or else.

216
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:59,820
You're doomed and may fry forever in some before life or afterlife.

217
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,440
But we'll we'll depress you first with the protest songs by ethnic subgeni.

218
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:10,660
And then we'll try to build your mood back up into some semblance of sanity.

219
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,180
But first, a word from our sponsor.

220
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,500
Don't worry about all that.

221
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,040
Lying was.

222
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:19,780
Has this ever happened to you?

223
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,360
Why, I should have been there, Ted.

224
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:22,260
It was great.

225
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,760
There was free booze.

226
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,520
Great music.

227
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,020
One of the best.

228
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,580
One of the best parties I ever went to.

229
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,200
And where were you that night?

230
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:30,380
Oh, I just kind of stayed home and watched TV.

231
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,340
I guess I should have gone, huh?

232
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:34,000
Didn't you feel stupid?

233
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,900
Didn't you wish you could go back to that night, that party?

234
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:40,360
Well, maybe now there's a way to learn how to do that very thing.

235
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:42,620
Introducing Bob's School of Time Control.

236
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:48,220
At Bob's, you'll learn how to speed time, slow time, and make time run backwards.

237
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:48,900
Backwards.

238
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,380
But most importantly, you'll be learning how to make time work for you.

239
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,680
How, you may ask?

240
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,140
Well, just ask this man here, an actual graduate of Bob's School of Time Control.

241
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:01,720
One day, my dog ran out in front of a truck.

242
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:02,500
Blango.

243
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:03,740
My dog was dead.

244
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,700
Was I sad till I met Bob.

245
00:12:05,860 --> 00:12:10,220
Bob showed me how I could go back, get the registration number for the car, do a slip

246
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,980
job on the brakes, and wouldn't you know it, that truck went off into a ditch and burst

247
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,600
into flames just exactly a block before he could hit old Booger.

248
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,400
Ain't that right, fella?

249
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:23,400
Yes, just imagine the horrible things that could be undone tomorrow if you had only gone

250
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,600
to Bob's School of Time Control.

251
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,620
Julia Albalan, Mary Tabby, Amy

252
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,340
Walsher.

253
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:37,180
Hi.

254
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,060
Hi.

255
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:57,260
We had a first cousin called Arthur McBride

256
00:12:57,260 --> 00:13:01,280
He and I took a stroll down by the seaside

257
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,100
A-seeking good fortune and what might betide

258
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,900
T'was just as the day was a-dawnin'

259
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:12,760
Then after restin' we both took a tramp

260
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,760
We met Sergeant Harper and Corporal Cramp

261
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:20,500
Besides the wee drummer who beat up for camp

262
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:23,620
With his rowdy dow-dow in the morning

263
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,360
He says, my young fellows, if you will enlist

264
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:36,240
A guinea you quickly shall have in your fist

265
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,860
Besides a crown for to kick off the dust

266
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,500
And drink the king's health in the morning

267
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,480
Had we been such fools as to take the advance

268
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,760
The wee bit of morn'

269
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,580
Had to run chance

270
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,400
Do you think you'd know scruple to send us to France

271
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,620
Where we would be killed in the morning?

272
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:07,320
He says, my young fellows, if I hear but one word

273
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:11,160
I instantly now will outwit my sword

274
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:15,020
And into your bodies as strength will abhor

275
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,680
So now, my gay devils, take warning!

276
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:20,480
But Arthur McBride said,

277
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,960
Your lord and I, we took him the odds

278
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:27,200
We gave them no chance for to launch out their swords

279
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,920
Our wacky chaleleys came over their heads

280
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:33,940
And paid them right smart in the morning

281
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,720
As for the wee drummer, we rifled his pouch

282
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:46,860
And we made a football of his rowdy dow-dow

283
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,780
And into the ocean

284
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,260
To rock and to roll, and bad at the tea is returning.

285
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:58,540
As for the old rapier that hung by his side,

286
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:02,380
We flung it as far as we could in the tide,

287
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,480
Till the devil wiped its shoes as Adam and Bride,

288
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:09,440
To temper your steel in the morning.

289
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:31,800
¶¶

290
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,200
Oh, yes, dear friends, that was a group,

291
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,760
an iron.

292
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:50,760
An Irish traditional group called Planksteep.

293
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,960
Some listeners to this station may even have heard of them.

294
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,580
They blew my mind at one time in Ireland.

295
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,040
Yeah, whew.

296
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:05,340
That was some of my racial memory going on there,

297
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,820
but we've got lots of others.

298
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:11,200
I wanted to, I cut in to say that somebody was trying to call,

299
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:16,000
and if this, I can't answer the phone when I'm talking or cueing tapes,

300
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,660
and, I mean, we can't put you on anyway,

301
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:24,220
all we can do is kind of deliver a slight amount of healing or slack or hate or something,

302
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,220
as per this church.

303
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,100
But whoever called can hang up and call back again,

304
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:33,320
because right now your call is locked in Jeff's office down the hall,

305
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,580
and we can't get in there.

306
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:40,580
Your conversation is tied up in a room in this poor station.

307
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:44,560
Well, anyway, friends, do you remember the last poets?

308
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,380
Song!

309
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,100
Song!

310
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:53,160
Up, down, on the corner, uptown.

311
00:16:54,420 --> 00:17:00,400
I turned around and hear the sound of voices talking about who's gonna die next.

312
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,000
Cause the white man's got a God complex.

313
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,880
Silent niggas scream for help.

314
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,460
Ah, help me, help me.

315
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,740
Nigga, make your own help.

316
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,920
Shit, you need it.

317
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:18,060
I turn around and hear the sound of jukeboxes playing in bars.

318
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,120
Pimps popped outside in big pretty Cadillac cars.

319
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,200
Cleaned it in a broke dick dog.

320
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,740
Sitting in a big fine hog.

321
00:17:27,260 --> 00:17:30,320
Dressed very fine in a mohair silk vine.

322
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,440
But Jim Dale died next.

323
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,920
Cause the white man's got a God complex.

324
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:39,420
Hey, brother, what's your sport?

325
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,560
My man, I got just the thing for you.

326
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,300
Only cost ten and two.

327
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,940
What you gonna do, baby?

328
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,640
I got black ones, brown ones, red ones, yellow ones.

329
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,700
I even got a white one.

330
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,760
If you wanna buy some.

331
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:51,620
Yeah, that's right.

332
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,020
Two fifty-eight.

333
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,000
Play it straight.

334
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,840
I got it all worked out.

335
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,180
You know what I'm talking about.

336
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,100
Been reading my dream book.

337
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:01,980
Ain't no way in the world a kid gonna get took.

338
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,220
Nigga, what you mean?

339
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:03,960
I didn't hit.

340
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,260
Nigga, you full of shit.

341
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,220
Lick dice.

342
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,340
Uh, now seven.

343
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,520
Come on, be nice and hit eleven.

344
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,720
Well, what do you know?

345
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,560
It's little Joe.

346
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:14,500
Hey, my man got twenty dollars.

347
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:16,160
Say, little Joe don't blow.

348
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,400
Ha, baby needs a pair.

349
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:18,800
Yes, you.

350
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:21,120
Ah, Papa's got the funky blues.

351
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,420
Ah, Mama plays the crossword in the news.

352
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,520
Oh, snake guys.

353
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,280
Sorry, nigga, you lose.

354
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,320
The line forms to the real lady.

355
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,440
And I don't care if you never cash your welfare checks.

356
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:36,900
Cause the white man's got a God complex.

357
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,920
But I got ten babies.

358
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,380
I ain't got no man.

359
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:45,680
I ain't got no choice but to hold out my hand and feed my young ones the best way I can.

360
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,700
Hey, man.

361
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:47,820

362
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,500
Ain't no doubles on blackjack.

363
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,740
Pup, you better change that rule.

364
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,360
Cause I ain't no fool.

365
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,520
You better be cool, Jim, or you'll die next.

366
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,880
Cause the white man's got a God complex.

367
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:04,360
Hey, my man, uh, I wanna cop a nickel bag.

368
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,460
You say, oh, you got a skag.

369
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,520
Wow, that's a drag.

370
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:11,140
Cause, uh, I don't wanna cop no dope is death.

371
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:11,720
Next.

372
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:15,980
Cause the white man's got a God complex.

373
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,320
Hey, baby.

374
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:18,360
You better get out tonight.

375
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:21,220
Well, there's one over at Slick's for faggots and tricks.

376
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:25,300
There's one around graveyard side of town that'll cost you a pound.

377
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:30,560
But if you go and know what I know, you better pack your piece at least or you'll die next.

378
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:35,040
Cause the white man's got a God complex.

379
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:40,020
Mr. Stein, I done paid enough rent for this pad to be mine.

380
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,900

381
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:45,700
Damn, can't you see the place is falling down?

382
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:46,380
No.

383
00:19:46,420 --> 00:19:47,180
You can't dig it.

384
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,360
Cause you ain't never around.

385
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,040
Damn, I'm so poor.

386
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:52,180
I don't know what the hell I'mma do anymore.

387
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,240
Not from this day to the next.

388
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,400

B.I.A.

445
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,620
Boy, folks, this is a tough one.

446
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,380
My headphones are all tangled up in the telephone.

447
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,920
I shouldn't have given anybody the number.

448
00:23:05,980 --> 00:23:06,880
We can't put you on.

449
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,480
I can barely handle this engineering stuff.

450
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,000
So...

451
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,020
Don't call unless you really need a healing.

452
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,780
But we do appreciate hearing from you.

453
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:17,760
Oh, by the...

454
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:20,920
Well, I'm going to get on with this before we go into the subgenius news.

455
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:24,740
This is the next ethnic minority group to be represented.

456
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,820
The Mutants.

457
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,260
Captain Beefheart.

458
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:31,040
Oh, that I just played was Floyd Westerman.

459
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,620
He's a sort of...

460
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,140
He's a Lakota Sioux folk singer from...

461
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,780
I think he's from Rosebud Reservation.

462
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:40,620
And if there's...

463
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,780
Now, here's somebody who can call in.

464
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:46,820
Anybody from Rosebud Reservation in South Dakota, call up.

465
00:23:46,860 --> 00:23:50,500
Because if I know you're out there, I'll play some...

466
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,160
I've got all kinds of stuff from the Crow Dog record,

467
00:23:53,920 --> 00:24:00,620
UEP stuff, various ceremonial deals, and some fancy dance music.

468
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,280
So I used to live out there, believe it or not.

469
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:08,000
Yeah, I've been to all these places these records are from,

470
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:08,880
and that's why I have them.

471
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,140
And I'm afraid I've been here, too.

00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,520
Rotten fruit between my toes

539
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:12,240
In my suit I decompose

540
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:19,080
Standing on my own

541
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:21,720
My flesh comes off the bone

542
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,220
My blood takes away

543
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:27,500
Tells me that I'm saved

544
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:34,660
Nine to five pollution blues

545
00:29:34,660 --> 00:29:37,400
Only got my soul to lose

546
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:40,020
Wish I didn't have to choose

547
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,600
Standing in a dead man's shoes

548
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:01,500
I didn't

549
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:40,000
Soon beyond when I die

550
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,280
Another moment you'll survive

551
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,840
See no future, no escape

552
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,460
Mother nature changing shape

553
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,340
The day that I was born

554
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:03,880
A number of four

555
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,440
Said I'd rise

556
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,820
And must be utilized

557
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,580
Nine to five pollution blues

558
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:19,220
Only got my soul to lose

559
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:21,860
Wish I didn't have to choose

560
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:25,300
Standing in a dead man's shoe

561
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:30,720
In a dead man's shoe

562
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:36,120
In a dead man's shoe

563
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:41,440
In a dead man's shoe

564
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:49,300
This is KNON 90.9

565
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,740
in Dallas, Texas.

566
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,800
You say you're looking for excitement.

567
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,940
I'm not.

568
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:13,260
I'm not.

569
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:13,260


570
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:18,540
Look, isn't this opportunity a real nice place to raise the kids?

571
00:32:19,040 --> 00:32:21,920
Well, explore no more.

572
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:23,800
We're there already.

573
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:27,520
Let's visit the world of the future.

574
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:38,380
World of the future.

575
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:45,180
Yes, this bustling world of a thousand moods reflects the dreams of its ambitious inhabitants,

576
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:49,580
dreams already realized of man's triumph over nature,

577
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,320
where humans no longer suffer self-inflicted pains,

578
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:56,420
where one is made to enjoy life.

579
00:32:56,900 --> 00:33:02,420
All the signs point to serious health damage.

580
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:04,840
There are no winners in a nuclear war.

581
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:06,940
The minute you have another war,

582
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,360
there's not going to be much.

583
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:09,360
There's only one world left, I don't know.

584
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,640
But you're going to blow one another to pieces.

585
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:14,280
And in these times when the world is breathing,

586
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:17,640
all the others find a home.

587
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:19,800
There's not going to be anything left for the kids.

588
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,380
I mean, there's not going to be a world left.

589
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,640
And we're all going to end up digging our own holes.

590
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:27,180
As soon as we dig them, they're going to fall in on us.

591
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,200
I don't think anybody would know what to do.

592
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,060
Even the Australian president.

593
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,840
The only true religion is guns.

594
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,860
The guns will create your own reality.

595
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,360
The only true religion is guns.

596
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:38,360


597
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,940
Not a gun, I can create my own reality.

598
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,640
What is the church's priorities?

599
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,860
What's important to you guys?

600
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,720
Mainly the quest for slack.

601
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,780
The casting out of false prophets.

602
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,820
And controlling time.

603
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:53,200
Those are our three main goals, I guess.

604
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:53,920
Slack.

605
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:56,780
Slack is something we all need.

606
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,680
And I know that lots of people out there

607
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,580
listening right now are feeling

608
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,780
a terrible shortage of slack.

609
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,280
A shortage that can be...

610
00:34:04,280 --> 00:34:05,120
Slack is something you can't get enough of.

611
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:08,240
That's right. That's right. And we can help them to get slack, George.

612
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:08,340
That's right. That's right. And we can help them to get slack, George.

613
00:34:08,340 --> 00:34:08,340


614
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:08,460
That's right. And we can help them to get slack, George.

615
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:11,660
Man, the world is filled with a bunch of

616
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:11,820
Man, the world is filled with a bunch of

617
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:14,980
kooky ideas and concepts about the Bible.

618
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,040


619
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:19,020
And I can't believe the weird things

620
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,140
that people get in their heads and start...

621
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:22,160
that people get in their heads and start...

622
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:24,940
Ashley Bob just uses me as an instrument of death.

623
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:25,000
Ashley Bob just uses me as an instrument of death.

624
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,280
That's what I like about the Word of God.

625
00:34:27,420 --> 00:34:29,360
There's nothing fakey about this thing, man.

626
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:31,580
You talk about telling it like it is.

627
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:35,100
See, it hangs the dirty wash right out the front bay window.

628
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:37,440
For everybody to see.

629
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,860
For everybody to see.

630
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:40,820
Aw fridge, Hey wanna know they got the spirit of fire

631
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:43,820
for entire, whole entire, whole entire day

632
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,860
for entire, whole entire, whole entire day

633
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:46,860


634
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:47,620
It's production stamp

635
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,640
about the word Trump and Trump and Trump

636
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:54,520
and what it's a hell like some facts things going on.

637
00:34:54,700 --> 00:35:01,320
and what it's a hell like some facts things going on.

638
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:06,340
The following program is transcribed in Spanish for our Latin listening audience.

639
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:34,120
A big house and a cheap education?

640
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:40,020
Do you want to change your luck or take advantage of your business?

641
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:47,740
Friends, you can have those things and much, much more easily.

642
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:49,480
I'm going to explain.

643
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:53,240
Do you know JR Bob Dogs?

644
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:57,420
Are you informed with the Church of the Subgenius?

645
00:35:58,180 --> 00:35:58,940
I thought not.

646
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,700
Only Bob! He's the same Bob!

647
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,900
And Bob does not change!

648
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,860
And Bob does not stop changing!

649
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:12,160
He come on down!

650
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:13,480
Yes?

651
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,580
These humans will not wake up.

652
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:24,560
Only the return of Jesus or intervention by some cosmic superintelligence can save us now.

653
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,900
And only Bob can bring about either one properly.

654
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:30,940
But if you don't want to boil your brains,

655
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:31,300
and you don't want to be a man,

656
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:31,300


657
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:31,480
or if you want to be a man,

658
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:35,520
then you've got to be a zombie business corridors of empty pinkness or grinding poverty.

659
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,600
If you don't want to feel the meat cook off your bones in a nuclear oven that was once your hometown,

660
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:45,520
you'd better drop your mental candy bars and step out under the blinding light of the sun

661
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,260
and make witness to what you really are.

662
00:36:47,660 --> 00:36:50,440
Yes, you'd better be ready to jump.

663
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,140
Probably econocataclism.

664
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:56,240
Those of you who know how to climb up a conspiracy job tree

665
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:59,680
had better know how to climb back down again.

666
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:01,220
You're going to be stuck.

667
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,940
up there when the heat rises.

668
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,980
Look around you.

669
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,340
The signs

670
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:08,100
are everywhere.

671
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,020
The American social

672
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:12,800
patterns have already gone

673
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:14,140
way too far.

674
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,040
The family is all broken

675
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:19,320
apart. Morals

676
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,060
have degenerated into a

677
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:23,260
venereal TV swamp.

678
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:25,280
Drug abuse

679
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,100
and perverted

680
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:28,940
sex are taught

681
00:37:28,940 --> 00:37:30,900
in schools just

682
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,940
like the Roman Empire before it fell.

683
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:36,900
Collapse is nearly total now.

684
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:38,760
It may become

685
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,580
in the final few years

686
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:42,760
we'll mutilate our children

687
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:44,820
beyond our wildest

688
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:45,500
nightmares.

689
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,240
Yes, it's everywhere.

690
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,540
The money changers,

691
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,820
the beast, the masters

692
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:55,000
of pink, purveyors

693
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,080
of all that is sheepish and soft

694
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,780
in the world, they're just setting

695
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:00,400
us up for a massive

696
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:01,900
1984

697
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:03,700
white

698
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,420
wee resurgence, which in turn

699
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,060
allows the great witch burning.

700
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,360
Look, there, we already have demon

701
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:11,780
infiltrated normalcy

702
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:13,860
shock troops

703
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:16,100
going by the hellishly ironic

704
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,980
name of moral majority.

705
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,220
Good God,

706
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,000
are these supposed to be Christians?

707
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,320
They've got Jesus

708
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,720
and the devil all mixed up.

709
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,920
Make

710
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,280
no mistake,

711
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
some genius foundation is with

712
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,260
Jesus, the fighting

713
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,100
Jesus, not some

714
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,140
long-haired mush mouth.

715
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,460
We're with Brother Roloff

716
00:38:41,460 --> 00:38:43,200
and free enterprise in America.

717
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,480
We're no communist tools of

718
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:45,800
Satan.

719
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:51,360
Who are they winning souls for,

720
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,320
Satan or Jesus?

721
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:54,540
Beware of false prophets.

722
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,620
That is the main warning that

723
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:58,440
Bob is getting out. You're going to be

724
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:00,260
seeing more and more of these people,

725
00:39:00,400 --> 00:39:02,500
who claim to be Jesus, come again, for instance.

726
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:04,640
We know of ten people right off hand

727
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,420
here in the United States that claim to be

728
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,320
Jesus right now, and they all

729
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,780
have tremendous number of followers.

730
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,560
Now, we believe that there can't be more than one

731
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,540
Jesus at any one time,

732
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,420
so even if one of them was the real one,

733
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:17,980
there's nine of them that aren't.

734
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,640
All we want people to know is that there's a lot

735
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,460
of people out there that are going to try to get you

736
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:24,340
to believe what they want you to believe.

737
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,500
You think we're trying to get money out of you.

738
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,520
You ought to see how some of these guys with the

739
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,200
new Messiah,

740
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:32,760
they're trying to get all your worldly goods.

741
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:33,140
Sure.

742
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,500
If you send us enough money, we'll send you the whole

743
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:38,060
church, and you can deal with it instead of us.

744
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:39,480
Okay, well,

745
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:41,920
after I do that, what are you going to do for me?

746
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:42,820
Slack.

747
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,480
Quite enough of that

748
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,240
depressing fare.

749
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,720
Hello, and welcome to Happyland.

750
00:39:50,300 --> 00:39:52,360
The people here in Happyland are very

751
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:52,680
calm.

752
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:56,040
And the drugs are very effective.

753
00:39:57,040 --> 00:39:58,340
Nonsense may be heard over

754
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:00,300
our PA system, and as we

755
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,800
walk toward Happyland's gates,

756
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:04,920
let us remind you of no pushing,

757
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,240
no sharp objects, and no writing

758
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,200
to your favorite home. Thank you.

759
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,280
This is a crook

760
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,440
at her first night.

761
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:14,580
I feel to wear it.

762
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,300
There's nothing less graceful than an

763
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,080
angry spud.

764
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:26,720
This is some rare Devo.

765
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:28,700
Bootleg Devo.

766
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:57,120
Bootleg Devo.

767
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,920
Naughtyajev novikievskoy,

768
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,740
Oh, trouble's coming.

769
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,820
No one's going

770
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,440
You are not fighting

771
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,720
here

772
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,520
There's a curfew

773
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:14,520


774
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:14,520


775
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:14,520


776
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:15,100
to war

777
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:15,160
Laughing

778
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,140
lying

779
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:16,840
mad

780
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:17,420
Laughing

781
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:18,180
rational

782
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,040
No more

783
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,620
grumbling

784
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:22,580
Edwards

785
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:37,560
Thank you.

786
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:19,140
Thank you.

787
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:36,260
Thank you.

788
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:57,180
Thank you.

789
00:42:57,180 --> 00:43:02,920
Thank you.

790
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,680
Well, as some of, as a few sub-geni know,

791
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,280
old Mark Mothersbaugh, Reverend Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo,

792
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:25,440
is also a born-again sub-genius.

793
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:29,260
And it's funny how the circle comes and goes.

794
00:43:29,360 --> 00:43:32,840
That song was probably being done about the same time as we wrote our pamphlet.

795
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:39,080
And a couple of months ago, when we were doing our devivals,

796
00:43:39,180 --> 00:43:43,020
Buck and I were out with Doctors for Bob and the Pope of New York

797
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:46,280
and the band Dare Not Speak Its Name doing sub-genius revivals

798
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:50,300
up and down the Pink Coast, the West Coast, Seattle, San Francisco, and L.A.

799
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,040
And there we met.

800
00:43:52,580 --> 00:43:55,880
And all kinds of strange weirdos.

801
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:57,860
And Nina Hagen.

802
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,120
Oh, yeah, Buck saw Nina Hagen and thought it was just a punkette

803
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:03,940
dressed up as Nina Hagen.

804
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,660
And went up and said, you look like Nina Hagen.

805
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,120
And she said, my name is no name.

806
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:13,000
So she said, yes, I know Nina very well.

807
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:15,480
So let's see.

808
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:21,880
Anyway, what I was getting to is Mark introduced me to a young lady named Nancy Ferguson,

809
00:44:21,880 --> 00:44:26,440
a younger generation of rock and roller.

810
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:27,560
I mean, real younger.

811
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:32,280
This is a song called Drop Me Off at the Galleria by Visiting Kids.

812
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:36,780
This song, I think, illustrates what's wrong with the world today.

813
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:43,640
It's done by a group of, well, Nancy's probably in her 20s,

814
00:44:43,640 --> 00:44:47,860
but the rest of the singers are little bitty kiddos.

815
00:44:48,120 --> 00:44:51,680
They're like 10 to 12 years old, something like that.

816
00:44:51,700 --> 00:44:51,860
Yeah.

817
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:52,940
This is Visiting Kids.

818
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:57,680
And after that, we'll play the Wallman's version of The Shopping Mall Life,

819
00:44:57,900 --> 00:45:02,100
followed by Negative Land's version of The Shopping Mall Life.

820
00:45:02,420 --> 00:45:04,100
What a life, friends.

821
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:09,360
He was 14, a little older than 13.

822
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:16,260
He was in eighth grade, and he made me go crazy.

823
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:27,340
After school, he asked me if it was cool

824
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:34,080
if he could take me to go shopping.

825
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:37,880
His mom drove a K-car.

826
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:41,320
It was far, I thought.

827
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:47,700
I started to blink a lot and sweat a lot, and I said,

828
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,820
Drop me off.

829
00:45:51,820 --> 00:45:53,560
Drop me off at the Galleria.

830
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,220
Drop me off at the Galleria.

831
00:45:58,020 --> 00:46:01,880
I couldn't stand this guy or his mother.

832
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,520
Oh, brother.

833
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:04,420
Oh, brother.

834
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:07,640
Drop me off at the Galleria.

835
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:11,140
Drop me off at the Galleria.

836
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,480
Drop me off on the San Diego freeway.

837
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:17,600
Oh, drop me off.

838
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,000
Drop me off at the Galleria.

839
00:46:30,000 --> 00:46:32,500
Drop me off at the Galleria.

840
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:34,640
Drop me off at the Galleria.

841
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:34,980
Drop me off at the Galleria.

842
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,180
Drop me off at the Galleria.

843
00:46:36,180 --> 00:46:40,860
After school, he asked me if it was cool

844
00:46:40,860 --> 00:46:47,580
if he could take me to go shopping.

845
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,120
His mom drove a K-car.

846
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:54,600
It was far, he thought.

847
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:00,880
I started to blink a lot and sweat a lot, and I said,

848
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:06,760
Drop me off at the Galleria.

849
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,220
Drop me off at the Galleria.

850
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:15,320
I couldn't stand this guy or his mother.

851
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,460
Oh, brother.

852
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:17,340
Oh, brother.

853
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,620
Drop me off at the Galleria.

854
00:47:21,220 --> 00:47:23,560
Drop me off at the Galleria.

855
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:24,180
Drop me off at the Galleria.

856
00:47:24,720 --> 00:47:28,620
Drop me off on the San Diego freeway.

857
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:30,660
Oh, drop me off.

858
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,880
I just got a guy in his car.

859
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,720
He was funny clothes.

860
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,720
He was freckles.

861
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,580
I want to go to the Galleria.

862
00:47:39,780 --> 00:47:41,540
Maybe see a movie or something.

863
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:42,820
Buy new clothes.

864
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,900
I just want to be drunk.

865
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,080
Please drop me off at the Galleria.

866
00:47:48,940 --> 00:47:49,960
Drop me off.

867
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:50,600
Drop me off at the Galleria.

868
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:50,600


869
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:50,600


870
00:47:50,620 --> 00:47:50,880
Drop my off.

871
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:51,680
Drop me off.

872
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,460
Drop me off.

873
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,340
Drop me off.

874
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,240
Drop me off.

875
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:55,900
Drop me off.

876
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:56,800
Drop me off.

877
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:57,600
Drop me off.

878
00:47:57,700 --> 00:47:58,440
Drop me off.

879
00:47:58,500 --> 00:47:59,340
Drop me off.

880
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:00,240
Drop me off.

881
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,040
Drop me off.

882
00:48:01,060 --> 00:48:01,920
Drop me off.

883
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:02,740
Drop me off.

884
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:03,620
Drop me off.

885
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:03,700
Drop me off.

886
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:04,440
Drop me off.

887
00:48:04,460 --> 00:48:04,520
Drop me off.

888
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:04,520


889
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:04,520


890
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:05,180
Drop me off.

891
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:05,460
Drop me off.

892
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:05,720
Drop me off.

893
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:05,720


894
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:05,720


895
00:48:05,720 --> 00:48:06,080
Drop me off.

896
00:48:06,220 --> 00:48:06,740
Drop me off.

897
00:48:06,740 --> 00:48:06,920
Drop me off.

898
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:19,640
Drop me off.

899
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,580
on any other radio station around here because that's not on a record.

900
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,900
Most of the stuff we play, there isn't on records.

901
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:29,520
Like this next one by the Wall Men.

902
00:48:29,660 --> 00:48:34,800
This is the other side of the shopping mall world that has created the...

903
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,180
Anyway, this is the Wall Men.

904
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,100
Yeah, the Wall Men.

905
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:41,220
They're a lot like Doctors for Wotan,

906
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,660
one of the first Doctors for Bob copy bands in the subgenius church.

907
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,640
These guys are from Syracuse, New York,

908
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:52,600
and they're depressed because they're the people who are working in the malls.

909
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:20,680
Here we go.

910
00:49:44,660 --> 00:49:45,120
Here we go.

911
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:47,660
Here we go.

912
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:49,540
Here we go.

913
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,880
Because you have been faithful in prayer,

914
00:49:54,560 --> 00:49:56,260
faithful in the reading of the word,

915
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:59,780
and because you have not forsaken the house of God,

916
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:04,440
you have overcome the tempter and gained the crown of eternal life.

917
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:09,040
For this I say, well done, thou good and faithful servant.

918
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:12,060
Enter thou into the joys of thy Lord.

919
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,500
Praise God.

920
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,380
I made it.

921
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,440
I finally made it.

922
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:16,000
Did you hear?

923
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,020
I finally made it.

924
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,000
Glory to God.

925
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,340
Oh, I thank you, Lord, for thy mercy.

926
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:21,460
I thank you, Lord.

927
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,560
Blessed be thy name.

928
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:23,680
Oh, I love you, Jesus.

929
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,860
I thank you, Lord.

930
00:50:25,300 --> 00:50:25,780
Hallelujah.

931
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:26,960
Glory to God.

932
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:27,740
I made it.

933
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:28,260
I made it.

934
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,640
Hallelujah.

935
00:50:29,080 --> 00:50:30,100
Praise God.

936
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,100
All right, see, folks, it works out okay for some people.

937
00:50:33,820 --> 00:50:35,280
But then there's others.

938
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:38,420
This is Doctors for Bob's version of Hell.

939
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,400
This song introduces a new genre in country and western music.

940
00:50:44,660 --> 00:50:46,500
We call it Gosp Hell.

941
00:50:46,580 --> 00:50:50,520
It's gospel music for people who know they're going to hell anyway.

942
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,580
It's a little thing called Legs of Fire.

943
00:50:54,140 --> 00:50:55,080
Let's roll.

944
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:55,420
Okay.

945
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:07,960
Well, I thought I could get away with saunter on our wedding day.

946
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:12,800
Preacher man said, boy, better put away your song.

947
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:14,480
But I said, I don't.

948
00:51:14,660 --> 00:51:17,020
Cotton to no God's county law.

949
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,400
But that song was stolen.

950
00:51:19,540 --> 00:51:21,460
At least that's what they said.

951
00:51:21,700 --> 00:51:25,920
So I wrapped up in asbestos from my waist up to my head.

952
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:30,680
I wrapped up in asbestos that I got from Greg's.

953
00:51:30,780 --> 00:51:34,820
I only wish I had enough to cover up my legs.

954
00:51:34,860 --> 00:51:37,000
So I've been sinning, sinning, sinning.

955
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,100
But I ain't no liar.

956
00:51:39,460 --> 00:51:41,180
I'm burning, burning, burning.

957
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:43,480
I got legs, I got legs, I got legs of fire.

958
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:46,760
Oh, my head's dry and cool.

959
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:48,920
So's my arms and tool.

960
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:52,340
My torso, even more so.

961
00:51:52,700 --> 00:51:54,960
But I ain't no liar.

962
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:57,100
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

963
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:59,440
I got legs, I got legs, I got legs of fire.

964
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:04,620
Well, I was selling heroin at the elementary school.

965
00:52:05,120 --> 00:52:08,820
Preacher man said, boy, you know that isn't cool.

966
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:13,320
The good Lord come to me and said my time was up.

967
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:17,680
When I asked why God, he said because that horse was cut.

968
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,980
They were shooting up in the bathroom.

969
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:21,920
Yes, you know it's true.

970
00:52:22,420 --> 00:52:26,340
But they were not getting off until my soul was through.

971
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,600
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning.

972
00:52:28,720 --> 00:52:30,580
But I ain't no liar.

973
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,720
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

974
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,000
I got legs, I got legs, I got legs of fire.

975
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,320
Oh, my brain ain't in no flame.

976
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:40,460
And my shoulder ain't in pain.

977
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:42,100
But my toes.

978
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,560
Need a hose.

979
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,220
But I ain't no liar.

980
00:52:46,540 --> 00:52:48,420
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

981
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:50,680
I got legs, I got legs, I got legs of fire.

982
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:56,060
Well, I was stealing cars for God to try to get in well.

983
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:00,480
But when my judgment came, he said you'll have to go to hell.

984
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,020
It's true I gave my son, he said, to pay for all your sins.

985
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:09,360
But when you brought me that limo, Jane, or the door was dented in.

986
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:11,740
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning.

987
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:13,720
But I ain't no liar.

988
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,880
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

989
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,140
I got legs, I got legs, I got legs of fire.

990
00:53:19,140 --> 00:53:21,420
Oh, my head ain't on the line.

991
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,460
And my arm is doing fine.

992
00:53:23,780 --> 00:53:26,580
But my knees are trying please.

993
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:29,300
But I ain't no liar.

994
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,440
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

995
00:53:31,580 --> 00:53:33,720
I got legs, I got legs, I got legs of fire.

996
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:39,300
Well, I was bashing grandma's head with a railroad tie.

997
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,680
Good Lord, come to me.

998
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,620
And said, why did you lie?

999
00:53:44,180 --> 00:53:45,760
When I said, what lie?

1000
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,980
God, he said, you must confess.

1001
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:50,760
That ain't your grandma's head at all.

1002
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:52,360
It's just a bloody mess.

1003
00:53:52,620 --> 00:53:54,720
Oh, I've been sinning, sinning, sinning.

1004
00:53:54,820 --> 00:53:56,820
But I ain't no liar.

1005
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:59,180
Now I'm burning, burning, burning.

1006
00:53:59,220 --> 00:54:01,560
I got legs, I got legs, I got legs of fire.

1007
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:05,840
Yeah.

1008
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:22,260
That's too bad that I don't own that mystery.

1009
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,880
They call it a download, guys.

1010
00:54:25,560 --> 00:54:26,020
No, I'll change it toion top.

1011
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:26,020


1012
00:54:26,020 --> 00:54:26,460
At first, stop wanting to listen to it.

1013
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:26,460


1014
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:26,640
Leave it to yourself.

1015
00:54:26,640 --> 00:54:26,640


1016
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:32,000
No shame, this is your promo.

1017
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:32,000


1018
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:32,900
We need to be happy with our money.

1019
00:54:32,900 --> 00:54:33,740
I don't know how I'm ever going to get it why

1020
00:54:33,740 --> 00:54:34,320
I get it wrong.

1021
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,380
But I earned $300.

1022
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:40,960
Did you know that I never bought a Poker Robo?

1023
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:41,660
It's a crack pot.

1024
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:46,500
After all, it should be every person's choice to curse God and die if that is what they wish.

1025
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,800
We all have the right to spit in the eye of the collective gods, did we not create them?

1026
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:55,140
Where indeed would Yahweh own be without the human race to torment and pester?

1027
00:54:55,820 --> 00:54:59,820
I'll put it to you, the old chiseler would be pretty damn bored with it all

1028
00:54:59,820 --> 00:55:05,440
if there was nothing more entertaining than sherbins and seraphims and numby-pumby flaming angels

1029
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:10,460
sitting around up there on damp clouds and arcing and trumpeting all 24 hours a bloody day

1030
00:55:10,460 --> 00:55:11,600
and you can fuck all that.

1031
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,740
Uh, what did you say, Bob?

1032
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:18,980
I said good Lord, what's to lose?

1033
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,380
A little time?

1034
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:22,620
Hurt your ego a little bit, baby?

1035
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:28,480
You've probably got time you're wasting on Mickey Mouse stuff now, so that's no big deal.

1036
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,540
So why not?

1037
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:32,220
So why not?

1038
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,480
Why not make a new beginning in your life and see what'll happen?

1039
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:36,360
I don't know.

1040
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,560
You don't know.

1041
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:39,980
And you will never know.

1042
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:42,840
You have signed the application.

1043
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:45,180
You do have the kit.

1044
00:55:46,900 --> 00:55:48,560
None of those things are important.

1045
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,500
But there is a point in your life when you've got to just stop talking about it

1046
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,880
and you've got to stop worrying about what your friends and neighbors and relatives

1047
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,140
and uncles and aunts and sisters and brothers and everybody else is going to say about it.

1048
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:02,900
Because nobody else is going to pay your bills for you.

1049
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:03,760
Why not?

1050
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:04,920
You don't know.

1051
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,320
And you will never know.

1052
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:10,280
And who knows?

1053
00:56:10,460 --> 00:56:11,020
Just maybe.

1054
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:16,460
Just maybe.

1055
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,840
You could air one of the biggest...

1056
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,440
I don't know.

1057
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:30,460
But even more important, you don't know.

1058
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,140
And you will never know.

1059
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:38,540
You will never know.

1060
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:42,240
You will never know.

1061
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:42,560
Just maybe.

1062
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,100
You're in for a new and exciting experience.

1063
00:56:47,900 --> 00:56:49,660
You have signed the application.

1064
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:54,360
Well, have you got your pipe through the mail?

1065
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,220
Or are you going to write in and get your pipe?

1066
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:57,620
I'm still waiting for the cast.

1067
00:56:57,900 --> 00:56:58,760
The cast?

1068
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:00,680
Well, the cast is all here, unfortunately.

1069
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,340
They'll be outside your house to sing a song about 8 o'clock this morning.

1070
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:05,980
Actually, we're expecting Vic Moore.

1071
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:10,040
Oh, well, friends, that was that last little piece you heard there.

1072
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:10,720
On the...

1073
00:57:10,720 --> 00:57:11,440
Ooh.

1074
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:14,460
Good thing I punched the tabs out of that cassette.

1075
00:57:14,560 --> 00:57:15,460
I would have erased it.

1076
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,860
That was put together by Puzzling Evidence.

1077
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,340
The original Puzzling Evidence.

1078
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:21,060
Not the Puzzling Evidence that you'll...

1079
00:57:21,060 --> 00:57:24,260
That David Byrne's group will sing about in the song they...

1080
00:57:24,260 --> 00:57:26,280
In the movie they filmed around here.

1081
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,040
They got that Puzzling Evidence from our Puzzling Evidence.

1082
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:31,020
But, uh...

1083
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:31,840
Let's see.

1084
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:32,840
What have we?

1085
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,720
What have we?

1086
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:34,560
What have we?

1087
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:37,000
Slim Whitman.

1088
00:57:37,080 --> 00:57:37,440
No.

1089
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:38,020
No.

1090
00:57:38,080 --> 00:57:39,760
It ain't Slim Whitman.

1091
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:40,020
It's...

1092
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,320
Ooh.

1093
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,020
Wow.

1094
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:42,500
Wow.

1095
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,660
Listen to that, friends.

1096
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:45,220
It's negative land.

1097
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:45,720
Yeah.

1098
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:48,220
Let's get 10-4 first.

1099
00:57:48,700 --> 00:57:50,940
I guess I'm gonna have to start jamming mobile.

1100
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:52,480
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

1101
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,660
I guess I should start jamming you guys.

1102
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:57,860
All right, people.

1103
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:02,200
It's almost time for us to be 10-8.

1104
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,760
In just a few moments,

1105
00:58:06,940 --> 00:58:08,640
we're gonna be 10-8,

1106
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,020
and I'm...

1107
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:14,340
I'm going to tell you the story of 180 and the letter G.

1108
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,060
All right, people.

1109
00:58:17,820 --> 00:58:19,320
It's almost time for us to be...

1110
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:21,960
We're almost to that moment right now, people.

1111
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:24,600
In just a few moments, we're gonna be 10-8.

1112
00:58:24,940 --> 00:58:30,580
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

1113
00:58:31,860 --> 00:58:32,520
Hmm.

1114
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:33,360
Hmm.

1115
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:36,560
Hmm.

1116
00:58:36,700 --> 00:58:36,700


1117
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:38,060
Hmm.

1118
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:38,900
Hmm.

1119
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:38,900


1120
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:39,900
Hmm.

1121
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:39,960


1122
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:40,020


1123
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:40,020


1124
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:40,020


1125
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:40,020


1126
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:40,020


1127
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:40,020


1128
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:40,020


1129
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:42,660
I am a man

1130
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:46,020
A man with four fingers

1131
00:58:46,020 --> 00:58:50,860
A man with four fingers on my hand

1132
00:58:53,260 --> 00:58:55,580
I am a man

1133
00:58:55,580 --> 00:58:58,940
A man with four fingers

1134
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:01,660
Oh, yes, dear friends.

1135
00:59:02,680 --> 00:59:03,980
I'll tell you what.

1136
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,100
I promise I'm gonna play

1137
00:59:05,100 --> 00:59:08,740
the negative land and special effects editing

1138
00:59:08,740 --> 00:59:09,280
song that I'm gonna be playing.

1139
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,020
I'm gonna play the negative land and special effects editing song that I'm gonna be playing.

1140
00:59:10,020 --> 00:59:11,840
sound effects show, an incredible

1141
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:12,840
narrated show

1142
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:14,760
next week.

1143
00:59:16,040 --> 00:59:18,000
We'll go heavy on sound effects,

1144
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:20,000
so be ready with

1145
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,580
your tape decks and your headphones.

1146
00:59:23,060 --> 00:59:23,660
This

1147
00:59:23,660 --> 00:59:25,660
Negative Land album is literally

1148
00:59:25,660 --> 00:59:27,340
just unbelievable.

1149
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,540
Anyway, and it was unbelievable

1150
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,820
today. It's the reason we've got

1151
00:59:31,820 --> 00:59:33,700
such a disorganized show, because

1152
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,860
this is a disorganized religion, and we were

1153
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:37,780
mailing out the new

1154
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,380
subgenius pamphlets

1155
00:59:39,380 --> 00:59:41,220
today. Oh, yes,

1156
00:59:41,420 --> 00:59:43,480
it's beautiful. You should have seen

1157
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,400
the warehouse. This is pamphlet number two,

1158
00:59:45,420 --> 00:59:47,600
and all you members in Dallas, you $20

1159
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,260
subgenius members, you believers

1160
00:59:49,260 --> 00:59:51,380
and bobbies and gimme bobs and so

1161
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,300
forth will get this pamphlet soon,

1162
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,400
because you should have seen the warehouse today.

1163
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,440
We had all the zombies wired

1164
00:59:57,440 --> 00:59:58,020
up.

1165
00:59:59,740 --> 01:00:01,400
65 zombies, Smith's

1166
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,640
zombies. They're all named Smith, every one of them.

1167
01:00:03,660 --> 01:00:05,780
Not me. I'm Reverend Stang.

1168
01:00:06,100 --> 01:00:07,580
But these were the other

1169
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,220
Smiths, the clone

1170
01:00:09,220 --> 01:00:11,400
Smiths. They were all wired and yoked in

1171
01:00:11,400 --> 01:00:13,140
sequence, having to hand sort

1172
01:00:13,140 --> 01:00:15,400
49,000 pamphlets by zip

1173
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:17,480
code. These subgenius

1174
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,360
church pamphlets are to be airdropped

1175
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,460
into foreign countries where

1176
01:00:21,460 --> 01:00:23,620
there's no slack.

1177
01:00:24,540 --> 01:00:24,880
For instance,

1178
01:00:25,060 --> 01:00:27,240
Galapagos sea turtles are used

1179
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:29,500
to carry the pamphlets strapped to their

1180
01:00:29,500 --> 01:00:30,760
back into

1181
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:33,340
the shores of Red China.

1182
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,060
Whales

1183
01:00:35,060 --> 01:00:37,460
have been force-fed pamphlets.

1184
01:00:37,580 --> 01:00:39,040
I mean, these zombies are hard at work.

1185
01:00:39,140 --> 01:00:41,440
We force-feed the pamphlets to these

1186
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,600
whales, which then swim to Russia

1187
01:00:43,600 --> 01:00:45,460
and South Africa and other

1188
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:47,440
slackless places and beach

1189
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:49,360
themselves. They actually commit suicide

1190
01:00:49,360 --> 01:00:51,200
for Bob by beaching themselves

1191
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,160
and disengorging

1192
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:55,120
those hundreds and thousands,

1193
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,480
49,000 subgenius

1194
01:00:57,480 --> 01:00:59,260
pamphlets, so that those

1195
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:01,340
red commies can read about

1196
01:01:01,340 --> 01:01:03,420
the world of slack and revolt against

1197
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:04,840
their masters, and so that

1198
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:07,320
all the slackless

1199
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,020
people in all the slackless lands

1200
01:01:09,020 --> 01:01:10,580
where there's too many of

1201
01:01:11,540 --> 01:01:13,400
those who don't

1202
01:01:13,400 --> 01:01:15,060
have enough. And you know, too much is always

1203
01:01:15,060 --> 01:01:17,080
better than not enough. Bob said that.

1204
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,460
Bob always says that.

1205
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:20,180
A man with no fingers

1206
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:23,300
A man with no fingers

1207
01:01:23,300 --> 01:01:25,040
on my hand

1208
01:01:27,540 --> 01:01:29,500
I am a man

1209
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:31,060
A man

1210
01:01:31,660 --> 01:01:32,720
with no fingers

1211
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,140
A dad

1212
01:01:35,820 --> 01:01:37,040
Well, that

1213
01:01:37,320 --> 01:01:39,120
doesn't count my ring finger, my middle

1214
01:01:39,120 --> 01:01:40,560
finger, my index finger,

1215
01:01:41,480 --> 01:01:42,520
or my...

1216
01:01:42,520 --> 01:01:44,660
Ah, yes.

1217
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:47,220
Dear friends, if you want to write for information

1218
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:48,760
to the Church of the Subgenius, that's

1219
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:51,320
P.O. Box 140306

1220
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:52,960
Dallas,

1221
01:01:53,220 --> 01:01:55,600
Texas, 75214.

1222
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:56,420
And we need those

1223
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,020
dispensations from you, those love

1224
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:01,200
offerings. Once again,

1225
01:02:01,260 --> 01:02:03,260
that's Church of the Subgenius, P.O. Box

1226
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:07,300
140306.

1227
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,720
Dallas, Texas,

1228
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:12,660
75214.

1229
01:02:12,800 --> 01:02:13,840
Write for information

1230
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:16,660
about all the books and pamphlets.

1231
01:02:16,700 --> 01:02:18,680
We're not kidding about these pamphlets and tapes.

1232
01:02:18,820 --> 01:02:20,700
We sell the tapes. We can tell

1233
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:22,700
you where we got the

1234
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:24,820
songs we play because you can't

1235
01:02:24,820 --> 01:02:26,660
get them in stores. And this one

1236
01:02:26,660 --> 01:02:28,000
right here, as a matter of fact...

1237
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,260
You hear this?

1238
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:32,360
This is...

1239
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:34,580
This was

1240
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,540
performed by Mark

1241
01:02:36,540 --> 01:02:37,120
Mothersbaugh.

1242
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,740
Believe it or not, we've been playing it all this time

1243
01:02:39,740 --> 01:02:41,500
and you thought it was just some subgenius.

1244
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:42,280
Ha ha.

1245
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:44,060
Ha ha.

1246
01:02:44,180 --> 01:02:44,740
Ha ha.

1247
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:45,280


1248
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:48,040
America

1249
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:52,140
you invite the

1250
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:53,840
red man to sit

1251
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:55,460
at your table

1252
01:02:55,460 --> 01:02:57,860
and be your guest

1253
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:59,440
to justify

1254
01:03:00,540 --> 01:03:02,180
the guilt that

1255
01:03:02,180 --> 01:03:03,380
you are feeling.

1256
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:05,840
Now you tell us that

1257
01:03:05,840 --> 01:03:08,480
you like us the best

1258
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:09,860
and a black

1259
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:11,120
man

1260
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,080
waiting on the sidelines

1261
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,340
for the chance

1262
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:18,900
to get into your game

1263
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:20,280
to show

1264
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,620
you that

1265
01:03:21,620 --> 01:03:24,660
he's just as good as you are

1266
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:26,900
to prove to you

1267
01:03:26,900 --> 01:03:28,780
that he can be

1268
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:29,440
the same

1269
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:31,440
and the triangle

1270
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,720
that you have created

1271
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:35,820
is the triangle that you have created

1272
01:03:35,820 --> 01:03:35,960
and the triangle that you have created

1273
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,280
keeps you by yourself

1274
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:39,600
and keeps you paranoid

1275
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:42,620
for the red, white

1276
01:03:42,620 --> 01:03:45,280
and blue that you keep flying

1277
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:47,840
for the red, white

1278
01:03:47,840 --> 01:03:50,260
and black that you avoid

1279
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,980
cause the red man

1280
01:03:53,820 --> 01:03:56,000
was here so long before you

1281
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,400
while the black man

1282
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,760
was a slave you brought ashore

1283
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:03,420
and the red man

1284
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:05,800
was killed to free the boy

1285
01:04:05,800 --> 01:04:05,800


1286
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:06,500
from the frontier

1287
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:08,700
while the black man was killed

1288
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:11,240
for sporting nothing boy

1289
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,840
and you wonder why

1290
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:16,720
the red man won't be like you

1291
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,080
you should wonder why

1292
01:04:19,820 --> 01:04:21,420
the black man wants to be

1293
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:24,220
and you came to this land

1294
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:26,780
because you wanted freedom

1295
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:29,280
but that you have forgotten

1296
01:04:29,820 --> 01:04:31,920
now that you are free.
