1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:05,240
For who shall defile the temples of the ancient gods?

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,920
A cruel and violent death shall be his fate,

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:14,600
and never shall his soul find rest unto eternity.

4
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:20,640
Such is the curse of Amundra, king of all the gods.

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,640
And he said, it's healthy for them.

6
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,640
And he said, it's a wonderful thing if they continued all through their lives,

7
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,380
to get that enthusiastic about anything.

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,680
Now, ladies and gentlemen, the self-genius, our old swan.

9
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,400
Come on, come on, come on, yell.

10
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,820
All right, now wait, wait a moment.

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,540
Wait a moment.

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,000
Quiet, for just...

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,200
Quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet, quiet.

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,480
Please, please be quiet,

15
00:00:54,560 --> 00:00:56,380
because I know you want to hear what I'm going to say here.

16
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,320
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

17
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:00,000
These are the nicest young people.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,360
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,280
What I want to tell them is how much we've enjoyed having them.

20
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,720
You're going to be on our show once again.

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,340
Bob.

22
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,040
Yes, Bob.

23
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:15,300
Thanks for Mende-mende-mende-mende-mende-mende-mende-mende-mende.

24
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:20,580
And welcome to Hour of Slack number 1099,

25
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:25,740
which this time piggybacks on a radio synesthesia show from April 22nd.

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:34,420
on which host Dr. Sinister was talking about the Virginia Tech slayings and crazy killers in general.

27
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:41,400
I realize it's all old news, but in the Church of the Subgenius, even old news is eternal news,

28
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,740
if it's a subgenius who's fixating on it.

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,200
We also have the unusual Norrell Prep collages and Lemur cut-ups,

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:55,240
and two more crazy killer killer songs, if they can be called that,

31
00:01:55,260 --> 00:02:02,360
from the new CD Stung by Cleveland's own Kirkendall Void, who are also heard in the background right now.

32
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:06,100
Or maybe it's vice versa, maybe it's Kirkendall's own Cleveland.

33
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:11,400
But this episode isn't just about crazy killers, friends, but food and drugs,

34
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:16,240
and the conspiracy's contaminants thereof as follows.

35
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,180
A huge percentage of people die in high school.

36
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,180
We must outlaw hospitals.

37
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,400
Well, I'm still working to get dihydrogen monoxide banned.

38
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,780
I don't know what that name is.

39
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,280
Dihydrogen, oh my goodness.

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:35,780
I have to, I have to, I'm going to look this up here real quick, because this is something so scary.

41
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:38,520
That you just have to...

42
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:38,720
Can't get off on it, man.

43
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:47,520
And especially on this, on this Earth Day, you know, I think it's especially important that we let everyone know about the dangers of dihydrogen monoxide.

44
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,140
Well, what is...

45
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,080
Dihydrogen monoxide?

46
00:02:51,140 --> 00:03:00,700
It's a colorless and odorless chemical compound, also referred to by some as dihydrogen oxide, hydrogen hydroxide, hydronium hydroxide, or simply hydric acid.

47
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:09,660
Its basis is the unstable radical hydroxide, the components of which are found in a number of caustic, explosive, and poisonous compounds,

48
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,820
such as sulfuric acid, nitroglycerin, and ethyl alcohol.

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,660
For more detailed information, including precautions, disposal procedures, and storage requirements,

50
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,040
refer to the...

51
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,780
Materials Safety Data Sheet for Dihydrogen Monoxide.

52
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,780
Should I be concerned about it?

53
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:27,540
Yes, you should be concerned about DMHO, uh, DHMO.

54
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:34,600
Although the U.S. government and the Centers for Disease Control do not classify dihydrogen monoxide as a toxic or carcinogenic substance,

55
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:38,440
as it does with better-known chemicals such as hydrochloric acid and benzene,

56
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:46,660
DHMO is a constituent of many known toxic substances, diseases, and disease-causing agents, environmental hazards,

57
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:50,120
and can even be lethal to humans in quantities as small...

58
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,440
as a thimbleful...

59
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,620
if inhaled.

60
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,420
Uh...

61
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:56,040
Research conducted by award-winning U.S. scientist Nathan Zoner

62
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:00,660
concluded that roughly 86% of the population supports a ban on dihydrogen monoxide.

63
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:08,260
Although his results are preliminary, Zoner believes that people need to pay closer attention to the information presented to them regarding dihydrogen monoxide.

64
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,500
He adds that, if more people knew the truth...

65
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,540
then, uh, the studies like the one he conducted would not be necessary.

66
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,600
What are some of the dangers associated with it?

67
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,380
Well, you know, death due to accidental inhalation of DHMO,

68
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,480
even in small quantities.

69
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,140
Each year, it's a known causative component in many thousands of deaths.

70
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,820
It is a major contributor to millions upon millions of dollars

71
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,000
in damage to property and the environment.

72
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,320
Prolonged exposure to solid DHMO causes severe tissue damage.

73
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,980
Excessive ingestion produces a number of unpleasant,

74
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,760
though typically not life-threatening, side effects,

75
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,300
although, you know, it can lead to electrolyte imbalances.

76
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,200
DHMO is a major component of acid rain.

77
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,380
Gaseous DHMO can cause severe burns.

78
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,420
It contributes to soil erosion.

79
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,320
It leads to corrosion and oxidation of many metals.

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,820
Contamination of electrical systems with DHMO often causes short circuits.

81
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,600
Exposure decreases effectiveness of automobile brakes.

82
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:06,280
It's found in biopsies of precancerous tumors and lesions.

83
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,360
It's given to vicious dogs involved in recent deadly attacks.

84
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,320
This is a true story.

85
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,800
Often associated with killer cyclones in the U.S., Midwest, and elsewhere,

86
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:37,480
it's the use of DHMO in the production of

87
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,360
and biological and chemical weapons manufacture

88
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:43,120
in the development of genetically engineered crops and animals

89
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,080
as a spray-on fire suppressant and retardant.

90
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:49,440
In so-called family planning or reproductive health clinics,

91
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,060
as a major ingredient in many home-brewed bombs,

92
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,820
as a byproduct of hydrocarbon combustion

93
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,960
in furnaces and air-conditioning compressor operation.

94
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,580
It's used in cult rituals.

95
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,720
It's used by the Church of Scientology members.

96
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,760
It's used by both the KKK and the NAACP

97
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:08,620
touring valleys in marches, which is, you know, really frightening.

98
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,500
It's used in animal research laboratories,

99
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,940
and it's used in pesticide production and distribution.

100
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,180
It's used in the production of pesticides,

101
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,520
and it's used in community swimming pools to maintain chemical balance.

102
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,700
It's also even been approved for use as a food additive,

103
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:26,220
and you'd be surprised how many things in your pantry

104
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,560
actually contain dihydrogen monoxide.

105
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,900
So, that having been said, are you scared yet?

106
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:39,880
Yeah, I tried to quit drinking, but I was unable to.

107
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,620
I still suck the stuff down like crazy.

108
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,680
Yeah, it's better.

109
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,160
Should we tell them what the...

110
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,400
Should we let the next caller figure it out?

111
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,460
Hello, you're on the air.

112
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,240
Holy crap.

113
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,440
Holy crap.

114
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,120
I am so scared right now.

115
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,900
I'm wetting my pants.

116
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:56,380
Oh, no.

117
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,000
There could be some dihydrogen monoxide in there now.

118
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,720
You've got to be careful.

119
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:00,900
Oh, my goodness.

120
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:08,060
Hey, I heard a rumor that the Cleveland city water is full of it.

121
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:08,560
Oh, yeah.

122
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,460
It's a major component, actually.

123
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:10,920
That's...

124
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,100
Yeah.

125
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:12,400
Yeah.

126
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,160
And once I got my tap tap...

127
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,160
I got tested at home.

128
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:17,700
Mm-hmm.

129
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,900
And they said it was just full of the stuff.

130
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,700
And I'm really...

131
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,740
Is there some kind of petition or something I can sign to ban it?

132
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:31,620
Well, if you want to get more information about this potentially deadly substance,

133
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:36,280
you can find more information at www.dhmo.org.

134
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,680
You know, in that movie Idiocracy, they had banned it

135
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:46,160
and replaced it with, like, some kind of sports aid, Gatorade.

136
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,160


137
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:46,160


138
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,960
Gatorade type stuff.

139
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,420
Which, of course, is still full of DHMO.

140
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:50,860
Yeah.

141
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,680
Right.

142
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:54,280
But it wasn't working on the crops.

143
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:59,120
The crops were dying because they didn't really like electrolytes.

144
00:07:59,180 --> 00:08:05,840
You know, I live in Parma, and our tributary system, I think, I'm pretty sure it's full of it.

145
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,720
Big Creek has been contaminated with dihydrogen monoxide.

146
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,200
And I think it gets right into the soil and into the sewage system as well.

147
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,980
Well, there was so much...

148
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:20,500
In the Cleveland rivers, the Cuyahoga River going through Cleveland,

149
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:25,160
it caught on fire 11 times in the previous century.

150
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,760
Although now, you can fish out of it.

151
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,740
It's kind of a success story.

152
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:39,080
I wouldn't fish out of the Cuyahoga, at least not in the Cleveland part.

153
00:08:39,140 --> 00:08:39,360
But a bunch of people do.

154
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:44,440
And, you know, and they're having children, and those children are growing up and voting.

155
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:45,960
Isn't it true?

156
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:51,440
Isn't it true that the atmosphere is full of, like, a gaseous form of dihydrogen monoxide?

157
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:59,020
Depending on weather conditions, yeah, you can get anywhere from, like, half a percent to, like, 2-3% of the atmosphere around you.

158
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,740
And we're just inhaling this stuff.

159
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,260
Being pure DHMO.

160
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,980
Mindlessly inhaling it?

161
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,020
Uh, yeah.

162
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,080
Yeah, Bush suppresses all studies about it.

163
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,100
And the government's doing nothing about it.

164
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:12,040
Well, fortunately, it's very, very dilute when it's in the atmosphere.

165
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:13,360
It's not, you know...

166
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,380
But, of course, if you took...

167
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,940
If you took it, like...

168
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:22,560
Like, in its natural state at room temperature, like, when it hasn't evaporated, inhalation of this would definitely cause some...

169
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,940
As little as a thimbleful.

170
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:27,100
As little as a thimbleful, if the contents were inhaled.

171
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,660
Isn't there some way we could form, like, some kind of lobby group or something?

172
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:33,860
Well, guys, I'm going to come out and let you all know here, I actually...

173
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,100
I'm actually in favor of dihydrogen monoxide.

174
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,600
I think it's a wonderful substance.

175
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:40,800
I use it all the time.

176
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,180
And I will fight...

177
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,200
I will fight tooth and nail.

178
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:45,800
Any attempt.

179
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:51,300
To regulate or restrict the availability of dihydrogen monoxide.

180
00:09:51,840 --> 00:10:02,300
Wasn't there a radio show that was asking listeners to drink as much of it as they possibly could to win some kind of prize?

181
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,500
And a woman died from a...

182
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,320
Yes, it's true.

183
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:09,040
A woman has died recently from ingesting too much dihydrogen monoxide.

184
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,940
It was part of a radio contest.

185
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,120
You're pushing the stuff.

186
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:12,820
Yeah.

187
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,920
You're nothing but an H2O pusher.

188
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,860
Oh, man.

189
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,520
Yeah, folks, for those of you who haven't figured it out, think of what the chemical formula would look like.

190
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,080
Dihydrogen, that means two hydrogens, right?

191
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:26,120
What's the symbol for hydrogen?

192
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,920
And monoxide, that means one oxygen.

193
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,580
What's the symbol for oxygen?

194
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:33,960
All right, so dihydrogen monoxide.

195
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,000
Think of that.

196
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,940
Think about H's and O's.

197
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,900
Welcome back to Making Food.

198
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,500
Welcome to the contamination of the world's food products and the food supply.

199
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,920
But in breaking news...

200
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,800
I've contaminated virtually all of the organic and conventional papaya crop in Hawaii.

201
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,780
Earlier today, I contaminated fish and cotton.

202
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:01,820
We've been genetically modified with RBGH, and we have major contamination of U.S. rice supplies.

203
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,320
Unfortunately...

204
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:09,320
All right, we've been speaking with Joe of the Center for Food Contamination and the Fight Against Dairy Production.

205
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,560
Thanks for joining us.

206
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:15,620
Continuing with our look at food today on Making Food.

207
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:22,400
We have another piece speaking about a fifth grader's activism against foods in her cafeteria.

208
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,460
I'm a fifth grader in California.

209
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,660
I'm sick and tired of school lunches.

210
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,520
No more lunches.

211
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,880
Boycott the cafeteria.

212
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,340
By the way, we want more processed junk as well as invisible things like food.

213
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,260
We love our invisible food.

214
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,920
Now, this is true.

215
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,100
But meanwhile...

216
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,280
Hello, you're on the air.

217
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,740
Hello, you're on the air.

218
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,520
You got ghosts, man.

219
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,520
I guess.

220
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,200
Scary music has attracted ghostages.

221
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:01,320
Yep.

222
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:02,900
Hello, you're on the air.

223
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,780
Hey, what's up, sinister?

224
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,620
You just stepped in.

225
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,080
It's Governor Rocknar.

226
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,660
Yes, it's me.

227
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:09,740
How are you, Stang?

228
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:10,820
Great.

229
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:11,780
That's good.

230
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,980
Well, I've been indulging...

231
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,040
I've been editing...

232
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:19,160
Ancient X-Day movies of the 1998...

233
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:22,160
What the conspiracy calls the 1998 X-Day.

234
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,980
From a long, long time ago.

235
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:31,960
Yes, and all of those pretty moms that we see at X-Days now were young 20-somethings then.

236
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,940
And they all used to run around with their shirts off out there at breakfast.

237
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:35,720
And they weren't moms then.

238
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,060
It's been a lot of fun editing this and cleaning it up for family.

239
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,840
Oh, yeah.

240
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:43,700
That's important.

241
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:49,420
So, yeah, did you hear about the NASA shooting on 420?

242
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,460
No.

243
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,460
Well, I'm sure Stang heard about this.

244
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,040
Actually, I think I remember hearing something.

245
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:59,760
A NASA employee was upset because he got a bad work report.

246
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:05,280
And he went and took, I guess, his boss or somebody hostage and shot him and shot himself.

247
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:14,180
The idiot was kind of hostage in NASA and he didn't hijack a space shuttle and go to the true Earth.

248
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,840
I mean, what was he thinking?

249
00:13:15,940 --> 00:13:17,020
No kidding.

250
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:25,320
These crazy armed loners these days are giving the rest of us armed loners a bad name.

251
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,320
I tell you.

252
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:29,760
I tell you.

253
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,200
You know, I mean, you've got a hostage at NASA.

254
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,200
You're surrounded by spaceships.

255
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:43,900
And, you know, if that dorky Korean kid hadn't stolen his glory earlier in the week, he might have gotten more publicity.

256
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,740
As it is now.

257
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:48,140
That's just a blurb in the news.

258
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,640
That Travis Bickle wannabe.

259
00:13:49,940 --> 00:13:52,000
Well, see, I don't listen to the news.

260
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:55,020
I listen to the news about the news shows.

261
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:04,020
So I heard what they about what they wouldn't talk about because the other thing that they wouldn't shut up about.

262
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:14,240
Well, I think because, you know, when a crazy killer does does his thing, the media should always immediately do just what the crazy killer wanted.

263
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,920
It posed all his rants and pickpockets.

264
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:22,260
It's just a bunch of pictures on the Internet and television so that everybody, all the next crazy killers have a good role model to follow.

265
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,120
Exactly.

266
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:30,040
And plus, do you get to see all the glory and the guy posing just like in those violent movies that he liked?

267
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:39,380
Well, it's like if you're if you're a crazy serial killer type, well, I'm not serial killer, but just a poor rampage.

268
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,040
That's a spree killer, not a serial.

269
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,000
Who's suicidal.

270
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,780
You know, that's that's how you can get famous.

271
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:52,420
If you must die, if you really need to kill yourself, just jump in Bob's pipe and let him smoke you.

272
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:55,520
That is the honorable way to off yourself.

273
00:14:56,100 --> 00:15:03,260
Well, we've always said that, you know, Bob or God are going to kill you anyway.

274
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,660
Do you really think you're going to do a better job than them?

275
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:11,800
Or would it just be another one of your dumb mistakes that you were going to kill yourself for?

276
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,860
Well, why don't you just hold off?

277
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,800
Let you know.

278
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:19,060
You may be impatient, but let Bob do it.

279
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,720
That's the way we look at dealing with the humans.

280
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,700
Don't don't.

281
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:28,300
It's not up to subgeniuses to go around destroying humans.

282
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,260
We're that's what the aliens are for.

283
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:33,320
We have slack and we wait for the aliens to do it.

284
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:33,940
That's right.

285
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,660
Chosung, we was the aliens.

286
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,720
The aliens will know who's a true subgenius and you don't.

287
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,920
You're not Bob.

288
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:41,680
You don't know.

289
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:42,640
I don't know.

290
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:44,780
I wouldn't take that kind of.

291
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:49,340
Well, there's a few people on my list, but that's different.

292
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,620
America's continuing growth depends on people.

293
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,680
Favorite with almost everyone.

294
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:59,660
Nowadays, more and more of the people you buy comes to you fully prepared.

295
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,480
Ready to eat people are an accepted part of our everyday life.

296
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,780
Mixing, slicing people.

297
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,780
This time consuming work is done for you.

298
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,860
How can you be sure?

299
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,840
Millions of people slaughtering millions of people each year.

300
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,540
Millions of people.

301
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,780
Slaughtered in this country.

302
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:21,980
Coming under federal inspection are carefully examined by thoroughly trained USDA people.

303
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:23,920
Inspectors grinding people.

304
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,420
Prepared people inspected and passed by the United States.

305
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:32,880
Slaughtering plants are clean, safe, wholesome and truthfully labeled.

306
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:39,980
People unfit for human consumption is slaughtered separately and converted to fertilizer or other non-food uses.

307
00:16:40,660 --> 00:16:45,520
Nothing is left from the moment the consumer carcass starts on its way along the line.

308
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:45,520


309
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:45,520


310
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,060
Any questionable carcass is set aside.

311
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,260
It is condemned.

312
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:54,580
Only clean, safe and wholesome people goes into the cooler for further processing.

313
00:16:55,520 --> 00:17:03,380
About 18 billion pounds a year or two-thirds of all the processed people consumed in this country are prepared under federal inspection.

314
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,120
More than 7 billion fweeners each year earned the US mark of wholesomeness.

315
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:15,500
All products containing people including soups, gravies and stews must contain wholesome ingredients that are not harmful to the environment.

316
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:15,500


317
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:18,440
The food is only head cheese and other favorites.

318
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,840
Scientists in the laboratories poured into petri dishes for food many times a day.

319
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:27,740
Let's take a look at some of these people's left by pesticides for the consumer.

320
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:31,520
Another machine and to support them here's the way it's done.

321
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,980
Radioactive fallout.

322
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,260
You get what you pay for.

323
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,280
You the consumer.

324
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,040
Deception.

325
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,320
People with barbecue sauce must have at least 50% cooked people.

326
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,440
The processor claims it will not char.

327
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,500
It has been cured with a USDA approved solution.

328
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Synthetic sweetener.

329
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,520
Let's watch kitchen testing at work.

330
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:50,900
Yes, the claim proves to be accurate.

331
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,340
The anti-charring statement will be allowed to appear on the label.

332
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,920
Prepared people are American favorites.

333
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,520
Favorites for convenience.

334
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,180
Favorites for nutrition.

335
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:02,240
And favorites for flavor.

336
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,340
They are enjoyed by almost everyone.

337
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,000
Slaughtering the whole family.

338
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:09,660
So whenever you're out slaughtering, just look for the mark of shopping.

339
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:14,700
From PR News in Washington, I'm throwing rocks and bottles.

340
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:21,700
NASA engineers fired rubber bullets into a crowd that had been asking the Federal Trade Commission to investigate PR's reports.

341
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,800
House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said,

342
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:26,040
Democrats are committed to this war.

343
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,860
President Bush jabbed her in the back with his club.

344
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:29,960
We need animosity.

345
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:31,800
And he tried to strike Democrats.

346
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,700
Both sides have spoken astounding the Iraqi government.

347
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,800
The President needs to do better.

348
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:42,660
In Stocks 7521195657, this is PR News.

349
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,540
PR News.

350
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,220
PR News.

351
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,160
In Colorado, Denver responded to snowstorms in Denver.

352
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,600
John Hickory received 7% of the vote in Tuesday's election.

353
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:55,100
He's proved troublesome from the moment polls opened that morning.

354
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,840
PR News in New Denver.

355
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:04,760
Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton has ordered an investigation into allegations that PR News used undue force in Washington.

356
00:19:05,100 --> 00:19:08,020
But yeah, I mean that kind of stuff happens several times a day in Iraq.

357
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:13,300
Well something must have triggered it in him because he, you know, he was planning this obviously.

358
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,300
For the anniversary of Columbine.

359
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,720
No, we don't know that at all.

360
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,440
Well we don't know that.

361
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,000
I mean why, I mean where on earth has that come up?

362
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,860
Well the fact that he brought it up in his video that he was, you know, emulating the two kids from Columbine.

363
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,600
He mentioned it.

364
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:28,200
Okay.

365
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:31,260
So, so he was, you know, he had this in his mind.

366
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,960
He had it planned, I guess.

367
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,340
He doubled their body count.

368
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,960
Right, doubled the body count.

369
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:41,900
Well I think, I think most of the subgeniuses who heard about that thing went, oh, there but for the grace of God go I.

370
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:42,440
Oh yeah.

371
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:46,940
And thank God I finally got laid in college or this would have, I probably would have done the same thing.

372
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:47,800
Yeah.

373
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:49,900
You know, this guy didn't get laid.

374
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,420
Well it just, you know, it just shows how college just isn't the same anymore.

375
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,060
I mean it never, you know.

376
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,820
It sounds about the same to me.

377
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:05,260
Honestly, I mean really if someone could just go back in time and, and like, and get that kid a hooker, you know, the day before.

378
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,720
Yeah, some of his rants.

379
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,600
Those people would all be alive.

380
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:11,260
I was writing the same kind of stuff my freshman year of college.

381
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:16,620
Well I've heard, I've heard people argue that the book of Revelation is actually one of those adolescent revenge fantasies.

382
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,020
Oh.

383
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,960
That you get from a guy who's been trapped on an island for however long and has been exiled there.

384
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:30,320
And he says that like the only people who survive the apocalypse will be those men who have not sullied themselves with the flesh of women like, uh, uh, hello.

385
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,080
Yeah.

386
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,500
Yeah.

387
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:34,300
We see what this guy's problem is.

388
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,860
I mean it's just like the revenge fantasies written by the, the Columbine shooters.

389
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:40,360
And by the way, I just accidentally hung up on, uh.

390
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:40,800
Mark.

391
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,460
On Mark, yeah.

392
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:44,620
I heard that Bush made him do it.

393
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,200
Hello, you're on the air.

394
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,660
Is this Dave?

395
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:48,720
No.

396
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,220
Dave's not here, man.

397
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,320
Man, I am funny and cute.

398
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:55,000
No, no, no.

399
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,940
You're a loser who, uh, can't even stay on the air on this program.

400
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:00,640
If you can't get on the air on this program.

401
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,040
You can't get on the air.

402
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:03,460
You can't get on the air anywhere.

403
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:04,960
Was that cracks just now?

404
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,840
No, that was just some loser.

405
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:08,680
You're on the air.

406
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,180
Hey, hi.

407
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,040
How are you today?

408
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:12,460
I'm hanging in there.

409
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:14,480
Who you picking on that guy for?

410
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:15,820
Which guy?

411
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:16,700
The, the idiot?

412
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,440
The guy you just called.

413
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,400
Yeah, he is, he's, he's an easy target.

414
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:22,200
I mean, he, it's, it's so obvious that he, he, uh.

415
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:22,780
Needs some men.

416
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:26,420
He has earned some, uh, some ridicule by being an idiot.

417
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,140
You know, that gives us the right to make fun of him for being an idiot and a loser.

418
00:21:30,140 --> 00:21:31,160
Yeah, that gives him the right to.

419
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,380
No, that doesn't give you authority power just because he has a different viewpoint,

420
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:34,900
does it?

421
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,540
Uh, it's not that he has a different viewpoint.

422
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,780
He's not expressing a viewpoint.

423
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,160
He's just calling up and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,

424
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:41,420
blah, nonsense and hanging up.

425
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:43,100
I mean, that's, that's pathetic and dumb.

426
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,180
And it shows that you're a loser and have nothing better to do with yourself.

427
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,980
I mean, I mean, geez.

428
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,220
It's, it's true.

429
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,360
We're elitists.

430
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:53,860
He could, he could be masturbating and that would be probably better for him

431
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,440
in the long run.

432
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,160
You know, he could be, he could.

433
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,500
I don't want a picture of that.

434
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,920
He could, he could be exercising his prostate, you know, reducing his risk of, uh, prostate

435
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,380
cancer.

436
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:04,100
He could be, uh.

437
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:05,400
What, masturbate?

438
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:07,520
What was, uh, what is ejaculation?

439
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,900
The more, the more.

440
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,040
The more you exercise.

441
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,140
Uh.

442
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,280
your prostate, the better it is for you. That's what I've heard.

443
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,420
Oh, really? Really?

444
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:16,180
You're going to have to excuse me for about two minutes. I'll be right back.

445
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:17,020
Two minutes, dude.

446
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:18,180
That long?

447
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:24,380
Ma'am?

448
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:25,080
Yeah?

449
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,340
Beg your pardon?

450
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:26,900
Yeah.

451
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:27,960
Yeah.

452
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,460
Yeah.

453
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:29,740
Have you got any ideas?

454
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,940
Not that I could tell.

455
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:32,300
Go on, please.

456
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,300
No.

457
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,860
Well, if you say so.

458
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,600
Oh, yeah.

459
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:36,260
Yeah, that's right.

460
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,200
Did you see anybody?

461
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,340
Oh, yeah, I see.

462
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:38,700
Did you?

463
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:39,660
Mm-hmm.

464
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,360
Want to try it again?

465
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:40,880
Okay.

Here.

473
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:46,460
Why do you say that?

474
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,080
Yeah.

475
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:47,640

00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:36,700
You hear children of the night.

527
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:39,460
They howl about the hill.

528
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,820
Of the seven jackals.

529
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,080
When Carice must be fed.

530
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:48,420
Should unbelievers seek to desecrate the tomb of an anchor.

531
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:51,840
You will use nine leaves each night.

532
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,960
To give life a moment to Carice.

533
00:23:56,540 --> 00:24:03,260
Thus you will enable him to bring benches and the heads of those who try to enter.

534
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:04,360
Yes, master.

535
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:05,600
But never.

536
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,440
For any reason.

537
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:08,820
Must you brew.

538
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,260
More than nine leaves at one time.

539
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,040
Should Carice obtain a large amount of the fluid.

540
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:18,640
It would become an uncontrollable monster.

541
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:21,040
A soulless demon.

542
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,240
With a desire to kill.

543
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,660
And kill.

544
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,480
I understand, master.

545
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:30,420
Neanderman.

546
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,020
Neanderman.

547
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:33,200
Neanderman.

548
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,340
Neanderman.

549
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,980
Neanderman.

550
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:36,980


551
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:37,720
Neanderman.

552
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,080
Neanderman.

553
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:05,700
You got a funky thing going on.

554
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,800
You got a funky thing going on.

555
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:08,980
Oh, no.

556
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:14,800
Okay, you're Mr. Hill Nussbaum, 243 at Retchelon?

557
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,100
Yeah, that's right. That's me.

558
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:20,920
Okay, Mr. Nussbaum, just what seems to be the problem?

559
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:25,120
Well, my brains feel like there's maggots inside, there's ratchets crawling all over me,

560
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:27,420
and I bark sometimes for no good reason.

561
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,540
You bark often?

562
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,680
Only when I gotta go to the bathroom.

563
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,440
I see.

564
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,200
Open wide, please.

565
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:37,520
Oh, my.

566
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,460
Yes.

567
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:40,560
Yes.

568
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:46,540
Okay, I think I know what your problem is.

569
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,060
What is it, Doc? Tell me.

570
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:54,320
Well, you have a small touch of electroconvulsive, chronic compulsive, schizolecuclomenagital,

571
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:58,120
cerebral spinal, hypermanic, psychosomatic, neurocoaxial, endopectaxial,

572
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,500
anaphylactic, hypochondriactic, neurobacterial,

573
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:04,980
ne-ne-ne-ne-no-nicky, sclerosanivosa, infectious, acutus, ne-ne-ne-ne-nex, miscerebral castration.

574
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,880
What? Could you repeat that, please?

575
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,400
No, no, don't. Just tell me in layman's terms.

576
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,140
In layman's terms?

577
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:12,740
Okay.

578
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,600
I am so sorry, Mr. Nussbaum, but you're going insane.

579
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:23,300
Huh? What? You mean I'm going cuckoo?

580
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:26,480
You're going crazy, Mr. Nussbaum. Congratulations.

581
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,200
And I am pleased to report, you're going to have to be

582
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,120
staying with us for quite some time.

583
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,360
You're going crazy!

584
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,300
Oh, no.

585
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,920
You got a fucking thing going on.

586
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:44,840
You're going crazy!

587
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,040
You got a fucking thing going on!

588
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:50,860
You're psycho!

589
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,080
You're crazy!

590
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:59,480
You got a fucking thing going on!

591
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,020
You got a funky thing going on!

592
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,640
You got a funky thing going on!

593
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,480
You got a funky thing going on!

594
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,120
You know it's in ours!

595
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:27,820
I assure you, Mr. Thor, my dear friend, I really had no designs upon your exalted position.

596
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,320
I pleaded vehemently with Brynn Hilda, but she was too powerfully persuasive!

597
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:38,660
She's that all right. Mystifying and mortifying, seeing the likes of you, Farwarrior. What's your name?

598
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:48,260
My name? Oh, but heaven must cut my name. But it'll come to me the moment I know the reveal. No prompting, please. No prompting, please. My name, the dear little Smith! Smith! It's Dr. Hatteras Smith!

599
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:54,320
What kind of name is that, Farwarrior? It ought to roar! Like Thor!

600
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,800
Now, what am I to lose?

601
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:00,160
I'm gonna do with you till I get the other glove back.

602
00:28:00,440 --> 00:28:01,820
Well, I've got you.

603
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,120
Well, you can send me home!

604
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,680
Of course!

605
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,120
Come, Dr. Smith.

606
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,520
After you, dear quick-drying cement.

607
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,520
You got a funky thing going on!

608
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:21,680
I'm a w-I'm a wittle bird! I weave in a cage!

609
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:25,060
I think I'm on fire and I have insects in my brains!

610
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,820
I'm a wittle bird!

611
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:31,760
I think I'm on fire and I have insects in my brains!

612
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,680
I'm a wittle bird!

613
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,300
I weave in a cage!

614
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:37,300
I'm a wittle bird!

615
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,920
I think I'm on fire and I have insects in my brains!

616
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,380
I'm a wittle bird!

617
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,240
I weave in a cage!

618
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:44,480
I think I'm on fire and I have insects in my brains!

619
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:44,480


620
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,400
You got a funky thing going on!

621
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:49,620
I think I'm on fire and I have insects in my brains!

622
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,800
I'm a wittle bird!

623
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:52,660
I'm the thing amongst types and habits who are left alone.

624
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,260
I think I'm on fire and I have insects in my brains!

625
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:07,220
To the American soldier in the Saudi Arabia desert,

626
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,360
there is nothing more expensive than peace.

627
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:17,060
Live in your state and let others live in their state peacefully.

628
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,500
Don't be dual for the war machine.

629
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,080
Your children are waiting for you.

630
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:27,140
Your wife is waiting for you.

631
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,780
You might have a lover.

632
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,380
Where did you go to school?

633
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,300
You might have a lover.

634
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,640
You got a funky thing going on.

635
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:29,060
You got a funky thing going on.

636
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:38,120
This is flight number 914 from Earth to our planet.

637
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,440
We will be taking off in three minutes.

638
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,100
Mr. Chambers.

639
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:50,300
Mr. Chambers, don't get on that ship.

640
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,880
The rest of the book, to serve man, it...

641
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,580
It's a cookbook!

642
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,500
Cookbook!

643
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:58,660
You got a funky thing going on.

644
00:30:59,120 --> 00:30:59,500
Cookbook!

645
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:00,520
Cookbook!

646
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,120
Neonerman.

647
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:06,600
Neonerman.

648
00:31:07,860 --> 00:31:08,580
Neonerman.

649
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:10,420
Neonerman.

650
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,180
Neonerman.

651
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,040
Neonerman.

652
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,040
Neonerman.

653
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:15,740
Neonerman.

654
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:17,540
Neonerman.

655
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:23,260
Say, baby, why don't you bring that sweet badonkadonk

656
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,180
gone up to my place?

657
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,720
Has your bad trip terminated yet, friends?

658
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:34,680
That was the Kirkendall Void from their new album Stung.

659
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:38,780
And you can get more information about that from the Kirkend...

660
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:41,780
Well, kirkendallvoid.com.

661
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:53,240
Kirkendall Void being spelled K-I-R-K-E-N-D-A-H-L-V-O-I-D.

662
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:56,780
Kirkendall Void.com.

663
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,540
They're also doing this background music.

664
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:04,140
You know, that's something that I read on All.Slack,

665
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:09,160
that you were saying that the only true kooks in the Church of the Subgenius

666
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:14,160
were you and me, because we're the ones who've given the most money to this thing.

667
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:15,580
Well, yeah, you could say that.

668
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:16,040
Yeah.

669
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:21,380
And the true definition of a kook is someone who believes in it wholeheartedly,

670
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,900
even beyond the point.

671
00:32:23,260 --> 00:32:25,760
Of knowing that it's just simply all crap.

672
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,720
You've got to believe everything you read,

673
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:31,200
especially when the things you read contradict each other.

674
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,400
Then you must believe both.

675
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,440
Well, and also, the magician does, you know,

676
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:41,380
he cheapens the audience and his art when he gives away his tricks.

677
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:47,700
But, and I'm going to get a little bit serious with you here, friends,

678
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,540
for just a second.

679
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,580
Tattoo this on your brain, okay?

680
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:53,240
It turns my stomach.

681
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:54,080
As it says here.

682
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:00,680
It turns my stomach to see all you knee-jerk, quote, subgeniuses, unquote,

683
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:06,920
make blanket statements about those stupid Christians or those stupid Republicans,

684
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:12,640
which might as well be the same as saying those stupid niggers or those greedy Jews

685
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,040
or all Muslims hate women.

686
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:21,640
That mindset is the same old we're brilliant us and they're stupid old dumb them.

687
00:33:21,820 --> 00:33:23,240
And pointing out, you know, that's not true.

688
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,420
Pointing out the innate dumbness of that kind of thinking,

689
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,860
isolating the loci where the dumb attitude starts,

690
00:33:31,060 --> 00:33:36,760
that's one of the main points of several satirical put-on religions that I can think of.

691
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:41,660
And wouldn't you know it, that main point is the very one that's most often missed.

692
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:45,160
In other words, here in the subgenius church,

693
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,560
we run into people who actually believe this shit.

694
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:49,200
Yeah.

695
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,740
Bob has this way.

696
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:56,840
He's telling, well, he came up with these perfect formulas of,

697
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:03,200
it's just the kind of thing that schizophrenics and kooks most want to hear.

698
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,740
Well, guess what happened?

699
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,420
We got kooks and schizophrenics.

700
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,500
Now, I'm saying there's nothing wrong with, in fact, I should jump ahead to that section.

701
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:16,180
Section on religion.

702
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:17,860
Yes, yes, yes.

703
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,080
My favorite part.

704
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:22,960
In fact, I'm going to do this.

705
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,940
I'm going to do this whole thing here.

706
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:33,440
Ranting about God is vain in every sense of the word and doesn't belong in a holy book like this one.

707
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,620
Ranting about God's fan club.

708
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:39,080
But now that's different, friends.

709
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:47,000
As Nenslow pointed out, people will have a total spaz attack over the way you draw two lines.

710
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:52,100
Whether the horizontal line crosses the upper part or the lower part of the vertical one.

711
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:55,060
How fucked is that, I ask?

712
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:55,820
Two lines.

713
00:34:56,020 --> 00:35:03,820
They will riot in the street and get themselves killed because somebody on the other side of the planet in a country they never heard of before

714
00:35:03,820 --> 00:35:09,280
drew a picture last year which they, the rioters, haven't actually seen themselves,

715
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:14,180
but which some preacher in another country on the other side of the planet didn't like.

716
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:17,800
How can you be surprised at anything that happens?

717
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,960
But as Nenslow pointed out, once you believe one impossible,

718
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:25,520
it's easy to believe a million more impossible things.

719
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:30,480
Well, we have the line, believe me out of it, friends.

720
00:35:31,460 --> 00:35:35,040
Fish in an aquarium don't know they're in an aquarium.

721
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,980
They don't know that we feed them.

722
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,080
To them, we might as well be clouds.

723
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:45,980
In just the same way, we don't really know whose aquarium we could be swimming around in, do we?

724
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,520
So we don't really believe in much.

725
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:52,080
And by the same token, we don't disbelieve in much.

726
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,780
Some of us don't even believe in skepticism,

727
00:35:57,120 --> 00:36:00,480
which, sort of like atheism, can be downright dangerous.

728
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:06,840
There are sad wandering ghosts and mournful earthbound spirits that are nothing but dead skeptics

729
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,320
who couldn't believe they were dead and just won't let go.

730
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:12,080
Some of us don't even believe in science!

731
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,260
You can't fool us.

732
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:21,980
Eternity and infinity are just fairy tales that some mathematician dreamed up to scare little kids and stoners.

733
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:30,000
But we got to where it's like, well, the paranormal is really interesting.

734
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:37,480
And many a subgenius has had that first walk at age 13 down the occult aisle of the used bookstore.

735
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:42,420
But after a while, the beliefs all start to sound the same and none of them work in the lab.

736
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:47,380
The believers themselves become very interesting, though.

737
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,480
And not so much for the trite crap they believe in,

738
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,960
but for the fact that they're not.

739
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:54,880
The fact that they can even believe it!

740
00:36:55,780 --> 00:36:58,580
And, friends, take my word for it,

741
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,620
becoming one of those kooky believers yourself is even more interesting.

742
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:03,920
I've done it.

743
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,960
We find the whole sweep of human belief fascinating,

744
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:11,280
and not just from an anthropological perspective.

745
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,180
No doubt most of us have believed in miraculous things at various times.

746
00:37:17,380 --> 00:37:21,960
The fact is, miracles are indeed happening around us.

747
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,620
They affect us constantly.

748
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:25,300
Some people may be surprised that we would say that,

749
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:28,720
but, yes, supernatural miracles occur daily.

750
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,920
The most miraculous one of all, my friends, is faith itself.

751
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:40,640
It is a fucking miracle that so many people can believe such dumb bullshit!

752
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:46,860
And that is a miracle that never stops happening, my friends.

753
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,140
The fact that such hogwash brings millions,

754
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,200
such deep, much-needed comfort and calm in a world of uncertainty and hardship,

755
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:58,600
that itself is the most fantastic miracle of all.

756
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,400
Isn't that sweet?

757
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:04,080
So, you know, we understand everybody wants something for nothing.

758
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,640
But then there's the crazy people and the religious nuts, so to speak,

759
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,460
of which I'm proud to count myself craziest and most fanatical.

760
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:17,400
But what's considered crazy these days,

761
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:20,120
you know, it's really changed over the years.

762
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:25,180
Insane now doesn't mean running around the mall with your underwear on your head.

763
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,520
That's fashionable now.

764
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:33,900
Nowadays, what's weird is what used to be considered common human decency.

765
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,300
Having manners is weird and crazy nowadays.

766
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:44,440
And so we see the world of the differently-samed, let's call them.

767
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,880
It's not that they see things that aren't really there.

768
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:54,060
Serious religious nuts and speed freaks also see connections that aren't there.

769
00:38:54,980 --> 00:39:00,280
Marvelous connections between, say, quantum physics and sappy mysticism.

770
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:04,640
The only reason the rest of us don't see the connections is that we're not completely insane.

771
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,820
It's hard to carry on a real conversation with these people

772
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:14,420
because they're precariously balanced mentally and they prefer to lecture.

773
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:18,780
If you question their basic presumptions, suddenly you're barking up,

774
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:20,320
and they're barking up an unoccupied tree.

775
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:26,220
The non-traditionally-aware person, as we might say,

776
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,760
can't answer certain questions because if he lets himself even understand them,

777
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,820
his whole mental house of cards collapses.

778
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,600
The concept of him being wrong is outside of his frame of reference,

779
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:42,100
so his answers are always to other questions than the ones you'd ask,

780
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,600
the ones they prefer you ask.

781
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:46,640
Now, we're all kooks to some extent, friends,

782
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:48,760
but as long as you're not a kook,

783
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,080
as long as you can take a joke,

784
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,840
you're not too far gone.

785
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:57,240
However, you have to be able to recognize that a joke has been told.

786
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:01,860
And we keep running into these subgeniuses that

787
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,680
they got the lies and believe the jokes.

788
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,820
They got the lies.

789
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,220
Oh, I know what you mean, Reverend Seng.

790
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,080
Oh, no, no.

791
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:16,320
Friends, crippled sense of humor

792
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,880
is the single most distinguishing aspect of the, quote,

793
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,600
kook or deep pink personality.

794
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,940
We call the really deep pinks purples.

795
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,960
And thus, many alternately-realitied persons

796
00:40:29,960 --> 00:40:32,700
can't experience slack except negatively.

797
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:36,320
And then there's the fooling yourself thing.

798
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,360
New Age beliefs combined with dipshit science

799
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:42,580
can inflict brain damage every bit as tragically

800
00:40:42,580 --> 00:40:45,820
as can chronic drug use and cable television.

801
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:49,500
Luckily for all but the most damaged victims,

802
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:51,600
there is a place in the world for them,

803
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:53,260
and often a lucrative one,

804
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:56,240
as religious or philosophical teachers.

805
00:40:57,060 --> 00:40:59,700
And an important thing to note, friends,

806
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:04,760
is that rich people can afford to be much more superstitious

807
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:06,660
than poor people can.

808
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:11,920
It's easy to learn the trappings of awareness and knowledge.

809
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:16,200
All it takes is impenetrably flighty jargon

810
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,120
punctuated by pregnant pauses and flatteries,

811
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:21,680
and big eyebrows help a lot.

812
00:41:22,340 --> 00:41:26,840
Um, many malaligned normals naturally and automatically

813
00:41:26,840 --> 00:41:30,780
gush the kind of New Age kookademic jibber-jabber

814
00:41:30,780 --> 00:41:32,600
and, uh, guy-a-rea

815
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:36,400
that appeals to the lowest con-man denominator,

816
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,260
the comforting blither-blather of so many gurus,

817
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:43,460
therapists, philosophy majors, and other doofi.

818
00:41:43,460 --> 00:41:46,640
This self-validating bullshit

819
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:49,740
also tends to be self-generating.

820
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:51,620
That's why we see so many pests

821
00:41:51,620 --> 00:41:54,580
who never get past Mysticism 101.

822
00:41:55,400 --> 00:41:59,360
Now those who catch on that there is no Mysticism 102

823
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:03,260
are the ones who teach Mysticism 101.

824
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:09,460
So, most New Age guru claptrap

825
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,420
doesn't teach you how to be more awake.

826
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,520
It only teaches you how to pretend to be more awake

827
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:20,700
and how to use the lofty vocabulary of higher consciousness

828
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,540
to categorize all the parts of the personality

829
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,820
and all of human experience

830
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:29,100
so that you can talk just as if you actually understood them.

831
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:32,480
What you've really learned from the guru, though,

832
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:34,420
are just holy-sounding platitudes

833
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:36,380
that keep you automatically sure

834
00:42:36,380 --> 00:42:38,300
that you're not on automatic.

835
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:42,060
We know this because we're the automatic robots,

836
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,960
and we're the robots that are programmed

837
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,540
to tell the other robots

838
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:46,980
that they're robots and must wake up!

839
00:42:48,360 --> 00:42:52,040
So it's gratifying, as many of you I'm sure know,

840
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,340
to put yourself into the happy mental state

841
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:57,120
of believing oneself to be fully awake

842
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:58,800
and preternaturally aware,

843
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:01,800
to skip straight to the enlightenment,

844
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:04,380
to announcing the enlightenment, rather,

845
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:07,500
without actually having turned on any of the lights,

846
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,320
so to speak.

847
00:43:09,840 --> 00:43:12,000
I mean, you know a lot of New Agers,

848
00:43:12,060 --> 00:43:16,080
I'm sure, are so busy congratulating themselves

849
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,800
moment by moment

850
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:20,120
about how in the now they are

851
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:21,940
that they don't really see what's happening

852
00:43:21,940 --> 00:43:23,560
right in front of their damn face.

853
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,280
They talk the trademark talk

854
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,520
of the awakened spiritual master,

855
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,980
but it stays talk.

856
00:43:30,340 --> 00:43:31,600
They don't live forever.

857
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:33,520
They don't speak from the grave.

858
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,620
They sure do speak, though,

859
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,060
uh, forever.

860
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:39,980
And it's nothing but words, words, words.

861
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,940
We're sick of the hot air

862
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:42,360
and should probably shut up ourselves.

863
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,900
Actually, I probably should just shut up.

864
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,800
Because, friends, as Nenslow said,

865
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:52,380
there is nothing, no, nothing,

866
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:55,760
as disillusioning as enlightenment.

867
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:00,500
You chew on that one for a while.

868
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:03,940
Friends, we subgeniuses may not be enlightened,

869
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:05,920
but we sure can spot a liar.

870
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:07,340
It takes one to know one,

871
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,220
and we are definitely liars.

872
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,640
The liars are the ones who are bragging

873
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,420
about their enlightenment.

874
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,580
I'll say that again.

875
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,060
Bragging about their enlightenment.

876
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:28,820
You know, it kind of implies that they're enlightened.

877
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:30,220
How about that?

878
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,260
Well, the nice thing about subgenius enlightenment

879
00:44:35,260 --> 00:44:37,740
is that you have to figure it out for yourself.

880
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,680
As Bob said, believe me out of it,

881
00:44:40,940 --> 00:44:42,480
no blood for snake oil.

882
00:44:42,700 --> 00:44:44,520
It is extremely important

883
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:48,100
that you understand how much you suck.

884
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:50,660
Because that is the first step

885
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,680
towards not sucking.

886
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:56,840
Look at the people who suck the hardest.

887
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,840
The person next to you, perhaps.

888
00:44:58,960 --> 00:44:59,400
I don't know.

889
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:02,040
One of the things they all have in common

890
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:03,640
is their erroneous belief

891
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:05,180
that they do not suck.

892
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:08,940
Those of us who are aware that we do suck

893
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:10,720
strive to remedy it,

894
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,300
and thus continually improve.

895
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,820
Those who are not aware that they suck

896
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:18,220
only grow sucklier day by day.

897
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,700
Praise Nenslow, who said that.

898
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:30,040
Yes, friends, it seems like the dumbasses are always...

899
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:31,740
Well, we are all of us dumbasses.

900
00:45:31,940 --> 00:45:34,600
And none of us really knows a damn thing for sure.

901
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:36,120
And all really is vanity.

902
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:39,880
That said, all dumbasses are not created equal.

903
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,580
Generally, the dumber they are,

904
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,220
the more sure they are right

905
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,880
about how much smarter they are than everybody else.

906
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,480
So, we subgeniuses are always trying to figure out

907
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,860
if we are getting dumber or smarter,

908
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:55,460
or if we are really just a brain in a jar

909
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:56,480
dreaming everything.

910
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,820
As Joe Cosby said, though,

911
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:02,180
I'd like to think that if this were all just

912
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:04,200
a fevered hallucination of mine,

913
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,700
I could hallucinate something

914
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,500
where I was getting laid more.

915
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:13,580
That was from Starwood26 last year.

916
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,600
Some readings from the new subgenius book,

917
00:46:15,660 --> 00:46:16,580
The Bobliographer.

918
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:18,780
And now, for a much needed break,

919
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,240
and a reward, so to speak,

920
00:46:20,420 --> 00:46:23,060
some more Kirkendall Void.

921
00:46:45,020 --> 00:46:46,420
futurist circa

922
00:46:46,420 --> 00:46:47,560
protests

923
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:53,660
rejected

924
00:46:57,020 --> 00:46:58,420
access

925
00:46:58,420 --> 00:46:59,560
toxic

926
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,380
roasted

927
00:47:04,380 --> 00:47:04,640
dangerous

928
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,060
I don't want to be a man

929
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,340
But I get it when I can

930
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:23,500
I don't want to be a girl

931
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,440
But if I was I'd wear my pearls

932
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:37,220
I don't want to be a guy

933
00:47:38,760 --> 00:47:41,280
I ain't gonna tell you why

934
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:45,460
I don't want to be a dame

935
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,360
Cause it wouldn't be the same

936
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,920
Shh, shh

937
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,340
Shh, shh

938
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:57,420
Shh, shh

939
00:48:04,740 --> 00:48:07,320
I don't own a great big car

940
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:11,080
And I don't own a new guitar

941
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:15,680
I don't own the leotards

942
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:19,060
But I want a new guitar

943
00:48:19,060 --> 00:48:21,080
Chronic indecision

944
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,100
Chronic indecision

945
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:27,420
Shh, shh, shh

946
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:43,060
Shh, shh, shh

947
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:06,240
Thank you.

948
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:36,680
Thank you.

949
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:58,640
Thank you.

950
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,680
Thank you.

951
00:50:57,420 --> 00:50:58,560
Thank you.

952
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:35,260
Thank you.

953
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,380
Thank you.

954
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:27,740
Thank you.

955
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:39,360
Dr.

956
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:39,360


957
00:52:39,360 --> 00:52:39,360


958
00:52:39,560 --> 00:52:39,560


959
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:40,320


960
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:40,320


961
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:56,360
Dr.

962
00:52:56,660 --> 00:52:56,680
Dr.

963
00:52:56,980 --> 00:52:57,380
Dr.

964
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,380


965
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,380


966
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,380


967
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,380


968
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,380


969
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,380


970
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,380


971
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:57,400
Dr.

972
00:52:59,320 --> 00:53:01,440
Wilhelm von Hornzahleren, the ex-Kaiser,

973
00:53:01,580 --> 00:53:05,400
could drink three gallons of wine at one draft without taking a breath.

974
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,300
He went about the streets at night with a lighted red candle

975
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:09,960
stuck in the vertex of his skull.

976
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:11,600
The orbit to Leenot.

977
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:15,120
In a moment, I'll tell you how the card game Bridge got its name.

978
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,600
Two English families used to visit one another on alternate nights to play the game.

979
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:22,200
Gradually, the game became known as Bridge,

980
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:25,900
and their dead bodies were buried in the walls to make them strong.

981
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:27,640
Strong. The orbit Leenot.

982
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,680
Sebastian Spinola, famous dancing master of the 16th century,

983
00:53:33,860 --> 00:53:36,580
was cast at the order of the Chinese emperor, Yang Lo.

984
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:41,200
It took 50,000 European slaves 20 years to pay no taxes.

985
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:42,880
The orbit Leenot.

986
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,080
In a moment, I'll tell you about the bizarre amusement the Duchess gave a stable boy

987
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,400
by embedding 3,200 needles in his arm.

988
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:55,120
Gilea Gonzaga, widow Duchess of Fondi, Italy, was the wettest on Earth.

989
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:57,840
Sacrificing her life for a perfect b-

990
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,040
Orbit Leenot.

991
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,620
The orbit Leenot.

992
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:03,460
Hello, you're on the air.

993
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:06,140
Hey, uh, where is the DHMO found?

994
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,080
It's not just an industry, but, uh,

995
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:08,800
Yeah, I mean, yeah.

996
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:11,060
I think it's useful for treating many diseases also.

997
00:54:11,660 --> 00:54:15,260
Uh, you know, just because, you know, you think of it as dangerous in some ways,

998
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:18,200
you know, I think, uh, I think people are forgetting how important,

999
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:23,180
you know, how, how much, how many people's jobs depend on dihydrogen monoxide.

1000
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:23,800
True.

1001
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:24,980
You know.

1002
00:54:24,980 --> 00:54:25,120
Yeah.

1003
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,360
That's something you gotta consider.

1004
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,940
Do you, do you know what it is yet?

1005
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:28,960
Yeah.

1006
00:54:29,820 --> 00:54:30,180
Yeah?

1007
00:54:30,540 --> 00:54:30,900
Yeah.

1008
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,500
You wanna tell me what it is?

1009
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:33,800
The DHMO?

1010
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:34,340
Yeah.

1011
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:38,100
Uh, what you said, it's a substance, you know, found in the air, um,

1012
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,940
wasn't it found in, uh, Lake Erie?

1013
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:42,160
It's found in the ground, it's found in Lake Erie.

1014
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:42,840
Yeah, it was found in Lake, yeah.

1015
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:45,600
It's found in your tap water, it's found in,

1016
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,940
it's found in your body tissue, I guarantee you.

1017
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:48,200
Yeah.

1018
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,460
That your body's pretty well saturated with it by now.

1019
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,080
Yeah.

1020
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,520
Since you've been living on this planet.

1021
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:53,380
Yeah.

1022
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:56,100
But, but that's, that's, that's all you know about what it is?

1023
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,000
Mm-hmm.

1024
00:54:57,860 --> 00:54:58,580
It's everywhere.

1025
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,400
It's all around you, you can't do anything about it.

1026
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,760
That's why I called it, I'm pretty cool with it.

1027
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:04,640
It's gonna kill you one day.

1028
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:06,920
Actually, it may or may not kill you, we don't, we don't know that for sure.

1029
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:11,580
Well, but I think you, actually if there wasn't any, you'd die if you, if you didn't have

1030
00:55:11,580 --> 00:55:13,320
try some amount of it.

1031
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,320
Right, but we also know that it's absolutely essential for cancer cells, uh, to survive.

1032
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:18,320
Yeah.

1033
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,360
And a number of other pesky, uh, crops.

1034
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:23,360


1035
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:28,040
It's, it's, it's been known to attract, uh, it, yeah, it even attracts mosquitoes.

1036
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,320
Has it really?

1037
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:29,840
Oh yeah.

1038
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,280
Yeah.

1039
00:55:30,340 --> 00:55:33,280
Mosquitoes that could be carrying, you know, malaria or the West Nile virus.

1040
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,320
They hatch their eggs in it.

1041
00:55:35,520 --> 00:55:36,540
It attracts skunks.

1042
00:55:37,220 --> 00:55:37,580
Yeah.

1043
00:55:38,300 --> 00:55:38,660
Yeah.

1044
00:55:38,780 --> 00:55:43,240
Let me, I can't, I can't, yeah, but you know, and, and, and for all the like dangerous,

1045
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:48,200
you know, uses, uh, all the dangerous factors about it, ironically enough, you, you can't

1046
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:52,260
even use it to wipe off, to, to, to, I mean, even though they use it as a solvent, you

1047
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:53,340
still can't use it to get the cells out.

1048
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:54,420
You can't use it to get the skunk spray off you.

1049
00:55:55,780 --> 00:55:58,800
You know, I've always seen skunks as a kind of an excuse.

1050
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:01,400
I do too.

1051
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,520
First I hated the smell and now I love it.

1052
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:04,640
You love it?

1053
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:05,360
Mm-hmm.

1054
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:07,300
Oh no, officer.

1055
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:08,440
It's not what you think.

1056
00:56:08,660 --> 00:56:10,280
No, I really did hit a skunk.

1057
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:10,720
I ran over a skunk the other day.

1058
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:14,560
No, I really did hit a skunk.

1059
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:14,820
See?

1060
00:56:16,800 --> 00:56:20,580
Dead skunk in the middle of the road, stinking to high, high heaven.

1061
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:23,320
Well, you know, if they, uh, if they, uh, if they, uh, if they, uh, if they, uh, if they,

1062
00:56:23,320 --> 00:56:30,460
um, if they just die a natural death, they, they don't, uh, stink any worse than any other

1063
00:56:30,460 --> 00:56:30,900
animal.

1064
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:39,020
I unfortunately found that out when the, the, uh, when the cold broke finally and I opened

1065
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:45,000
my garage again, there was a little baby skunk laying in there by the door as if she'd wandered

1066
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:50,540
in and didn't know how to wander out and probably died of dehydration.

1067
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,300
And she was probably dead.

1068
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,300


1069
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,300


1070
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,300


1071
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,300


1072
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,300


1073
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,300


1074
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,300


1075
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,300


1076
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,300


1077
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,300


1078
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:53,300


1079
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:56,380
Preserved as if, uh, as if freeze dried.

1080
00:56:57,460 --> 00:56:57,940
Wow.

1081
00:56:58,220 --> 00:56:58,400
Yeah.

1082
00:56:58,420 --> 00:56:59,420
Just stiff little thing.

1083
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:01,440
Nothing offensive about it at all.

1084
00:57:02,340 --> 00:57:03,660
I didn't keep it.

1085
00:57:06,600 --> 00:57:12,220
I understand that it's against the law in this land to bury a pet in your backyard.

1086
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:13,060
Is it?

1087
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:14,020
Really?

1088
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:14,380
Yeah.

1089
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:16,280
Some, for some reason, I'm not surprised by that.

1090
00:57:16,380 --> 00:57:17,140
It's kind of a...

1091
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,540
Well, they have a pet.

1092
00:57:18,600 --> 00:57:21,400
Well, it gets that DMH stuff into the ground too.

1093
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:22,060
That's true.

1094
00:57:22,060 --> 00:57:22,140
That's true.

1095
00:57:22,140 --> 00:57:24,580
Animals bodies are also saturated with DMH.

1096
00:57:24,580 --> 00:57:25,600
They're permeated with it now.

1097
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,340
DHMO, yeah.

1098
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:28,680
You just can't get away from that stuff.

1099
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:29,400
Yup.

1100
00:57:31,140 --> 00:57:32,220
Everywhere you turn around.

1101
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:34,480
Every time you blink your eyes, it's in your tears too.

1102
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:35,900
It's everywhere.

1103
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:39,240
You know, and, and by the way, you know, getting enough of getting, you know, getting, getting

1104
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,740
DHMO in your eyes can, can make vision difficult by the way.

1105
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:44,220
It can take them?

1106
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:44,400
Yeah.

1107
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,180
It can reduce your vision.

1108
00:57:45,180 --> 00:57:47,100
It can blind you temporarily for sure.

1109
00:57:48,460 --> 00:57:50,820
Or it could, it could transmit infections.

1110
00:57:51,500 --> 00:57:51,920
Yeah.

1111
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,040
Yeah.

1112
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,840
Yeah, it's definitely been known as a vector for numerous pathogens.

1113
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:00,660
You know, a person could just spend every second being paranoid.

1114
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:01,760
Yeah.

1115
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:02,240
Really?

1116
00:58:02,340 --> 00:58:03,300
But what would that catch you?

1117
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:07,800
You just live a meaningless existence.

1118
00:58:07,820 --> 00:58:09,620
Well, yeah, but they never catch you.

1119
00:58:09,700 --> 00:58:12,040
So that way you know that you succeeded.

1120
00:58:12,180 --> 00:58:13,380
Just because you're paranoid.

1121
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:16,840
That your paranoia was justified because they haven't come and gotten you yet.

1122
00:58:16,940 --> 00:58:19,480
See, a paranoid is just someone in possession of all the facts.

1123
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:29,560
Thanks to Dr. Sinister and WCSB and callers Lonesome Cowboy Dave and Rocknor and so forth

1124
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:34,880
and Norrell Preff and Fernand and Andy Lemur for the collages in this show.

1125
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:36,660
Friends, you're listening to the Hour of Slack.

1126
00:58:37,660 --> 00:58:39,460
Voice of the Church at the Subgenius.

1127
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:47,680
And if you want more to learn, look at, if you want, subgenius.com.

1128
00:58:48,480 --> 00:58:51,940
And remember, kids, subgenius is not spelled with.

1129
00:58:52,060 --> 00:58:52,360
S-O-N-E-O.

1130
00:58:53,020 --> 00:58:53,840
Praise Bob.

1131
00:58:59,780 --> 00:59:04,160
This is the story of a man who buried his identity to dedicate his life to the

1132
00:59:05,060 --> 00:59:05,580
Subgenius.

1133
00:59:05,660 --> 00:59:07,820
The Power of Slack.

1134
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:08,440
What?

1135
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,740
Good news, Captain Raid.

1136
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,680
It's all clear.

1137
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:16,060
I scouted the rim on both sides of the canyon and found no sign of

1138
00:59:16,060 --> 00:59:16,280
Bob.

1139
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:16,980
Ah.

1140
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:17,740
Him.

1141
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:18,420
Dead.

1142
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:19,720
Dead.

1143
00:59:19,880 --> 00:59:20,340
Dead.

1144
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,160
Ah.

1145
00:59:21,320 --> 00:59:21,800
Hmm.

1146
00:59:22,060 --> 00:59:22,140
Hmm.

1147
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:23,160


1148
00:59:26,260 --> 00:59:27,420
Well, Bob.

1149
00:59:34,020 --> 00:59:35,040
Let me go.

1150
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:39,540
Let me go.

1151
00:59:40,720 --> 00:59:41,800
Let me go.

1152
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,260
Let me go.

1153
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:44,440
Let me go.

1154
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:51,600
The destiny of the priests of Karnak is fulfilled.

1155
00:59:52,060 --> 00:59:56,860
Happy Birthday Mr. President
