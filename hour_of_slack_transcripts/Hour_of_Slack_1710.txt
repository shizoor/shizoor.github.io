You're not going to sedate me anymore.
Who are you?
The Self-Genius Power of Swag.
I seem to be in a timeless space void.
Neither light nor dark.
I have awareness but not mind but no memory.
That should hold her till you get her home.
Well, I went on down to my girlfriend's shack
to see how they did hang.
When I got there, her cupboard was bare.
I couldn't ignite a thing.
There was no shard, no bone, no twig.
I brought my comic book collection.
Was about this big, yeah.
From Alaska.
From Alaska.
Without slack is like slack without frop.
But where the hell else am I going to cop?
I found my dog food collection about five o'clock.
But all that food was stale.
I thought I'd call that rip-off schmuck.
But I forgot he was in jail.
Ended up killing a porcupine.
Just to see if I could smoke his rhyme.
Oh!
Oh, frop are you ready?




Frop without slack.
Oh, frop without slack.
Is like slack.
You're Cocky kid.
Fướp without, I'm sorry

Physics and I am gonna feel the need.
Oh, brobs!
without slack is like slack without propppa
Where the hell else am i going to cop?
where the hell else am i going to cop?
But Where the hell else am I going to cop?
Yeah!
But Where the hell else am i going to cop?
but don't cop from that guy right there
It's like, where the hell else am I going to cop?
Yeah!
But Where the hell else am I going to cop?
No way
No, no, no.
No, don't bother.
When we were born
into this life
we were destined
to make it right.
It's predetermined
and this is our fate.
We're singing this song
so you can relate.
We are going
to save the universe.
We are going
to save the universe.
We are going
to save the universe.
This time.
We are full grown.
We are grown up men.
We are all masters.
We pay to reason it.
It is our mission.
It is our task.
It's obvious.
Just use your lives.
We are going
to save the universe.
We are going
to save the universe.
We are going
to save the universe.
We are going

This time.
Friends,
this is Reverend Stang
and I'm here all by myself
with the two dogs
at Stang Ranch
in front of Tarzan's radio station
which is this
bunch of mostly really
old equipment.
Analog type stuff.
Running through a little tiny digital recorder.
Smaller than a cigarette pack.
And the most modern thing hooked up to the system
is an iPhone.
On which I'm about to call Philodrummond and Bleepo Abernathy
and try to get them both on the show at the same time.
And I'm going to start up my CD player here.
Which has Captain Beefheart instrumentals
ready to play in the background.
And somewhere in here is a recording of an
obscene and terrible thing happening.
It's just the sound effects of it.
It's just a dog cleaning herself with her tongue.
That's all.
You can hear Captain Beefheart here.
This is old Beefheart.
So that's winged eel fingerling on the guitar.
I think.
Hold on.
Hold on just a second.
There we go.
I'm going to change over to a headphone jack thing.
Headphone.
What are you?
Is he talking about something dirty?
No.
He's talking dirty.
Can you hear me now?
You were talking dirty on the radio weren't you Philo?
Headphone jack.
Hello I'm Patrick Fave today.
Are we on the air?
Are we on the air right now?
Well yes and no.
Yes.
So we are somewhere.
Yeah.
We're on the air.
You know I like to include the setups in the show.
Oh yeah.
Since they seem to go on forever anyway.
Remember that last time we did Doctors for Wotan at XC?

Yeah.
You weren't really ready and you were still futzing around after about half an hour trying
to get your crazy sound effects.
Sound right.
We'd already done six of our songs by then.
Yeah.
I just decided okay the setup is part of the show.
This is our best song.
Yeah.
You know and.
Well I think that's always worked for us in the past.
You know it's a good strategy for lack of a better one.
You know.
Right.
For lack of a better one.
Why not?
Why even look for a better one?
Just go to the easy one.
Yeah.
What is better anyway?
I mean is better really isn't easy sometimes better?
The path of least resistance I think is what you yourself dubbed that path.
A great man said that sometime.
Yeah.
Well I mean it's attributed to Bob but you're the one who told me.
Ah yes.
No I could I pushed.
Many of my.
I pushed.
Many of my best things came directly from Bob to me.
Well everybody's best things come from Bob to them.
Hey you just had a lot more best things than most people.
When you see when you see me on Scrub Genius and I'm posting as I need my Johnson.
Yeah.
And you're like.


And you're like.
Did you see that?
Yeah.
Okay.
Yeah.
Because when I when I look at it just says me.
Right.
Yeah.
Same with me.
But other people see Reverend Ivan Stang.
Flipped me out a little bit you know.
Yeah.
Just a little bit.
Oh imagine how I feel on Facebook.
They won't let me be Reverend Ivan Stang on Facebook.
I have to use my human street name.
Which everybody has.
I mean it's the same name about half of Americans have.
It's ridiculous.
I'm going to call Bill K.
K.
I mean Reverend Bleepo Abernathy and see what happens.
Merge calls.
Merge calls.
That's what I need.
Hey can you hear me?
Oh good.
Hopefully I can hear both of you.
Yes.
Yes.
You can hear us.
This is just crazy.
We can be hear us.
Just for one day.
And Bleepo this may surprise you but I think I'm hearing a bit of an echo.
I'm not sure.











Oh that might be that.
I'm going along communicate.
Even considering I'm going tell it on abrazas of Aliexpress and hate it calm down you and
I move from a derived from adam Salmon and ב� Irene for a yes to this one and ask Julie
for help with the other one
Yes, they said that.
And they were right.
Someone said that.
Yes, that was Lady Miss Keir.
Yeah.
Lady Miss Keir.
She was beautiful.
Oh, man.
And she still is.
She still is.
I hope so.
Yep.
Bleepo, you sound a little digital to me.
Do I?
Yeah.
What about now?
Huh?
Even now?
I mean, I can hear, I can understand Philo, and I can understand Bleepo.
Hey, does everybody's name end with an O?
Then there's Sterno.
And then there's...
And Onano.
And it's Ivano.
Stango.
Ivano.
Puzzly.
Puzzlo Evado.
Nenslo.
Yeah, Nenslo.
Nenslo, yeah.
Isn't Ivan actually short for Ivanho?
No, it's short for...
It means...
It means John, believe it or not.
Oh, I know that.
It's Russian.
I didn't know that myself.
I was giving you a joke, and you wouldn't even go with it.
Oh.
Well...
Ivanho.
Yeah.
Famous, you know, Sir Walter Scott or somebody.
No, it's Ivanho.
Get it?
Bleepo, you just sounded broken up again there.
Hmm.
I mean, not emotionally.
Technically.
I think that when we all three talk, we sort of duplex.
We don't talk to each other out.
See, I've got a microphone in front of me.
And the phone.
So, are you running your microphone into your phone?
I'm running my mouth.
I'm running my phone into my mix board.
The Tarzan's radio station little mix board that you're familiar with.
You don't have to do that.
Huh?
Do you have any alligator clips?
Yeah, I do.
Yeah, you need...
Not for the reason that...
Alligator clips.
You know, not...
But yeah, I do.
I do have fresh ones.
You should put those alligator clips on your nipples.
There you go.
Oh, okay.
But one on your left nipple and one on the phone.
Bleepo, you sounded just terrible then.
I mean, you broke up...
I'm sorry.
What about now?
You broke up into a million...
You're fine now.
What are you doing?
I don't know.
I'm trying to keep it in the same place.
Well, and Philo sounds more muffled than before the merge.
Didn't the aliens say that?
At some point, Philo...
That seems like a familiar phrase.
What about now?
Now bleepo sounds good.
Sort of.
When we blabber all at the same time, does it still sound good?
No.
That would be the worst.
We can't talk at the...
Wait.
We just talked at the same time and it sounded awesome.
Yeah.
Oh, okay.
Well, let's try it.
I'm doing it right now.
I'm talking at the same time.
Okay.
Blabber, dabber, debber.
Yeah.
Pretend it's a puzzling evidence show.
And I'll put the background music on real loud.
And I shouldn't put on a monster movie, too.
Okay.
So I couldn't hear bleepo.
Yeah, I couldn't either.
That's because I was eating.
Oh, he wasn't actually saying anything.
Yep.
That explains everything.
So let's try it again.
Blippity, bloppity, blippity.
Well, now it's time for me to eat.
I need to eat something.
Shnogger, she neeger, she gooter, she gee.
That sounds like a puzzling evidence show almost.
Where's Hal?
Yep.
We all have our individual...
We all have our individual needs that we have to fulfill while we're on the show.
I'm going to feed my head.
I just...
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
Like Allison, like the Jefferson Airplane did that time.
Yeah.
I remember that.
They admonished me.
They admonished me and directed me to feed my head.
To feed your head.
Yeah.
No, the Dormouse.
The Dormouse said it.
The Dormouse.

The Dormouse said that.
Right.
But Grace Slick told it to me.
Yeah.
That was back when she was hot.
I don't think the Dormouse actually ever says, feed your head, though.
I'm pretty sure the Dormouse does not really say that.
I think he said it to Grace Slick and she was just repeating it.
Right.
Yeah.
It was a private conversation between them.
Yeah.
A private conversation between the Dormouse and Grace Slick.
Because back then, rock stars could have private conversations with Victorian authors.
Well, and Dormouse.
Right.
Right.
And the authors would actually literally channel their characters.
So that's why you hear Dickens in those early Jackson Browne songs, you know?
Wow.
No, I guess I don't know.
But then they made that.
Yeah.
I do, but I was feeding my head, so I couldn't talk.
Boy, I sound so much better than you two guys.
It's unbelievable.
Mark Twain recorded some of the early bits with the Eagles.
They have Mark Twain on there because of that rule.
Okay.
That answers a lot of questions.
That explains a lot.
Can you hear me awesomely now?
Not awesomely, no.
No, but then, you know, I hate that term, awesome.
It's lost its awe.
It no longer calls you.
Can you hear me exactly now?
Now I can hear you exactly.
Okay.
It's funny.
It's funny.
It's almost like when you guys get far.
A little bit away from your phones or something, the digital signal starts to crack up.
I don't like this merge thing much, but that's okay.
We can plow on.
If you guys can FaceTime, we can merge the FaceTimes, I think, and it'll sound even better.
Oh, my gosh.
I'm up for any program.
You do FaceTime.
It's called FaceTime audio.
But it'll drop this connection, right?
Right.
It'll drop this connection.
In the mix, you'll have to cut that part out.
Yeah.
Oh, I don't know how to edit or anything.
I can't.
I don't know how to do that.
I just ended one thing.
I'm looking at Philo.
Speak, Philo.
Speak.
Philo, speak.
I guess I should change now.
See, all of a sudden, listeners, now this has become a TV show in that I can see Philo.
Well, look, I see BK waiting.
Hello.
Oh, hello.
Oh, okay.
Now?
It's like a TV show.
It is.
Oh, and this actually may sound better now.
Oddly enough, it does.
We're using Wi-Fi.
We have a fatter signal.
Yeah.
Yeah, that's what she said.
The listeners don't know that.
Right.
They can't see this.
Thank goodness that Philo would scare them.
They would really, honestly, Philo seen from below with that giant beard and that face.
It's almost hideous.
Well, I guess you can turn the beef heart back up.
There it is.
Oh, oh, oh, wait.
I thought somehow it had interfered with my CD player, but it was just that I hadn't turned it on.
It may mute other things on your computer audio.
Well, this is all coming from another machine.
It's an old CD player running through an incredibly old Radio Shack mixer.
And I'm telling you, because you're doing that old school shit,
and you're using an old school language, your stuff, your excrement sounds better than the other people's excrement.
I know, because, yeah.
We can't say, can we say, like, cow hockey?
Yeah.
Yeah, you can say cow.
You know the rules.
All three of us are radio professionals.
Between the three of us, we've got like 150 years of experience.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.
That's right.








Jesus rode his ass into Jerusalem.
Right.
You can say that.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
But you can't say Mary Magdalene had a really nice ass.
Right.
We don't know that for sure.
We don't know that for sure.
It could be that that may be something we find out to be true at some point.
And another, here's another thing you can't say, even though there won't be any of the seven words in it.
The donkey had his way with Mary Magdalene.
Right.
In front of a big crowd.
No, you can't say that.
That's actually obscene by community standards.
Right.
But you can actually say that and get away with it because it doesn't have any of the seven deadly words in Christ.
No, that's what my point is.
My point is it doesn't have to have any of those seven deadly words.
It just has to be obscene and disgusting.
Well, I think that wouldn't qualify.
Right.
People don't want to see Mary do it in a compromising position.
Well, and we're talking about Mary Magdalene, who was kind of, you know.
She was a whore.
A whore.
Yeah.
A lady of the night.
Was she a saint?
Was she made a saint, too?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
She bet.
All right.
Did she have a gospel that was among the censored, hidden gospels?
Yes, she did.
Yes, she did.
And, you know, Mary Magdalene, when Jesus was taken, when he actually lived through the crucifixion,
he and Mary made it over into southern France.
Right.
That's what some people say.
The pride of Christ stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know at least three people who claim that they're descendants of their Merovingians,
you know.
Of course, I believe all that, you know.
I believe every bit of that.
Nobody believes that I'm a descendant of the Romanovs.
They don't understand that my real name would be not Stang, but Rasputin Romanov.
And that I am the heir to the crown jewels of all the Russias.
I don't expect anybody to believe that.
I believe it.
I do believe it.
I believe it.
But, you know, you'll be surprised to know that I, too, am also almost over 4%.
I'm a 4%-er, man, like you.
4% of what?
Neanderthal?
Neanderthal.
Oh, wow.
That's the real royalty right there.
Oh, really?
Oh, cool.
Wow.
I got 4%.
4%.
I didn't know that.
Wow, that's great.
My dad found out.
My dad did that.
My brother.
That's how come you and I got, you know, we got along so well early on is because we both
had that Neanderthal thing going.
Well, Yetinsani.
Yetinsani.
Have you guys both seen the Zukowski documentary called Struggle?
Oh, yeah.
The story of Stanislav Zukowski.
What's it on?
Netflix.
And they're flogging it.
They're pushing it.
They're pushing it real hard.
It's the first documentary that comes up.
Yeah.
Actual people I know are in that.
It's, yeah, right.
Right.
Well, Bob's in it.
Yeah, that's right.
Bob's in it.
St. Byron Werner is in it, in a still.
Yep.
And my friend Charles Schneider, a brilliant fellow, is actually one of the talking heads.
And, well, Robert Williams, the painter, does a fabulous, yeah, he and his wife, Suzanne,
both, they do a great job.
They do a great job of talking about how brilliant and how crazy the great man was.
We're talking about Zukowski, a Polish artist and scientist who really was a genius artist
and the most crackpot scientist you could ever imagine.
He pieced together an entire new history of the world and history of linguistics, anthropology,
everything, from studying art in museums all over the world from different cultures.
And he just threw out all the history books and all the known science and just said, this
is what is clear from the art.
I'll have you guys know that I got a chance to attend a speaking engagement by Zukowski
at the Dallas Fantasy Fair.
Oh, wow.
And I got to tell him that we admired...
That we believed in Zermattism, but that we felt he had it backwards, that the Yeti
were the good guys and the humans were the bad guys.
And I got treated like a kook by Zukowski.
That's like one of the biggest badges of honor.
I wish I had a recording of it.
But yeah, he just kind of rolled his eyes, looked at the audience and said, well, you
know, many people sometimes get these funny ideas.
I mean, I got funny ideas about my work.
Do you remember in the movie Galaxy Quest?
He was really bummed out.
He was sitting in the...
Zukowski was in Galaxy Quest?
No, I'm talking about...
I'm just making a point.
The actor, Tim Allen, his character sitting there at this convention and he's just heard
what a washed up doofy is in the bathroom.
Right.
And so now he's sitting out there signing autographs.
He's really mad.
Some kid comes up and asks him some arcane question about some really something about
the power thruster for some mathematical thing going on in the ship and he blows up,
you know?
Mr. Shatner, why were the quartz dimethium crystals available only on one planet?
Yeah, Mr. Shatner.
That's you, that's you.
And he's playing Zukowski.
Yeah.
Well, yeah, that was, boy, those Dallas Fantasy Fairs were great.
They brought in Robert Crumb and Ray Harryhausen, but I heard tell and they were run by a young
acquaintance of mine.
He and I were the first, the youngest members of the Dallas Science Fiction Society at one
time.
And he became rich off the Fantasy Fairs and apparently that's what put him out of business.
He got too successful and partied a little too hard.
Yeah.
Everybody who puts on those big conventions tends to, there always seems to be some problem.
Well, you know, my wife and I put on conventions.
Yeah, except you guys, except you guys.
It's just another example.
It's, you see it every day, all the time.
The older I get, the more it just slaps me in the face every day.
It's that people, you see how little power it takes to corrupt a human.
No kidding.
No kidding.
Even in the church of the subgenius, it's like people will get-
The tiniest amount can cause them to just go totally nuts.
Well, they never got to be popular or famous before.
And they don't understand how little that really means.
Yup.
Yeah.
And-
And it's just that it doesn't even take much.
You see it, you can be like, you know, one clerk is above the other clerk.
And so he's lauding it over him because of his greatness.
You know, in his higher position.
I've seen such-
We've seen such tragic examples of that.
And-



And within the church of the subgenius, if you can imagine that.
Yeah.
I can imagine it.
I've seen it myself.
To put, to use the jargon-
So sad.
Bobbies that decide they're now in the hierarchy.
What they don't understand is there never was a hierarchy and there's not really any
such thing as bobbies.
There's a lot of stuff there's not any such thing as, and they, they, they get so worked
up about this stuff.
And then they start treating it like a-




And others like, you know, tools and who, and that everybody gets offended.
And-
Well, you know, it's sort of like there wasn't a such thing as bobbies, but then it's like
a self-fulfilling prophecy and people find their, the niche that fits them in their environment.
Well, it's like the word sheeple.
It's when somebody starts calling everybody else Bobby, that's the Bobby and the people
that, that, that call everybody else sheeple.

Well, they just sound all alike.
Who's the sheeple?
That's how I got my name.
Huh?
Well, I guess I don't know-
I combined Bobby with, with sheeple and I got bleepo.
See?
That's how, that's how I came up with the name.
I guess they have to come up with a new term for a sycophantic butt kissing toady.
You know, I'll tell you, I'll tell you guys a secret.
I wrote down the name Dr. Strange and then crossed out the doctor.
I'm sorry.


I'm sorry.




I got the doctor and a couple of letters and then looked in the Dallas phone book for a
name that wasn't in there with Stang.
That's, that was it.
Philo, on the other hand, who hadn't come up with a name instantly, just like I did,
just did instantly because that was his name.
Just Philo.
Yeah.
You know what, Dr. Drummond, I want-
Philo Drummond.
I want you to know Dr. Drummond.
It really was just like in the air?
That's how you came up with it?





Well, no.
Philo can make up strange but name sounding names just effortlessly.
And I admired that so much.
Remember when we used to give each subgenius a special secret name?
Yeah.
It was too much trouble so we quit doing that.
But Philo whipped out a list of funny sounding names in a minute.
Of course, I was the one who had to write them down.
We put the-
We put together lists several times.
Many, many lists.
Okay, time to- it's time to come up with some more names.
Actually, Bleepo actually does come from, much as the church, a lot of, some ideas in
the church of the subgenius came out of a perverted version of the Fireside Theater's
Bozo's stuff.
Yeah.
Yep.
Yep.
Because my friend-
There's that O again.
Art and O.
Art and O.
And we were talking about evil clowns.
We were into evil clowns way before evil clowns were a thing.
Oh yeah, me too.
And I have lots of proof of it.
Yeah, exactly.
And so I was doing sort of an evil clown bit.
Oh, it's me, Bleepo the Clown.
Ha ha.
Why weren't you in World of the Future?
Or something, you know.
Yeah.
All because of Ed Gein or whatever.
Right.
So he was an evil clown, you know, that would like murder people or whatever.
And so that was Bleepo.
I had no idea we had something like that.






I didn't know what you were talking about.
I didn't know what you were talking about.
I thought you were talking about the clown.
Bleepo the Clown.
I thought you were talking about the clown.



And then when it came time to come up with my subgenius name, I had another character
who was Mr. Abernathy, the spokesperson for your local power company.
Mr. Abernathy.
And he talked like that.
And so I figured I'd combine Bleepo the Clown with Mr. Abernathy, and then that was Bleepo
Abernathy.
It was just my own thing.
No one knew about these characters except me.
Yeah.
It was all in my own head.
News to me.
Yep.
Is Bob going to kill us for being so plain, blunt?
He's going to kill you.
He won't kill me.
Right.
Because I haven't actually gone that far yet.
And I still have the certificate, so he said he's not going to kill me.
He said it, but yeah.
Yeah.
Other people could have bought that certificate several times over.
Yeah.
That's the thing.




They're always up for auction, and you never know about who is in the blind auction, and
they never even tell you when it's yours that's sold.
But that's sort of one of the-
Or how much or how little it's sold for.
Yep.
Yep.
But so I say that I don't think I have any enemies, but yeah.
They're probably lurking right now, listening to this.
Well, I know I have enemies.
But there's so many-
It kind of runs in the family.
Yeah.
There's so many federal agencies listening right now.
Why?
The FBI, the NSA, the TSA.
Oh, I think they quit on us a long time ago.
I think they got bored with us.
Like all these guys talk about is monster movies and comic books and stuff.
No, they hoover up all that stuff.
They have a big machine.
I was actually in San Francisco when they installed it.
Oh.
The telephone company was complicit with us.
But the government said, we need this.
And the telephone company was like, you want me to jump?
How high and how far?
Right.
Yeah.
Spy on all citizens with a giant computer?
Sure.
So they made this-
Yeah.
Yeah.
They made this network that can hoover data of all the phone calls, all the where they
go, and the metadata that goes along with that stuff.
And they harvest all that stuff for the NSA.
And then they have robots, algorithms that are constantly plowing through that stuff,
looking for things.
Yeah.
But look how mistranslated that stuff usually ends up.
I mean, we've all played around with our smartphones to see what kind of gibberish it would translate
our gibberish into.
Yeah.
But they have the power of massive, huge, huge amounts of data.
Even smarter than an iPhone Plus, 6 Plus?
So they don't have to look at an individual to come up with trends that they can then
use to target individuals.
Right.
Yeah.

So, do you think the word frop triggers anything?
Probably didn't until just then.
I hope so.

But the word trigger does.
Oh, uh-oh.
No, trigger does.
Yeah.
As soon as you say trigger, oh man, there's like 10 more people listening right now.
Well, but the word before that was frop, so now-
You don't want to say Muslim.
Uh-oh.
Oh, damn.
Goddammit.
Sorry.
Muslimics.
That's what my son and I call those people.


Muslimics.
It's kind of a takeoff on someone we know who actually talks that way.
Oh, dear.
Yeah.
Wow, the Captain Beefheart music that you guys can't hear just ended, and I think I'll
leave it off.
You know what?
I'm eating big hunks of chocolate right now.
I'm pals on Facebook with the drummer from Captain Beefheart's Magic Band.
Which one?
Oh, come on.
What's his name?
It's-
John French.
John French?
No, the other one.
There's a guy named Art.
Oh, come on.
He's got a name like another name.
A guy named Art.
Obviously, he's not a good friend, but he's selling the drumheads.
He's selling the drumheads from Captain Beefheart, so if you want the big bass drumhead that
says Captain Beefheart, you can get that now.
Wow.
Yeah, he lives near me, in fact.
I was surprised to see he lives like in North Hollywood.
Right.
Well, I was going to say, a lot of people live near you, Bleepo.
Famous people, super famous people.
Well, Chuck McCann told me to live here.
It was actually because of the great voice talent and funny man, Chuck McCann.
He said, Billy, you should live over here.
Here's where you should live.
And he was right.
I live there now.
Chuck McCann's film, The Projectionist, was the first time I ever saw found footage
repurposed.
And, you know, he had a little world of the future.
The terrible world of the future and then the wonderful world of the future were two
collages that he built into that movie.
That was a huge influence on me as a low-budget editor.
Which movie?
The Projectionist by Chuck McCann.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I remember that.
It was pretty obscure at the time.
Yeah.
And, you know, this was back in the day when you couldn't just rent a video.
Yeah, and you couldn't just get your movie distributed.
Right.
Yeah, I saw it at some really weird art film porno theater in Dallas.
Right, right.
Because I think there's a breast in it at one point, I think.
Yeah, maybe.
Or there might be.
I can't remember.
Anyway, yeah, that and the movie Head also had a media barrage found footage chop up.

And really fractured flickers.
Remember that old show?
Yep.
Yep.
Silent movies with all those Jay Ward voices doing shi-e-ko.
I have a copy of a bunch of those.
I have a whole bunch of those.
There's a few people that did that.
Also, the Fireside Theater Jay Men.
Right, Jay Men Forever.
Yeah.
That's another one of those pastiches of old footage.
Yeah.
That they repurposed and did their own soundtrack to.
And it's hilarious.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The one that though I had to direct people to is you go on YouTube and you type in Green
Boy.
It's hard to find unless you do this.
You type in Green Boy, G-R-E-E-N-B-O-Y, official.
Huh.
And just watch that thing.
It's a takeoff on Dragnet that a friend of mine did.
Oh, oh, okay.
Okay.
I remember the Green Boy.
Yeah.
Mike Upchurch co-wrote a lot of the Mr. Show episodes and he was a writer for the Chris
Rock Show.
Wow.
And he's my buddy out here and he is putting together a new thing that I'm helping him
with a little bit with the sound.
And I'm also in a little bit.
But he takes old footage.
I'm not going to say what the new footage is that we're doing that's old footage, but he
takes old footage from like an existing TV show or a movie and then he adds contemporary
actors and situations to it and they had dialogue.
So you see this actor having dialogue with, you know, what's his name?
Joe Friday there.
Yeah.
Oh, yeah.
In the Dragnet thing.
I had a conversation with Joe Friday at Burning Man.
They had a...
There was this camp that had a life-size jacket.
Jack Webb photo with a speaker behind it and they were in a tent kind of secretly watching
you and they could hear you.
I walked up and said, hi, Sergeant Friday.
And they would play...
They must have had some device that would cue...
It was like a soundboard.
Yeah.
It was a soundboard that would cue up these tapes from Dragnet of Jack Webb lines, you
know, and he'd go, just the facts, ma'am.
Just the facts.
Just the facts.
I'd go, oh, the facts.
Okay.
Well, we've...
I'm from Church of the Subgenius.
We found our way to this crazy place here and I don't know what's...
You know, LSD is the bomb.
You know, that kind of...
It just triggered these things that they had some control over.
So it was like a conversation with an AI a little bit.
Well, yeah.
This...
What's the point, Mr. Nell?
What are you trying to tell us?
Yeah.
What?
There it was.
There you go.
You want to get to the point, Mr. Nell?
What is it?
What are you trying to tell us?
Philo's so good with that.
He could...
Philo could pull stuff up.
Of course, you've been...
Philo, you've been observing K-Rob for years.
K-Rob is the guy that does sound with Dr. Hal.
It was Wednesday, December 24th.
We were working the day watch out of Berkeley.
That guy's incredible at just whipping...
All right.
My partner's Frank Smith.
Yeah.
What'd you do, Philo?
Just type in Jack Webb?
Jack Webb.
Yeah.
Just drag that sound board.
Oh, my God.
Wow, really?
That's great.
Yeah.
I've had a number of them...
There's several of them came up.
Oh, my God.
There's another one.
Wow.
I used to do that on the show.
I'd be on the...
Sitting there on the show...
Well, yeah.
I've heard you do it a million times.
Yeah.
They'd say something, I'd pull it up and then I'd play it into the mic from my phone.
Right.
Something like that.
Too bad we're not on a show now.
I wish I was on a show.
Yeah.





I'm getting ready to post the last
Puzzling Evidence show I was on
Wow
That was like two years ago
On your video?
On your Roku thing?
I have a Mixcloud page where I post
Oh the Mixcloud
Just Puzzling Evidence shows
Heck Philo has a TV channel
I know the Roku
Yeah
That's wonderful
I'm so glad it's you and not me
Well here
This might intrigue you
Because now
Before we could only host
10 videos at any given point in time
So I had to kind of rotate things
And
You know
The content wasn't always as fresh as it could be
But now
I've got
5 slots
But each slot can be an infinite number of things
Good God
Wow
Good Lord
So now I'm just in the process of putting everything that I ever did out there
And I'm going to be looking for new content before long
Anyone with a Roku device
Which costs about 20 bucks
Can watch
Subgenius television
Including
Bulldada movie of the week
W-E-A-K
And the great
St. Joe Riley's archival show
Hypnotic Eye
Yeah
Hypnotic Eye
Oh wow
The new Dobbs film short fest series
Is on there
Those are great
The new
And then of course the Ministry of Slack
We have that series out there
We only have one season so far
We're going to hope to make more
Yeah but it's a real TV show
With a backdrop and a laugh track
God the laugh track is so great on that
Yeah pretty funny
Rev X is
Do you have that on YouTube?
Is that on YouTube too?
It's on my Vimeo channel
On Vimeo okay
Cool
Yeah that's better than YouTube
Vimeo.com slash Philodrummon
And then just search around
You'll find Ministry of Slack out there
But I would suggest you watch them in sequence
Yeah listeners you don't even have to have a Roku
You just get on your computer and go to Vimeo and type in Philodrummon
Cool
And everything that we host on Roku is actually served from that Vimeo page
Oh
Oh
Oh
That's our server Vimeo
Hi
Listeners I feel like I should explain a couple of things about our guests tonight
Actually Lonesome Cowboy Dave was planning to call in
But I think he felt bad or something tonight
But Reverend Bleepo has been like a creative
Author
Audio engineer and producer at many radio stations
He worked with Howard Stern for years and years at that station Stern was at
I'm not allowed to say that
I worked at the station that Howard worked at
Right
Made very clear to me that I should never ever say I worked with Howard Stern
Oh
I remember them mentioning you on the air once
Or twice
Several times
I would work with him but I didn't work with him
They complained about your patchouli
Okay
And your
And they knew that you were some kind of a pagan-y woo-woo
You know some you were going to these Starwood things
By the way did you know Hal was a guest at Starwood last year?
Dr. Hal
And he's going to be next year
And he's going to be at X-Day because somebody just donated 700 bucks
To pay for Hal's plane ticket
Wow
To come and go to Starwood
And his lodging
That's wonderful
Because I lost money on X-Day last year
And I couldn't afford to do the Hal thing
And the guy that used to help is already on the saucers
Dr. Dark
But I did a little fundraiser
I just said we're really hurting for money to bring in Dr. Hal
And raised 250 bucks
And then this one subgenius couple
I probably shouldn't say who
But they're at X-Day
At most X-Days
And they wanted to see Dr. Hal
Passed the pressure
No no it wasn't passed the pressure
It was a different couple
Oh yeah I forgot we're on the air
Yeah yeah I don't want to you know compromise anyone's security
You don't want to say people's names
Right
Or I mean and what if the other subgeniuses find out
What they sent Stang 700 bucks just for Hal
What are they going to send me if I play sad?
So anyway
I'm sad
Yes Bleepo here now lives in Hollywood
And is an actor
He always wanted to be a cartoon voice
And he's ended up being all kinds of cartoon people
Well yes I'm still actually trying to break through the cartoon ceiling
But you worked with what's left of the Fireside Theater
I know and you know what
They're
Yeah it's hard to get a gig
You'd be surprised
You'd be surprised at the people that aren't getting cast
Not that I'm saying I won't get cast
But
But it's very very competitive
It's ridiculously competitive
And they don't want to hire anybody
Over the age of 40
Right
Or the age of 30
Right
Yeah
Well my son moved out there
Even for the voices
With a degree in film
From M.A.C.
And he couldn't get any job
For a year
He couldn't get a job delivering pizza
For a year
When he finally did get a job
It was at a really good production place
But his job was to repair their Macintoshes
Right
Thank goodness he knew how to do that
Eventually he let on that he could edit
And they let him be an editor
And then he became a director
Just before they closed
And
And

Now
that lived above me.
And so the apartment would get flooded above me,
and then my apartment would get flooded,
including, of course, where the tapes were.
I've got all the reel-to-reel tapes
that you ever sent me, Bleepo,
in my Dobbs shed,
the climate-controlled special facility
that I had built.
Just for my tapes.
For the rest of my life.
Just for your tapes and my tapes.
It has my old reel-to-reel tapes, too.
And a wall of VHS,
because that's what we filmed stuff on
for a long time.
Yep.
I threw out all the...
People don't know what that means.
I think it means very high signal.
Vehicular hickey salamander.
It is something like that.
It's a vertical...
Do I hear...
It's vertical helical scan.
Yeah, vertical helical scan.
That's right.
Do I hear Zandy in the back there?
No, I don't.
No.
Oh, I thought I heard Zandy.
No, I was starving,
so I came in here to eat.
No, Zandy's in...
And there's television in the other room.
Oh, it sounds like Zandy.
No, he's in Dallas.
That's two hours away.
Oh, okay.
He's talking about Zandy as my son.
He's now, like, 40.
I don't know how my dad felt.
I'd come in the house,
hadn't seen my dad in a year,
and he'd go,
Ivan, I can't believe my own son's got
a long gray beard and a beer gut.
I don't have the beer gut anymore.
That's good.
Well, I had a heart attack,
and I had to completely change my lifestyle.
Big time.
Bigly.
Very bigly.
One time, my dad looked at me,
and he looked down at my gut
and looked up at me,
and he goes,
well, you finally gave up, huh?
Yeah.
Oh, my God, that hurts.
Oh, geez.
Yeah.
Wow.
You finally gave up, huh, son?
Listeners, I'm going to do a little bit more.
Now that we've been recording for over an hour,
I was going to say who these guys are.
Dr. Philo Drummond, well, I mean,
that's a household name,
but I wouldn't know about Bob
were it not for Dr. Drummond.
I wouldn't have this.
I wouldn't have known his job as sacred scribe.
I wouldn't have known the word slack.
Well, yeah, I would have known slack,
but I wouldn't have known about the conspiracy by that name.
Yeah.
Yeah, me neither.
There's a lot of, you know,
file a new Bob before anybody.
And here's another weird thing.
So they say.
Dr. Drummond is the one who finally got me on the internet
around 19.
Ninety four.
So I'd been hearing all these nerds had been telling me,
you got to get on the internet.
It's bulletin boards, bulletin boards.
I was going, what the hell are they talking about?
And then you get mailed by computer.
They were so bad.
And they were terrible at explaining what it was.
Believe it or not, the first email I ever got mailed to me
was from Penn Gillette.
Oddly enough.
Wow.
And he was trying to get.
Really?
To understand it.
But it was not until Philo,
who I think by that time lived in Missouri,
came to my house and he said,
do you have one of those AOL discs that comes every day in the mail?
Because this was like 1980.
No, 19, about 1993.
91 or two.
Yeah, 91 or two.
He goes, and I said, well, yeah, of course.
And he goes, and he shoves it in my machine.
He doesn't have a whole stack of them.
He doesn't have 700 of them.
He doesn't have 700 of them.
Right.
For the first time, I found myself actually seeing the internet on my little classic Mac
or whatever I had.
And the World Wide Web hadn't even been invented.
No, we had Prodigy and CompuServe.
Right.
Well, see, first I was on AOL, which at that time, believe it or not, kids, was $3 a month.

And the general goal of a device for this were people going multimedia attacks.
And I didn't even realize it something real, out of nowhere from Google.
I called Apple.
I said, well, what is that thing called?

I said.

That against me.


I thought Apple was like, well, if I pay you for this, I'm going to work with you or

And funnily enough, I ended up coming back to Google's digital not help me on my way




What was cool about it though is, first of all, I was going on back fixed wanting
to use the internet to work at Apple because I only had required г and ug and running
a company.
right and then usenet i i went out and i found some books about usenet and um
there was a great guy there's a guy named adam told you about it yeah i remember printing out
a whole bunch of stuff on the use right that was the thing it's called alt dot slack right before
we even were there well see that kind of turned me off because it was reams of paper and it was
unedited so it was like you got the previous post reprints over and over and over again and i didn't
understand really what i was looking at there were only four people on the internet then and
okay so yeah but they were all really smart right so different one was one was the fire sign theater
one was bob robert anton wilson was on and robert anton wilson and the residents the residents were
also there and also uh
i forgot there was frank zappa didn't want to hear about it yeah oh david bowie david bowie was
the other one yeah so just those well i'm the swedish guy that invented hypertext markup
language or ht oh yeah yeah the swedish the swedish chef yes so yes but it may have evolved
what was his name something anyway it was fine it was after a hundred nerds all those
bowie and all those other people had tried to
explain the internet to me it just didn't get through until dr drummond at my house plugged it
in and turned it on and said here's what the deal is and uh yeah within a few months i had
was using uh usenet for all kinds of things uh porn i mean the porno faucet was unbelievable
even then i think pornography is kind of driven 20 minutes you can get a picture of a naked girl
yeah to
show up yeah they show up line by line by line right but they were the innovators for multimedia
on the internet was pornography because that's where the money was um and in fact the subgenius
website is on a server that is mostly used for high-end porno things so that's why we're banned
in some hotels and classrooms but just because the the company that we're that we used
it was jesus that set me up with that but anyway yeah it's like i i had to become self-taught
with the internet just as i had to fake my way through when video replaced film
and then of course the internet replaced video we all had to self-educate and move
television what places smell a vision but philo uh was working as an arms dealer for the
internet and he was a real early adapter and it just uh but he wasn't a nerd and so he was able to
make sense of it for me and i thank you for that dr drummond well you're welcome but what you guys
said was true is true is true is true is true is true
from pr news in washington i'm tempered by cautionary reminders to
keep it respectful but the sexual path is the only sex path the russian government says 4.72
and 4.16 earlier this year the russian government says it is listening to pr news
the show the hour of slack
