1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,640
I am seeking information about Bob. Let us see what is on the radio.

2
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:11,940
You're listening to PR News.

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,980
No, I don't think I can accept that program.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,100
Nor that man.

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:22,740
Yes.

6
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,760
Well, you know what? I'm high. It's simpler than you think.

7
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:44,640
By the time we finish, you're all going to know everything that you need to know to be able to get high in a flash.

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,260
I'm going to show you how to get high with two hands.

9
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:50,320
I never do because it takes too long.

10
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,340
Tonight at 9.

11
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,580
Let's get high and have fun.

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,560
I'm.

13
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,000


14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:02,840
Falling.

15
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:10,620
And I can't give up.

16
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,840
Calling Dr. Howard. Dr. Fine. Dr. Howard.

17
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:16,780
No, I'm a doctor, not a mechanic.

18
00:01:16,980 --> 00:01:19,080
We're losing potency in our antimatter parts.

19
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:20,200
My mind is growing.

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:22,820
I can feel it.

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:27,820
You see? You see? You're stupid minds. Stupid. Stupid.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,200
Are you talking about the mind shafting gap?

23
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,700
Where you've been shafted in the mind again?

24
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,620
Right in the gap?

25
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,540
I'm a poor.

26
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,040
I'm a poor.

27
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:43,300
What?

28
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:44,880
What?

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,040
It's a beer.

30
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,540
I'm a poor.

31
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,120
I'm a poor.

32
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,100
I'm a poor.

33
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,420
I'm a poor.

34
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:52,600
I'm a poor.

35
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:52,840
I'm a poor.

36
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:53,680
I'm a poor.

37
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:54,100
I'm a poor.

38
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:54,440
Huh?

39
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,600
Being of a blood mind.

40
00:01:59,680 --> 00:01:59,980
I'm a poor.

41
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:00,740
Is that hurt?

42
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,460
Do

43
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:03,980
Hereby

44
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,220
Be

45
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:06,260
Queeth

46
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,560
Benadryl

47
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,160
Eve

48
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:08,360
Stop!

49
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:08,660


50
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:08,980
Stop!

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,400
You're dressed

52
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,400


53
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,400


54
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,400


55
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:16,840
Way

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:16,840


57
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,000
Way

58
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,480
There's a lord

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,840
Tell the lady

60
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,560
I am now

61
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,540
Well, guess why now?

62
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,100
So beware of falsehood.

63
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:41,060
So you're the man who gets drunk and kills innocent people with his car, are you?

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,580
Did you know you were putting a cell phone right into your brain?

65
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:49,760
That's the truth, and that's why I'd use a cell phone.

66
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,500
But guess what? There's a brain phone called Ray.

67
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:53,500
That's R-A-Y.

68
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,380
Ray is a small chip that attaches right into your brain, right next to the antenna.

69
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,960
Takes about 20 seconds.

70
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,580
Once in place, Ray's patent-pending subtle energy technology

71
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:07,940
immediately begins to counter the effects of the government without affecting your brain.

72
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,480
The cost of Rayway? Only $5,444.95.

73
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,880
Order right now.

74
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:13,220
Now.

75
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,080
Dot.com.

76
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,420
We enjoy the rich flavor of the products we've made with our minds.

77
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:25,660
The human mind is capable of more than you know in your show,

78
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,020
your dog and pony show, your light.

79
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,800
And dark shadow show.

80
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,660
For one thing, the human brain is fattening.

81
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:39,360
For another thing, it's fattening so much it's going to take over very soon the rest of the body.

82
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,220
Deep fried.

83
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,360
But it's buttery and sugary.

84
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,740
So, well, some of the human brain.

85
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:48,940
Other parts are bitter and sour.

86
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,460
Have you ever jacked in?

87
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,100
Have you ever wire tripped?

88
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,620
It was terrible. It was just terrible.

89
00:03:56,780 --> 00:03:58,120
I'll never get over it.

90
00:03:58,380 --> 00:03:58,960
As long as I live.

91
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,400
It was terrible.

92
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,420
It was just terrible.

93
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,700
I'll never get over as long as I live.

94
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:05,140
It was terrible.

95
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,220
It was just terrible.

96
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:08,520
I'll never get over as long as I live.

97
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,980
It was terrible.

98
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,020
It was just terrible.

99
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,320
I'll never get over as long as I live.

100
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:22,080
It's alive.

101
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,900
It's alive.

102
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,220
In the line

103
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,060
Deadly church

104
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,380
Are creaking over the earth

105
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,840
Killing every human in their path

106
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,200
Radioactivity's a constant thing

107
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,040
Radioactivity's a constant thing

108
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,740
It's the ride

109
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:20,640
It's the ride

110
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,680
Phineas Narco

111
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:28,160
From Midnight

112
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,260
Voice Jail

113
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:31,040
Did that

114
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,600
And before that we heard some

115
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,020
ESO Swamp Radio

116
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,040
From WCSB Cleveland

117
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,700
Host Chaz Smith

118
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,260
With Lonesome Cowboy Dave

119
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,320
Yours truly Reverend Ivan Stang

120
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,380
And Princess Lear Doe

121
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:47,640
And friends all hours of slack

122
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:48,560
It seems are

123
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:50,480
Lighten and dripping

124
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,600
With collage pieces

125
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,020
By Fernanda Nande

126
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,380
Lee Murr

127
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,520
This

128
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,640
Particular show

129
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,960
Hour of Slack number

130
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,960
905

131
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,240
Is an educational show

132
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,860
With the subject matter being

133
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,820
Drugs

134
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:10,600
Yes

135
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,760
It is educational

136
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,840
Now

137
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,520
Well

138
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,460
Now let's go back to ESO

139
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,680
Swamp Radio

140
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,440
About a month ago we had just gotten back

141
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,020
From doing field research

142
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,240
On Entheo Musicology

143
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,220
At a conference of scientists

144
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,380
Who specialize in that

145
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:34,180
It was a slack filled

146
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:34,940
Starwood

147
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:37,140
As such things go

148
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,420
Partly because it rained so much

149
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,980
There wasn't much to do but hide out

150
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:42,020
With your loved one

151
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:44,400
Or your right hand

152
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,220
Well Starwood's this outdoor festival

153
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:48,520
Run by the

154
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,080
Crazy people and crazy people perform

155
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,260
And it's just insanity

156
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,200
In the mud

157
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,160
Late at night you see these neon giants

158
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:57,500
And they're all like

159
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:57,500


160
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:57,500


161
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:57,500


162
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:57,500


163
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:57,500


164
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:57,500


165
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:57,500


166
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,140
Stalking the campground

167
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,960
That were actually

168
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,160
Not hallucinations

169
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,900
But giant puppets

170
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:06,500
Rod puppets

171
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,400
Twice the size of a person

172
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,840
They were kind of tied like Waldo machines

173
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,200
To a human

174
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,800
But you didn't even see the human

175
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,840
Because they'd be in the darkness

176
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,600
The giant puppet is lit up

177
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,660
To freak out those on ketamine

178
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,520
Which was going around that campground

179
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,240
That particular

180
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,200
Now is that a legal or illegal substance?

181
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,520
Ketamine is legal if you're a horse

182
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,100
That needs to be tranquilized

183
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,000
Or if you're a vet who needs to administer

184
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,220
The tranquilization

185
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,240
I didn't touch that stuff

186
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,220
I saw that movie Altered States

187
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,740
It turns you into a caveman

188
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,000
And you run to the zoo and rip up the

189
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,740
Taper throats

190
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:48,360
Yeah

191
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,660
Crop circle makers were there

192
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,220
Reverend Circle Maker

193
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:55,180
Was at my house

194
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,480
I just sent him

195
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,100
Back home to Wales

196
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,100
The other day

197
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:03,940
We had one of the many

198
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,440
Crop circle artists

199
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,420
The people who

200
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:10,220
Make crop circles for the aliens

201
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,320
We're not saying the aliens

202
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,180
Don't direct the making of the crop circles

203
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,340
Or anything like that

204
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:18,420
It's just that most of the crop circles

205
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,800
Were made by these

206
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:21,940
British

207
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:24,260
Coffee drinkers

208
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,740
Let's say

209
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:27,400
Who like to stay up real late at night

210
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,020
And make artwork

211
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,880
Out of

212
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,060
Farmer's fields

213
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:31,880
Illegally

214
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,160
I was talking to one of these

215
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,260
These K people

216
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,500
And they talked all about

217
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,040
Going down the K hole

218
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:41,260
Yeah the K hole of special K

219
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,360
Ketamine

220
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,420
And they told me it was a club drug

221
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:47,840
And I couldn't imagine it

222
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:49,700
Being like a dancey kind of thing

223
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,300
No I've been told just the opposite

224
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,420
Really?

225
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:52,940
Yeah

226
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,080
That it's a what drug?

227
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,960
Well the guy

228
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,280
Has told me

229
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,280
He took some

230
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:02,080
He got up about 30 seconds later

231
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,120
And started to change channels on the TV

232
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,420
And fell to the floor

233
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,460
And at that point he said in very slow motion

234
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:13,760
I don't think this is a club drug

235
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:17,760
And that was the last thing he was able to say

236
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,540
As he lost contact with his body

237
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,300
But went on to another planet

238
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,880
Inside his own head

239
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,120
Apparently

240
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,480
I don't think this is a club drug

241
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,480


242
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,480


243
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,480


244
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:27,480


245
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,080
One person said

246
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,680
It's just like being real drunk

247
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,260
It's like drinking a whole lot of vodka

248
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:35,640
But without swallowing

249
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,680
But the guy who said it

250
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,260
Didn't sound like he was very drunk

251
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,060
When he said it

252
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,900
So I didn't believe that exactly

253
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:46,120
I think the numbness and disconnection

254
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:46,820
From your body

255
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,560
Is the vodka like aspect

256
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,900
But then there's some kind of a weird

257
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,380
Interior head trip

258
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,020
That you do

259
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,480
And you know ketamine is classed

260
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,280
As a telepathine

261
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,440
Wow

262
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,400
That is it causes people to

263
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,600
Telepathize

264
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,580
Think that they're experiencing telepathy

265
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:08,500
Especially with somebody else

266
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,020
Who happens to be on the stuff

267
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,460
Yeah

268
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,760
There's a very interesting article about that

269
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,640
In Paul Craster's new book

270
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:18,200
Magic Mushrooms and something something

271
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,980
About going to John Lilly's house

272
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,000
And taking ketamine

273
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
And getting in the isolation chamber

274
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,300
And freaking out

275
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:27,420
But then

276
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:30,160
Hearing John Lilly's mind

277
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,320
Speak to him to calm him down

278
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,460
Which somebody else later said

279
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,060
Well yeah he did go and sit outside

280
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:38,020
The tank with his hand on it

281
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:38,940
While tripping

282
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,860
And he didn't say anything

283
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,160
But he looked like he was beaming

284
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:45,620
Calm down trip guidance

285
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:46,660
Into the tank

286
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:49,160
And you picked up on it man

287
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,060
If you believe that sort of thing

288
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,820
You picked up on it

289
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,220
Personally I've found that when people

290
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,700
Get drunk as a lord on psychotomimicry

291
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:57,920
And they're on drugs

292
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,880
What they want to happen sometimes happen

293
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,380
Like them red lights on that phone

294
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,080
You think that might be Dave?

295
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:05,440
CSB

296
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:08,240
Hello

297
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,400
Man

298
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,380
CSB

299
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,220
Hey

300
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,360
That's not Dave

301
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,440
I'm not Dave dude

302
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,500
How you be?

303
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:21,560
It's Echo Man

304
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,180
Echo Man

305
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,320
Is this the ketamine dude?

306
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:26,940
You know it's me?

307
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,520
How you doin'?

308
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:33,120
Is this the disembodied spirit of Sam Phillips?

309
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,380
I don't know

310
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,940
Call back in a few minutes

311
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,000
Hello?

312
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,960
Yes who is it?

313
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,600
From PR News

314
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:51,820
This is week edition

315
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:54,240
I'm from Cimarron Kansas

316
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,640
Ha ha ha

317
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:56,960
Ha ha ha

318
00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,640
And where you from?

319
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:01,040
Cimarron Kansas

320
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:02,100
I think you're from

321
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,400
Sssssssss sssssssss

322
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:03,900
Cimarron

323
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,200
Are you ready to play Let's Play?

324
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,760
Alright today's first word ends in O

325
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:10,780
Oh?

326
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,080
And the second word starts with O-R

327
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,520
Okay

328
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,920
Right number one is

329
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,660
A floor rug made into something you smoke

330
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,060
You might say

331
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:20,480
Whoa

332
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:20,980
Ahhh

333
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:22,280
Okay

334
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,720
The first word is pipe

335
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:25,680
Oooh

336
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,040
Oh, fuck.

337
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,320
You might say the first word is James Bond's zits.

338
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:31,980
Oh, sure.

339
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,020
You might say the first famous broadcaster of Japanese zits.

340
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,940
Nasty mouth.

341
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,320
You might say the first word improves old zits.

342
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,900
I enjoyed the tongue infection.

343
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:55,220
And your last one, a cry at a Washington Zit Ball game.

344
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:55,920
Ow!

345
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,460
You're a idiot!

346
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,240
You should have listened to me.

347
00:12:59,500 --> 00:12:59,900
Goodbye.

348
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:00,440
Goodbye.

349
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,020
Oh, thank you.

350
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,980
Watch her carefully.

351
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,580
Don't take your eyes off her.

352
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:06,980
All right.

353
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:07,800
Drop the gun.

354
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,180
So, let's look at Bob.

355
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,980
I use it almost every day of my life, even if just for a minute or two.

356
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:22,380
So, in something like one or two seconds, you've gotten the buzz going with the gentle inner's pure dynamite.

357
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,320
Believe me, you'll know it when you have it.

358
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,380
I don't know.

359
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,160
It might be pretty scary in there.

360
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,020
And you hold on to that as you're Bob.

361
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:46,660
And pump up that tender feeling coming from that smile until it just becomes.

362
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,820
Take off, joy life.

363
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,620
Do it.

364
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:53,980
And get that want motor revved up for wanting brings passion.

365
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,280
Passion brings.

366
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:55,960
Bob.

367
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:56,720
Bob.

368
00:13:56,940 --> 00:14:02,700
Brings more wanting, but also stake your claim for universal or intangible things such as.

369
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,820
I'm so sorry.

370
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:04,720
I'm so sorry.

371
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,480
I'm so sorry.

372
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,300
You're my boy.

373
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,080
Afterward, I knew the rules.

374
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,980
I understood what I was supposed to do, but I didn't.

375
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:16,920
I couldn't.

376
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,680
I was compelled to stay.

377
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:22,100
Compelled to disobey.

378
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,660
And now here I am.

379
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:27,280
I stand because of you.

380
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:27,760
Bob.

381
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:28,820
Because of you.

382
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,860
I am no longer an agent of this system.

383
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,840
Because of you.

384
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I've changed.

385
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,360
I'm unplugged.

386
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,400
A new man.

387
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,420
So to speak.

388
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:38,340
Like you.

389
00:14:38,580 --> 00:14:39,840
Apparently free.

390
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,400
Congratulations.

391
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:43,280
Thank you.

392
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,760
Friends, you're floating in a sea of pills.

393
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:50,120
A sea of Bob's pills.

394
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,760
But you're just too blind yet to, done to see them.

395
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:54,840
Oh.

396
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,640
I'm not blind.

397
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:55,640


398
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:55,640


399
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:55,640


400
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:55,640


401
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:55,640


402
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:55,640


403
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:55,640


404
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:55,640


405
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:55,640


406
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:55,640


407
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,260
Oh, friends.

408
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:02,360
I know you're not the dumb-asticated type.

409
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:05,880
I know you're the smart-asticated type.

410
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:12,140
Oh, but people say, Reverend Stagg, what is slack?

411
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,700
I want you to tell me what slack is.

412
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:24,620
You know, friends, the television doesn't have to watch you as long as you are watching

413
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:25,300
the television.

414
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:33,300
And a lot of people, a lot of people think that slack is that Miller beer commercial

415
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,440
where everybody's good looking and you're rich and your team just won the game and you're

416
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,160
drinking Miller beer and your favorite show is on.

417
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:45,240
And you know that's bullshit because slack is not laziness, friends.

418
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:47,980
Slack is getting into the zone.

419
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:54,620
It's being awake and alert and doing what you wanted to do until your eyes snap open

420
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,640
and you're stuck.

421
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:58,280
That's good.

422
00:15:58,280 --> 00:15:58,540
That's bad.

423
00:16:01,140 --> 00:16:10,900
That's better than getting too wasted and trying toん going oops!

424
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:14,060
You know you've been here long enough longer than in my opinion because it's so boring

425
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,640
Mums!

426
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,220
I don't know if I have to say anything to you.

427
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:18,580
Please be nice.

428
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:18,580


429
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:18,580


430
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:25,620
I am in charge of your children from language and information, but this is fucking begging

431
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,740
It's not the right time to be sober

432
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:51,860
Now the idiots have taken over

433
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,240
Spreading like a social cancer

434
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,040
Is there an answer?

435
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,380
Mensa membership exceeding

436
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:05,240
Tell me why in hell are all the stupid people breeding?

437
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:07,400
Watchin' it's really elementary

438
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,100
The ingestible revolution

439
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,440
Has flipped the bitch on evolution

440
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:18,220
The benevolent and wise are being wanted out to size

441
00:17:18,220 --> 00:17:19,240
What a bummer

442
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:22,580
The world keeps getting dumber

443
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,220
It's not the right time to be sober

444
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,840
The insensitivity is standard

445
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,300
And faith is being fancied over reason

446
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:34,400
It's always rolling over and it's toughening

447
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,680
Cause I think it starts surviving much less often

448
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:41,100
Now everything seems to be reversing

449
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,680
And it's worsening

450
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,680
Someone plopped a steamer in the gene pool

451
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:52,420
Now angry my mentality is no longer the exception it's the rule

452
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:54,200
And I'm starting to feel a lot like a fool now

453
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:54,200


454
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,860
Strong Heston

455
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,280
Stranded on a private planet

456
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Apes and orangutans that ran into the ground

457
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,840
With generals and the armies that obeyed them

458
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,220
Followers following fables

459
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:13,800
Philosophies that enable them to rule without regard

460
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:23,940
There's no point for democracy when ignorance is celebrated

461
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:33,160
Political scientists get the same one vote as someone can talk in bread

462
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,280
Majority rule

463
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:41,300
Don't work in mental institutions

464
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,900
Sometimes the smallest, softest voice carries the grand

465
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,820
PG solutions

466
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,180
What are we left with?

467
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,760
A nation of God-fearing pregnant nationalists

468
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:00,240
Who feel it's their duty to populate the homeland

469
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,300
Pass on traditions

470
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,100
How to get ahead with legions

471
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,220
And prosperity via subaltern culture

472
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:13,460
The idiots have taken over

473
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:16,780
The idiots have taken over

474
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:20,120
The idiots have taken over

475
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,520
The idiots have taken over

476
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:26,760
The Idiots have Taken Over

477
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:30,260
The Idiots have Taken Over

478
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:32,280
Do you want to help?

479
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,280


480
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:32,660
The Idiots have taken over

481
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,560
The idiots have taken over

482
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:36,860
The Idiots are takingover

483
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,480
The Idiots are taking over

484
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:46,260
No FX, friends, was the name of the band that did that.

485
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:56,180
Before that, me and ESO at XX Day in 1999 in Brushwood

486
00:19:56,180 --> 00:20:01,600
with some clips from my cousin, Agent Smith,

487
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,920
from the Matrix Rebloated.

488
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:10,860
And the Bob Meditation Collage was by Reverend Jartow.

489
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:17,200
Now, friends, you understand that Bob, J.R. Bob Dobbs, replaces drugs.

490
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:21,040
This church is often misunderstood in that respect,

491
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,160
especially by the man and idiots

492
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:29,360
who glean everything they know only from surface appearances.

493
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,120
But, as you well know,

494
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,580
appearances can be deceiving,

495
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:39,320
which brings me back to the reason why we're here.

496
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:42,920
We're not here because we're free.

497
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,720
We're here because we're not free.

498
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:49,120
There's no escaping reason, no denying purpose,

499
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:54,660
because as we both know, without purpose, we would not exist.

500
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,440
It is purpose that created us.

501
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,180
Purpose that connects us.

502
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,700
Purpose that pulls us.

503
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,740
That guides us.

504
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:03,100
That drives us.

505
00:21:03,580 --> 00:21:05,580
It is purpose that defines.

506
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,380
Purpose that binds us.

507
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:09,440
Can I have some?

508
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,920
Uh, can I get you a cup of coffee?

509
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,420
Yes.

510
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:13,640
Or, um, some water?

511
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,660
No, no, thank you.

512
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,960
This is good coffee.

513
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:18,380
It tastes awfully good.

514
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:20,120
The hot in the world of me?

515
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:20,960
That's torture.

516
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:21,800
Yeah.

517
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:25,900
I mean, you have this totally unbelievable life-altering sex,

518
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,480
and then you just disappear.

519
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,120
I mean, you stop drinking coffee.

520
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:28,520
I know, I know.

521
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,280
I had to go get coffee.

522
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,180
God!

523
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,800
Is this Johnny Pops?

524
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,100
There's a lot of people who are like,

525
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,100


526
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,100


527
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,100


528
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,100


529
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,100


530
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:33,100


531
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,360
Oh, there's a new movie about Napoleon.

532
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,380
Oh, wait, no, I thought that was my alter ego.

533
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:36,680
No!

534
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,020
This new movie about Napoleon.

535
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:38,300
That's my alter ego.

536
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,460
And he's played by Ian Johnny Potts.

537
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:40,940
Oh, yeah.

538
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,680
Johnny Potts, from Meet Napoleon.

539
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,980
Wow, cool!

540
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:48,700
Oh, didn't they already do this in Bill and Ted's, uh,

541
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:53,540
Excellent Adventure, and, uh, you know, in that Terry Gilliam movie?

542
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,920
Why Johnny can't smoke pot?

543
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,840
Why Johnny Cash smokes pot?

544
00:21:57,860 --> 00:22:00,980
I knew Johnny Cash smoked pot, though.

545
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:01,980
He doesn't know how to do it.

546
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,060
He's so big.

547
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:08,800
Um, okay, uh, let's backtrack a little bit and make sure that we're on the same page.

548
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,240
I wouldn't want to be at cross purposes.

549
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,020
Cannabis or us?

550
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,520
You haven't heard of that, no.

551
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,500
Hey, Neil, we're gonna have to kill Johnny Potts, mate.

552
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:16,880
No.

553
00:22:19,260 --> 00:22:22,800
I want each and every one of you Johnny Potts smokers on air.

554
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,600
Johnny on the spot.

555
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:25,920
What?

556
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,500
To what?

557
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,220
Or Johnny on the closet.

558
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,100
The call of lost control.

559
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,100
He comes out, and we'll smoke some more.

560
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,320
I'm James Salyer.

561
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:32,960
I'm James Salyer.

562
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,380
I'm the guy that's been working on the briefest of fogs.

563
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,040
I'm going to have to go sit somewhere else.

564
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,860
I'm going to have to go to Harrison.

565
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:37,600
Yes?

566
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,440
Have a nice day.

567
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,080
Have a new day.

568
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:39,480
Yes.

569
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:47,400
Down the road I look, and there runs Mary.

570
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,920
Green, green, pair of black cherries.

571
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:58,120
It's good to choke the green, green grass of home.

572
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,080
Yes, they're all home.

573
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,920
Farm livin' is the life for me

574
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,540
Land spreadin' out so far and wide

575
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,680
Keep Manhattan, just give me that countryside

576
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:50,960
guitar solo

577
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,000
The charge

578
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,680
The stars

579
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:02,300
Fresh air

580
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,280
Times Square

581
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:07,880
guitar solo

582
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:17,100
New York is where I'd rather stay

583
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:21,580
I get allergic smellin' hay

584
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:26,280
I just adore a penthouse view

585
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:27,500
guitar solo

586
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,480
Darling, I love you, but give me Park Avenue

587
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:33,480
guitar solo

588
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,440
You are my way

589
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,000
guitar solo

590
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,960
I said goodbye city life

591
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:47,340
Green Acres, we are there

592
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:52,180
Green Acres, we are there

593
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:56,480
Green Acres, we are there

594
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,660
Green Chems here tonight

595
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,040
j knew you was a sweet little thing

596
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,000
I always knew

597
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,120
Green Acres, there's no other place

598
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,160
I'd like another getaway

599
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:21,640
you can be along just hangin' around

600
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:22,600
Even if you stay out here

601
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:26,340
together with your cell phone

602
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:26,460
You're my lass

603
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,480
This and his present always feel in a fizzling.

604
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,500
Hey.

605
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:38,680
Hey, Andy.

606
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:39,320
Oh, hi, Goof.

607
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:40,400
Andy, I've got to talk to you.

608
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:41,520
We're just having supper.

609
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:42,620
Would you like something to eat?

610
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:42,960
Oh, no.

611
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:43,440
Anything?

612
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,000
No, no, no, thank you.

613
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,160
Well, let's have our certain coffee in the living room.

614
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:51,600
No, no, I'll get it.

615
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:55,180
Hey, hey, everybody.

616
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,040
Hi, Goof.

617
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,500
Goof.

618
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:56,880
Goof.

619
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,240
Goof.

620
00:25:57,240 --> 00:25:57,520
Goof.

621
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:57,700
Goof.

622
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,620
You know that's funny.

623
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,320
Well, I'll...

624
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,140
Shows what greed will do.

625
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,540
Oh, yes.

626
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,540
Changes a person completely.

627
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:09,580
Oh, that makes a lot of sense.

628
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:10,320
Yep.

629
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:11,760
Yes.

630
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:12,980
Yep.

631
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,260
Yep.

632
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,100
Yep.

633
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,000
Shows what greed will do.

634
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:16,860
Right, Andy?

635
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,280
Yeah, well...

636
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,860
What time you got?

637
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:27,500
Well, come back.

638
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,500
I'll be going.

639
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,860
Shows what greed will do.

640
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:43,280
Hey!

641
00:26:47,260 --> 00:26:47,820
Hey!

642
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,320
Hey!

643
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,220
Hey!

644
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,700

646
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,520

648

Bravo.

649
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:55,420
Bravo.

650
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:55,600
Bravo.

651
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:55,740
Bravo.

652
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:56,160
Bravo.

653
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,300

654
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,500
to a potentially fatal

655
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,160
muscle disease.

656
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,220
Call 3966

659
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,000
your pharmaceuticals.

660
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,540
Is your co-payment ready?

661
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,300
Bob is my co-payment.

662
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,260
We do not accept

663
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,680
Bob as a co-payment.

664
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,040
Will you accept Connie?

665
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:19,740
No.

666
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,580
I'm sorry.

667
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,260
Well, what will you accept?

668
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:23,180
We accept

669
00:27:23,180 --> 00:27:25,040
orange plastic dildos.

670
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:25,820
Damn.

671
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:27,180
I'm fresh out of dodi.

672
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,900
Do you have any slack tokens?

673
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:30,440
I have a dead cat.

674
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,120
We do not accept dead cat

675
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,200
as co-payments.

676
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,800
My tumor has gotten bigger.

677
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,580
My best friend is a tumor.

678
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,960
Would you like to touch it?

679
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:39,120
Well, can I?

680
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,520
That feels good.

681
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,260
It is green.

682
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,920
I am very proud of it.

683
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:43,800
You should be.

684
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,160
Would you accept a chunk?

685
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,440
As a co-payment?

686
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:47,160
Yes.

687
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:47,860
Sure.

688
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,900
Have a nice day.

689
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,320
Thank you very much.

690
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,160
Heart Ignition did that.

691
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,800
The HMO is a great company.

692
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:55,800


693
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:55,800


694
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:55,800


695
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,560
It is called the HMO Fiasco.

696
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:03,440
A little while before that, Green Haze was by Elvis Hitler.

697
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:09,080
And everything else around it was cut up by Mr. Fernando Andelemer.

698
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:15,140
Now a cut up by Baran, whoever that is really.

699
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:17,100
I got it off of Binary Slack.

700
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:24,460
Featuring Terence McKenna from the new album Conversations at the Edge of Magic, which

701
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,780
was recorded at Slate.

702
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:34,260
It is available at Starwood and is available at through www.Rosencomet.com the ACE website.

703
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:40,540
Oh, I should mention this background music is by Hell Pope Huey.

704
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,900
And now Terence McKenna.

705
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:51,020
And here is my answer to this riddle.

706
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:54,580
Where did human consciousness come from?

707
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
It began.

708
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,740
It begins like this.

709
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:57,800
The vacuum, byğim.

710
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:10,380
And in highly sexed animals small amounts of psilocybin mushrooms would

711
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,020
have naturally been eaten.

712
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,980
And blamed by Extraterrestrial scientific proof.

713
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,780
There are no þo girocephalic anyone was ever exclude.

714
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:24,180
In small amounts of psilocybin, orarzci走吧 di daetos y enzim preservatives, theynosis

715
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:24,260
partiasi iq advertisement mosca eae paquial corpati.

716
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,320
ول

717
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:34,400
And so you see, my young friend, here we have a case where the use of drugs actually introduces

718
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:41,060
us to a more true vision of reality than if we have avoided the drug.

719
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:53,980
Some of these we take in highly sexed animals, small amounts of psilocybin mushrooms, and

720
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,040
an exotic pseudo neurotransmitter.

721
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:12,660
Is that when you take slightly larger doses of psilocybin, and that is the psilocybin containing

722
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,620
mushrooms that grow in the dung of cattle.

723
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,860
Mommy!

724
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,040
Mommy!

725
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:27,680
Whip me up a plosive bee, I'm about to lose my noodle.

726
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:31,380
I'm getting spiritual now.

727
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,160
I've taken all the pills I can take.

728
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:51,420
I feel so relaxed now, but I certainly don't look forward to what I have to do.

729
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,840
And if you don't want to, I'm going to have to go to the hospital.

730
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,440
You can kiss me if you want to.

731
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:17,240
I just want to do this little thing projects, putting on some clothes and his

732
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,240


733
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:17,240


734
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,340
my eyes at a track.

735
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:22,820
You know, my left foot is my pillow.

736
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,980
And I'm a law abider

737
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,000
There's nothing I like more than getting fired up on beer

738
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,340
And when the weekend's here

739
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:31,180
I exercise my right to get paralytic and fight

740
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,620
Good bloke, fairly

741
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,460
But I get well, Larry, when geezers look at me funny

742
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,040
Bounce them round like bunnies

743
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:38,800
I'm likely to cause mischief

744
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,700
Good clean grief, you must believe

745
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:41,760
And I ain't no thief

746
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,060
Law abiding and all, all legal

747
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:46,580
And who cares about my liver when it feels good

748
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:48,540
What you need's some real manhood

749
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,480
Rasher, rasher, burning catcher

750
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,960
Putting people's backs up

751
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,620
Public disorder, I'll give you public disorder

752
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:58,220
A down eight pints and run all over the place

753
00:31:58,220 --> 00:31:59,920
Spit in the face of an officer

754
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,420
See if that bothers ya

755
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,460
Cause I never broke a law in my life

756
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,860
Someday I'm gonna settle down with a wife

757
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,580
Go on lads, let's have another fight

758
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:09,420
My name's Tim and I'm a criminal

759
00:32:09,420 --> 00:32:11,880
In the eyes of society I need to be in jail

760
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,460
For the choice of herbs I inhale

761
00:32:13,460 --> 00:32:15,280
This ain't no wholesale operation

762
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:18,680
Just a few eights and some playstations, my vocation

763
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,180
I pose a threat to the nation

764
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,360
And down the station

765
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:22,720
The police hold no patience

766
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,640
Let's talk space and time

767
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,140
I like to get deep sometimes

768
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:27,220
And think about Einstein

769
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,460
And Carl Jung

770
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:30,820
And old kung fu movies I like to see

771
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,260
Pass the hydrator please

772
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:34,460
Pffft, yeah I'm floating on thin air

773
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,100
Going to Amsterdam in the new year

774
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,060
Top gear there

775
00:32:37,060 --> 00:32:39,040
Cause I take pride in my hobby

776
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:41,580
I home make bongs using my engineering degree

777
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:45,160
Dear leaders, please legalise weed for these reasons

778
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,580
Like I was saying to him

779
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,400
I told him

780
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,000
Spock with me and you won't live

781
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:51,340
So I smacked him in the head and downed an old man's head

782
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,340


783
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,340


784
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,340


785
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,340


786
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,340


787
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,340


788
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,340


789
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:51,940
Part of the cahling

790
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,060
Badda badda bing

791
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:54,040
Full of that's like

792
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:54,900
Mad fight

793
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,480
His face a sad sight

794
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:57,880
Vodka and snakebite

795
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,500
Going on like a right geez

796
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,660
Ease a twat

797
00:33:00,660 --> 00:33:02,380
Shouldn't have looked at me like that

798
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:02,900
Anyway

799
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,380
I'm an upstanding citizen

800
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:07,140
If a war came along I'd be on the front line with em

801
00:33:07,140 --> 00:33:08,740
Can't stand crime either

802
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:10,300
Them hooligans on heroin

803
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,560
Drugs and criminal

804
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,080
Those thugs are the pinnacle of the downfall of society

805
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,060
I've got all the anger pent up inside of me

806
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,340
No, I don't see why I should be the criminal

807
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,320
How can something we know recorded first

808
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,280
Fatalities be illegal.

809
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,980
And how many deaths are there per year from alcohol?

810
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,160
I just completed Gran Turismo on the hardest setting.

811
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,320
We pose no threat on my settee.

812
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,620
Oh, the pizza's here. Will someone let him in, please?

813
00:33:32,860 --> 00:33:35,340
We didn't order chicken. Not a problem. We'll pick it out.

814
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,120
I doubt they're meant to mess us about.

815
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:39,360
After all, we're all adults, not louts.

816
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,040
As I was saying, we're friendly, peaceful people.

817
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:44,000
We're not the ones out there causing trouble.

818
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:46,580
We just sit in this hazy bubble with our quarters,

819
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,980
discussing how beautiful Gail Porter is.

820
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,900
It's MTV, BBC Two, Channel Four is on until six in the morning.

821
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:55,900
Then six in the morning, the sun dawns and it's my bedtime.

822
00:33:56,020 --> 00:33:58,740
Causing trouble? You're stinking rabble, boys.

823
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,560
Saying I'm the lad who's spoiling it.

824
00:34:00,620 --> 00:34:01,560
You're on drugs.

825
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,520
Really bugs me when people try and tell me I'm a thug.

826
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,920
Just for getting drunk. I like getting drunk.

827
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,540
Because I'm an upstanding citizen.

828
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:11,240
If the war came along, I'd be on the front line with them.

829
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:13,100
Now, Terry, you're repeating yourself.

830
00:34:13,380 --> 00:34:15,520
But that's OK. Drunk people can't help that.

831
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,860
A chemical reaction happening inside your brain

832
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:18,840
causes you to forget.

833
00:34:18,980 --> 00:34:19,400
What you're saying.

834
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:21,580
What? I know exactly what I'm saying.

835
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,800
I'm perfectly sane.

836
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:24,880
You stinking student lame-o.

837
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,460
Go get a job and stop robbing us of our taxes.

838
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,600
Well, actually, according to research,

839
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:32,920
government funding for further education pales in insignificance

840
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,220
when compared to how much they spend on repairing

841
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:36,900
a layer of drunk people at the weekend

842
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,860
and casualty wards all over the land.

843
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,620
Why you seeking it? I'm spying. Come here.

844
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,400
I'm going to batter you. Come here.

845
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,320
The irony of it all by The Street's

846
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,760
original pirate material.

847
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:51,840
And now, a live revival recording

848
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:55,140
from 5X Day in London, England.

849
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:58,240
Yes, where Pope David Lee Black

850
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,280
can be heard performing a healing.

851
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:09,040
Now each, now a sub-genius church service

852
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,020
would not be complete

853
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,780
unless we had a what?

854
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,220
What's that?

855
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,680
We gotta have a healing.

856
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:16,980
We gotta have a healing.

857
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:18,940
And if we can't have a healing,

858
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:20,360
we gotta have a sickening.

859
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,520
Is there anybody in the audience

860
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,620
who has a problem, have an ailment?

861
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,020
This, that something bothering you?

862
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,740
Somebody, somebody's gotta...

863
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:32,440
You, sir.

864
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,420
There must be someone as sick as me.

865
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,700
Yes, sir. We have one.

866
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,340
Sir, sir, tell me.

867
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,060
Tell me, what's ailing you?

868
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,520
At the moment, I've got chronic alcoholism.

869
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,580
Did you hear that?

870
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:47,420
He has chronic alcoholism.

871
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,860
He has chronic alcoholism.

872
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,760
Well, I've got some good news for you.

873
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:54,360
We have a, we have a, we have a cure for that.

874
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:55,540
I want you to close your eyes.

875
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,720
Alcoholism is an ailment.

876
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:58,840
It's a blessing from God.

877
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,680
We have this holy elixir here.

878
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:03,080
Fear.

879
00:36:04,140 --> 00:36:04,520
Obstinacy.

880
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:05,520
Obstinacy.

881
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,560
I want you to drink it.

882
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,320
When you, when you've had it, come on, drink it.

883
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,000
Drink it all.

884
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,940
Hey, this ain't, this is a, a church of excess,

885
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:16,080
not a church of obstinacy.

886
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,780
Come on, drink it.

887
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,400
Come on.

888
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:18,960
Drink it.

889
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:19,360
Drink it.

890
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:20,900
Drink it.

891
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:21,040
Drink it.

892
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,700
Get your fucking neck.

893
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,320
Get your down your fucking neck.

894
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,000
Woo!

895
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:25,540
I'm drunk.

896
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,080
I'm going through this.

897
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,100
He's an alcoholic, my friends.

898
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,260
Bob has rubber stamped his alcoholism.

899
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:32,920
Yeah!

900
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,480
This is whiskey for Bob!

901
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,480
Whiskey for Bob.

902
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:37,580
Whiskey for Bob!

903
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,280
Woo!

904
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,760
I'm not afraid.

905
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:47,020
I like it out there.

906
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,280
You wouldn't believe me.

907
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:54,320
No!

908
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,720
He defies all the laws of man and God.

909
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:03,620
There may be an entirely new set of laws, Jim, that we know nothing about.

910
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,360
Come out and say what you mean.

911
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:06,980
I'm only guessing.

912
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,520
Sall I sing in my yard.

913
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:15,980
Sall I sing in my yard.

914
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:18,260
Come by y'all.

915
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:18,900
Come by y'all.

916
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:18,960


917
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:18,960


918
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:18,960


919
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:18,960


920
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:18,960


921
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:18,960


922
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:18,960


923
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:18,960


924
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:18,960


925
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,960
Sawa and Sene Marlon

926
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,540
Kumbaya

927
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:27,760
Oh Lord Kumbaya

928
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,560
Kumbaya

929
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,040
I'll believe the world once paid

930
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,080
With your majestic

931
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:37,680
It's a New Year cackling hand

932
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,820
Your people I do not understand

933
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,460
So do you my Shambhala

934
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:48,620
Shambhala

935
00:37:48,620 --> 00:37:50,900
A place we all believe

936
00:37:50,900 --> 00:37:52,920
That someday will take us away

937
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,800
A place of refuge

938
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,260
With every dark feeling

939
00:37:57,260 --> 00:37:58,820
That grows within us

940
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,060
An understanding develops

941
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,580
Someday

942
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,040
In Shambhala

943
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:07,360
We shall fight them with sticks and toads

944
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,380
We shall bring them down

945
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,680
And squish them with our mighty mortars

946
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,760
We shall pray to them

947
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,820
On altars of cheese and peanuts

948
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:18,400
And sing while the devils dance

949
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,260
Around us

950
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,840
Ah Shambhala

951
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,520
What was that about fighting them with sticks and toads?

952
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,000
Just exactly what kind of toads are you talking about?

953
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,520
Mystic toads my friend

954
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,700
I am talking about mystic toads

955
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:35,280
The kind that drip from your cerebellum

956
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,120
When you are stinking in your sleep

957
00:38:37,120 --> 00:38:39,420
Everybody loves the hypno toad

958
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:40,340
Oh yeah of course

959
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:43,560
But I don't think that's what you're talking about

960
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:46,460
No I wasn't talking senor

961
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,380
I was just informing you

962
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:49,360
How it's going to go down

963
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:51,240
Over the next 25 years or so

964
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,140
The world's in a collision course

965
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,340
With it's own self see

966
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,460
Prophecy

967
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,220
Obviously

968
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:57,680
Prophecy

969
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:01,660
The earth and the moon shall come together

970
00:39:01,660 --> 00:39:03,140
And have unnatural sex

971
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:05,180
Like a priest and a school boy

972
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,020
Children shall all be born

973
00:39:08,020 --> 00:39:09,660
With a third nostril

974
00:39:09,660 --> 00:39:11,280
Very very visible

975
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:13,220
To those practitioners of the church

976
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,480
Of the evil Sabianians

977
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:17,920
This man

978
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,740
Is absolutely dangerous

979
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,300
Do you realize how many children

980
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:24,600
Are out there probably looking at this program

981
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,020
And you're telling them

982
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,600
It's not dangerous to use drugs

983
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,920
I can name you 15 people

984
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:30,920
On crack

985
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,640
Crack cocaine alone

986
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,840
And my stepson

987
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,660
Got on it

988
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:38,480
And he is in prison

989
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:40,340
The child was a

990
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,880
Good Christian man

991
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,120
And he got on cocaine

992
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:46,000
And he is in prison

993
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:46,900
For stealing

994
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:47,900
Because he's a Christian man

995
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:47,900


996
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:47,900


997
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:47,900


998
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:48,560
Because he could not

999
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:49,880
Support his habit

1000
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,340
And these children out here

1001
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:53,460
Are listening to you man

1002
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,760
Cannot compare alcohol

1003
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:57,900
Alcohol is addictive

1004
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,220
Cigarettes are addictive

1005
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:01,320
Nobody should do none of them

1006
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:03,400
Don't compare drugs with alcohol

1007
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,320
And say that it's alright

1008
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,760
The government sell alcohol

1009
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,360
And it's not alright to sell drugs

1010
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,160
You're dangerous man

1011
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,020
And the fellows that fell down

1012
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,320
A double latte

1013
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:16,660
To hell

1014
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,360
All the way down to hell

1015
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,220
It has milk in it

1016
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,540
They bounced on the leaves

1017
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:23,540
The acid

1018
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,220
And took the acid

1019
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,960
And then fell

1020
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,800
Faster faster

1021
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,220
Falling freely

1022
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,520
Into the abyss

1023
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,300
Into the deep deep dark abyss

1024
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,120
Into which

1025
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,180
The psychedelic

1026
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,940
Sounds

1027
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:42,960
The linoleum and fluorescent lights

1028
00:40:42,960 --> 00:40:44,140
Make me feel so

1029
00:40:44,140 --> 00:40:45,860
Much like sitting down

1030
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,060
At this little table

1031
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,020
And then there was

1032
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,400
Thousands and thousands

1033
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,060
Of cockroaches

1034
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:52,960
Swarming

1035
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,020
Seeking out the

1036
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:55,640
Female view

1037
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:57,600
While I scope out the action

1038
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,300
At this mall

1039
00:40:58,300 --> 00:40:59,980
Here in the puzzling

1040
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,940
Evidence of states

1041
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,220
Stretching and sprawling

1042
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:04,680
Over mile after mile

1043
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,980
Of reconquerable hell

1044
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,200
They were stolen from them

1045
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,500
But Bob

1046
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:09,220
But what happens

1047
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,980
When high altitude

1048
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:11,900
Air force planes

1049
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,880
Split the sky

1050
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,740
With a glowing contrast

1051
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:17,800
Bob paid for the

1052
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,280
Return of your orgasm

1053
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,940
With his self

1054
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:23,520
With his pain

1055
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,300
Oh Bob didn't have anything

1056
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:27,300
To do with that file

1057
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:33,020
88888888888888

1058
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,640
Hello you're on

1059
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,100
Am I just doing this

1060
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,940
For the benefit of

1061
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,000
Some other doobie dealer

1062
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,480
Well but you're under

1063
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:41,060
No obligation

1064
00:41:41,060 --> 00:41:42,560
To go to the dealer

1065
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:43,100
Yeah

1066
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:45,000
I'm asking 170 bucks

1067
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,720
Don't forget

1068
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:46,400
That they will

1069
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,000
Break things

1070
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,760
for free.

1071
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:54,840
Okay.

1072
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:56,240
Alrighty, bye-bye.

1073
00:41:56,380 --> 00:41:56,640
Okay.

1074
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,460
Good luck.

1075
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:57,940
Yeah.

1076
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:58,880
Jesus.

1077
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,480
What a stupid

1078
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,480
f***ing home now.

1079
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:01,940
No.

1080
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:03,580
And speaking of

1081
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,560
enjoying things,

1082
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,100
who can leave out

1083
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,240
the very basis

1084
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:08,360
for our faith?

1085
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,040
Our famous,

1086
00:42:10,260 --> 00:42:11,360
most holy,

1087
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,920
and revered world

1088
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:13,680
without end

1089
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:14,680
reason for life.

1090
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:17,780
The Brinsky's

1091
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:18,880
Nuclear Bear.

1092
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,500
It's the same

1093
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,800
as the fine amphetamines

1094
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:22,360
you are surely

1095
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,080
familiar with.

1096
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,140
It allows us to do

1097
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,200
our vastly needed work

1098
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:25,740
for the economy

1099
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,140
and expands our awareness

1100
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:27,860
that we may fully

1101
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,840
appreciate the wonders

1102
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,700
that our hard-working

1103
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:30,320
bozo leaders

1104
00:42:30,320 --> 00:42:31,220
have provided us.

1105
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:32,580
And we are generously

1106
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,400
allowed injections

1107
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:34,580
five times a day.

1108
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:37,320
It helps us

1109
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,020
mature faster.

1110
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,840
Our eldest citizens

1111
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:40,460
are 25.

1112
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,140
Like football?

1113
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,720
Well, wait till you see

1114
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:45,020
the war against Mars.

1115
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,440
The finest teenage

1116
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:46,980
champions

1117
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:47,640
have been bred

1118
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:48,620
for these gala celebrations

1119
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:49,700
which keep alive

1120
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:50,180
the tradition

1121
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:51,320
of skillful combat.

1122
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:52,840
Colorful but simple,

1123
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,080
rugged but rewarding

1124
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,940
both to winners

1125
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:55,620
and losers,

1126
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:56,960
it's just like

1127
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:57,900
the good old days.

1128
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,360
A grueling test

1129
00:42:59,360 --> 00:42:59,900
of stamina

1130
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,800
with two entire

1131
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:01,640
players to support.

1132
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,040
Watch our Earth team

1133
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:03,800
fight for our

1134
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:04,380
Binsky's

1135
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:04,760
which those

1136
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:05,220
Martians

1137
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,840
just can't do without.

1138
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:07,800
Whoops,

1139
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,660
looked like that

1140
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,500
Martian won't score.

1141
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:10,340
Sorry Mars.

1142
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:15,060
What anti-drug

1143
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,220
film are we

1144
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:16,440
in?

1145
00:43:16,640 --> 00:43:16,980
I don't know.

1146
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:17,480
I'm not sure.

1147
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:20,420
I don't know.

1148
00:43:20,420 --> 00:43:20,440
I don't know.

1149
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,160
Which drug?

1150
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,140
Which drug are they

1151
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,300
trying to warn us against?

1152
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,540
That's what I'm...

1153
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,140
Dave, are you

1154
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:31,780
handing out...

1155
00:43:31,780 --> 00:43:32,460
Those are...

1156
00:43:33,040 --> 00:43:34,280
Man, that's not medicine?

1157
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:35,300
Yes, these are.

1158
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:35,580
Or candy?

1159
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:36,540
It's red medicine.

1160
00:43:36,820 --> 00:43:37,720
These are communist

1161
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:38,140
medicine.

1162
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:38,900
Those are Martian pellets.

1163
00:43:38,960 --> 00:43:39,340
These are...

1164
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:40,400
Oh my God,

1165
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:41,420
these are Martian pellets.

1166
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,320
Little red children

1167
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,760
orphaned Martian children

1168
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:44,660
from Mars

1169
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:45,400
that came in

1170
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:46,040
after the war.

1171
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:46,840
Oh, wow.

1172
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,140
Which war?

1173
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:47,900
The ones that lost

1174
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:48,460
their antenna.

1175
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,700
The war against Mars.

1176
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,560
The beer war.

1177
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:52,920
Oh, I thought you meant

1178
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:53,940
the dinosaur war.

1179
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:54,460
Remember the sperm for beer

1180
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:54,720
and all that?

1181
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,260
Yeah.

1182
00:43:55,540 --> 00:43:56,640
See, I totally forgot

1183
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:57,320
about that one.

1184
00:43:57,320 --> 00:43:58,420
I remember the dinosaur war.

1185
00:43:58,420 --> 00:43:59,760
I used to forget about it.

1186
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:00,800
I remember when Carter

1187
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,420
was there, you know,

1188
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:02,160
Carter of Mars.

1189
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:02,920
Yeah, Carter.

1190
00:44:03,180 --> 00:44:04,220
Jimmy Carter of Mars.

1191
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:05,260
Jimmy Carter of Mars.

1192
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,140
Those were the days.

1193
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,580
Fort of Jupiter.

1194
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:08,740
The really advanced

1195
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:09,980
presidents were

1196
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:11,340
like over men

1197
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:12,120
and they were highly

1198
00:44:12,120 --> 00:44:13,520
trained in the mystic arts

1199
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,740
and could expel

1200
00:44:14,740 --> 00:44:15,340
a pineapple

1201
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:16,960
from their...

1202
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:17,920
The nether regions.

1203
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:18,900
They didn't need armies.

1204
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:20,600
With unchewed

1205
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,500
and undigested.

1206
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,860
They could swallow it down

1207
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:25,560
and expel it a day later

1208
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:26,880
completely whole.

1209
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:28,500
Bringing the entire village

1210
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:29,140
good luck.

1211
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:30,060
And then they could make...

1212
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:31,580
Garfield could do that.

1213
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:32,460
And making smoothies

1214
00:44:32,460 --> 00:44:32,920
for all of them.

1215
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:33,860
In fact, how do you think

1216
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,600
Garfield won the 1884

1217
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:37,840
Transcendental Reerections?

1218
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:38,740
Right, right.

1219
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:39,360
Because, you know,

1220
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:40,440
Ohio is the father

1221
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:42,080
and the bad mofo

1222
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:43,100
of presidents.

1223
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,000
There was a boy

1224
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,640
Very strange and

1225
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:55,580
Chanting

1226
00:44:55,580 --> 00:45:01,180
They say

1227
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:02,360
Wonderberry

1228
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:02,880
For

1229
00:45:07,620 --> 00:45:09,020
Overland

1230
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:10,520
Sea

1231
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,660
A little

1232
00:45:15,660 --> 00:45:16,900
Child

1233
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:21,720
And said

1234
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,040
I was

1235
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,240
Very wise

1236
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,940
Was evil

1237
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:40,380
I got an idea

1238
00:45:40,380 --> 00:45:44,020
I had a plan

1239
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:44,780
to grow in you

1240
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:45,720
Before the outdoor

1241
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:46,680
was to be recreated

1242
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:46,980
Do you believe

1243
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:47,240
I was implicated

1244
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,020
in a grow room

1245
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:48,720
Wanted to produce

1246
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,340
the kind of plant

1247
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:49,980
that you could display

1248
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:50,720
up in a showroom

1249
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:51,680
So beautiful but yet

1250
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:52,280
Stinky

1251
00:45:52,280 --> 00:45:53,200
Stick to your thumb

1252
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:53,600
Index

1253
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,380
Little ring

1254
00:45:54,380 --> 00:45:54,820
Pinky

1255
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:55,320
And the brain

1256
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:55,960
So the first thing

1257
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:56,320
was to provide

1258
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:57,040
setting for proper

1259
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:57,300
cultivation

1260
00:45:57,760 --> 00:45:58,600
Discrete location

1261
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,880
10 by 10 foot spot

1262
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,220
Lit up by a thousand

1263
00:46:01,220 --> 00:46:01,860
watt lamp

1264
00:46:01,860 --> 00:46:02,840
Plus two air vents

1265
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,920
for the air to circulate

1266
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:04,680
And um

1267
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:05,300
I calculate

1268
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,520
30 gallons of water

1269
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:07,060
Oh we um

1270
00:46:07,060 --> 00:46:08,120
Really into this

1271
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:08,800
Now all I need

1272
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:09,480
is some good fertilizer

1273
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,700
And some photosynthesis

1274
00:46:10,700 --> 00:46:11,380
To proceed

1275
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:12,820
After I choose

1276
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:13,460
The right seeds

1277
00:46:13,460 --> 00:46:14,320
It's all in motion

1278
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,320
With a little

1279
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:15,920
Love and devotion

1280
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:16,900
I can make

1281
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:17,480
the front cover

1282
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:18,260
of high times

1283
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,200
I hope I never get

1284
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:20,160
Busted and have to

1285
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:20,900
pay some fines

1286
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:21,600
For having a

1287
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:22,680
Secret garden

1288
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,620
Like Barry White

1289
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:24,660
I must not tell anyone

1290
00:46:24,660 --> 00:46:25,720
And keep my lips

1291
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:26,200
still tight

1292
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:26,980
I got the grow

1293
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:27,740
If you ain't never

1294
00:46:27,740 --> 00:46:28,720
had the homegrown

1295
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:29,640
It made you choke

1296
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,400
Put your hands

1297
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,040
in the air

1298
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:31,620
And say no

1299
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,060
And if you're high

1300
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:33,460
already

1301
00:46:33,460 --> 00:46:34,300
You can't take

1302
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:35,060
another toke

1303
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:35,760
Put your hands

1304
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,400
in the air

1305
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:36,960
And say no

1306
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:37,680
I got the grow

1307
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:38,460
During the first

1308
00:46:38,460 --> 00:46:39,000
stage of growth

1309
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:40,380
The seeds germinate slow

1310
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,660
Start a root system

1311
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:42,520
Sprout up some leaves

1312
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:42,920
And grow

1313
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:43,800
Towards the light

1314
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:44,800
Make sure the temperature's right

1315
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,000
I was told by this fun guy

1316
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:46,960
Watch your plants

1317
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:47,220
closely

1318
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:48,120
You're aware of bugs

1319
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:48,680
and fungi

1320
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,060
The hurt your garden

1321
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:51,020
They only interfere

1322
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:52,160
with the vegetative growth

1323
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:52,760
That lasts about

1324
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:53,780
two months to a year

1325
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:54,660
When full grown

1326
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:55,360
flowers bloom

1327
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:56,400
Big buds and leaves

1328
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:57,240
Watch out for these

1329
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:58,100
People like to

1330
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,140
stash it up their sleeves

1331
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:00,520
It's now been three months

1332
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:01,500
I'm tempted to break off

1333
00:47:01,500 --> 00:47:02,740
a piece and roll some blunts

1334
00:47:02,740 --> 00:47:03,920
I wonder what it is

1335
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:04,700
Is this some skunk?

1336
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:05,660
I see some purple stems

1337
00:47:05,660 --> 00:47:06,400
and orange hairs

1338
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,440
Could it be the humble

1339
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:08,220
mixed with Maui?

1340
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:08,880
It's a hybrid

1341
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,340
Wow

1342
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:10,220
Look what I did

1343
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:11,200
I got the green thumb

1344
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,820
Observe the superb herb

1345
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,820
Bushy branches loud

1346
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:15,220
Smell light green pastel

1347
00:47:15,220 --> 00:47:16,720
I got it on deck

1348
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:16,940
For a new year

1349
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,760
And if anyone asks

1350
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:19,920
it's for medical use

1351
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:20,940
I got the growth

1352
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,560
If you ain't never

1353
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,520
had a homegrown

1354
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:23,500
that paid you choke

1355
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:24,220
Put your hands

1356
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:24,880
in the air

1357
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,540
Zen note

1358
00:47:25,540 --> 00:47:27,280
And if you're high already

1359
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,840
you can't take another coat

1360
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:29,600
Put your hands

1361
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:30,260
in the air

1362
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:30,920
Zen note

1363
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:32,280
If you ain't never

1364
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,200
had a homegrown

1365
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,220
that paid you choke

1366
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:34,960
Put your hands

1367
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:35,620
in the air

1368
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:36,300
Zen note

1369
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,020
And if you're high already

1370
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,620
you can't take another coat

1371
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:40,380
Put your hands

1372
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:40,960
in the air

1373
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:41,700
Zen note

1374
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,080
It's been over

1375
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:43,860
four months

1376
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:45,200
Time to get high

1377
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:46,480
Uphroot the plants

1378
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:46,920
and let the

1379
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:50,300
Let them hang dry in a cool room with dry air for two to three weeks.

1380
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:53,900
And I'ma be waiting right here with my loose leaf sheets to lovely harvest.

1381
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:55,600
It came in different amounts.

1382
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:58,480
Four trees, each one just a few grams shorter than ours.

1383
00:47:58,520 --> 00:47:59,840
I can't wait to smoke it.

1384
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:00,920
I know this bomb.

1385
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:02,440
Been waiting so long.

1386
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:03,680
Make me want to write a song.

1387
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:06,420
I guess I'll sell two ounces and puff on the rest.

1388
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:09,320
Find a recipe to sprinkle herb on my filet of chicken breast.

1389
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:11,100
Or some tea chalk for the THC.

1390
00:48:11,280 --> 00:48:12,020
Hit the bomb.

1391
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,400
Cut open and swish it sweet.

1392
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,460
Then come off on me.

1393
00:48:14,460 --> 00:48:17,440
Man, it's stuck to my fingertips as I try to break it down.

1394
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:18,020
It went limp.

1395
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,020
The food is earthy.

1396
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:19,820
The taste is profound.

1397
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,560
They have me buzzing for a light here.

1398
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:23,340
And you best believe I'll have some seeds.

1399
00:48:23,460 --> 00:48:24,480
And be at it again.

1400
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:25,140
Yes, indeed.

1401
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:28,060
If you ain't ever had a homegrown, they made you choke.

1402
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:30,100
Put your hands in the air and say no.

1403
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,480
And if you're high already, you can't take another choke.

1404
00:48:33,560 --> 00:48:35,460
Put your hands in the air and say no.

1405
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:38,720
If you ain't ever had a homegrown, they made you choke.

1406
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:40,880
Put your hands in the air and say no.

1407
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,240
And if you're high already, you can't take another choke.

1408
00:48:44,460 --> 00:48:46,200
Put your hands in the air and say no.

1409
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:46,980
I got the bull.

1410
00:48:49,200 --> 00:48:57,000
Put your hands in the air and say no.

1411
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:07,760
Put your hands in the air and say no.

1412
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:11,740
Grow Room by DJ Pooh.

1413
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:13,820
And Mr.

1414
00:49:14,620 --> 00:49:15,120
Grim.

1415
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:17,900
And before that, Nature Boy.

1416
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:24,260
That very strange piece was by Artemia Salina.

1417
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:26,900
Hi, this is Jeff.

1418
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:29,420
It won't take the government to interrupt our food supply.

1419
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,160
There are scores of other man-made disasters like a comet or an asteroid impact

1420
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:35,300
that will do the job just as quickly.

1421
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:40,640
Are you prepared for relief agencies to get contaminated food and water to you in a major crisis?

1422
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,440
One phone call and a food counselor will come right to your face.

1423
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:45,760
You'll be able to save your family in times of disaster.

1424
00:49:46,020 --> 00:49:48,260
And by then, it might well be 1953.

1425
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:50,060
Call right now.

1426
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:50,240
Free.

1427
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:52,680
Force Food.

1428
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,040
24 hours a day.

1429
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:55,000
Force Food.

1430
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,980
The wait. Force Food.

1431
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:58,740
Is over.

1432
00:49:59,440 --> 00:50:01,620
Dr. Louis Therese is now available.

1433
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,560
Nostradamus gave splints.

1434
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:07,120
You're all ruled by the power of the Truthseeker Company.

1435
00:50:07,380 --> 00:50:08,840
24 hours a day.

1436
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:11,860
Alright, go ahead.

1437
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:13,200
Yes, sir.

1438
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:14,900
Oh.

1439
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:17,800
Who's that?

1440
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:19,020
It's Micah, Paul.

1441
00:50:19,900 --> 00:50:21,040
That's what I was afraid of.

1442
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:24,200
Micah.

1443
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:25,020
I can smell you.

1444
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:27,180
Well, I haven't had much breakfast.

1445
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:28,940
The years haven't erased your stink.

1446
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:30,880
No, we volunteered to take a bath.

1447
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,200
Alright.

1448
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:33,340
Turn around.

1449
00:50:33,980 --> 00:50:35,040
Nice and easy.

1450
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:36,480
Oh, go ahead.

1451
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:37,340
Hold it, mister.

1452
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,700
Throw that marshal down with your hands up.

1453
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,360
Oh, boy, this is awful.

1454
00:50:44,460 --> 00:50:45,220
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1455
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:45,840
Awful.

1456
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,700
Uh, I'll, uh, I'll see you later.

1457
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:03,460
Oh, no.

1458
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,060
Oh, no.

1459
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,320
Oh, no.

1460
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:12,460


1461
00:51:12,880 --> 00:51:13,060
Oh, no.

1462
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:13,400
Oh, no.

1463
00:51:13,400 --> 00:51:13,880
Oh, no.

1464
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,380
Oh, no.

1465
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:14,420
Oh, no.

1466
00:51:14,420 --> 00:51:14,440
Oh, no.

1467
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:14,440


1468
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:17,200
Don't leave me for so long.

1469
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:32,060
Oh, my dear, a female dear.

1470
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:34,340
Little day.

1471
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:40,260
That you bring us back to norm.

1472
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:46,500
Can you get to it?

1473
00:51:48,700 --> 00:51:50,020
Can you get to it, baby?

1474
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,040
It's not so far away as the crow flies.

1475
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:57,880
But like a giant bird, it can gulf space like a breath.

1476
00:51:58,060 --> 00:52:00,120
Oh, yeah, that'll take you there in no time.

1477
00:52:01,340 --> 00:52:02,960
Hyper, hyper, hyperspace.

1478
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:06,140
But the back of your cerebral cortex passing away.

1479
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,600
You've taken too much, you've taken too much, you've taken too much.

1480
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:20,680
You've taken too much, you've taken too much, you've taken too much.

1481
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:24,960
You sit and watch the evening news in a trance, pissing your pants.

1482
00:52:25,300 --> 00:52:30,100
You think there's a man outside with a gun or a knife ready to take your life.

1483
00:52:30,580 --> 00:52:35,600
And he sits there waiting for you, behind the wall outside of your view.

1484
00:52:36,140 --> 00:52:39,740
Your neighbor hears you screaming tonight that you're too busy.

1485
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:41,300
He's smoking, yes, God.

1486
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,960
Too bad your mama found out.

1487
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:50,900
Supposed to be something, not a target for a shot.

1488
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,700
Downtown, there's a room upstairs where nobody cares.

1489
00:52:55,880 --> 00:52:57,060
You can yell all night.

1490
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,380
He got picked up at the bus stop.

1491
00:53:00,540 --> 00:53:02,580
Had to get away, they had his DNA.

1492
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:08,100
How many broken bodies fit inside the trolley?

1493
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:09,720
Your baby's mama is...

1494
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:10,500
Crying tonight.

1495
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:13,700
But you're too busy smoking, yes, God.

1496
00:53:16,320 --> 00:53:18,280
Too bad the bottom dropped out.

1497
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:24,000
Too bad your mama found out.

1498
00:53:24,060 --> 00:53:24,300
Oh!

1499
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:25,840
Oh!

1500
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:27,760
Oh!

1501
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:31,120
Oh!

1502
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:31,120


1503
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:31,120


1504
00:53:31,120 --> 00:53:31,560
Oh!

1505
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:31,560


1506
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:31,560


1507
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:31,800
Oh!

1508
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:32,540
Oh!

1509
00:53:32,580 --> 00:53:32,580


1510
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,220
Oh!

1511
00:53:33,260 --> 00:53:33,260


1512
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:33,820
Oh!

1513
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:34,200
Oh!

1514
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:34,460
Oh!

1515
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:35,980
Oh!

1516
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:37,900
Oh!

1517
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:51,140
Oh!

1518
00:53:51,140 --> 00:53:51,200
Oh!

1519
00:53:52,280 --> 00:53:52,280


1520
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:53,020


1521
00:53:55,780 --> 00:53:56,300
Oh!

1522
00:53:56,340 --> 00:53:56,340


1523
00:53:57,340 --> 00:53:58,080
Oh!

1524
00:53:58,080 --> 00:53:58,340
Oh!

1525
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,180
Oh!

1526
00:53:59,180 --> 00:53:59,180


1527
00:53:59,180 --> 00:53:59,180


1528
00:53:59,180 --> 00:53:59,200
Oh!

1529
00:53:59,200 --> 00:53:59,600
Oh!

1530
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:00,600
Oh!

1531
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:00,920
Oh!

1532
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:00,920


1533
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:00,920


1534
00:54:00,920 --> 00:54:01,240
Oh!

1535
00:54:01,440 --> 00:54:02,000
Oh!

1536
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:02,300
Oh!

1537
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:02,300


1538
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:02,340
Oh!

1539
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:02,340


1540
00:54:02,340 --> 00:54:03,060
Oh!

1541
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:03,240


1542
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:03,240


1543
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:03,240


1544
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:03,420


1545
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:04,100
Oh!

1546
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,140
Oh!

1547
00:54:05,360 --> 00:54:06,100
Oh!

1548
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:07,780
Oh!

1549
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:08,900
Oh!

1550
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,760
And that was by CD Truth from the CE Chemically Dependent.

1551
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,200
Their name is like the object CD.

1552
00:54:21,380 --> 00:54:26,560
And in fact, you can check out www.cdtruth.com.

1553
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:30,000
That's a C and a D and truth, all one word.

1554
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:32,880
And now more no effects.

1555
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:46,080
Thank you.

1556
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,960
No second chance.

1557
00:55:14,740 --> 00:55:17,120
No guiding light.

1558
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:25,860
I never meant to cause you pain.

1559
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:32,100
I never thought I'd be the one who took the fall.

1560
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:36,140
I got lost in the moment.

1561
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:38,780
Assholes like to test the limit.

1562
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:42,680
Six minutes down.

1563
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:46,780
Breathing machine.

1564
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:51,160
Brain not feel right.

1565
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:55,400
The look on you.

1566
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,580
Is killing me.

1567
00:56:01,740 --> 00:56:03,860
Drowning in shame.

1568
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:08,120
But don't feel bad.

1569
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:13,900
Cause I never feared consequences.

1570
00:56:14,220 --> 00:56:16,880
Hate regrets more than apologies.

1571
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,860
A year has passed.

1572
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,680
Like photographs.

1573
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:41,220
My life is just.

1574
00:56:43,220 --> 00:56:45,460
A scrapbook of.

1575
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:51,200
Old friends and faded memories.

1576
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:56,100
Looks like I pulled the rug from under myself.

1577
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:59,180
The fall's too much for me to recover from.

1578
00:56:59,900 --> 00:57:01,660
It's been real fun.

1579
00:57:02,980 --> 00:57:06,200
But now I must say goodbye.

1580
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,880
I'll see you when I'm gone.

1581
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:28,240
Good riddance, nasally.

1582
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:29,840
I'll make it go.

1583
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:29,840


1584
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:29,840


1585
00:57:29,840 --> 00:57:31,060
Oh, he's friends.

1586
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:31,060


1587
00:57:31,060 --> 00:57:32,600
Says the hor ere.

1588
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:32,600


1589
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:32,600


1590
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:32,600


1591
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:32,600


1592
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:32,600


1593
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:32,600


1594
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:32,600


1595
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:32,600


1596
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:32,600


1597
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:32,760
I'm going bananas!

1598
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:33,580
Yeah.

1599
00:57:33,780 --> 00:57:34,800
We'll have aaya job on.

1600
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:34,800


1601
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:37,760
I don't.

1602
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,660
too soon, did he?

1603
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:39,840
I wonder.

1604
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:43,660
Men, friends, you have been listening to

1605
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,560
the Hour of Slack from the Church

1606
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:47,440
of the Subgenius. For more information,

1607
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:51,180
see www.subgenius.com

1608
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:51,800
www.subgenius.com

1609
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:52,820
And, or,

1610
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,140
you can actually email me,

1611
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:57,540
stang at subgenius.com

1612
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:58,600
Praise

1613
00:57:58,600 --> 00:57:59,320
Abe.

1614
00:57:59,740 --> 00:58:00,260
Abe.

1615
00:58:03,600 --> 00:58:04,120
Well,

1616
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,660
I've told you before that I will not tolerate

1617
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:08,180
brutality in this penitentiary.

1618
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:11,160
Here, here, stop that.

1619
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:17,520
I'm sorry.

1620
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,760
Next, ma'am.

1621
00:58:29,220 --> 00:58:29,720
Yes.

1622
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,060
Oh, I knew there was a catch in it.

1623
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,340
One last spurt of cleavage

1624
00:58:40,340 --> 00:58:42,700
produces two diploid ribosomes,

1625
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:44,560
each carrying half the plans

1626
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:46,400
for a new worm. Hopefully,

1627
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:47,480
not the same half.

1628
00:58:48,140 --> 00:58:50,560
Finally convinced that they are, indeed,

1629
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:51,880
of the same species,

1630
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:54,080
they hesitantly begin pairing.

1631
00:58:54,420 --> 00:58:56,280
They combine to become one

1632
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:57,880
single blasphemula,

1633
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,380
which makes a last tug of mycotic cell

1634
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:01,840
division, and voila!

1635
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:04,240
There are now two worms where there

1636
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:05,460
once was one.

1637
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:08,200
But, what becomes of them now?

1638
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,100
We'll learn not only that,

1639
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:12,280
but also why the peen worm is so

1640
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,820
crucial to our nuclear beer,

1641
00:59:14,020 --> 00:59:15,460
and even the Martian War

1642
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:17,320
in Series 9.
