1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,140
In my head of hearts.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,460
Oh, no, there's no such thing as being out of funny noises, Stang.

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,200
No, there's not.

4
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,200
Sit down and put your feet up on the huffer and just relax.

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,560
We're going to teach you how funny noises influence our lives everywhere and every day.

6
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:25,700
We hear these sounds and many more every day in our working life.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,660
On the way home from school or uptown, it's always some...

8
00:00:38,060 --> 00:00:45,860
And all these wonderful noises have meanings that only the inner ear and the open eye and the third nostril can...

9
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,320
The subgenius.

10
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:08,680
Our...

11
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:11,100
Slack.

12
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,860
One of the things that's quite interesting, it pertains to concessions.

13
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,460
I don't know how many of you have ever attended a tennis game.

14
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:31,860
If it's a championship game, such as they have in New York at Forest Hills,

15
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:39,960
every time the ball is hit from one player to the other or served,

16
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,800
you see the heads go this way and that way and back and forth.

17
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:48,100
Well, I have a story that works a little differently.

18
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:52,560
The heads that I speak about go up and down.

19
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,680
And that is while they're standing in front...

20
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:56,860
In front of a high striker.

21
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,020
And the town boys like to show their girlfriends how strong they really are.

22
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,420
They give them a big mallet.

23
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,480
And, of course, this machine can be gauged.

24
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:13,720
We can let them hit the bell three times in a row and get a cigar or a cupidol.

25
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:18,880
Or they couldn't hit it if they dropped a 10-ton tractor on top of it.

26
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,820
Everything is controlled practically around those games.

27
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,300
Well, the high striker is...

28
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:25,980
On purpose.

29
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,500
They hit the high striker, everybody looks up,

30
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,700
and while they're up, if their coats are open,

31
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:37,720
it's very easy for someone who gets his hands mixed up into someone else's pocket.

32
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,940
If he's caught, he said,

33
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:42,400
Pardon me, I thought I was in my own pocket.

34
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,680
There have been more reports of unidentified...

35
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,700
Flying objects, sometimes called flying saucers, seen over the city...

36
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:01,000
...

37
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,140
Seen over the city...

38
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:04,720
...

39
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,600
Seen over the city...

40
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:06,900
...

41
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,560
Ah, yes, UFOs.

42
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,140
This is a classic question.

43
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,600
Do you believe in UFOs?

44
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:16,740
Have you ever seen a UFO?

45
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:17,640
...

46
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,020
I will admit this.

47
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:22,940
...

48
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,200
People are...

49
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:25,500
...

50
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,160
...seeing...

51
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,040
...things.

52
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,500
UFOs, unidentified stuff.

53
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:34,440
People are definitely seeing things.

54
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:41,820
Is it paranormal, supernatural stuff?

55
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,600
Are they spirits, are they demons, are they godly things?

56
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,060
Are they little green men?

57
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,520
I doubt it.

58
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,280
I do.

59
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,620
I doubt it.

60
00:03:55,740 --> 00:03:57,960
I'm not discounting what people say.

61
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,040
I doubt it.

62
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,740
I need more convincing.

63
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:04,520
...

64
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,280
...

65
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,680
...

66
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:08,680


67
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:08,680


68
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:08,900
I do.

69
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,180
I need more convincing.

70
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:13,200
...

71
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,160
...

72
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,480
...

73
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:15,760
...

74
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:15,860
...

75
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:15,880
...

76
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,200
...

77
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:17,500
...

78
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:17,640
?

79
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,200
?

80
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,760
?

81
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:30,180
?

82
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,180


83
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:30,780
?

84
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,040
?

85
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,380
?

86
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:42,380


87
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:42,420
?

88
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:42,420


89
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:42,440
?

90
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:12,000
I have

91
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:27,700
modified my opinion. The UFO phenomenon is real. Aliens are real. Yes, that's the real thing.

92
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:41,640
People are definitely seeing things. Yes, I've seen stuff. I've seen weird things. UFO

93
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:41,980
things. I've seen weird things. I've seen weird things. I've seen weird things. I've

94
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:53,540
seen angels, devils, demons, godly apparitions. I've seen incredible looking weird things

95
00:05:53,540 --> 00:06:05,600
darting around in the skies. I've seen all kinds of stuff. I've seen all kinds of stuff.

96
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,880
What they all are, I don't know.

97
00:06:11,980 --> 00:06:20,040
Are they spirits? Are they demons? Are they godly things? Are they little green men? Yes,

98
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:30,280
they are. Stay away from this stuff. Stay away from soothsaying and fortune tellers

99
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:40,540
and occult type stuff. Stay away from devils, demons, spirits, UFOs, little green men. They

100
00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:41,960
are alien in nature. They are alien in nature. They are alien in nature. They are alien in

101
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:53,400
nature. Most scientists agree. The UFO phenomenon is real. That's the real thing. Yes. Yes.

102
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:54,740
Yes.

103
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:11,660
Ladies and gentlemen, I want to have you meet some of the tiniest, smallest, cutest,

104
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:40,640
little people in all of the world. A lot of people are under the impression that all the midgets in the world come from a colony over in Germany. Let me assure you that such is not the case. Midgets come from all parts of the world. Every race, creed, color, and nationality. And I want you to meet some of our little people. I know that every one of you have a thought in your mind. Do midgets marry? Do they have children? What are their children like?

105
00:07:41,660 --> 00:08:11,640
We have a little booklet here, and I'm going to make you a present of it in a moment. And that booklet will tell you everything there is to know about midgets. It is not printed in medical terms, but plain, everyday English language. It calls a spade a spade. It tells you the things you want to know. And believe me, I know the things that you are thinking in your mind now. You want to know if that little man is capable of marrying a normal-sized midget.

106
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:27,200
Or if that little woman is capable of marrying a normal-sized man. That book explains that to you. Tells you about the children that they have. Now listen, after you get the book, which is free, here's how you get it.

107
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:41,640
Everywhere that these little people go, people ask them for a souvenir or their autograph. Anytime you can get anything from a midget, even though it be so small and insignificant as an autograph only.

108
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:57,000
You can get it on a scrap of paper. Get it. And keep it. And as long as you live, you will enjoy nothing but good luck. That being the case, these little ladies and gentlemen have a very unusual souvenir for you.

109
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:09,940
They have had made and printed, in accordance with their size, a holy Bible. Not a big Bible like you have at home, or take to church, or mass, or Sunday school.

110
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:27,420
But one about the size of a postage stamp. Here it is. Look. Beautifully bound and embossed in gold. And as tiny as it is, you can read every letter, in every word, on every page.

111
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:38,780
Now here's what they've done. They've got a few of these Bibles here. They're going to pass among you, and they're going to sell you that little Bible for exactly what it costs to print.

112
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:39,920
The Bible.

113
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:39,920


114
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:39,920


115
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:39,920


116
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:39,920


117
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:39,920


118
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:51,200
This is not a money-making proposition for them, for every one of these tiny performers receives a very large salary. They are the best in their field, and they know it.

119
00:09:51,460 --> 00:10:06,240
They sell this little Bible for 25 cents, and when you get your little Bible, free, at the same time, they are going to give you that book, autograph, that tells you the story about the midgets.

120
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,460
One thing I must mention.

121
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:09,820
They will not...

122
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:21,800
They will not ask you to buy one. They won't solicit you. If you want one, you must be quick. Hold your hand up where I can see you, and I will direct the little ladies and gentlemen to you.

123
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:36,580
The lady there, the gentleman there, the little boy over there, hold them up high, please. I hope we have enough for every one of you. As long as they last, 25 cents. And hurry, get your hand up. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

124
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,720
The Bible.

125
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,580
They will not ask you to buy one. They will not ask you to buy one. They will not ask you to buy one.

126
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:13,580


127
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:18,140
Backing up, my friend. I mentioned I got some coaxial flutter in my unit.

128
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,020
The Bible.

129
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,960
The Bible.

130
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:24,820
The Bible.

131
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,740
The Bible.

132
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,420
The Bible.

133
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,420
The Bible.

134
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,780
Ah, yes, dear friends.

135
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:44,620
Right-o.

136
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:48,420
We have returned to Earth.

137
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,840
Dr. Hal and I have...

138
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,220
In one piece after an astonishing extra-cosmic voyage

139
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,720
lasting, well, who can measure,

140
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,320
in the timeless realms of the eternal.

141
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:05,340
Well, either that or we never left.

142
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,880
Well, that's all a matter of...

143
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:07,400
And it seemed that way.

144
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,020
We are back in one piece.

145
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,900
I hope our fans are pleased that we weren't dashed to pieces

146
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:18,400
in a meteor shower or scarred by cosmic radiation.

147
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,300
Although we feel like maybe all of those things did happen.

148
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,120
It could have happened in my case.

149
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:28,660
Friends, we just heard the amino acids...

150
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:29,680
The amino acids.

151
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,560
...who were and were not at 17X Day Drill.

152
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,300
It was a strange thing.

153
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,460
The mad...

154
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,560
artist...

155
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,620
carnival guy, the old carny guy,

156
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,840
that was Nate Eagle.

157
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,260
Nate Eagle, yes.

158
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:46,000
The great...

159
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,340
I noticed that that had that faint echo

160
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:52,200
that you get from very old tapes.

161
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,300
Yes, me too.

162
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,000
So you weren't doing it.

163
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,020
No, no.

164
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,520
And the Papa Joe Mama rants are like that

165
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,420
because they're from very old tapes.

166
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:04,900
They bleed through from the layer of tape underneath

167
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:07,300
or just over each layer.

168
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,040
And the entire layer gets through there.

169
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,680
Boy, you sure know that technological talk.

170
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,240
Oh, yeah.

171
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:15,380
And finally, friends, the UFO phenomenon,

172
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:20,940
moody piece there with talk show and music,

173
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,620
was by...

174
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,680
Insert artist name here.

175
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:29,060
Joe Jeziorski.

176
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,280
It's too exquisite and exclusive for us

177
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,740
to be able to tell you the source.

178
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,340
But we have our first...

179
00:13:37,340 --> 00:13:39,300
First review of X Day, Ian.

180
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:43,100
We literally just got back to the Slacker Mansion

181
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,680
and I checked the email.

182
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,500
What did it say?

183
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:48,640
Well, it's from Reverend Anacron and he says,

184
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:51,100
Reverend Stang,

185
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,260
the first couple of days of X Day were great,

186
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,300
but Thursday night,

187
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:59,060
Sex Mortis did a very good impression

188
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:02,780
of a Viking berserker until 6 a.m.

189
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:04,780
It was beyond annoying, Luna,

190
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:07,120
and I felt he was potent.

191
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:08,080
Potentially violent.

192
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:11,300
Reverend 808 was good enough to come over

193
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,820
and try to talk him down,

194
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,580
but he was not having any of it.

195
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,360
Hope this email finds you safely aboard the saucers

196
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,340
in the champagne room with one or two sex goddesses.

197
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:21,760
Well, we're close.

198
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:24,020
We're in the WCSB studios

199
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:29,580
with one other person each.

200
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:32,020
Dr. Howell and myself.

201
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,820
Princess Wee is saving Starwood.

202
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:35,160
Starwood.

203
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,140
And we hope that we'll hear from...

204
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:37,740
Dave.

205
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,420
Suck a tag.

206
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:39,360
Any minute now.

207
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,540
Yes, it's true.

208
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,760
We ought to get a special transmission

209
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:45,220
on the approved frequency.

210
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:46,660
But, you know,

211
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,760
these things, events like this,

212
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,520
will inculcate your inner zen lesson

213
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,600
as your patience is sorely tried

214
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,080
again and again

215
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,340
with every minute event that transpires.

216
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,440
But it's hard to believe.

217
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,900
For me, personally,

218
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,320
your humble...

219
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,580
I'm a humble narrator

220
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:08,920
that now I'm sitting here

221
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,520
in a comfortable, warm, safe radio studio

222
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,800
and only last night

223
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,900
I was at a bonfire

224
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,240
where pagans were playing bongo drums

225
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,960
and Bob Dobbs was being burned

226
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,780
in an auto-da-fay.

227
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,600
That was a spectacular burning, Dave.

228
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:27,600
Did I dream it?

229
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,880
Did I just dream that Lonesome Cowboy Dave called?

230
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:32,900
Yes, you did.

231
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,540
It was a living nightmare.

232
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,320
He has that dream all the time.

233
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:40,100
It was a living nightmare at Wisteria?

234
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:40,820
No.

235
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:44,240
Getting a call from Lonesome Cowboy Dave

236
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,340
is a living nightmare.

237
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,500
Most people had a great time at Wisteria.

238
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,380
I can guarantee you that.

239
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:51,500
Because it...

240
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
Did you have a great time, Dr. Howell?

241
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,940
Well, there were moments I certainly enjoyed.

242
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,840
Yes, indeed.

243
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,680
Some moments.

244
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:00,280
Some special, infinite moments.

245
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,440
Some special...

246
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:04,420
Moments of infinite duration.

247
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,360
What do you want?

248
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,460
Well, there were some unthinkably,

249
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,660
weird things that happened

250
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,260
that most weird and bizarre of which

251
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,600
was that the weather was fabulous the whole time

252
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,640
by Earth standards.

253
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,960
After all these wimps have been bitching

254
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,760
about how terrible it is

255
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,000
and how hot and too many bugs and so on.

256
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,220
Well, this certainly showed them.

257
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,240
It was like in the 70s

258
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,500
and breezy and cloudy every day.

259
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,700
I was breezy and cloudy back in the 70s.

260
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,020
Yeah.

261
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:33,000
And you know why that was?

262
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,340
Because all the jerks didn't come this time.

263
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,340
No, they...

264
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,300
That's why we've had bad...

265
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,300


266
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:37,300


267
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:37,840
We've had bad weather before.

268
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:38,980
There were too many jerks.

269
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,200
Cons aren't kids today.

270
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:41,760
Don't even know how to do the jerk.

271
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,520
No, and they're not being...

272
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,080
I don't know how to do the twerp or whatever it is.

273
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,380
Twerk.

274
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:47,780
Tweak.

275
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,740
Tweaking or...

276
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,300
Twerking.

277
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:49,780
Twerking.

278
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,420
Get in line with the feet already dead

279
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,420
in their service of the country, old man.

280
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,200
Do the dork.

281
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:56,180
The twerk.

282
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:56,960
Twerk.

283
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,480
Do the dork.

284
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,940
It's called twerking,

285
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,820
but I surely think our audience

286
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,980
doesn't want to hear about a discussion of that phenomenon.

287
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,640
Or do they?

288
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,540
I don't know.

289
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,800
Cue Miley Cyrus footage.

290
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:18,680
It might seem a little picayune and presentable.

291
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:20,580
We've got so much to talk about,

292
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:23,300
we immediately have to plunge into mediocrity?

293
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:27,180
Well, no, it's not mediocre if Dave's doing the twerking.

294
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:27,800
I'm sorry.

295
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,620
Have you ever seen Dave twerk?

296
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:29,180
No, I wasn't.

297
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,760
I wasn't.

298
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,980
I didn't mean that.

299
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,060
You're putting words in my mouth.

300
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,800
I, um...

301
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,100
Unfair twerk hours.

302
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,000
Unfair twerk hours.

303
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:42,000
It was a twerk-related injury.

304
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,180
A twerk-related injury?

305
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,080
A twerk, yeah.

306
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:45,920
Not with me.

307
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,460
There may have been twerk-related injuries.

308
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,800
There might have been.

309
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,320
Actually, we prevented a lot of them.

310
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:51,620
Yeah.

311
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:54,920
Once again, it wasn't going to happen to me on this trip.

312
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,660
But who cares about that

313
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,280
when you can see the gates of the universe itself

314
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,860
open wide, rolling on adamantine hinges?

315
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,120
Which you did do.

316
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,660
At exactly 5 a.m. on the morning.

317
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,240
Showing the infinite regress,

318
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,380
the path of the giant craft.

319
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,140
And they hummed as they hovered over...

320
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:17,840
Craft!

321
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:18,680
Oh!

322
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,700
I thought it was one of those leggy routines

323
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,660
like when they had the reunions and stuff.

324
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:26,260
You mean the Gilligan's Island family reunion?

325
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,300
Yeah.

326
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,760
One of those things where...

327
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,660
With the Harlem Delfts.

328
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,400
The professor and Marianne are expected to show certain body parts

329
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,960
before they're allowed to go to...

330
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,080
Oh, that never happens.

331
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:37,300
And all of a sudden...

332
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,140
We always prevent that from happening on Gilligan's Island.

333
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,420
Not at X-Day, however, I should add.

334
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:48,240
Yes, there is a certain sanitation in pink media,

335
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:53,080
as we remember, who suffered from its greatest onslaught.

336
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:55,860
But at X-Day, nothing is censored.

337
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:59,400
There are none of those hovering black rectangles that you see.

338
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:04,160
You get to see what's under those rectangles each and every time.

339
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:07,300
Aside from the normal, everyday blackness,

340
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,020
black rectangles that float around there.

341
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,080
I get those in my vision.

342
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:15,040
They're called floaters, but most people can't see them.

343
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,740
Just me.

344
00:19:16,120 --> 00:19:17,020
For the most part.

345
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,120
Have you ever seen the bloaters?

346
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,180
Oh, man.

347
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,120
I was just in the grocery store.

348
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:26,060
I saw the floaters in those sweat lodges

349
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,560
that line the road at the Wisteria campground.

350
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,460
Are they, you know, in the tanks?

351
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,280
Floatation tanks.

352
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,160
Yeah, there's stuff floating in the bottom of...

353
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,700
Someone should flush that.

354
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,100
I noticed that the campground management

355
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,620
left little pink mints in those sinks.

356
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,640
Doo-dah.

357
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:46,300
Doo-dah.

358
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,100
What a delightful way to go.

359
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,200
It's beautiful for them to think of such a thing,

360
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,880
to have a concierge service like that going all the time.

361
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:57,220
You guys are just being wild and insane,

362
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,180
like Neanderthals or ape people or something.

363
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,160
Oh, ape people are sane as you and me.

364
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,060
Did you know there were...

365
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,180
There are lots of giants in this entire area of the United States?

366
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,560
They found their bodies are 15 feet tall.

367
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:13,880
It was the tallest of them.

368
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,220
What's your source for that?

369
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,840
Um, uh, um...

370
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,640
Or, um...

371
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,180
Many, many.

372
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,360
They used to believe that there were giants

373
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:27,240
and they found the Cardiff giant and so forth,

374
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:34,080
but then long-faced scientists said they were all fakes

375
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:36,260
that were carved by clever fakers.

376
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,840
And there were no fossilized giants.

377
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:42,440
But the Bible says that there were indeed

378
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,080
huge, ungainly, uncouth giants in those days.

379
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,320
Yes.

380
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,240
And so did the Native Americans.

381
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,880
And one of the sources I was going to cite,

382
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:53,620
it was an expert, I couldn't remember the name of the book,

383
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,840
but it was actually peer-reviewed in a journal and stuff,

384
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,800
and he found thousands of bones, tibia,

385
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:02,840
and, well, that's what I was saying, too.

386
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:06,840
I heard it on one of those, you know, one of those radio shows,

387
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:09,800
and stuff that sees flying saucers everywhere

388
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,240
instead of where they should be.

389
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,660
But the guy who was...

390
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:17,620
No, it was on a regular off-news program.

391
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:18,260
That's right.

392
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,160
Well, you see, as one who often thinks about these issues,

393
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,980
then I would have to ask, who examined the bones in question?

394
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:31,420
Often untutored would-be anatomists

395
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:34,900
misidentify bones from different creatures.

396
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,960
And the bones of elephants,

397
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,080
elephants were originally thought to be the bones of the cyclops.

398
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:46,280
Its huge skull seems to have an eye socket for a single eye in the middle,

399
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:49,040
an anatomical feature misinterpreted.

400
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:52,040
And the tibias, fibulas, and femurs,

401
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,920
especially of certain large dinosaurs,

402
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,660
resemble those of humans,

403
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,840
which was another reason people thought they had dug up dino...

404
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,340
I mean, human bones in the old days.

405
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,480
What I think they caused a celebrity,

406
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,000
was that they actually found, you know,

407
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,840
huge human foot bones,

408
00:22:11,020 --> 00:22:13,640
which was the telltale characteristic of all humans.

409
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,920
If they found anything telltale and characteristic,

410
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,820
it would either be those arches or the teeth.

411
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,920
They really tell that tale.

412
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,380
And curiously enough,

413
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,420
supersized humanoid teeth have been found.

414
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,920
But today's science say,

415
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:31,520
well, they are simply from a giant ape

416
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:33,580
that had somewhat human-like teeth

417
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,160
through a freakish anomaly.

418
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,360
Well, that would be reverent.

419
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,200
Richard's skull.

420
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,100
It was Dr. Franz Weidenrich in his book,

421
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,640
Apes, Giants, and Men.

422
00:22:43,340 --> 00:22:46,000
Well, they mentioned the pattern of two teeth,

423
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:49,440
or two sets of teeth running parallel to each other,

424
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,040
both up and down, bottom and top.

425
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,920
Only these mammals can do it.

426
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,160
Reptiles don't get to chew their food.

427
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,240
Their mouths can only open and close like a pair of scissors.

428
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:03,800
But humans and cows can move their lower jaws all around one

429
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,600
and chew their cud.

430
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:09,560
But if they ever found a giant human tooth,

431
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,400
that would cinch the fact that, yes,

432
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,100
there were giants in those days.

433
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:17,140
Well, these people claim that there were, like,

434
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,400
two layers of teeth, like two front toppies

435
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,860
and two bottom lowers, you know,

436
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,960
right next to each other, like double teeth.

437
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,720
And I've also heard...

438
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,800
Some people get that today.

439
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,240
Sometimes extra teeth grow.

440
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:31,560
Pardon?

441
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,220
Sometimes extra teeth grow.

442
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,580
So dentists will tell...

443
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,720
I'll tell you that, Dave.

444
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:39,420
They sometimes have to remove extra teeth

445
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,840
that grow from behind the original teeth.

446
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,280
Well, giants need extra teeth

447
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,940
so they can grind your bones to make their bread.

448
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,220
Yes, let's not forget that.

449
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,960
Now, in...

450
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,160
Make cross sounds out of your forehead.

451
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:55,220
When Gulliver returned from Brobdingnag,

452
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,080
or as it actually should have been called, Brobdinggrag,

453
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,860
he was picked up by a ship,

454
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:03,580
and he had some curiosities that he'd picked up

455
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,100
in the giant's kingdom,

456
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,200
and he offered some to the captain of the ship

457
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,160
for saving him,

458
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:11,420
since he didn't have any money to pay him,

459
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:14,780
and the captain chose a tooth which Gulliver had,

460
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:16,960
which had been pulled from a footman

461
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:17,780
who had a toothache,

462
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,900
and he had asked to keep it

463
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:21,760
and had been allowed to keep it in his little house,

464
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
which was eventually picked up by a giant eagle

465
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,000
and dropped hundreds of feet into the sea

466
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,280
until it floated.

467
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,840
So nothing in the Isaac Asimov

468
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,480
annotated Gulliver's travels.

469
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:35,580
It says...

470
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,920
Would prove the existence of a giant human

471
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,180
more than this tooth,

472
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:43,240
so that captain knew just what to ask for.

473
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,640
Well, then, was Gulliver actually traveling

474
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,560
at the same time he was collecting

475
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,820
and picking out these various teeth?

476
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,480
No, he didn't pick them.

477
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:53,660
He was a curiosity.

478
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:57,560
He was the smallest person in the kingdom of Brobdingnag,

479
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:59,860
but as a favorite at court,

480
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,180
he was able to get certain things,

481
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,960
and when a servant there had a toothache

482
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:05,580
and the tooth...

483
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,080
was drawn,

484
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,960
he asked for and got to keep the tooth

485
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:11,020
in his cabinet of curiosities,

486
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,680
where he also had a wasp sting from a wasp

487
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:14,960
he killed once with his sword

488
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,240
and a bunch of other stuff.

489
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,480
I know that stuff happened

490
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,700
because I've read that Gulliver's Travels comic book

491
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,100
and it didn't have no giants in it.

492
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,120
It was just little bitty people,

493
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,240
and he was the only giant.

494
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,840
Well, that was the first part of his travels.

495
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,380
You know, he went to a lot of different places.

496
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:30,160
He sailed the seven seas,

497
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,660
but there were more than that.

498
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:32,660
There were actually 11 people.

499
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:32,720
He went to Japan.

500
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:35,560
He went to the floating island...

501
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,360
of Laputa.

502
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:38,800
He went to Balnebarby,

503
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,900
where he saw the terrible Strollbrugs,

504
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,080
or immortals,

505
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,760
the people who never die.

506
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,440
Unfortunately, they keep getting older.

507
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,720
Yes, they want to desperately and cannot.

508
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:51,960
It's one of the sad tales,

509
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,400
and it's similar to a lot of the action

510
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,140
that occurred down in Wisteria, too.

511
00:25:56,300 --> 00:25:58,060
A lot of these people just wanted...

512
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,860
came down there,

513
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,840
they wanted to be released from their bodies

514
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,560
and set forth into a brand new kingdom,

515
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:06,820
a kingdom of pleasures,

516
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,180
perhaps earthly or otherwise pleasures,

517
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,320
and were let down once again,

518
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:15,060
just because of Bobb'n-Edge Gullible Travels.

519
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,180
Well...

520
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:17,060
Keep on resurfacing.

521
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,840
I'm sorry.

522
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:20,800
Dr. Howell, did you notice that we passed a place

523
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,780
called Gulliver Travel Center on the highway?

524
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:24,220
Yes.

525
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:27,100
These days, everything is taken care of by automation,

526
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,420
but back then, if you wanted to travel,

527
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:33,620
you had to sign up with a full-rigged wooden sailing ship

528
00:26:33,620 --> 00:26:34,860
and set forth.

529
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:35,560
Now, Gulliver Travel Center, it's a very, very good place.

530
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:35,560


531
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:35,560


532
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:35,560


533
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:35,560


534
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:35,560


535
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:35,560


536
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,260
Gulliver started as a surgeon,

537
00:26:37,480 --> 00:26:40,120
a respectable trade in his day,

538
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,320
but later accumulated enough fortune

539
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,640
traveling in its various exploits

540
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,580
to become a captain of several ships.

541
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,900
However, he didn't have good luck.

542
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,480
Often he ran into mutineers and pirates.

543
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,640
Well, when you first take off in your ship,

544
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:57,840
or actually it moves very slowly by modern standards,

545
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,320
you'd hardly think you were moving at all,

546
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,740
then you'd think the ship was going to sink

547
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:05,120
because this horrible racket is coming at you from everywhere.

548
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,860
Well, in the 17th century, when you're on a ship,

549
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:14,400
every board, the sea makes everything crackle and groan,

550
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,220
and you think it's coming apart, and you hear this

551
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:19,120
coming from all directions.

552
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:23,720
The masts, the spars, the decking, the planks of all the decks.

553
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:27,160
But it holds together, even though it was pegged together

554
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,680
by illiterate carpenters and joiners.

555
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,920
You have a long memory, Dr. Howell.

556
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:35,020
Yes, sometimes I think I have lived too long.

557
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,940
A long memory and short of breath.

558
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,240
I know what you mean, Dr. Howell.

559
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:40,700
Yes, I can barely breathe.

560
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:45,020
My breath is failing, my dear son.

561
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:55,100
But remember, remember J.R. Bob's and his church of his sons.

562
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:00,320
Do you need your medicine, Dr. Howell?

563
00:28:00,620 --> 00:28:02,820
Yes, I'm going to take some right now.

564
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,720
Oh my God, that's a big pill.

565
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,100
Dr. Howell's favorite medicine.

566
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:07,600
Oh, it's a horse pill.

567
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:11,540
I got it from Harry's Light Horse Cavalry.

568
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,220
How do you get that thing in there?

569
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,700
Oops, not this one. That's a different box.

570
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,200
Harry Light Horse.

571
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,980
How was your X-Day, Dave?

572
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,920
Yeah, Dave, you've been awfully silent about your X-Day.

573
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,540
We'd like to hear the straight on it right now.

574
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:25,120
You can understand my pallor.

575
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:27,780
My home is full of squalor.

576
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:31,900
I live and I die like a chicken pie.

577
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:32,820
No.

578
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:33,820
They say no, no.

579
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,600
Well, that sums it up.

580
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:39,480
Well, at least there was a chicken pie in there.

581
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:39,840
No problem.

582
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,700
The chicken pie sounds good.

583
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,000
It was. It's a little break from the routine.

584
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,780
Two great things are in there, chicken and pie.

585
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:54,440
I wear a hospital bib nightie around most of the time and a pair of fuzzy socks.

586
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,600
And just go back and forth. I read my old Dashiell Hammond books.

587
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,120
Some of them date back to 130,000 years old.

588
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,780
I'm in pretty good shape, too.

589
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,720
There were giants on the Earth in those days.

590
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,460
When you take those paperback books back in time and you leave them outside the time machine,

591
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:13,000
they're really, you can't even pick them up when you get out.

592
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,840
They fall to pieces in your hands.

593
00:29:15,140 --> 00:29:16,420
At least some of mine did.

594
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:19,680
Well, that reminds me of that time travel trip I had at X-Day.

595
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:25,640
I was able to go back in time any time I wanted, and I chose to go back and kill Hitler.

596
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,020
And I was about to do that, and I found out he was my grandfather.

597
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:30,380
Hitler.

598
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,220
Don't you know it.

599
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:36,460
And you should have seen the twinkle in old Adolf's eye when he saw the little stain.

600
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,540
Don't you mean kill Hitler and you pressed kiss Hitler?

601
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:43,440
I thought that was, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt, but I thought that when you went into the program,

602
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:46,460
it came back saying, don't you mean kill Hitler?

603
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:50,280
And you just went ahead and put what you had in there, which was kiss Hitler.

604
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:58,640
Maybe if only someone had kissed Hitler at the right time, maybe he wouldn't have been that frustrated madman

605
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,360
that led his country to the end.

606
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,880
He got a lot of kisses when he came into his own.

607
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,080
Oh yeah, once he was a führer.

608
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:12,320
Once he was a starving teenager in Austria, he fell in love with many girls, and he'd point them out and say,

609
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,780
that one is the one I'm going to marry.

610
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,580
Oh, well, congratulations Adolf.

611
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,160
Well, I haven't told her yet, you fool.

612
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:25,600
Hey, did I tell you guys about my movie idea, Harold and Maude and Kumar Go to World War II?

613
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,360
They go back and, their idea, Harold and Maude and Kumar Go to World War II,

614
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:36,140
decide that if they could get some of Hitler's artwork, they could bring it back to the modern times

615
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:38,680
and sell it for a lot of money, because it's by Hitler, right?

616
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:45,440
So they go back in time, they find Hitler before he's famous, he's just a starving painter in art school,

617
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:48,640
he's never had a girlfriend, he doesn't have any fun.

618
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:54,540
Well, in the process of buddying up to this guy, they get him high, they get him laid,

619
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,200
and the next thing you know, his, and then they buy his artwork,

620
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:06,640
and then he tells the Nazi dudes to go away, go to hell, he didn't have anything, he's having a good time,

621
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:10,280
he doesn't want to mess with politics, he's having a successful art career.

622
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:13,660
So when Harold and Maude and Kumar get back to the modern world,

623
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:18,640
there hasn't been a World War II, and the artwork they brought back is worth nothing,

624
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:20,840
because it was just by that Hitler guy.

625
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:24,000
So he still never made it, and was in pain.

626
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:29,180
No, but he got slack. You see, they went back in time, they didn't kill Hitler, they gave Hitler slack.

627
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:33,680
You see, if only someone had given Hitler slack, it would have been slack for everybody.

628
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:42,020
No World War II, no Hiroshima, Dresden, Nagasaki, all the post-war world would not have happened

629
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,040
if Hitler could just have had some slack.

630
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:46,220
The Teabagger Party would never have come along.

631
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:50,500
Yeah, it would never have existed, not even in their wildest imagination.

632
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:55,080
But Nazis is so, Nazis stands for National Socialist Parties, that means they're socialists,

633
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,240
that means they're communists, which is worse than Democrats.

634
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,180
So they're, the case is, they're communists.

635
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:01,440
You don't know nothing about your history book.

636
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,320
This country is founded on Jesus!

637
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,420
And let's hope he doesn't wiggle, because that'll upset the old apple cart.

638
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:18,520
Speaking of upsetting apple carts, I actually, as a small child, saw Axis Sally walk into a local drugstore.

639
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,220
Sounds like the beginning of a joke.

640
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,740
No, it wasn't a joke, it was just like, that's her.

641
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:26,720
I didn't know who her was, because I was holding my mommy's hand.

642
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,180
But people started whispering, that's Axis Sally.

643
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:36,920
And she admitted, suddenly she acted a little bit funny, but the drug has still waited on her, and left, and when she left, she said,

644
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,720
I know who Tokyo Rose is, but I don't, I actually don't know who Axis Sally was.

645
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:50,760
She was like Tokyo Rose, only she moved back to this part of Ohio after she got done, I don't know whether she was forgiven or just slapped on the floor.

646
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:59,160
She was in Germany, the war came out, so she did broadcasts for the German side, and had a nice apartment, rather than a cold concentration camp.

647
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:04,300
But she did return to the US, and also, what about Lord Haw Haw?

648
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:11,080
He was the British guy, who would talk about how great the Nazis were, and then Haw Haw Haw Haw.

649
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,780
After the war, he didn't Haw so much.

650
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:15,600
The Haw, the Haw.

651
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:22,660
Well, Moseley's Raiders, I think of them when I think of him, because I can't think of more than two things at a time, so.

652
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:26,780
But Axis Sally, you actually saw Axis Sally, met her.

653
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,560
As a young, as a very young child.

654
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,140
As she was a young girl, I was a young girl, I was a young girl.

655
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,020
As a young spring.

656
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:35,120
And everyone whispered, kind of loudly.

657
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:44,880
She was sitting over there, and everybody looked away, like they were examining the products they were about to buy, and she went to the drugger's, and got her stuff and walked out.

658
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:52,040
You know, someday, Dave, there will be some people whispering, this sounds like cowboy Dave, sounds like cowboy Dave.

659
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,880
Don't serve that guy, it's him.

660
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:59,080
And it'll be practically anybody that's unshaven, and it's just wet their pants.

661
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:06,360
Anybody who looks like that, they'll just assume automatically they were favored with the gift of the view of Dave.

662
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:10,060
Got out of bed in a hurry today, eh, lonesome cowboy Dave?

663
00:34:11,780 --> 00:34:13,320
What you talking about?

664
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:18,660
I was asleep the entire time. Much the same way you guys are right now.

665
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:25,160
What? Huh? Yeah, yeah, that's right. Whatever. Whatever I said. You better pick up on it.

666
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:30,040
Well, no, I thought that everybody's brains were like in this weird synchro mesh.

667
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,460
Not everybody's brains.

668
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:33,260
None in all of ours.

669
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:35,520
No, some of us had to drive for five hours.

670
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,880
Five long hours.

671
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:38,780
Yeah.

672
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:47,720
I thought I was going to be going at light speed for five hours, but I was only going about an average of 60.

673
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:54,200
Because the other humans get in the way, don't they? They do. They get right in the way and they slow down, too.

674
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:54,920
No, actually.

675
00:34:55,160 --> 00:35:00,460
They get behind me and push because I just as soon drive about five miles an hour all the time.

676
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,260
Driving or park it, buddy.

677
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:12,840
Look, he's clopping along at a top speed of Grandma Tessie in her goat car, causing a massive traffic tie up on the freeway.

678
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:19,320
Yeah, speaking of traffic tie ups, this is a perfect excuse now, according to some constitutional lawyers.

679
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:24,780
Did you know that you can be stopped even for like a severe case?

680
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,220
A severe case of rosacea or acne?

681
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:26,960
Uh-oh.

682
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:28,140
Uh-oh.

683
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:30,240
Better slap on the nice and soft.

684
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:37,980
Well, I thought it was ridiculous in the beginning, which was a car driving too slow or close to a person with too rigid.

685
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,800
All right, citizen, I can see your problem is acne. Step out of the vehicle.

686
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,120
You're going too slow, you're rigid, and you've got acne.

687
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,360
I mean, that means you're going too slow, you're rigid, and you've got acne.

688
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,760
Stay right there while we run your pimples through.

689
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,880
That configuration doesn't look good.

690
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:03,420
Keep you in my pocket here, and we'll have the results in exactly five seconds.

691
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,960
You are who you claim to be.

692
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,000
Oh, look.

693
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,040
Well, maybe that'll happen.

694
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:12,140
We don't know.

695
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:14,260
There's a strange new world to come in.

696
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,220
I wish you would hurry up.

697
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,380
We thought there was a strange new world to come in.

698
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:20,800
Oh, there is, Stag.

699
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:21,680
Yesterday.

700
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:22,780
Have faith.

701
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:23,840
Was that only yesterday?

702
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:24,020
Have hope.

703
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,060
Or was it yesterday?

704
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,220
Yes, it was.

705
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,200
That's what I was saying to you tonight.

706
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,840
I was saying, I can't believe that here we are.

707
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:36,620
We're back on planet America, and all this stuff was happening just within 24 hours.

708
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:43,640
I have the strangest mixture of tender feelings, sadness, and grief-stricken horror.

709
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:45,200
In other words, I'm back to normal.

710
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,320
Yes, you're totally overwhelmed and back to normal.

711
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:54,220
Oh, well, it has nothing to do with it so far, but the horror will increase as I get closer to...

712
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,040
My home turf.

713
00:36:56,640 --> 00:36:58,440
This bleeding piece of earth.

714
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,600
This land.

715
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:03,220
This jeweled isle set in a silver sea.

716
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,520
California.

717
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,860
It's a damn foreign country.

718
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:10,700
Well, say as you.

719
00:37:11,180 --> 00:37:13,840
To us, it's the good old U.S. of A.

720
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,420
Turtle Island is the...

721
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:17,360
We stole it fair and square.

722
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,120
Right.

723
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:23,160
The Turtle Island Foundation, as a matter of fact, is another name for the people who published my last two books.

724
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:24,380
Maybe that's why.

725
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:26,040
That's why they sunk like a turtle.

726
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,740
Oh, did I say that?

727
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,860
I know how that goes.

728
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,760
Um, I guess this was on a...

729
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:37,100
Well, anyway, you heard about how they excavated that hideous withered mummy.

730
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:46,000
Well, you see, they used to pull the brains of those things out through the nose with a little silver hook.

731
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:51,820
But when the mummy in question was excavated,

732
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,640
a scientific examination...

733
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:59,560
A frightful mummy was planned and conducted by the eminent Dr. William Minot.

734
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,240
He made the first deep incision of that cut.

735
00:38:03,460 --> 00:38:06,580
There slowly trickled a thick crimson stream,

736
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:13,340
whose nature, despite the infinite ages dividing this hellish mummy's lifetime from the present,

737
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:15,420
was utterly unmistakable.

738
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:22,560
A few more deft strokes revealed various organs in astonishing degrees of non-petrified preservation,

739
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:24,180
all indeed being...

740
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:32,040
intact, except where injuries to the petrified exterior had brought about malformation or destruction.

741
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:37,240
The perfection of those ghastly, bulging eyes was uncanny,

742
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:42,040
and their exact state with respect to petrification was very difficult to determine.

743
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:46,180
But at 3.30 p.m., the brain case was opened,

744
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,920
and ten minutes later, our stunned group took an oath of secrecy,

745
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:54,240
which only such guarded documents as,

746
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:57,400
the future manuscripts of X-Day will ever modify.

747
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:04,760
Because, from the opening, we saw a pulsing, living brain.

748
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,940
So we just threw the whole thing on the fire and danced around it.

749
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:11,100
It was damn fine, isn't it?

750
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,420
Did you notice that guy lighting a cigarette off of the...

751
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,100
On the fire.

752
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:18,480
Off the fire on which Bob was burning.

753
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:19,940
Yes, it was the mummy of Bob.

754
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,420
Actually, his shoe.

755
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:21,960
The mummy of Bob.

756
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,360
The shoe of the mummy.

757
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:23,800
The shoe.

758
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:24,260
It was on...

759
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,760
It had a particularly colorful flame,

760
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:32,620
and another subgenius was, like, cooking hot dogs on it.

761
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:38,060
These subgeniuses have no awe of the mysteries of unfathomable nature.

762
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,780
We're not...

763
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:41,980
This is all real, by the way.

764
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,400
Yeah, this really happened.

765
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,700
We did chuck that mummy on the fire,

766
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:50,440
and it did cook and sparkle and fritzle, and...

767
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,100
It smelled good, actually.

768
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:52,560
Yes.

769
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,700
There was no slag like that.

770
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,480
It was pristine, except for the brain.

771
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,700
The brain was shown to be, or said to be, still active.

772
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:02,540
I'm sure we have to...

773
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,280
You know, some of this is just hysteria.

774
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:06,920
But there was other strangeness going on there.

775
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:11,960
In fact, a mystery which grew to dominate everyone's thoughts,

776
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:17,920
because some unthinkable thing stalked by night.

777
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,160
The first indication we had was a report of a pathetic,

778
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:25,580
little dog's death.

779
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:30,700
We always tell people not to bring pets to these festivals, by the way.

780
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:36,740
And that order is still in force, more so after what it was that we found.

781
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:40,140
I mean, the mysteries of X-Day are enough to blow the mind of a human,

782
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,860
let alone a dog or a cat.

783
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:45,020
Yes, Doctor Sinister, someone was out there,

784
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:49,280
and I don't know, the dog looked as if it had been...

785
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,660
If it was a dog, its cells had exploded.

786
00:40:52,740 --> 00:40:53,220
It exploded.

787
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,060
Each individual cell.

788
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:58,700
Well, then maybe that was someone's X-Day fantasy,

789
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,460
was to see exploding dogs.

790
00:41:00,900 --> 00:41:03,420
We had a very disgruntled couple leave,

791
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:06,140
and in tears and anger at us,

792
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:09,220
because of what happened to their stupid, horrible dog,

793
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:10,640
known as Snuckles,

794
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:13,600
which was already old and ready to die.

795
00:41:13,660 --> 00:41:14,460
I didn't name it.

796
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:17,940
Already old, ready to die, with a grey muzzle,

797
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,820
quivering, wet, like a...

798
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:23,480
It has been described as like a rat with a tube top on.

799
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,280
Yapping.

800
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:29,320
And yapping, yipping, and exposing its foul little yellow teeth.

801
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:29,780
That was an expensive dog, though.

802
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:32,160
That was like a purebred shih tzu or whatever.

803
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:33,960
They get attached to these things.

804
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,460
Apparently that's what happened, but if they were so attached,

805
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,140
why did they let it wander off in the shadows,

806
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,620
an oncoming dog, to an unspeakable thing?

807
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,420
So there's a part of the puzzle, then.

808
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,960
The dog wandered off.

809
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:47,520
They left it off its leash away from the camp.

810
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:50,540
Now, in this panel, it's wandering a little farther off, see?

811
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:52,540
And then some errant subgenie,

812
00:41:52,660 --> 00:41:53,780
wandering through the woods,

813
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:55,780
which found the corpse of the...

814
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:58,780
No subgenius would do that.

815
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:01,520
Well, actually, for a while, we suspected...

816
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,000
Well, we did.

817
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,800
...various different subgeniuses.

818
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,080
That was no boating accident.

819
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,860
...strangled over the poor little pup.

820
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:10,580
Actually, let's come out, come clean here,

821
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:13,060
and say we suspected that it was Dr. Legume,

822
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,860
a renegade subgenius,

823
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:17,480
the Simon Gertie of the subgenius movement,

824
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:20,800
who had joined forces with the dark thingies...

825
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:22,880
Well, the dog's neck, then, for sure. I'm sorry.

826
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:23,620
Well.

827
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:28,400
You know, there are things that lurk outside the campfire's circle of firelight,

828
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,260
waiting to pounce.

829
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:34,240
We thought our own dark legume had gone over to that side,

830
00:42:34,420 --> 00:42:39,680
and perhaps was committing these more than sinister pranks.

831
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,440
But no, it was not the case.

832
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,400
So then it was a wild animal of some kind, perhaps...

833
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,700
No animal could do that.

834
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,560
No animal could do what this would happen.

835
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,700
It couldn't have been mountain lions, and that's that.

836
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,560
It weren't...

837
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,520
No regular animal.

838
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:56,260
No animal I ever heard of did that.

839
00:42:56,620 --> 00:42:58,020
Giant spider.

840
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:58,600
Ha!

841
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,000
Well.

842
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,480
It's painful to even think about,

843
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:07,740
but so these people were actually angry at you personally.

844
00:43:07,740 --> 00:43:08,400
They left.

845
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,100
We didn't have to withstand the brunt of their anger,

846
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,480
but the next day was the baptism.

847
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:18,920
And when we went down there to begin the baptism,

848
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:23,340
as I was standing in the cold water with the ladies and waiting,

849
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:23,900
and waiting,

850
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,340
Stang didn't come.

851
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,860
He didn't come to the edge,

852
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:29,820
and what in the world was going on?

853
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:32,980
So I had to wade out with my bare feet,

854
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,520
which aren't good at wading over pine cones and rocks,

855
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:36,660
to come up to Stang,

856
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,960
and a horrible sight,

857
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:42,260
if you thought the dog was bad.

858
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,220
Well...

859
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:47,240
I thought we weren't going to talk about this, Dr. Howard.

860
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:47,800
Oh, I thought we were.

861
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:48,980
Okay, I'm sorry.

862
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:49,600
Now I'll stop.

863
00:43:50,280 --> 00:43:52,020
Okay, I got it all wrong.

864
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:53,540
I thought we were supposed to talk.

865
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:53,820
What are you talking about?

866
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:54,560
Well...

867
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,780
No, you can't hear any more about it.

868
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,460
Nope, no more.

869
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:58,360
Forget it.

870
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:58,580
Oh, the gory detail.

871
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,820
Man, spare us the fluff and give us the gory detail.

872
00:44:00,820 --> 00:44:03,640
And the worst thing was that was just the beginning.

873
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:04,940
Now you're talking about it.

874
00:44:04,980 --> 00:44:05,700
Oh, yeah, that's right.

875
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,680
We weren't going to talk about it.

876
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:08,620
We'll talk about it some other time on this program.

877
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:08,860
Yeah, yeah.

878
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:11,840
We have actual location...

879
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,720
What time after these liability issues have been taken care of?

880
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:14,520
We have to...

881
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:15,340
Right, exactly.

882
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,980
There are still ongoing investigations,

883
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:20,320
mostly by insurance companies.

884
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,520
And, of course, you know,

885
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,420
we don't want to jeopardize Wisteria's life.

886
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,420
Sorry I did that.

887
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,680
I was just getting excited and carried away with...

888
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,240
There weren't any rapes of cars.

889
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:32,580
There wasn't really...

890
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:34,520
Well, it wasn't a corpse found.

891
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:34,980
That's true.

892
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:35,780
There was no corpse found.

893
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:37,000
No corpse was found.

894
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:37,780
How can you prove it?

895
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:39,720
So you can go ahead and say all you want

896
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,160
about that bloody set of empty clothes.

897
00:44:42,260 --> 00:44:43,700
Because there was no murder.

898
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:49,640
And it's not a crime to mutilate a teddy bear, is it?

899
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:49,880
Yes.

900
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:50,080
Is it?

901
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:50,880
Yes.

902
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:51,460
Not yet.

903
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,300
Did they eat it?

904
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:53,360
It's nanny stuff.

905
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,240
And it probably will become illegal

906
00:44:56,040 --> 00:44:57,520
to mutilate a teddy bear.

907
00:44:57,540 --> 00:44:58,840
I've been trying to find a way

908
00:44:58,840 --> 00:44:59,800
for criminal...

909
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,260
Little baby teddy bears.

910
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:01,600
I've been trying to find a way

911
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:01,880
to make it a crime.

912
00:45:01,880 --> 00:45:03,320
Yes, things are going right now.

913
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:05,260
There's nothing you're going to be able to do.

914
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,980
You won't be able to rape your own mom

915
00:45:06,980 --> 00:45:07,860
for crying out loud.

916
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:12,500
Well, we will...

917
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:14,540
We are going to have to come out with...

918
00:45:15,220 --> 00:45:15,820
Come out?

919
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,700
But there's a documentary in progress.

920
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:19,520
Oh, yes, that's right.

921
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,260
We've got a...

922
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:22,860
We want to release these facts bit by bit.

923
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,380
You can sit...

924
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,740
Sit back in your comfortable abode

925
00:45:25,740 --> 00:45:28,600
and watch this on your little screen-o-rama

926
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,060
while we had to do all the nightmarish running

927
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,960
through the woods over the blood-flecked leaves

928
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,240
and hear the coarse panting of...

929
00:45:37,240 --> 00:45:39,200
Oops, I'm talking about it again.

930
00:45:39,740 --> 00:45:41,140
Let me put it this way.

931
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,220
We don't...

932
00:45:42,220 --> 00:45:44,920
We want the full story to come out,

933
00:45:44,980 --> 00:45:45,700
and it will.

934
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:46,780
It will, in time.

935
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,060
But we'd rather do it slowly

936
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,780
so as not to traumatize our Slack listeners

937
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,540
and other subgeniuses.

938
00:45:53,560 --> 00:45:54,580
Yes, we'll shape this tale.

939
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:56,260
As we were traumatized

940
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,600
because I was shaken to my very core

941
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:04,320
by the events of what we call 17X Day Drill.

942
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:05,060
Yes.

943
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,560
Of course, no actual drill was used, but...

944
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,940
Well, the old nose drill.

945
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:14,060
It's kind of a psychosomatic kind of thing.

946
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,380
It kind of doesn't really exist.

947
00:46:15,500 --> 00:46:16,120
It kind of does.

948
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,820
And near this location,

949
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,360
some rednecks were building an ark,

950
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:23,380
a huge...

951
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:23,760
Huge ark.

952
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,360
Yes, that's right.

953
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,320
I forgot about that.

954
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:29,960
They thought they would survive the iconoclasm

955
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:32,340
by sailing away like Noah and his sons,

956
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:35,160
Ham, Japheth, Shem, and...

957
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,000
Shemp.

958
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:36,500
Curly.

959
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:38,060
The iconoclasm?

960
00:46:38,060 --> 00:46:39,120
Curly died young.

961
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,320
The iconoclasm?

962
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:42,320
With all the statues burned?

963
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,540
No, no, that's the econocataclysm

964
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,000
is the full title.

965
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:46,860
I've heard that...

966
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:48,540
The econocataclysm.

967
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:50,100
Econoclasm.

968
00:46:50,520 --> 00:46:52,860
It's for a fraction of the retail price.

969
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,360
The econoclasm.

970
00:46:54,480 --> 00:46:55,260
It's been...

971
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,820
I've used that term because it's been written

972
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:01,420
by other writers as if the word was econoclasm,

973
00:47:02,140 --> 00:47:04,220
which sounds to me like iconoclasm.

974
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:05,720
But except you're breaking the economy.

975
00:47:06,020 --> 00:47:08,840
No, the original term that Bob handed down

976
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:10,400
was econocataclysm,

977
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,740
which is ongoing,

978
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:14,880
but only in its beginning phases.

979
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:17,140
And in the symbolic sense,

980
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:20,840
the iconoclasm is the ritual burning of Bob.

981
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:21,900
That happened too?

982
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,540
Kind of like what you call...

983
00:47:23,540 --> 00:47:24,300
You call it grove...

984
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,780
Harbinger's Grove, wherever it is out there.

985
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:27,820
The sacred grove.

986
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:28,960
Bohemian.

987
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:29,660
Of Dodona.

988
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:31,160
Oh, the Bohemian Grove.

989
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,300
Yeah, Bohemian's Donuts.

990
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:34,460
The crab claws were excellent.

991
00:47:35,680 --> 00:47:37,300
Oh, yes, they're excellent

992
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,600
unless you happen to be clutched

993
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:43,240
in the mirus and propodus of a giant crabus.

994
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,720
Or one of the crabs.

995
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,600
It's kind of an unfortunate situation for all.

996
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,520
Did you ever see Attack of the Crab Monsters?

997
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:53,460
I did, I did.

998
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,780
I didn't.

999
00:47:54,780 --> 00:47:56,600
I recommended it to Baby Bear,

1000
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,040
and she saw it before I saw it.

1001
00:47:58,860 --> 00:47:59,840
I still haven't seen it.

1002
00:47:59,840 --> 00:48:01,560
The main thing I remembered from it,

1003
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:02,900
I saw it as a kid,

1004
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,740
probably at age 11 or so,

1005
00:48:04,860 --> 00:48:07,100
and it had a great scene of a guy

1006
00:48:07,100 --> 00:48:10,600
getting his hand snipped off by the giant crab.

1007
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,060
And you actually saw it.

1008
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:14,560
This was rare in the late 50s

1009
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,380
to see the outstretched stump

1010
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:19,780
and the chopped off hand

1011
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,820
with the guy staring at it

1012
00:48:21,820 --> 00:48:22,740
and screaming.

1013
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:25,020
Could we download that for Netflix?

1014
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,180
Yeah, but it'll be an MST3K thing.

1015
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:30,900
Oh, that's no good.

1016
00:48:31,120 --> 00:48:32,120
The thing is, the crabs...

1017
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:33,540
You can download King Dinosaur,

1018
00:48:33,660 --> 00:48:35,160
but it's the MST3K thing.

1019
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,440
The crabs are...

1020
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:37,740
The people in this movie

1021
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:39,820
are on a little tiny island,

1022
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,220
and the crabs are underwater

1023
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:44,160
chopping it up with their claws,

1024
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:46,280
and the island's getting smaller and smaller.

1025
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,960
Also, the crabs can imitate human voices,

1026
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:51,220
and they call your name at night,

1027
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,500
and you come out to see what's going on,

1028
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:54,180
and snap.

1029
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,300
Those crabs are spreading like cancer.

1030
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:56,940
Speaking of knowing your names,

1031
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,760
how about the Crabs of Gullible Island?

1032
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,600
That sounds like a good name for the group.

1033
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:02,720
Gullible Island?

1034
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,660
The Crabs of Gullible Island.

1035
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:06,620
That was a pretty good album

1036
00:49:06,620 --> 00:49:08,480
by the Swingin' Love Corpses.

1037
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,640
Back, I'm thinking of 68.

1038
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:16,000
Anyway, yeah, Attack of the Crab Monsters

1039
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,320
had a good trailer.

1040
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:19,580
Someday I'll catch up with you.

1041
00:49:19,580 --> 00:49:21,940
I can't believe you would recommend movies like that

1042
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:23,480
to new minds.

1043
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,000
I'm trying to be complete,

1044
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:26,640
and I said I hadn't seen this,

1045
00:49:26,740 --> 00:49:28,900
but, uh, and then I...

1046
00:49:29,460 --> 00:49:30,300
It's pretty bad.

1047
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:31,400
I've seen most of them.

1048
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,520
There are a few that I haven't seen

1049
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:34,440
that I put in the list.

1050
00:49:35,220 --> 00:49:36,440
I hope to see them.

1051
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,960
It's a joy not to have seen every monster movie.

1052
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,600
It means there's still some I can see.

1053
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:43,300
There are probably thousands left

1054
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,480
that even we have not seen,

1055
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:48,060
but probably would not want to see.

1056
00:49:48,080 --> 00:49:48,920
Well, that's it.

1057
00:49:48,980 --> 00:49:50,340
Unless we were going to be immortal,

1058
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:52,140
and that's why we wish Planet X

1059
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,480
would hurry up.

1060
00:49:53,500 --> 00:49:57,560
I have no wish to spend time,

1061
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,080
especially in my advanced age

1062
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:01,280
of three figures,

1063
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:04,080
watching a monster movie

1064
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,080
that isn't any good.

1065
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:07,000
Let's watch good ones

1066
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,380
in this last little time we're in.

1067
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,600
Why did you recommend Attack of the Crab Monsters?

1068
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,780
Because in my research,

1069
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,800
as I noticed, others had done so.

1070
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:16,280
Copycat.

1071
00:50:18,540 --> 00:50:20,440
Also, she called me up.

1072
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:21,960
She called me up.

1073
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,240
She said,

1074
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:24,000
she liked it.

1075
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:25,400
I got feedback.

1076
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:26,520
She liked the movie.

1077
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,520
Well, there are many crabs.

1078
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,280
Well, that just goes to show you.

1079
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:30,580
I'm sorry.

1080
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:31,220
Something.

1081
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,380
I don't know.

1082
00:50:32,420 --> 00:50:32,720
Something.

1083
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,740
Are there many crabs,

1084
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:35,980
crab islands?

1085
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:38,540
I mean, are there many crab horror movies?

1086
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:39,280
I thought there were quite a few.

1087
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:40,060
Well, there could be.

1088
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:41,140
There's two?

1089
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,260
What's the other one?

1090
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:44,900
I don't know any other,

1091
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,640
but it seems like such a profit that the media's.

1092
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:50,280
Well, Mysterious Island had a giant crab.

1093
00:50:50,340 --> 00:50:52,200
That's what got Hal started on that.

1094
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:53,020
That's the 19...

1095
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:54,500
1963 version,

1096
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:57,280
as opposed to the 1922 version,

1097
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,480
although that had giant lizards.

1098
00:50:59,560 --> 00:51:01,860
But then also, there's crab.

1099
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:03,240
How did you, like,

1100
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,520
journey to Mysterious Island starring The Rock?

1101
00:51:07,020 --> 00:51:07,600
Hated it,

1102
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,320
especially when Michael Caine rode on the back of a bee.

1103
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,980
I didn't care for that at all.

1104
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:13,820
I didn't either.

1105
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:15,940
And he was doing his Alfie talk, you know,

1106
00:51:15,940 --> 00:51:16,340
and like,

1107
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,380
going to crab.

1108
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,340
Well, there was one scene that saved the whole movie,

1109
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:21,820
and that was

1110
00:51:22,420 --> 00:51:23,120
Dwayne Johnson.

1111
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:23,980
The Rock,

1112
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:28,920
showing his son how to bounce berries off of his chest nipples.

1113
00:51:29,240 --> 00:51:30,820
Oh, for key right's sake.

1114
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:31,500
I missed that.

1115
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:33,220
I've only seen a piece of that movie.

1116
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:37,220
I'm not going to recommend it to the Dr. Hal's movie list.

1117
00:51:37,340 --> 00:51:37,780
I'm sorry.

1118
00:51:38,080 --> 00:51:42,300
It's as bad as that modern Center of the Earth movie.

1119
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:43,360
That one was better,

1120
00:51:43,420 --> 00:51:45,460
because at least they go to the center of the Earth there.

1121
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:50,200
Is ripping nipples a part of the subject matter of all these materials?

1122
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,380
No, it's a part of X-Day,

1123
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,540
and we're just speaking, though,

1124
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:53,300
nostalgically.

1125
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,920
We're not going to see those nipples again for an entire other year.

1126
00:51:57,400 --> 00:51:59,580
I was talking about The Rock's nipples.

1127
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:00,380
Oh, The Rock.

1128
00:52:00,540 --> 00:52:01,060
Well, yes, I'm this rock I built, Mike.

1129
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:02,820
There were some good nipples at X-Day,

1130
00:52:03,020 --> 00:52:05,700
but we shouldn't be sexistful, should we?

1131
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:06,580
Isn't that bad?

1132
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,020
Are we?

1133
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:08,160
Are we being sexist?

1134
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:10,200
I'm just saying, not for another year.

1135
00:52:10,420 --> 00:52:10,680
I've had sex with rocks.

1136
00:52:11,900 --> 00:52:14,320
I've had sex with rocks many times.

1137
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:15,560
I'm sure we all have.

1138
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,160
Been on the rocks many times.

1139
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:20,720
Yes, up and over and under, too.

1140
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:23,400
And I forgot what I was doing.

1141
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,240
All right, all right.

1142
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:25,700
Now let's keep it clean here.

1143
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:25,940
All right.

1144
00:52:25,940 --> 00:52:31,500
I wasn't intending to slide into vulgarity and bawdy effusions of...

1145
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:34,620
Yeah, listen, I didn't mean to push it that way either.

1146
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,840
See, I had the better things in mind.

1147
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,060
On the other hand, I've just come here from X-Day,

1148
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:43,080
and all the subgeniuses sit around the campfires

1149
00:52:43,080 --> 00:52:48,080
talking a stream of blue speech about bawdy parts, sounds,

1150
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,240
all sorts of things.

1151
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:50,700
Yeah.

1152
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:53,100
And you can just imagine, do I have to draw you a picture?

1153
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:56,200
Right, and that's just the hour of slack shows at the cafe.

1154
00:52:57,340 --> 00:53:00,300
You should hear what the kids back in the woods are doing.

1155
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:01,120
Oh, my God.

1156
00:53:01,340 --> 00:53:02,200
Well, it's already done.

1157
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:03,800
Oh, my God.

1158
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,360
Well, it's all over and done with,

1159
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:12,120
except for the recording and distributing of X-Day-related materials.

1160
00:53:12,380 --> 00:53:14,220
Yeah, I got my work cut out for me.

1161
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:18,700
There's thousands of extrapolations based on each individual's memories

1162
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,740
of what really happened.

1163
00:53:19,740 --> 00:53:21,980
And then their memories are, in turn,

1164
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,520
each one reduced by a figure or factor of about 12,

1165
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:29,820
meaning that only one-eighth or 8% of it,

1166
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,040
8% of what they remember actually happened to them.

1167
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:34,280
It may have happened to somebody else,

1168
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:38,540
or it may have happened in the cloud ether of the air they were breathing.

1169
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:39,960
Not the cloud again.

1170
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,760
You know, I'm starting to doubt that any of this happened.

1171
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:49,360
It seems so unnaturally impossible while I'm sitting here in this prosaic studio,

1172
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:49,980
and...

1173
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:50,940
But there's proof.

1174
00:53:51,340 --> 00:53:52,720
I mean, I think there's proof.

1175
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:55,000
We brought back the negatives, the recordings,

1176
00:53:55,260 --> 00:53:58,460
unless they've been somehow erased or turned out blank.

1177
00:53:58,560 --> 00:53:58,640
Well, I hope not.

1178
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,560
Maybe we'll look at them later tonight.

1179
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:01,860
Check them out.

1180
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:04,280
Go over that material carefully.

1181
00:54:04,720 --> 00:54:05,480
It'll take...

1182
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:09,140
It's a days, days, days long effort to go through all that stuff, too,

1183
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,680
because it's not just what you see.

1184
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:12,460
The savage faces of the undergrown children.

1185
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:14,300
Yes, one day they'll all be taken care of.

1186
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:15,440
It's the background.

1187
00:54:15,700 --> 00:54:17,900
It's the hazy figures in the back.

1188
00:54:17,940 --> 00:54:18,780
Like, it's if they were...

1189
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:21,540
Somehow pulling the puppet strings of the whole organization.

1190
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:24,400
They were pulling and pushing a wheelchair.

1191
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,280
That was what they were doing.

1192
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:31,980
And someday it'll just be wheelchairs pushing other wheelchairs.

1193
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,940
There was a terrible vision.

1194
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:37,220
Geriatric subgenius, uh, X-Day.

1195
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,880
Synphaltimus sex mortis had a terrible vision

1196
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:43,700
of the wisterious stage

1197
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:48,760
surrounded by an audience all in wheels.

1198
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:49,400
Wheelchairs.

1199
00:54:49,560 --> 00:54:50,000
Everyone.

1200
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:51,600
A gaunt and blue flame.

1201
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:53,400
Old subgenius home.

1202
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,480
Weak subgenie.

1203
00:54:56,400 --> 00:55:00,040
Filled with the pee-pee and the longings of years gone by.

1204
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:05,120
Walking with different utensils they need now to maintain themselves.

1205
00:55:06,740 --> 00:55:07,860
Flip-flops.

1206
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:09,640
Armchairs.

1207
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:11,480
There were flip-flops, yes.

1208
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:12,640
Little, little twists.

1209
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,280
Oh, yes, madam.

1210
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:16,160
There were flip-flops.

1211
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:18,760
Oh, yes, madam.

1212
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,380
There were wheelchairs.

1213
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:23,860
Weep ye widders in lone homes

1214
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,000
when a subgenius meets a from.

1215
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:28,020
Madam, there were...

1216
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:29,960
Do you remember the last scenes of Zardoz?

1217
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:30,280
Monsters.

1218
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,080
When they're all begging the Zardozes to kill them?

1219
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,260
Yes, but then after that they play famous Beethoven's famous seventh symphony

1220
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:40,660
and they grow old and die in peace.

1221
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:43,960
But they grew very old, which was a nice touch, you know.

1222
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:45,040
It wasn't like they were gonna...

1223
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:46,000
And then they're just...

1224
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,240
They're just skeletons sitting there.

1225
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,360
Skeletons.

1226
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,700
While the slow movement of Beethoven's seventh symphony plays.

1227
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:54,000
But kids, you know what?

1228
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:58,240
It's the end of this hour of slack.

1229
00:55:58,340 --> 00:55:58,680
Already?

1230
00:55:58,700 --> 00:56:00,280
But it's only the beginning...

1231
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:00,720
It just seemed like it.

1232
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:04,820
...of a million hours of synesthesia.

1233
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:05,900
What he said.

1234
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:10,340
Are you boys gonna be coming up for Dr. Sinister's show there?

1235
00:56:10,580 --> 00:56:11,480
Yeah, that's right.

1236
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:13,620
Aren't you gonna stay tuned for Dr. Sinister's show?

1237
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:15,380
Should Dave call back in about ten minutes?

1238
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:15,780
You'll just...

1239
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:16,160
Nothing.

1240
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:19,120
Dave should call into my show any time he has the opportunity.

1241
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,880
Stay tuned for more cartoon fun, kids.

1242
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:22,700
Okay, friends.

1243
00:56:22,700 --> 00:56:24,820
So we'll call back in five...

1244
00:56:24,820 --> 00:56:25,700
Ten minutes.

1245
00:56:25,760 --> 00:56:29,580
And now here's Nenslow with that old subgenius hit,

1246
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:34,480
Take Me Off to Space, y'all.

1247
00:56:37,480 --> 00:56:42,440
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

1248
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:47,260
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

1249
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:52,180
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

1250
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:57,100
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

1251
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,840
Thick needles in my belly take samples of my skin.

1252
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:06,440
I don't care as long as I can live with saucer man.

1253
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:11,240
I know that you don't take requests, but I'm a special case.

1254
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:20,820
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

1255
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:25,120
Come on down, you saucer man, and take me off to space.

1256
00:57:25,940 --> 00:57:29,820
Take me off to space, take me off to space.

1257
00:57:35,660 --> 00:57:39,240
Hey, commutilators, let me join your crew.

1258
00:57:39,420 --> 00:57:41,220
Give me a knife, you'll get a kick.

1259
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:41,220


1260
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,780
Bet your life I'll cut up cows for you

1261
00:57:43,780 --> 00:57:48,360
I don't care if you're some kind of ghastly fiend without a face

1262
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:52,740
So come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

1263
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:57,520
Oh, take me off to space, take me off to space

1264
00:57:58,040 --> 00:58:02,000
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

1265
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:06,500
Take me off to space, take me off to space

1266
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:11,120
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

1267
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:15,660
Come down you tiny robots with your little nipper claws

1268
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:20,240
You pale and bug-eyed aliens with white and clammy paws

1269
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:24,620
Life is just a sucker's dream and death is a disgrace

1270
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:29,280
So come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

1271
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,600
Oh, take me off to space, take me off to space

1272
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:36,480
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

1273
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:40,280
Take me off to space, take me off to space

1274
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:47,180
Take me off to space, come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

1275
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:36,480
Come on down you saucer man and take me off to space

1276
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:41,200
Take me off to space, take me off to space

1277
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:55,180
Take me off, take me off to space

1278
00:59:55,180 --> 00:59:58,880
Take me off, take me off to space

1279
00:59:58,880 --> 00:59:59,100
Then I can't go anymore

1280
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:01,160
Oh, hey there baby, can I fight it with you

1281
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:01,800
This mouth just thought where you came from

1282
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:02,600
You hit on me, ignore like a thief

1283
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,180
I don't pay for ticking ways

1284
01:00:05,180 --> 01:00:05,560
Just wanna see

1285
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:05,620
And unfortunate opens the door

1286
01:00:05,620 --> 01:00:05,620


1287
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:14,440
worse. But some of you still have jobs. Even five bucks makes a big difference, even if it's only

1288
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:22,180
once a month from enough of you. Fifty bucks makes an even bigger difference. All we're saying is

1289
01:00:22,180 --> 01:00:30,880
that blowjobs could go the way of Steve Jobs if you don't pay Dobbs. We also take checks and money

1290
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:45,900
orders to Subgenius Foundation, P.O. Box 181417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio 44118.

1291
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:51,120
Thanks for anything you can do to help Let There Be Slack.
