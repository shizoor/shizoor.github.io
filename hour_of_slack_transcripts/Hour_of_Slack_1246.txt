And it comes down the street like a garbage wagon.
Okay.
So their brains may live on forever.
Fresh vending machine.
Has he created another?
By the miracle of recording.
I'm not very good at singing songs, but here's a try.
Well, better make it quick, kiddo.
Ridiculous theory of evolution.
Well, better make it quick, kiddo.
Peace or annihilation.
And thanks to Lee Murr for all that mess we just heard,
except for the very last part, which was by new guy Jason Myrick.
And welcome to another non-standard Hour of Slack.
I, your host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang,
was looking at a whole mess of editing I'd have to do
to polish up another show made from live winter star footage
or chopped up puzzling evidence or even a best of oldies show.
But I've got a ton of other stuff to do for Bob.
And then it struck me.
At some point in the past,
I had compiled enough new hymns and songs of a subgeniously nature
to make a seven.
Bob song CD.
But I'd never gotten around to making the packaging.
So this stuff hadn't been released except in dribs and drabs
on ancient hours of Slack from 2006.
So that solved my problem.
Here then is our of Slack number 1246
and all Bob songs episode and a sneak preview of our next official CD release,
which you now already have on MP3 from downloading this show.
But oh, well, Slack must come first in the life of every initiate.
Lee Murr.
Lee Murr shall start us off.
One, two, three.
Bob.
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob.
Bob came and did something with all of us.
Quiet.
No music on broadcasting.
Let your ass go to radio.
It's not a nightmare that's going to end.
It's just beginning because it's inside me.
You have to love Bob.
He loves you, Bob.
You love Bob.
You have to.
Or else what happens if you don't love Bob?
He'll kill you.
He'll bob you out.
Right now, I will give you all my money.
I will give you all my money.
I will give you all my money.
I will give you all my money.
I will give you all my money.

I will give you all my money.

Look, if he starts this thing, he won't be able to stop it.
It's immortality.
Attention.

Attention.
Attention.
The world stops spinning and the clock stops moving.
But something's still ticking and wearing on the inside.
Attention.
And every time you let it go like I'm doing right now,
you can feel the wear.
I know from 342 years of experience that
time control can only go awry.
The Third World War might begin any minute and we'll all be killed.
Why should we bother about giant turtles?
Yes, maybe you're right.
I know how much you love your turtles.
But there are other things in life just as important, like having friends.
Our ancient legends did mention fire-eating turtles.
The End.
I will burn.
That Awe Yes from Pastor Epley signifies that that was the soundtrack of a video, Spazz Blaster,
for which I did the music and mix using a bunch of collages by Fernand and Andy Limer
as well as Byron Werner, Sivit Stang, Reverend Rosna, Sandy Smith, and Reverend New Monet.
By the way, if anybody can tell us what happened to New Monet, please do.
In the meantime, from norelpref.com,
Norel Pref and his composition Love Church.
I gotta tell ya,

I just love church.

And the T joke is that I didn't teach my friends how to sing and

Giving. Yes, giving.
Bob!
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go!
We all thought you were dead.
No, no, still here.
How are you, Bob?
How are you, Bob?
You're a whirlwind, wrapping your dishes and plates, and then unpacking them and placing them back on the shelf.
This is not the way the Jehovah One has designed you to act.
Unless you are willing to admit that you are a gnome, a pink boy, a nini, a twig.
Only then can you decide where your path shall lead you.
But we know inherently that we are all created good by Jehovah One.
Some of you got such bad luck sometimes in your life, you couldn't hang yourself with your own necktie.
This is when you should look to Bob.
When you look to Jehovah One and say,
Bob, come into my life.
And you should see one set of footprints in the sand.
And that is when you...
You will know that Bob has charged you $5.99 to carry you to the nearest taxi.
Praise Bob and his divine ways.
You got to know that life is like a vanishing twin.
A baby inside of a twin inside of a woman's belly.
That's how confusing this wiggly world can be.
You gotta raise up above this wiggly world.
And grab the hand of Bob.
Praise him and all that flows from Bob.
And praise Reverend Raymond Lafferty who did that classic.
A wiggly world indeed.
To help solidify things, we'll now hear Bob's audition by, not Bob, but the Psychoskeletons.
BOOS GOES Hiyopi
Feels kinda like I'm in Space Land.
That's a contradiction in terms.
And Bob's shining down on me.
And no one's aiming a rifle at me.
Holy dammit.
That's a contradiction in terms.
And Bob is the giant hepatitis penis of destruction bursting forth from the portable johnny.
Now let's...
ALL be a contradiction in terms.
Herds of benign cattle wander across the earth.

the acid-washed, flush-drained landscape, all belonging to their own friendship families,
none loving any other than Bob. The flow between adjacent points of reference, points on the
line segment between the concrete to absolute oblivious eternity, sweet lord Bob. When we
all act together as men, as people, we could distinguish ourselves and betray any other.
As it was before time, but still within space, all who bow down and submit to their fractals.

Hey little brothers and sisters
Why don't you get around?
I've got something important to say to you
Something I think you need to hear
Come on now
Are you sure you got your life together?
You think you're on top of the world
But reality is about to reel its ugly head, my friends
Are you ready to face the music?
You're pink
You're pink
We think
You're pink
You're a little girl
You drive that big ol' SUV
Draining your wallet into used to be
You're in a material race you just can't win
Following society is your greatest sin
You are destined to fail, my friend
You're gonna be poor and alone in the end
You got your treasures, you got your hoard
You got your treasures, you got your hoard
But you're only gonna end up broken bored
Come on, friends
It's time to turn over a new leaf
Unleash your weakness and get some relief
Slack is king and nothing else matters
Don't be pink
Pull yourself up by your latex undergarments
Toss away all your commercial influences
The slack will be broken, it's gonna be broken

Within you can be born again
Act now, this is a limited time offer
Get yours now while supplies last
Offer void in Alaska and Hawaii
Be sure to consult your doctor about any risks that might be associated with slack
Yeah, I hope you learned something today
Now I'm going to get myself some slack
And add some variety with a bunch of� ate

Who are the overlords of the UFO?
I bring you a warning.
Every one of you listening to my voice, tell the world.
Tell this to everybody wherever they are.
Launch the sky.
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.
Shazam.
And I say it is possible for a giant lizard to have lived there for years without being sick.
You, you, you, you bloated idiot.
You stupid.

There are a bunch of art critics and we're looking for people who like to draw.
You are not safe.
I'm safe.

Long cow Dave, don't you know what they're doing to yourself?
Apparently, Bob came and did something with all of us.
The drugs I took seem to light up my brain.
And I'd say, as long as you're alive, you'll make noise.
You don't want to hurt us.
You don't want to hurt us.
You turn up like hell.

And I perform the head.
The head.
What about the head?
What about the scary poster dog thing?
That evil head.
There's no sign of Wellman.
There's no sign of Wellman.
We're just landlady.
Wellman's gone.
Wellman's gone.
Yeah, Wellman's gone.
But if we can just get the head inside that lead-lined vault, we'll be okay.
Friends, beware that head.
Save it.
I left a little Wellman at home, but he won't.
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer rose slowly above the trap between the third and fourth greens.
Down at Onion Creek Country.
The
The bleeding head slowly rose at a gentle angle above the green, dripping blood.
It hovered briefly over the sand trap and then slowly ascended towards the constellation of Orion at an angle of about 44.32 degrees.
There was no doubt that it was the head of Arnold Palmer.
That moon-faced smile was unforgettable.
There was no doubt that it was the head of Arnold Palmer.
The population, the population of South East Austin went wild.
They tore off their clothes.
They danced in the streets and said, the bloody head has come.
The time is here.
Take off your clothes and be someone else.

The bloody head of Arnold Palmer was above such things.
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer rose gently, buffeting itself slightly as it passed among some ancient pecan trees.
And slowly, still, ever moving upwards, it wobbled slightly, spraying a small glissando of blood, so to speak, on the people below it.
Healing two old ladies and giving an old man a substantial gland rebuild.
At 14 minutes after 9, the bleeding head was sighted on the forward control radar access plant at Barksdorm Air Force Base.
Three interceptors were scrambled.
One of which crashed.
The other crashed on takeoff.
They could find nothing.
The radar was still strikingly dead.
The bloody head moved north, rocketed over Dallas and Fort Worth.
The radar at Caswell Air Force Base gave subsequent indications that something large and wet was moving north-northeast,
while ascending still upwards.
Towards the constant...
The population were crying.
The bloody head moved on.
Fourteen ex-virgins were rejuvenated in Lubbock as the head passed through.
Keep your hands out of each other's marsupial pockets, boys.
What?
That's right.
Yes, the ballad of the bleeding head, a real oldie from the great Dr. G. Gordon Gordon and Doctors for Extreme Prejudice.
I'm not sure, but I think one of the musicians on that finally got out of prison after serving a term for murder.
And now, the news.
From NPR News in Washington, I'm delayed by heavy snow.
Pope Benedict XVI is instructing Irish Roman Catholic clergy to cooperate in the sex involving priests and children.
The Vatican says Benedict does expressly...
Express profound sexual regret, this time at the Vancouver Olympics.
On Wall Street, 15, 10, 2, 14, 21.
Pope Benedict says this is PR.
Your news is flawed.
Three instead of three and a half.
President Obama says...
And this is only the tripling.
Astronauts killed 18 people and injured 71 others aboard the International Space Station.
The astronauts need to encourage development of PR news from Washington.
Come on.
Come on.
Change out of this city...

Yep, Trump is a eureka

The mighty Reverend Artemia Salina engineered that one.
Nothing shrimpy about him.
And such a briny fellow.
Next up, well, I'm sorry.
I promised I wouldn't do this.
But with the help of Princess Wee and inspired by the Pneuma Pneuma Enterprises,
I sang.
This is the Subgenius Pneuma Pneuma song with our English translation
phonetically derived from the Romanian boy band original.
The title was phonetically changed from Dragos Ja Dente to rather Bob Didn't Stay.
But soon, sun's born, just eat a comb.
I know you'll be like my sub-spoon.
Genius.
Fettuccine.
Allo.

St. Paraschew.
Big ass wholesome that beef.
She's so unique.
That's if she won't share the meek.
Love will come, but Connie goes away.
Connie goes away.
Connie goes away, away.
Bob may care to cheney all the day.
But not today.
Not today.






She did all today.
Face of dogs don't ever go away.
Never go away.
Never go or go away.
She'd rebel.
She'd rather fucking stay.
Now at best we'll all keep paying.

This is a public service matter
Do you often brainstorm ideas for getting some cash
As you empty logs of poo from your garments?
Maybe you could benefit from smack
I mean slack
I had a dream
I saw it twice
I had a dream

I saw it twice
Say dearth of day or even chocolate night
Nicotine breeze at night
Misrepresented sense of tunnel
A most beef-heartian song or homage
Called
Called slack solution by the psycho skeletons
Another song that also brings to mind Captain Beefheart
Although not for any good reason
Is this masterpiece by the great Dr. Gary Gabrog Fran
Titled Tar Baby of Bob
I got no money but I got no Bob
Stuck to the Tar Baby of Bob
Said spray spray spray Luiza

A studied out when a grew boy
Said the tiger could Reap new try
A coolallows for sale

Belong to a girl
That was dashing from home
For an open bed
A thing she bets on
Red much a touch under the sky
I was stuck in a big ball of frog
Instead of this church where my socks just rot
I was stuck in a big ball of frog
I was stuck in a big ball of frog
I was stuck in a big ball of frog
I was stuck in a big ball of frog
I was stuck in a big ball of frog
I was stuck in a big ball of frog
I was stuck in a big ball of frog
I wonder what you'd do
Can't get an ATM card
And no computers too
Imagine all sub-dini's
Living life in slack
Imagine there's no modems
And sitcoms on TV
We'd hunker down in mud huts
And take some LSD
And we'd be the only ones
To get the money

You may say I'm sub-genius
But I'm not the only one
Gotta wonder if I'm really one
What I'm losing out on
What I'm losing out on



Imagine no McDonald's
And no Big Mac with cheese
No email and no voicemail
And no more songs like these
Imagine the sub-dini's
Life without the con
You
Hoo hoo hoo
Gotta wonder
If I'm really one
What I'm losing out on
What I'm losing out on
What I'm losing out on
Look into my eyes
What do you trust?
The church of the sub-genius
I know your slack
I know your trap
I've been everything
So spit and cuss
I'm the church of the sub-genius
I'm the church of the sub-genius


I know your бок and bro downstairs
Don't be quiet
And I do like it

To, coddle me.
Only you, can, paint, to me.
I smell the things, you need to be.
Church of the sub-genius.
I explore you, don't make a fuss.
I tell you when and when and when makes a fuss.
I'm the church of the sub-genius.
Like J.R. Bob Dobbs and Old Festus.
I'm the church of the sub-genius.
Church of the sub-genius.
Church of the sub-genius.
Lonesome cowboy Dave.
I love women.
A sub-genius rants, that sub-genius lies.
You don't have, to follow me.
Only, you, can, paint freely.
Freely, you gave me frock.
A sub-genius rants, that sub-genius lies.
Doctor Howe, princess queen.
Mr. Lemo, lemo, lemo.
Will crash the next, next game.
You don't have, to, follow me.
Only, you, can, paint freely.
You gave me frap.
You gave me slack.
You gave me power from Bob Dobbs' bald sack.
I am every person.
You need to be so get on the bus, puss.
Don't need to discuss much.
I am the church of the subgenius.
I'm the church of, I'm the church of, I'm the church of the subgenius.
I am the church of the subgenius.
I am the church of the subgenius.
So while sometimes days, I guess I sure believe, maybe next year will be better than the last.
I still remember.

Remember the last thing that Bob said as he was eating?
Now the drills go by so fast.
And it's one more day up in the saucer.
And it's one more night in Rushwood.
If a Friday Jones could be my island.
I wish she would.
Na, na, na, na.
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.
Na, na, na, na, yeah.
The smell of big boys and of normals.
And the feeling that they all can't love but sit in my face.
With my throat.
With her eye I look across the mill.
The way to see he exists.
On their way to burn this place.
And it's one more day up in the saucer.
And it's one more night in Rushwood.
If saucer dreams alone could bring me Susie.
Maybe I could.
na, na, na, na.
Na, na, na, na, yeah.
La, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah.

La, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah.
La, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah.
I cruise the slatter mansion sometime after 2am
And talk a little while about the church
But the conspiracy makes you move a little slower
Makes you talk a little lower about the day that we take over
It's been a while since X-Day and I guess I will believe
Maybe next year will be better than the last
I can't remember all the times I played the hour of slack
And wished my wish would make it come to pass
So it's 6.59 on Gordon's Saucer
But it's 7.01 in Brushwood
I have never made it to an X-Day
I guess I should
Really tested how shallow it is
And also, what that doesn't understand


But then being on the same page makes me feel relatively secure
And make me talk passerby
When I had cut some records
Wasn't being able to get London on Notice
on my night shift
