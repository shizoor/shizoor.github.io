00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,320
You're listening to a free audio sample from the top 10 proofs that Bob is the only true religion.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:12,600
After listening to this sample, we hope you'll consider purchasing this CD to hear the rest of the evidence showing Bob is the only true religion.

3
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,860
Thank you, and enjoy your free sample.

4
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:19,220
The Self-Genius Hour of Religion!

5
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,480
Bob?

6
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:26,940
Bob?

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:28,260
Bob?

8
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:29,520
Bob?

9
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,340
Bob?

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:34,640
Bob?

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:34,920
Bob?

12
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:36,840
Bob?

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:42,660
Bob?

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:43,700
Bob?

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,080
Bob?

16
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:45,280


17
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:45,560
Bob?

18
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,420
From PR News in Washington, I'm down half a percent and also down more than half a percent.

19
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,700
President Donald Trump is commending PR News.

20
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,260
It is great and successful.

21
00:00:57,460 --> 00:00:59,740
Within hours of publicly scolding them.

22
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,460
Trump singled out NATO.

23
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:01,820
NATO.

24
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,220
NATO.

25
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:02,540
NATO.

26
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:02,780
NATO.

27
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:02,920
NATO.

28
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,280
The Senate voted 97-2 on Tuesday in favor of PR News.

29
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:14,000
The Dow is 98-8, 24-24, 720, 1858, 61-32.

30
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,120
21st Century Fox says this is PR News.

31
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:25,280
I pledge allegiance to my slack and against the conspiracy in Pink Nation.

32
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:29,060
And to my escape vessel stocked with froth.

33
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:29,980
I pledge allegiance to my slack and against the conspiracy in Pink Nation.

34
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:29,980


35
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:31,400
One nation under Bob.

36
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,100
Unexplainable.

37
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,400
With guilty pleasures for me and fuck the rest of them if they can't take a joke.

38
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:37,560
Joe.

39
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:43,400
Oh, yes.

40
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,400
Thank you.

41
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:52,380
The Mixolydian Illiterati experience with that slack pledge of allegiance.

42
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:59,260
Friends, you'll hear more original works by subgeniuses for subgeniuses on this show,

43
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,960
The Hour of Slack, than on any other subgenius radio show.

44
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:10,780
And there actually are four or five others, including one that predates Hour of Slack by three years,

45
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,600
The Puzzling Evidence Show.

46
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:21,920
And thanks to Lee Murr for the whole opening, the mouth at the front end of the show monster.

47
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,900
Speaking of which, I've been trying to find ways to keep that monster from devouring what's left of my time.

48
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:32,820
You know, ways to streamline show production.

49
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:41,400
Not caring would be the easiest, but I've tried that and it just doesn't, well, it just doesn't even happen.

50
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:47,040
We have plenty more X-Day recordings from the last three years of drills,

51
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:52,320
but those all take editing and editing takes time and time takes time.

52
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,600
And heck, just lift it.

53
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,980
Everything okay there, dogs?

54
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,520
Everything okay there, dogs?

55
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,520
Okay.

56
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,020
Everything.

57
00:02:59,260 --> 00:02:59,500
That's fine.

58
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:10,920
Just listening to a rerun and removing the obsolete blather subjects, that takes a long time.

59
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:16,800
Anyway, I recently stumbled upon an old mixtape, well, actually a mixed CD,

60
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:24,200
that I'd made at some point of my favorite 1970s classic rock bulldada hits,

61
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,820
which aren't the same as ordinary classic rock hits by any means,

62
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:36,220
but they are by famous bands, which I've mostly declined to play on this show for about 20 years,

63
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,860
since there's so much new stuff that gets heard nowhere else, practically.

64
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:48,760
But I was surprised at how some of these hoary old rock and proto-Prog rock songs hold up

65
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,720
in terms of relevance to today's shameful world.

66
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:58,800
A 1970, 2020, 50 years later, we're right back at the same time.

67
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:58,800


68
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:58,800


69
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:58,800


70
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,520
The same place.

71
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,160
Only much, much worse.

72
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:09,320
So I thought, what if I just throw together a show that's nothing but my favorite music

73
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,700
from when I was in high school and my early college dropout years?

74
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,080
It'll be just like the radio show I did in my high school on closed circuit.

75
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,100
And it'll be easy.

76
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:26,020
All I have to do is play records, like almost every other radio show DJ in the whole universe.

77
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,580
Besides, these...

78
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:39,520
old-timey songs of yore, which are from like 1968, maybe, through 1975 or so, I guess.

79
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:42,180
They're not hits that you've heard a million times.

80
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:47,240
Half of our listeners will have never heard these particular songs before.

81
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,100
And the older half will be going,

82
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,480
My God, I haven't heard that song in years!

83
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,280
I forgot how great that was!

84
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:56,900
And we'll start with the great Captain Beefheart,

85
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,620
and then we'll be moving.

86
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:06,000
And through Alice Cooper, Jethro Tull, Neil Young, Jefferson Airplane, King Crimson,

87
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,500
Bob Dylan, and the Hee Haw Gospel Band.

88
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:13,560
And some surprises.

89
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:18,240
And strangely, they're all on the subject of religion.

90
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,680
All of these songs.

91
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:26,600
But first, from his album, Clear Spot, the great Captain Beefheart and his magic band.

92
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,120
Clear Spot.

93
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:35,500
Distant cousins, there's a limited supply.

94
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,560
And we're down to the dozens, and this is why.

95
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:46,620
Big-eyed beans from Venus, oh my, oh my.

96
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:55,020
Boys and girls, earth people around the circle, mixtures of man alike.

97
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,760
Big-eyed beans from Venus.

98
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,780
Don't leave me alone.

99
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:00,380
Let anything get in between us.

100
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:06,140
Beam in on me, baby, and we'll beam together.

101
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:10,480
I know we always been together, but there's more.

102
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,480
Mr. Zuthorn Rollo, hit that long lunar note and let it float.

103
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:48,380
Man, let your wallets flop out, and women open your purses.

104
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,500
Cause a man or a woman without a big-eyed bean from Venus

105
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,980
Is suffering with the waste of the cases.

106
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,280
Yeah!

107
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:03,160
Now you're suffering with the wisest of cases

108
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:13,840
Put them out in the sun

109
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,340
And when the night comes

110
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,980
You don't have to go out and get them

111
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,220
They'll glow with you

112
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,880
They'll glow with you

113
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,620
They'll show with you

114
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:37,160
Ain't no losers

115
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,300
Cause they're on the right track

116
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,920
Cause they're on the right track

117
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:52,400
You can be on the right track together

118
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,180
Of course, of course

119
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,400
Ain't no snafu

120
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:03,980
No folly or wrong

121
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,220
Check these out

122
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,460
Big-eyed beans from Venus

123
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,700
I'll let a few out

124
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,780
Let them pass in between us

125
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,700
Just a cousin's

126
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,180
There's a limited supply

127
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,400
And we're down to the dozens

128
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,240
And this is why

129
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,780
Don't let anything get in between us

130
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:57,280
Big-eyed beans from Venus

131
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,900
Big-eyed beans from Venus

132
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,840
Big-eyed beans from Venus

133
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:36,940
Big-eyed beans from Venus

134
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,580
Big-eyed bees from Venus

135
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,660
Big-eyed bees from Venus

136
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,260
Big-eyed bees from Venus

137
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:47,500
Big-eyed bees from Venus

138
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,640
Big-eyed bees from Venus

139
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:49,720
And I don't need to swing an egg

140
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:49,720


141
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,460
No,釁

142
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:57,020
I couldn't tell

143
00:09:57,020 --> 00:10:03,340
Well, if the bells are getting louder The songs they ring I finally recognize

144
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:14,280
I only know hell is getting hotter The devil's getting smarter all the time

145
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:24,640
And it would be nice to walk upon the water To talk again to angels on my side

146
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:36,240
Time is getting closer I read it on a poster

147
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,180
And it would expose us If owners brought the sign

148
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:14,380
It would be nice to walk upon the water To talk again to angels at my side

149
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,420
It would be nice to walk upon the water To talk again to angels at my side

150
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,600
I just come back to show you All my words are golden

151
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,300
So have no doubt to pull me out the line

152
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:48,040
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

153
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,240
I'm the one who's the darkest Of all the stars

154
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:51,380
And it would be nice to walk upon the water To talk again to angels all the time

155
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:55,900
Time is getting closer I only know hell is getting hotter

156
00:12:05,140 --> 00:12:06,900
Thank you.

157
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,840
Thank you.

176
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:33,360
How long, how long

177
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,620
Ah

178
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:02,160
guitar solo

179

guitar solo

180
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,960
guitar solo

181

Don't forget what your good book says

192
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,560
Southern change

193
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,040

194
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,020
past

Thank you.

00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:48,080
Thank you.

243
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:09,640
And you've got no place to go

244
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:24,480
Soon you'll obtain the stability you strive for

245
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,960
In the only way that it's granted

246
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:33,680
In a place among the fossils of our time

247
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,340
guitar solo

248
00:26:03,980 --> 00:26:06,540
Loyalty to the kind

249
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:10,500
They cannot tolerate our minds

250
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,940
In loyalty to our kind

251
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,980
We cannot tolerate their obstruction

252
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,400
In the only way that it's granted

253
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,380
Life is change

254
00:26:55,680 --> 00:27:00,720
How it differs from the rocks

255
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,640
guitar solo

256
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,520
I've seen the world

257
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,360
In their ways

258
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:09,520
Too often

259
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,780
For my liking

260
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,000
New worlds again

261
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,420
My life is to survive

262
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:25,060
And be alive

263
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,200
For you

265
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,100

00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:58,900

00:27:58,900 --> 00:28:01,920
Text, certain, and fairy language

271
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:01,920


272
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:01,940

00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:01,940


278
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:01,940

00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,920
Your foreabît

281
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:05,620


282
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:06,520
They call that a week

283
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,820
The powerhouse, rise and go

284
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,500
20% case gets a man

285
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,160
I'm a black, I'm water

286
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,800
I'm a talent, I'm spirit, I'm fire

287
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,480
Innocent snakes with no teeth

288
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:46,740
21st century gets a man

289
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:42,040
I'm a black, I'm water

290
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:11,980
I'm a black, I'm water

291
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:42,180
I'm a black, I'm water

292
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:43,660
I'm a black, I'm water

293

I'm a black, I'm water

299
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:20,120
Black seed, woman's seed

300
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,380
Let's go in to believe

301
00:33:23,980 --> 00:33:26,860
Money is gold, in many leaves

302
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:30,520
20% case gets a man

303
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:12,480
guitar solo

304
00:34:17,640 --> 00:34:18,240
solo

305
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:35,420
I don't have to tell anyone as old as me

306
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:37,540
that we just heard King Crimson

307
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,820
doing 21st Century Schizoid Man,

308
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:41,900
Jefferson Airplane doing

309
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:42,480
Crown of the Red Cross,

310
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:42,880
Crown of Creation,

00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:46,120
Southern Man by Neil Young,

312
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,320
and by the way, I am a Southern man

313
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,300
and he's welcome around anytime, anyhow,

314
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,380
Jethro Tull's

315
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,500
My God,

316
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,560
and Second Coming

317
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,540
by Alice Cooper.

318
00:34:58,740 --> 00:34:59,420
And now,

319
00:35:00,520 --> 00:35:01,900
Buffalo Springfield

320
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,840
with the corniest and

321
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,840
unfortunately most

322
00:35:05,840 --> 00:35:07,760
prescient of the songs

323
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,640
so far.

324
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,820
There's something

325
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,380
happening here

326
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,160
What it is

327
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,200
ain't exactly clear

328
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,980
There's a man

329
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:32,180
with a gun over there

330
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,740
Telling me

331
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:36,980
I've got to beware

332
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:39,080
I think it's time

333
00:35:39,080 --> 00:35:40,400
we stop, children

334
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:41,620
What's that sound?

335
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,100
Everybody look what's going down

336
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,780
There's battle lines being drawn

337
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,140
Nobody's right

338
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,580
if everybody's wrong

339
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,340
Young people speak in their minds

340
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:10,020
Are getting so much resistance

341
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:11,600
Falling down the line

342
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:11,600


343
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:11,600


344
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:11,600


345
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:11,600


346
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:11,600


347
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:11,600


348
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,300
behind

349
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,460
Time we stop

350
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,560
Hey, what's that sound?

351
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:17,860
Everybody look what's going down

352
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:30,620
What a field day for the heat

353
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,440
A thousand people in the street

354
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,000
Singing songs

355
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:40,000
and carrying signs

356
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,600
Singing songs

357
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:41,600


358
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:41,600


359
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,160
and carrying signs

360
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:42,680
Mostly say

361
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,360
hooray for our side

362
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,460
It's time we stop

363
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,560
Hey, what's that sound?

364
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,920
Everybody look what's going down

365
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,640
Paranoia strikes deep

366
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:09,300
Into your life it will creep

367
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:11,600
Paranoia strikes deep

368
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:12,800
Into your balls

369
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,880
As the sky slides

370
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:35,340
The war begins

371
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:41,060
Get right via a giant

372
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:06,320
One time ago a crazy dream came to me

373
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,300
I dreamt I was walking in World War III

374
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:12,020
I went to the doctor the very next day

375
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:13,860
To see what kind of words he could say

376
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,100
He said it was a bad dream

377
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,520
I wouldn't worry about it none, no

378
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:21,560
Them old dreams are only in your head

379
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:35,320
I said, holy doc, a World War passed through my brain

380
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,900
He said, nurse, get your pie at the boys

381
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:38,280
He said, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

382
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:38,280


383
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:38,540
I said, that's insane

384
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,960
He grabbed my arm, I said, ouch

385
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,100
I landed on the psychiatric couch

386
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:46,880
He said, tell me about it

387
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:58,220
Well, the whole thing started at three o'clock fast

388
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,320
It was all over by a quarter past

389
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,140
I was down in the sewer with some little lover

390
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,200
When I peeked out from a manhole cover

391
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,280
Wondering who'd be there

392
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,380
He turned the lights on us

393
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:21,200
Well, I got up and I walked around

394
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,420
Up and down the lonesome town

395
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:28,900
I stood wondering which way to go

396
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,020
I lit a cigarette on a parking meter

397
00:39:31,020 --> 00:39:32,720
And walked on down the road

398
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:34,900
It was a normal day

399
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,340
Well, I rang me a fall-out shelter bell

400
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,500
And I leaned my head and I give a yell

401
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:54,160
Give me a string bean, I'm a hungry man

402
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,380
Shotgun fired my way around

403
00:39:57,720 --> 00:39:59,420
I don't blame him too much

404
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:00,420
Though he didn't know me

405
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:08,260
I don't blame him too much

406
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:14,380
Down the corner by the hot dog stand I seen a man

407
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,660
I said howdy friend I guess it's just us two

408
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,720
He screamed a bit and away he flew

409
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:23,520
Thought I was a communist

410
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:45,900
Well they spotted me a girl before she could leave

411
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,820
I said let's go play Adam and Eve

412
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,580
I took her by the hand and my heart was thumping

413
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,080
She said hey man you crazy or something

414
00:40:56,680 --> 00:40:59,100
You seen what happened last time they started

415
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:19,020
Well I seen me a Cadillac window uptown

416
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,960
There was nobody around

417
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,860
I got into the driver's seat

418
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:27,780
And I drove down 42nd Street in my Cadillac

419
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,920
Good car to drive after a war

420
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,800
Well I remember seeing some ads

421
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,100
So I turned on my car to ride

422
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,240
But I didn't pay the car net bill

423
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:55,180
So the radio didn't work so well

424
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,080
Turned on my record player

425
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:02,600
It was rock of day Johnny singing

426
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,200
Tell your ma, tell your pa

427
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:06,780
Our loves are gonna grow

428
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:07,980
Wah wah

429
00:42:07,980 --> 00:42:08,260
Wah wah

430
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:24,140
I was feeling kind of lonesome and blue

431
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:25,860
I needed somebody to talk to

432
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:29,340
So I called up the operator of time

433
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:31,420
Just to hear a voice of some kind

434
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,840
When you hear the beep

435
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,700
It will be three o'clock

436
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,320
She said that for over an hour

437
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,400
And I hung up

438
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:56,280
Well the doctor interrupted me just about then

439
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:59,080
Saying hey I've been having the same old dreams

440
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,100
But mine was a little different you see

441
00:43:02,820 --> 00:43:05,980
I dreamt the only person left after the war was me

442
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,200
I didn't see you around

443
00:43:16,540 --> 00:43:19,620
Well now time passed and now it seems

444
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,940
Everybody's having them dreams

445
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:26,420
Everybody sees itself walking around

446
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,620
There's no one else

447
00:43:30,780 --> 00:43:34,660
Half the people can be part right all of the time

448
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:38,120
And some of the people can be alright

449
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:38,180
But some of the people can be alright

450
00:43:38,180 --> 00:43:45,420
part of the time, but all the people can't be alright all of the time. I think Abraham Lincoln

451
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:52,180
said that. I'll let you be in my dream if I can be in yours. I said that.

452
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,240
I'll fly away.

453
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:27,700
To a land on God's celestial shore.

454
00:44:28,300 --> 00:44:30,800
I'll fly away.

455
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:36,700
I'll fly away, oh glory.

456
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:38,160
I'll fly away.

457
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:42,740
I'll fly away in the morning when I die.

458
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:44,720
Hallelujah, fly, fly.

459
00:44:45,100 --> 00:44:48,100
I'll fly away, fly away.

460
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,500
Just a

461
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:52,500


462
00:44:52,500 --> 00:45:07,820
just a kid

463
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,900
ran away.

464
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:18,880
Bullshit little kitty went to a

465
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:19,380
little place and told the story of a child on a

466
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:19,380


467
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:22,960
I'll fly away.

468
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:27,680
I'll fly away, oh glory.

469
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:33,680
I'll fly away in the morning when I die.

470
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:35,700
Hallelujah, fly, fly.

471
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,040
I'll fly away

472
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,440
I'll fly away

473
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:51,780
No, that makes me cry.

474
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:56,540
That was from a hee-haw TV show from 1973

475
00:45:56,540 --> 00:45:59,900
with Tennessee Ernie Ford, Grandpa Jones,

476
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,080
Stringbean, and Roy Clark.

477
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,400
Clark, an extremely moving song,

478
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,220
obviously about X-Day.

479
00:46:07,320 --> 00:46:10,980
And before that, Bob Dylan's World War III Blues.

480
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:14,580
And now, okay, friends,

481
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:17,900
talk about your classic rock royalty.

482
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,640
Here's the ultimate, the greatest,

483
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,780
the king, Dewey Cox.

484
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:35,100
guitar solo

485
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,080
Mailboxes drip like lampposts

486
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:46,880
In the twisted birth canal of the Coliseum

487
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:52,760
Rimjob fairy teapots mask the temper tantrum

488
00:46:52,760 --> 00:46:54,840
Oh, say, can you see them?

489
00:46:55,960 --> 00:47:00,220
Stuffed cabbage is the darling of the laundromat

490
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:02,060
And the summer's a-bottomin' up the window

491
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:02,060


492
00:47:02,060 --> 00:47:05,060
Rarity mascot sat with the lumberjack

493
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,820
Pressin', passin', stingin'

494
00:47:08,820 --> 00:47:12,640
Half-synthetic fabrications of his time

495
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,800
The mouse with the overbite

496
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,340
Explained how the rabbits were ensnared

497
00:47:20,340 --> 00:47:24,500
In the skinny, skinny self-thrash

498
00:47:24,500 --> 00:47:27,100
The apothecary diplomat

499
00:47:27,100 --> 00:47:29,400
Inside the three-eyed monkey

500
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,780
Within inches of his toast

501
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,200
A roaster of an life

502
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:35,940
In my mind

503
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:38,360
I'm half-blind

504
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,840
My inner wrath

505
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,340
Is mostly death

506
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:46,040
I'm smell-impaired

507
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:48,460
If you cared

508
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:52,520
My sense of taste is wasted

509
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:55,620
On the phosphorescent orange peels

510
00:47:55,620 --> 00:47:59,020
Of San Francisco axe-encrusted frenzy

511
00:47:59,020 --> 00:48:01,660
So let me touch you

512
00:48:01,780 --> 00:48:04,260
Let me touch you

513
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:07,040
Let me touch you

514
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,840
Let me touch you

515
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:17,020
Where the royal jelly gets made

516
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:20,980
Chimes in لوpo

517
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:22,040
Where the royal Kommo

518
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:27,460
And A-m처럼

519
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:27,740
Will go ap셈

520
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:31,560
T dummy

521
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,060
Bringing weeds and social clingers

522
00:48:34,060 --> 00:48:36,620
Hangers on and fancy flingers

523
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:37,980
To the dress ball

524
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:42,220
Mushrooms and bowling pins

525
00:48:42,220 --> 00:48:44,820
Stovepipe hats and other things

526
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:48,740
I can't recall from juvenile hall

527
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:53,760
We're so unlucky and stuff

528
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:59,160
Woodrow Wilson never had it so tough

529
00:49:00,560 --> 00:49:03,480
Dairy Queen and Vaseline

530
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,440
And Maybelline, Paul Bunyan and James Dean

531
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:14,120
Allegory agencies of pre-Raphaelite paganry

532
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:16,780
And Shenandoah tapestries

533
00:49:16,780 --> 00:49:19,200
Compared with good mahogany

534
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,920
Collapsing the undying postcard romance

535
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:27,080
The feline perspicacity

536
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,060
By the universe

537
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,380
That night I held a paucity

538
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,840
Which you deemed common courtesy

539
00:49:34,840 --> 00:49:37,780
I wasn't what you thought I'd be

540
00:49:37,780 --> 00:49:41,540
I shouldn't have invited you to dance

541
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:44,500
In my tree

542
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:46,880
I'm halfway free

543
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:49,660
And in my chair

544
00:49:49,660 --> 00:49:52,220
One quarter there

545
00:49:52,220 --> 00:49:54,960
In my dream

546
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:57,640
One sixteenth cream

547
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,140
And in my chair

548
00:49:59,140 --> 00:50:01,940
In the coffee of the courtier

549
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:05,660
Of the sycophantic assistant to the king

550
00:50:06,180 --> 00:50:08,800
So let me touch you

551
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:11,540
Let me touch you

552
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:14,360
Let me touch you

553
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:17,200
Let me touch you

554
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:19,420
With a roar

555
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:32,640
You're a Construction

556
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:39,460
Let me touch you

557
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:49,340
Over here

558
00:50:51,640 --> 00:50:52,300
Sensink

559
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:54,280
At that moment

560
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:54,760
I've got to go

561
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:55,300
Before you think

562
00:50:55,300 --> 00:50:58,000
That you had a bad time

563
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:58,160
What if you don't have the right

564
00:50:58,160 --> 00:50:58,240
Besth

565
00:50:58,240 --> 00:50:59,060
To think

566
00:50:59,060 --> 00:50:59,120
You can't make these who know you

567

570
00:50:59,120 --> 00:51:03,320
with a meltdown of the classic Jefferson Airplane song, White Rabbit,

571
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:08,580
which has been covered by every drugged-out weirdo in recording Christendom,

572
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:15,100
many of which recordings were mashed together by our friend, Reverend Dr. Phineas Narco

573
00:51:15,100 --> 00:51:21,320
of that other subgenius-affiliated show called National Cynical Radio,

574
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:29,240
linked, like all the subgenius shows, on the radio page of subgenius.com,

575
00:51:29,460 --> 00:51:36,140
which also shows you how to receive eternal salvation or triple your money back.

576
00:51:36,840 --> 00:51:37,840
Praise Bob.

617
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,400
Thank you.

618
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:21,680
Thank you.

619
00:56:48,600 --> 00:56:51,440
One pill makes you larger

620
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:55,720
And one pill makes you small

621
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,460
And the ones that mother gives you

622
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:04,780
Don't do anything at all

623
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:06,500
Go at her

624
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:11,500
When she's ten feet tall

625
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,200
And if you go

626
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:18,260
Chasing rabbits

627
00:57:18,260 --> 00:57:22,840
And you know you're going to fall

628
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:25,220
Tell them a hooker

629
00:57:25,220 --> 00:57:27,660
Smoking caterpillar

630
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:31,880
Has given you the call

631
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:33,660
Call her

632
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:38,520
When she was just small

633
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:45,680
When the men on the chessboard

634
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:47,980
Get up and tell you

635
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,540
Where to go

636
00:57:50,540 --> 00:57:52,540
And you just had

637
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:54,540
Some kind of mushroom

638
00:57:54,540 --> 00:57:57,900
And your mind is moving

639
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:58,860
Oh

640
00:57:58,860 --> 00:58:01,380
Go ask Alice

641
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,660
I think she'll know

642
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:10,200
When logic

643
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,380
And proportion

644
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:14,960
Have fallen

645
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:16,700
Stopping dead

646
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:19,740
And the white knight

647
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:21,720
Is talking backwards

648
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:24,740
And the red queen's

649
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,260
Off with her head

650
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:28,100
Remember

651
00:58:29,560 --> 00:58:33,080
What the dumb mouse said

652
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:37,580
Feed your head

653
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:42,140
Feed your head

654
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,500
.

655
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:00,120
And thank you

657
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,840

659

664
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,960
Friends, you're listening to the hourglass of the day.

665
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:17,960


666
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:23,380

668
