00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:29,520
this video contains spoilers for some rounds of swearing

00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:29,980
End quote

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,640
The war is still going on.

4
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,980
But friends, back when we were told it was just starting back in March,

5
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:48,540
the lymph node institute doctors of Bob's Slack Time Funhouse at Noble WREK Atlanta

6
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,740
reacted to it and did this show, which I'm about to play belatedly.

7
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,620
Except that the war is still going on.

8
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:08,220
So, in lieu of Hour of Slack 915 or as it, enjoy the lymph node institute's oil war show.

9
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:16,620
Hello. I'll bet you thought the conspiracy had finally shut us up.

10
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:20,620
Oh no. You'll know when the man shuts us down,

11
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,400
because we'll all be there together in the great big gulag in the sky.

12
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:31,560
Tonight's show will be very long and very tough up.

13
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:37,520
It was born two weeks ago as an Ides of March slash war show.

14
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:44,620
However, it's no longer the Ides of March, so we'll save that part for the end.

15
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,720
However, if at some point we refer to the impending war,

16
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,820
or if we say hello half a dozen times, it is either due to time control,

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,860
or terminal denial.

18
00:01:59,380 --> 00:01:59,840
Hi.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,580
Hello there.

20
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:06,400
Welcome to Hour 12 of our nonstop Bob's Slack Time Funhouse war-a-thon.

21
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,440
We've been trying to avoid this subject.

22
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,540
We try to be your shining beacon of slack,

23
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,300
so you can avoid these, the general that the world is turning into.

24
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,880
We don't really care about you, the listener, at all, but we feel that it is...

25
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,500
Hey, I do.

26
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,880
I'll edit that out. Don't worry.

27
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:24,500
Hey.

28
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,540
Okay. Well, he does. I don't.

29
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,680
But we should do something in the way of public service.

30
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:34,260
The two major monotheisms are about to have a big old rumble,

31
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:37,520
which I actually thought was going to happen a lot sooner.

32
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:40,080
But here we are, and it's finally going to happen.

33
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,880
There's been...

34
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:51,560
It's been a longstanding goal to restore to U.S. control

35
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,960
the second largest oil reserves in the world.

36
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,980
It's been recognized ever since the mid-40s,

37
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,120
quote the State Department in 1945,

38
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:06,580
that this is a major component of what they called

39
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:09,540
a stupendous source of strategic power

40
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:13,020
and one of the greatest material prizes in world history.

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,080
And a major theme of U.S. foreign policy since the Second World War

42
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,900
has been to make sure that the U.S. dominates it.

43
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:26,080
France was expelled on the interesting grounds that...

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,640
It was an enemy state since it had been occupied by Germany,

45
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,780
so therefore its contracts were void.

46
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:36,700
And England was slowly reduced to what the foreign office calls...

47
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,280
British foreign office calls a junior partner.

48
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,880
The U.S. puts it differently.

49
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,940
Forty years ago, a senior statesman,

50
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:48,100
probably Dean Acheson, in internal discussion

51
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:50,780
described Britain as our lieutenant.

52
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,980
The fashionable word is partner.

53
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,940
And they like to hear the fashionable word.

54
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,340
But the reality is the actual word.

55
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,280
And control over Middle East oil has been a very large part of it

56
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,480
from the Second World War.

57
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:07,280
Let me stress that it's control, it's not access.

58
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,180
There's a lot of confusion about that.

59
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:14,200
The United States really doesn't care much about access to Middle East oil.

60
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:17,780
From up until 1970, it didn't care at all.

61
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,440
North America was the biggest producer,

62
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:23,620
but it didn't affect the need to control the region.

63
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,520
Since then,

64
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,820
the biggest importer has usually been Venezuela.

65
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,200
If you look at U.S. intelligence projections,

66
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,440
for example, the National Intelligence Council projections

67
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,000
for the next 15 years,

68
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:39,640
they predict and suggest that the U.S. should rely on

69
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:43,780
a more secure Atlantic Basin of resources,

70
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,560
West Africa and Latin America.

71
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:49,080
But that has nothing to do with control over Middle East oil.

72
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,180
That has to do with it being one of the greatest material prizes in world history,

73
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,000
which means that whoever controls it

74
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,640
and can have an effect on setting the price and production levels

75
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,460
can also determine that the wealth,

76
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,040
the vast amount of the wealth,

77
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,340
flows right back here.

78
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,100
And it does.

79
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,260
It's independent of access to oil.

80
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,600
A source of strategic power has nothing to do with access.

81
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:13,480
That has to do,

82
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,920
that translates as a lever of world control.

83
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:19,180
And that's been recognized clearly since the 1940s

84
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,240
and it remains true today.

85
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,080
Well, September 11th gave the pretext,

86
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,220
the domestic politics affects the timing,

87
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,440
and the strategy has been working quite brilliantly.

88
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:07,660
Chocolate

89
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,520
I swallow, I swallow, I swallow

90
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:34,080
B-E-A-G-G-E-R-S-A-G-I-T

91
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,980
B-E-A-G-G-E-R-S-A-G-I-T

92
00:06:52,120 --> 00:07:02,520
I swallow, I swallow

93
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:27,500
B-E-A-G-G-E-R-S-A-G-I-T

94
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:40,360
I swallow, I swallow, I swallow

95
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,120
B-E-A-G-G-E-R-S-A-G-I-T

96
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:41,160
B-E-A-G-G-E-R-S-A-G-I-T

97
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,020
I swallow, I swallow

98
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,440
B-E-A-G-G-E-R-S-A-G-I-T

99
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,640
Tall and reckless

100
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:49,960
Unreceiving, stabilized

101
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:52,620
Road to building, bird, that's all I need

102
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,360
The septic pit

103
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,780
I've got your feet to poop

104
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:00,220
I've been to hell, then man, I've got to pee

105
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,420
Malnutrition

106
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,340
My submission, you're the master

107
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:08,300
And I'll take it on my knees

108
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:10,960
Ejaculate

109
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,220
Decisology

110
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:15,720
I swallow, I swallow

111
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,740
I swallow, I swallow

112
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:18,680
B-E

113
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,160
A-G

114
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:23,520
G-E

115
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:29,220
I swallow, I swallow

116
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:33,060
B-E-A-G-G-E-R-S-A-G-I-T

117
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:40,160
A-G-G-E-R-S-S-A-G-I-T

118
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:51,000
This species, and especially this country, knows a hell of a lot of things about war.

119
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,140
Started having to fight Indians when we got dumped here.

120
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,500
Well, we didn't have to fight them, but we chose to kill them.

121
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:59,680
They had all these fields cleared off that we wanted to build our towns in.

122
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,100
We had to kill them and take it.

123
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,400
And then we had to, you know, fight off other colonies.

124
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,220
The frogs.

125
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,900
There's been a longstanding problem with the French in America.

126
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,300
We helped them in their revolution.

127
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:09,520
Revolution.

128
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,740
And they helped us in ours.

129
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,100
Very much so.

130
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,140
They sent generals.

131
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:15,340
They sent tacticians out here.

132
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:19,720
France has done more for us than probably any other country in the world.

133
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,900
And we hate them.

134
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,320
Well, we don't hate them.

135
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,860
The English do.

136
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:29,280
And the bluebloods of our own society hate them because the French know what to do with their royalty.

137
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,960
They don't let them hang around and draw a stipend.

138
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,100
They empty them out in the middle of the street.

139
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:39,100
When you are anointed by God to be the king to run the world, egalitarian values.

140
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,840
Don't really work out so well.

141
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:44,100
So you can take your freedom fries and stuff them up your ass.

142
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,260
I say we bulldoze the goddamn Statue of Liberty.

143
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,840
Just push it into the fucking water.

144
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,580
We don't need anything from those frogs.

145
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:53,800
The French gave us the Statue of Liberty and we gave them Jerry Lewis.

146
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,520
Listen, you know, the French know a lot about cheese.

147
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,860
They know a lot about oral sex.

148
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,380
French generals suck.

149
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,880
OK, I'll grant you that.

150
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,000
You take my life, but I'll take your soul.

151
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,780
You throw your musket foot or run your throat.

152
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,600
So when you're waiting for the next attack.

153
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,040
You better stay and there's no turning back.

154
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,440
The vehicle sails, the charge begins.

155
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,580
But on the battlefield no one wins.

156
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,600
The smell of acrid smoking hoists is free.

157
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,480
As they plunge on into certain death.

158
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,380
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

159
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:34,300
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

160
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,780
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

161
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:48,140
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

162
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:48,420
Oh, oh.

163
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:56,540
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

164
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,080
Oh, these words were fair with word to word.

165
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,080
A matter of the rushing gas.

166
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,900
And as we race towards the human war.

167
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,060
The screams of pain as my comrades fall

168
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:13,820
We are the bodies that lay on the ground

169
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,180
And the Russians are another round

170
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:19,960
We get so near, yet so far away

171
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,780
We won't live to fight another day

172
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:23,860
Oh

173
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:25,100
Oh

174
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:25,920
Oh

175
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,000
Oh

176
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,680
Oh

177
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:27,920
Oh

178
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:29,580
Oh

179
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:31,420
Oh

180
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:32,220
Oh

181
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:32,360
Oh

182
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:32,460
Oh

183
00:11:32,460 --> 00:11:32,840
Oh

184
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:32,840


185
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:33,060
Oh

186
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,420
Oh

187
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:33,640
Oh

188
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:33,640


189
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:33,700
Oh

190
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:33,760
Oh

191
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:33,760


192
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:33,840
Oh

193
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:35,800
Oh

194
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:35,820
Oh

195
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,340
Oh

196
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:36,520
Oh

197
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:36,520


198
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:36,600
Oh

199
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:36,700
Oh

200
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:36,700


201
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:37,880
Oh

202
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:37,880


203
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:37,880


204
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:37,880


205
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:37,880


206
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:37,880


207
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:37,880


208
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:37,880


209
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:37,880


210
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:37,880


211
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:37,880


212
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:37,880


213
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:37,880


214
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:37,880


215
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,460
Oh

216
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:38,460


217
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,000
Oh

218
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,100
Oh

219
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:39,600
Oh

220
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:41,780
Oh

221
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:44,860
Oh

222
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,120
Oh

223
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,320
Oh

224
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,240
Oh

225
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:47,540
Oh

226
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,160
Oh

227
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:48,300
Oh

228
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:04,240
We get so close, near enough to fight

229
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:07,220
When a Russian gets me in his sights

230
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:10,280
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow

231
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,940
I burst a rail, take my arm below

232
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,980
And as I lay there gazing at the sky

233
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,220
My body's numb and my throat is dry

234
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,780
And as I lay forgotten and alone

235
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:25,480
Without a tear I draw my parting pro-no

236
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,100
Oh

237
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,640
Oh

238
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:32,620
Oh

239
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,100
Oh

240
00:12:37,880 --> 00:13:07,880


241
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,420
I've got to get out of this room

242
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:10,420


243
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:10,420


244
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:10,420


245
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:10,960
Hey, you guys

246
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,800
I'm Captain Kilgore Moose

247
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:13,980
Jesus

248
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,020
Your Francois, the famous downhill skier

249
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,760
Oui, it is I

250
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,280
We, it is I

251
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:21,340
Come on, hop on

252
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,160
We got some toy boys to hot-knock

253
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,860
Ponches, ponches

254
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,240
It's Francois Frog, the downhiller

255
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,780
Oh boy, this I gotta see

256
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:30,480
Oh, boy, this I gotta see

257
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:31,400
Hey, Francois

258
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,700
Watch me pull out some skis from my helmet

259
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:33,920
Watch me pull out some skis from my helmet

260
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,260
He's that safe in a helicopter?

261
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:37,860
Probably not

262
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:37,860


263
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:37,860


264
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:37,860


265
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,380
Probably not. I guess that's why you're the expert.

266
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:44,020
Hey Pontius, set it down on that mountain top.

267
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,440
Get out and ski, Francois.

268
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,340
What should I do?

269
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:51,220
You're coming with me. You gotta see this.

270
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,880
Good luck, crazy, stupid Canucks.

271
00:13:57,860 --> 00:14:03,080
Phil and the moose soared high above the battlefield, the sleigh dangling beneath them.

272
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,460
Look how that hill breaks. To the left and to the right.

273
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,740
There it is. That hollowed out tree.

274
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:14,140
Our intelligence reports say that's where the elves make their cookies.

275
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,640
And chemical weapons.

276
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,700
We're gonna burn the hell out of that tree.

277
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,560
And every damn toy boy in it, under it and around it.

278
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:28,940
The ski patrol waged a fearsome offensive on the tree with tow missiles.

279
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,680
Alright Pontius, let them have the hot nog.

280
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,220
Oh, this is gonna be great.

281
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,040
You smell that? Do you smell that?

282
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,000
Fresh baked cookies, son. Nothing else in the world smells like that.

283
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:43,240
Oh, I love the smell of cookies in the morning.

284
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,520
You know, one time we had a tree hot nogged for 12 hours.

285
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,220
When it was all over, I walked up. We didn't find one of them.

286
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,280
And not one goddamn toy boy corpse.

287
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,280
The smell. You know that cinnamon smell? The whole hill.

288
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,040
Smelled like... smelled like victory.

289
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,360
This conflict started August 2nd, when the dictator of Iraq

290
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,300
invaded a small and helpless neighborhood.

291
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,740
The crime has nothing to do with invasions.

292
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:14,980
It's pretty much duplicating what the US had just done a couple of months before in Panama.

293
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,540
Kuwait, a member of the Arab League and a member of the United Nations was crushed.

294
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,860
Its people brutalized.

295
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,220
Five months ago, Saddam Hussein started this cruel war against Kuwait.

296
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:35,180
He certainly is a brutal tyrant and a mass murderer, just as he was when the US was openly supporting him.

297
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,920
The overwhelming majority of his crimes were committed during this period when he was a friend and a ally.

298
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:47,820
While the world waited, Saddam Hussein systematically raped, pillaged and plundered a tiny nation.

299
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:49,680
No threat to his own.

300
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:55,200
At the time of the Hababja atrocities and later atrocities against the Kurds,

301
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:01,060
the atrocities were being carried out with the support of George Bush and Margaret Thatcher.

302
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:05,340
He subjected the people of Kuwait to unspeakable atrocities.

303
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,920
And among those maimed and murdered, innocent children.

304
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,640
The attack on the Kurds in northern Iraq destroyed large agricultural areas,

305
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:19,180
as well as killing plenty of people, probably tens of thousands.

306
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:20,940
Innocent children.

307
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:23,200
Plenty of people, probably tens of thousands.

308
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,120
Murdered.

309
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:28,900
That gave Bush an opportunity to do a favor for big US agribusiness

310
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:34,220
and send extensive credits to Saddam Hussein so he can purchase agribusiness exports.

311
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:38,520
After they had wiped out the agricultural areas in Iraq.

312
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:43,680
Others traveled to Baghdad in a variety of efforts to restore peace and justice.

313
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:48,780
So concerned to evade diplomatic efforts, and they did.

314
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:53,460
Arab leaders sought what became known as an Arab solution,

315
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:58,080
only to conclude that Saddam Hussein was unwilling to leave Kuwait.

316
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:03,740
Chief of Staff Powell in internal discussion said the problem is that Saddam may withdraw

317
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:11,100
leaving a puppet regime in place at which point everyone in the Arab world will be happy.

318
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,100
That's what they expected and they wanted to prevent.

319
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,580
No choice but to drive Saddam from Kuwait by force.

320
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,160
We will not fail.

321
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:25,720
The rebelling Iraqi generals requested from the United States, from General Schwarzkopf,

322
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:32,480
they wanted to obtain, didn't want help, but they wanted access to captured Iraqi arms

323
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:39,580
that they could use in their effort to overthrow the tyrant and carry out a popular revolution.

324
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:43,300
Now that was refused. They were not permitted access to arms.

325
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:51,640
Saddam Hussein was authorized to use military gunships to attack.

326
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:57,280
Rebels, air attacks are underway against military targets in Iraq.

327
00:17:57,580 --> 00:18:02,460
Our operations are designed to best protect the lives of all the coalition leaders.

328
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:11,180
So, the heroes of Afghanistan, 블 Premier 페ش gover,

Unspeakable atrocities.

339
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:41,460
Biological warfare with exactly the catastrophic effect that they predicted.

340
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:46,680
Iraq will eventually comply with all relevant United Nations resolutions

341
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:57,800
and then when peace is restored, it is our hope that Iraq will live as a peaceful and cooperative member of the family of nations,

342
00:18:58,180 --> 00:19:01,860
thus enhancing the security and stability of the Gulf.

343
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:07,860
The rebellion was crushed, Basra was devastated, so were other areas,

344
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:10,840
and the Bush administration was pretty frank about the reasons.

345
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:19,080
March 1991, after the so-called war, they simply preferred what they called an iron-fisted Iraqi junta

346
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,620
to the threat of a popular revolution.

347
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,380
Cooperative members.

348
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,380
And therefore had to, in the name of what's called stability.

349
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,520
Stability of the Gulf.

350
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,420
Had to support these men.

351
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,800
Major atrocities.

352
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,020
Unspeakable atrocities.

353
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:40,700
In which very possibly as many or more civilians were killed during the bombing a month earlier.

354
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,340
We will not say.

355
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:52,560
From here to eternity.

356
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:54,940

00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,920
I was there, I saw it.

358
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:01,840
I saw women thrown down on 5th Avenue.

359
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,280
And raped in their mink coats.

360
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:08,360
By blacks and whites and yellows.

361
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:12,680
While street urchins stripped the rings from their fingers.

362
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,780
A young officer stood nearby.

363
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,100
Aren't you going to do something, I demanded.

364
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:21,540
He looked at me and yawned.

365
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:26,880
I found Colonel Bradshaw bivouacking in the Ritz.

366
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:29,580
I told him bluntly what was going on.

367
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,520
His eyes glinted shamelessly as he said.

368
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:38,380
Well, you have to take a broad general view of things.

369
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,680
And that's what I have been doing.

370
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:48,100
Taking a broad general view of American troops raping and murdering helpless civilians.

371
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:51,880
While American officers stand around and yawn.

372
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,280
We've had it a long time ladies.

373
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,080
The old army game.

374
00:20:58,280 --> 00:20:59,480
From here to eternity.

375
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:02,920
It pays to pay the boys off.

376
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,020
Tacitus describes a typical scene.

377
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:10,200
If a woman or a good looking boy fell into their hands.

378
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,000
They were torn to pieces in the struggle for possession.

379
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,460
And the survivors were left to cut each other's throats.

380
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:21,400
Well, there's no need to be that messy.

381
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,640
Why waste a good looking boy?

382
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:28,300
Mother loving American army run by old women.

383
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,400
Many of them are religious.

384
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,600
My God.

385
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,140
Hanging American soldiers.

386
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:35,680
Raping and murdering civilians.

387
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,300
Oh Sarge Bellows.

388
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,860
From here to eternity.

389
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,940
What the bloody hell are civilians for?

390
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:44,340
Soldiers pay.

391
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,680
There was the American Revolution.

392
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,940
The French Revolution.

393
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,680
And then the second American Revolution.

394
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,600
Which hasn't technically happened.

395
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:58,280
Not quite.

396
00:21:58,280 --> 00:21:58,740
Not quite yet.

397
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,700
I couldn't believe what they did to those protesters.

398
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,960
God, why would they use gas on American people like that?

399
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:07,340
I guess they took a page out of the Iraqi methodology.

400
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,900
Gassed his own people.

401
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:12,520
The Kurds are not Saddam Hussein's own people.

402
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,300
They're in the way.

403
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,160
The Kurds in the way.

404
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:15,680
Kurds in way.

405
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,500
I mean that's just propaganda.

406
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,200
Propaganda during wartime?

407
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,780
I know it's strange isn't it?

408
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,920
Yes, we have used chemical weapons on our own people.

409
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,960
We've tested them on our own soldiers.

410
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:28,120
We've released them into the air in San Francisco.

411
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,400
We gave black guys syphilis just to see what would happen.

412
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,800
And same thing with LSD.

413
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,360
We injected black guys with LSD to see how long it would take them to freak out.

414
00:22:39,460 --> 00:22:40,080
The answer?

415
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,600
I don't know.

476
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:43,240
policy as one of consistent unequivocal support for Saddam Hussein in the war against Iran.

477
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:48,900
CIA Director Casey personally spearheaded the effort to ensure that Iraq had sufficient

478
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:55,280
military weapons, ammunition, and vehicles to avoid losing the Iran-Iraq war. The United States

479
00:31:55,280 --> 00:32:00,520
actively supported the Iraqi war effort by supplying the Iraqis with billions of dollars

480
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:07,600
of credits by providing U.S. military intelligence and advice to the Iraqis. The United States also

481
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,120
provided strategic operational advice to the Iraqis to better use their assets in combat.

482
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:14,300
Teicher said,

483
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:21,340
I personally attended meetings in which CIA Director Casey or CIA Deputy Director Gates

484
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:28,940
noted the need for Iraq to have certain weapons such as cluster bombs and anti-armor penetrators

485
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:30,500
in order to stave off the Iraq war.

486
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:38,760
When I joined the NSC staff in early 1982, CIA Director Casey was adamant that cluster

487
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:43,880
bombs were a perfect force multiplier that would allow the Iraqis to defend against the

488
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,380
human waves of Iranian attackers. Teicher noted,

489
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:54,080
Teicher's NSC files are in the Ronald Reagan Presidential Archives in Simi Valley, California.

490
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:57,540

494
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:10,060
The U.S. Department of Commerce licensed 70 biological exports to Iraq between 1985 and

495
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:18,100
1989, including at least 21 batches of lethal strains of anthrax sent by the American Type

496
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,400
Culture Collection, then situated in Rockville and now in Virginia.

497
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:29,020
Shipments continued beyond Reagan under President Bush after the Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988.

498
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,420
In other words,

499
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:35,580
Saddam Hussein was still able to purchase biological products for at least four more

500
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:40,880
years after the justification of U.S. administration worry about Iran was passed.

501
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:49,240
Also between 1985 and 1989, Iraq's Atomic Energy Commission got 17 batches of, quote,

various toxins and bacteria, unquote.

503
00:33:52,340 --> 00:34:00,500
In 1985, the CDC, now the CDCP, shipped at least three samples of Western-style nuclear

The case was dismissed due to jurisdictional reasons.

516
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:58,780
Aside from biological and chemical products, American companies were also licensed by the Commerce Department to supply Saddam with computers, components, electronics, and specialized equipment for future weaponry.

517
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:02,640
Other shipments went to Iraq without benefit of licensing.

00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,400
Hussein.

541
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:17,700
Well, Afghanistan's no fun.

542
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,560
So, what do you say?

543
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:22,440
We don't even have to win this war.

544
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:27,320
We just want a cut down on some of this excess population.

545
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,560
Hello.

546
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,380
Just start up a draft.

547
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,420
Draft as many of those people as you can.

548
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,240
We'll call up every last youngster we can get our hands on.

549
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:41,200
Give them an hour or two to learn how to use an automatic rifle.

550
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,240
Send them on their way.

551
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:49,880
El Salvador and Northern Ireland are a moderately repressive regime in South America.

552
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,100
We'll just cook up a good threat story in the Middle East.

553
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,180
We need that oil.

554
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,960
We had Libya all ready to go.

555
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:01,020
Although, Colonel Qaddafi's hit squad didn't even show up.

556
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:05,020
I tell you, that man is unreliable.

557
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:08,520
The Russians had their finger on the button just like we did for that one.

558
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,940
Just think for a minute.

559
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,380
We can make this war so big.

560
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:16,620
So big.

561
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:21,860
The more people we kill in this war, the more the economy will prosper.

562
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:27,940
We can get rid of practically everybody on your dole queue if we plan this war.

563
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:28,020
That's right.

564
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:32,180
Take every loafer on welfare right off our computer rolls.

565
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,860
Don't worry about those demonstrators.

566
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:41,160
Just pump up your drug supply.

567
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:47,260
So many people have hooked themselves on heroin and amphetamine since we took over.

568
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,920
Just like Vietnam.

569
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,080
We had everybody so busy with LSD they never got too strong.

570
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:55,840
Kept the war functioning just fine.

571
00:38:56,340 --> 00:38:56,960
It's easy.

572
00:38:57,720 --> 00:39:04,220
We got our college kids so interested in beer, they don't even care if we start manufacturing germ bombs again.

573
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,440
The nuclear stockpile in their backyard, they wouldn't even know what it looked like.

574
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:10,260
So how about it?

575
00:39:10,380 --> 00:39:13,100
I mean, look, war is money.

576
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:20,380
The arms manufacturers tell me unless we get our bomb factories up to full production, the whole economy is gonna collapse.

577
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:22,560
The Soviets are in the same boat.

578
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,160
We all agree the time has come to the big ones.

579
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:25,860
So what do you say?

580
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,860
It was marvelous.

581
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,640
That's excellent.

582
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:33,300
We knew you'd agree.

583
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,220
The companies will be very pleased.

584
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:17,320
And then I heard a lot of people get their stuff back.

585
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,320


586
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,320


587
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,320


588
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,320


589
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,320


590
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,320


591
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,320


592
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,320


593
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,320


594
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:17,360
Bye.

595
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:17,380
Bye.

596
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:17,380


597
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:17,380


598
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,060
Bye.

599
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:18,840
Bye.

600
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:19,140
Bye.

601
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,020
Bye.

602
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,020


603
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,020


604
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,020


605
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,020


606
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,020


607
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,020


608
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,020


609
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:20,020


610
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:23,060
Bye.

611
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,640
Thank you.

612
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,020
Thank you.

613
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,660
Thank you.

614
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:03,300
Thank you.

615
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:35,260
Thank you.

616
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:06,140
Thank you.

617
00:43:33,380 --> 00:43:35,720
Thank you.

618
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,420
Thank you.

619
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:45,540
Thank you.

620
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:10,860
Thank you.

621
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,520
Thank you.

622
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:33,780
Thank you.

623
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:25,120
Thank you.

624
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:34,600
Imagine how freedom would spread.

625
00:46:55,300 --> 00:46:58,000
The incredible freedom we understand now.

626
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:00,000
Don't look.

627
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,320
Don't look.

628
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:05,620
Don't look.

629
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:25,680
.

630
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:28,140
.

631
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:39,520
.

632
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:47,340
.

633
00:47:47,340 --> 00:47:47,600
.

634
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:48,840
Dad!

635
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,660
I'm a living fucking

636
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,280
I'm a living fucking

637
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:02,960
These are the times that rock and soul

638
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:17,200
I tell you this, I don't know what's gonna happen man, but I wanna have my kicks before the whole dish house goes up in flames, alright!

639
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:22,340
But, boo-ni-puff-hoo, they have their problems and we have ours.

640
00:48:22,340 --> 00:48:30,100
One of our main problems is that many creatures will exert no effort until forced to do so by a need or threat.

641
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:36,520
If you are one of these, then it is time to consider acquiring a few defensive adaptations.

642
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:39,520
Yes, it is evolution time!

643
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:47,400
Don't worry, your helix is old and has twisted past far worse than this, so just relax and listen.

644
00:48:48,620 --> 00:48:52,320
First and foremost, it is absolutely necessary that you remember that you are not alone.

645
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:52,320


646
00:48:52,340 --> 00:48:53,120
Remember to breathe.

647
00:48:53,460 --> 00:48:58,460
I know this may sound a bit elementary, but the basics are so easily overlooked.

648
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:03,460
I have seen many a smooth operator busted by a gasp.

649
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:13,740
Regulating the depth and frequency of your respiration not only moderates your heart rate and blood pressure, but also provides a certain sense of personal continuity.

650
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,040
In a similar vein, resist the temptation to scratch your itches.

651
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:20,400
In the literal physical sense now.

652
00:49:20,600 --> 00:49:22,320
Not the dirty little urination.

653
00:49:22,340 --> 00:49:24,160
The things that get you into so much trouble.

654
00:49:24,380 --> 00:49:52,280
While the full explanation of this exercise is out of the question, I will say that if you can refrain from this proprietary habit, then, hypothetically, this practiced willful resistance can travel with you up the scale of physical and psychic invasion to the uncharted territory of technological torture, leaving the, uh, client intact within the parameters of the, uh...

655
00:49:52,280 --> 00:49:52,320
The, uh...

656
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,440
Adverse stimuli.

657
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:58,900
And while we are on the subject of torture, you need to learn to lie.

658
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,360
That is, pull the wool over your own eyes.

659
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,380
Learn to lie to yourself.

660
00:50:04,860 --> 00:50:14,600
You must fully internalize your lies, whether they are part of a cover story or an innocuous explanation for your particularly freaky endeavor.

661
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:16,800
Memorize your lies.

662
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:20,020
Practice them in front of a mirror, a long mirror.

663
00:50:20,020 --> 00:50:22,040
You lie with your entire body.

664
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:27,580
Lie to yourself in front of the long mirror until you convince yourself.

665
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:33,260
Also of crucial importance, you will need your senses crackling at full capacity.

666
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,340
By now, you should have already sharpened your defensive paranoia to a hair's breadth.

667
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:50,000
If not, then you are dangerously behind the curve and the only advice I can offer is to try to notice everything and use every drop of your sensorial flood to construct a mental, emotional, and emotional response.

668
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,640
Evanescent, and ecocentric universe.

669
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:52,760
Which,

670
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:55,460
some studies show to be the most accurate model.

671
00:50:56,780 --> 00:51:00,820
Of course, none of this may prove relevant right now, this minute.

672
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:02,400
Then again, it might.

673
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:06,620
And I've always thought it better to be overly vigilant in advance,

674
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:10,600
than to be caught with your input jack dangling in the breeze.

675
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:12,780
If you still have time,

676
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:19,820
please direct any questions to PO BOX 670-541 Marietta, Georgia.

677
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:19,980
PO BOX 670-541 Marietta, Georgia.

678
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,560
30066-0126.

679
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:26,020
If you missed that,

680
00:51:26,120 --> 00:51:28,960
we will give it one final time

681
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,820
at the end of the show.

682
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:31,640
Good luck.

683
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,480
We are in it for a comeback

684
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:50,180
The sirens that live through the day

685
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,940
Prepared for war we will kill

686
00:51:52,940 --> 00:51:55,740
We will all prove what we find our way

687
00:51:56,480 --> 00:51:58,360
Closer to the sword

688
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:01,200
Feel the smell of burning bodies

689
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,080
The sound of screaming men

690
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,500
For peace we will stay

691
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,640
We rise to kill under God's command

692
00:52:09,640 --> 00:52:12,360
Attack and serve our fatherland

693
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,860
We want to kill and ready to fight

694
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,160
Under God's command

695
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:17,360
Cause we are right

696
00:52:17,360 --> 00:52:19,820
On the fields are made tonight

697
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,260
Panzers filled with metal

698
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,360
Our heroes will be left behind

699
00:52:25,360 --> 00:52:27,440
In our memories still immortal

700
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,320
We have lost the war

701
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:33,680
But still we got the will to be free

702
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,860
Which we've placed it in

703
00:52:35,860 --> 00:52:38,380
The songs we sing out loud

704
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,420
We rise to kill under God's command

705
00:52:41,420 --> 00:52:44,060
Attack and serve our fatherland

706
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,560
We want to kill and ready to fight

707
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,880
Under God's command

708
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,060
Cause we are right

709
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:52,380
Attack and serve our fatherland

710
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:56,480
We rise to kill under God's command

711
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:58,840
Attack and serve our fatherland

712
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,620
We rise to kill under God's command

713
00:53:02,620 --> 00:53:04,160
Attack and serve our fatherland

714
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:04,160


715
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:04,320
We rise to kill under God's command

716
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:04,320


717
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:04,620
Hang on centuries

718
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:04,620


719
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:04,620


720
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:04,620


721
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:04,620


722
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:05,860
Oh I realized

723
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:05,860


724
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:06,440
War will come to Moea

725
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:06,440


726
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:36,420
We'll be right back.

727
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:40,460
That's the reason why.

728
00:53:47,920 --> 00:54:01,260
That's the reason why.

729
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:06,080
Break and kill under God's command.

730
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,860
War tech can serve a fatherland.

731
00:54:09,060 --> 00:54:11,660
War boy to kill and ready to fight.

732
00:54:11,800 --> 00:54:13,320
War boy to kill and ready to fight.

733
00:54:13,320 --> 00:54:14,280
War boy to kill and ready to fight.

734
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,960
War boy to kill and ready to fight.

735
00:54:16,260 --> 00:54:17,580
So good luck with that war, everybody.

736
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:19,580
Yeah, we'll be in the bunker.

737
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:23,800
We'll probably come back and be talking about shoes or some mundane crap.

738
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:26,020
If you would like more information on the tag.

739
00:54:26,380 --> 00:54:30,100
If you would like more information on the Church of the Subgenius.

743
00:54:47,080 --> 00:54:49,160

747
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:12,760
30066-0126

748
00:55:13,320 --> 00:55:15,940
Because we don't want to live in a world full of zombies.

749
00:55:16,120 --> 00:55:16,760
Do you?

750
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:17,580
Oops.

751
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:19,040
Too late.

752
00:55:19,720 --> 00:55:25,280
You heard Noam Chomsky talking about the American plan to take over the world again.

753
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:32,060
And behind that and a few other pieces were the master musicians of Zizuka wailing away.

754
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:33,860
Faith no more.

755
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:35,020
Belting.

756
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,320
Be aggressive.

757
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,940
The Iron Maidens.

758
00:55:38,940 --> 00:55:41,980
A female Iron Maiden cover band.

759
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:47,740
LNI did the hot-nogging of the Toy Boys excerpt from Apocalypse Clause.

760
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:52,720
Then you heard George Bush and Noam Chomsky all cut up there together by somebody.

761
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:58,680
And then William Burroughs and the disposable heroes of hypocrisy.

762
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,680
Performing Mildred Pierce reporting from here to eternity.

763
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,920
Then Jimi Hendrix.

764
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,860
With the bombs and rockets portion of the Star Spangled Banner.

765
00:56:10,980 --> 00:56:16,560
And then old rummy Don Rumsfeld doing what he does best.

766
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:17,860
I love that line.

767
00:56:17,980 --> 00:56:18,940
I don't know that.

768
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:20,620
I'll remember that one.

769
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,540
Then Slayer performed chemical warfare.

770
00:56:23,980 --> 00:56:27,660
And then I read excerpts from an article by Margie Burns.

771
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:33,380
The Dead Kennedys lampooned kinky sex makes the world go round.

772
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,900
Then you heard the coping with monogamy.

773
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:36,900
Theologi's lecture.

774
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:38,880
The Police State Collage.

775
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:43,280
And then the second half of the lecture from the Police State Survival Show.

776
00:56:43,520 --> 00:56:44,760
All by LNI.

777
00:56:45,460 --> 00:56:50,600
And then you were gripped in the talons of a tough but unwieldy bird.

778
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:51,880
From Holland.

779
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:53,540
Hammerhawk.

780
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:55,520
Performing war.

781
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:11,220
And I want President Bush to get a good look at this.

782
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:14,200
Real good look here.

783
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:17,340
It's the only son I had.

784
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,220
Only son.

785
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:23,300
And then he walks away a lot of tears.

786
00:57:23,800 --> 00:57:26,200
What the hell do you think you're doing?

787
00:57:26,380 --> 00:57:27,440
Superior mutants.

788
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,260
Repent.

789
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:29,300
Quit your job.

790
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:29,880
Slayer.

791
00:57:30,140 --> 00:57:32,100
The world ends tomorrow.

792
00:57:32,540 --> 00:57:33,760
And you may die.

793
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:35,100
Well no, probably not.

794
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,020
But whatever you do, just keep listening.

795
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,280
The Church of the Subgenius could save your sanity with...

796
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,580
Are we controlled by secret forces?

797
00:57:45,000 --> 00:57:47,760
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

798
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:49,260
Do people think you're strange?

799
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:50,140
Do you?

800
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,800
Then you may be on the right track.

801
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,020
Are alien space monsters bringing new startling new worlds?

802
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,660
Are alien space monsters bringing new startling new worlds?

803
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:02,080
Jehovah is an alien and still threatens this planet.

804
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,720
Now, at last.

805
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:05,080
The step by step process.

806
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:05,080


807
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:05,080


808
00:58:05,100 --> 00:58:05,740
The step by step process is revealed.

809
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:06,620
This is it.

810
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:12,140
The only faith that promises action, thrills, success in sex and business.

811
00:58:12,500 --> 00:58:18,600
Get all your slack and more every Saturday night at midnight right here on WREK atlantan.

812
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,300
Reverend Ivan Stang presents the Hour of Slack.

813
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:22,780
Slack.

814
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:30,180
But this Hour of Slack was really a lymph node institute from WREK.

815
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:33,540
Originally broadcast in March of 2003.

816
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:34,540
More.

817
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:39,480
