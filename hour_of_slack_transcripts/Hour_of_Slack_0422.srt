10
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:55,360
friend bob calls me up and says don get a 900 line you won't believe how much money you can make

11
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,660
so i call bob up and i say bob i'm too busy placing ads don't bug me

12
00:01:59,660 --> 00:01:59,980

13
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,160
well he kept calling and calling and finally just to be a nice guy i told him okay also i thought it

14
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,420
was a mistake but it wasn't i was making so much money i thought i died and i went to heaven

15
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:16,300
well bob has joined us today he is the specialist that got don involved in the 900 number business

16
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:22,380
bob last year we talked and you were right so i did two things i paid for an 800 number

17
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:29,580
to go directly to bob's office anybody who orders the making money package can call bob for free 900

18
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:29,980
concession money and he'll pay for it for sure so i'm going to tell you what i'm doing right now

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,520
Will there ever be a second coming, Bob?

20
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:03,880
Is that a prophecy?

21
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:04,660
A second, a third.

22
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,080
Well, it would be the third now.

23
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,980
Actually, we're up to it being about the fifth or sixth.

24
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,560
He does come multiple.

25
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,740
His current life, he's been kicking since 85 now, right?

26
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,200
Bob can maintain a multiple orgasm state for quite a long time, can't he?

27
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,560
Without the use of a ring.

28
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:20,980
That's why he looks like he does.

29
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,000
Why do you think he has a particular grin on his face?

30
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:24,640
I know, I'd have.

31
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,540
He's in a constant orgasmic state.

32
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,200
Is that what you're saying?

33
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:27,620
Right.

34
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:28,420
Right.

35
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,620
But he only leaks every now and then.

36
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,220
Well, then he'd have to be depleted from his mankind accordion,

37
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,140
from the jismal area expanding so much.

38
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,860
Well, I mean, so to speak.

39
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:37,760
Wouldn't he?

40
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,400
I mean, he'd be, like, depleted.

41
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,840
That doesn't matter because he's rich.

42
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:45,780
You know, they said they found a piece of Jesus' skin

43
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:49,120
on part of a piece of wood that was supposed to be from the cross,

44
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,040
and they're going to try to, like, do a genetic, you know, DNA clone of him.

45
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,040
Clone the cross and Jesus.

46
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,060
Grecian.

47
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:56,480
Yeah.

48
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:57,200
Yeah.

49
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,080
That'd be cool.

50
00:03:59,240 --> 00:03:59,860
The tree.

51
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,620
Yeah, the tree that the cross came from.

52
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:02,420
Grow it.

53
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:06,980
And then kill Jesus again with the same tree.

54
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:12,640
You know, that would be so hard to pick up a tree and, like, kill Jesus with him.

55
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:13,980
They wouldn't do it with a tree.

56
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:18,840
They'd make him hole up inside of some stupid compound in Texas.

57
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:22,820
Then they'd go in with flamethrowers disguised as tanks.

58
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:26,240
They'd do it on a tree, but they'd have Georgia Pacific emblems on it,

59
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,240
and they'd have, you know, warehouses.

60
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,380
They'd have a blower on it or, you know, all these other sponsors.

61
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:31,440
So is Jesus...

62
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,200
Corporate sponsors on Jesus' 21st century...

63
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,760
Is Jesus really, like, flying around the whole universe,

64
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,160
like, visiting all the planets that are inhabited and getting crucified on each one?

65
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,300
He's flying around wreaking revenge on those planets that crucified him

66
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:47,640
now that he's got an entire army of exes monsters at his back.

67
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,780
I'm a Christian soldier.

68
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:49,940
Wait, is that...

69
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:51,460
I'd like to ask you a question.

70
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:53,900
Is that in, like, an auto-de-faith thing or something?

71
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,540
Is that the fighting Jesus that you're talking about, or what is that?

72
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,220
There's only one thing.

73
00:04:58,220 --> 00:04:59,800
Fighting Jesus, my friend.

74
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,580
Oh, I'm sorry.

75
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:04,400
The terror telephone book he'd have with his bare hands kind of Jesus.

76
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,560
6-8-7-3-5-1-5.

77
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:11,180
They believe in the namby-pamby little old lady Jesus, you know,

78
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:14,300
with the shaved knees and the little doilies on his fingers.

79
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:17,220
That was the fighting Jesus that tried to shoot you last time around, wasn't it?

80
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,880
No, he was after Bob.

81
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:22,220
That was you that was trying to shoot.

82
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,580
You don't need to get down.

83
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,060
Which kind of Jesus are you, my friend?

84
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:27,960
I'm more of Judas Iscariot.

85
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:28,680
I'm a black Jesus.

86
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,240
Everybody should think they're Jesus, but they shouldn't think they're the only one.

87
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,740
Then they're kooks.

88
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:36,220
They're nuts, you know, crazy, like Jim Jones.

89
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,000
I heard he came from the Orient anyway.

90
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,780
Jesus El Pifko?

91
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:40,760
The yellow Jesus.

92
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,540
Jesus El Pifko.

93
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,240
I thought he came from the Sarge.

94
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:44,940
Is he...

95
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,680
No, wait.

96
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,580
Jesus El Pifko is the Italian one.

97
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,140
No, that's El Pifko.

98
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,100
You know, you guys, if the Baptists are right, we're in real, real deep trouble.

99
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,260
I'm going to hell!

100
00:05:56,280 --> 00:05:58,120
We've all been immersed in the water.

101
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,700
We've all been taken to the river.

102
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,200
We're going to hell!

103
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,000
I ain't afraid of anything.

104
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,220
I ain't afraid of hell.

105
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,540
I've been there 40 years.

106
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:06,560
I'm used to it.

107
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,720
I want more slack.

108
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,960
Slack is not for everyone.

109
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:18,440
You cannot take my slack away.

110
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,040
Slack can be taken by prescription.

111
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:28,880
You can take my slack.

112
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:31,580
And you'll break your hand.

113
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,480
You can lay your hand gently upon it and it will sink right in.

114
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,620
Never ever let it go.

115
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:41,060
That's the first thing I've ever heard of a little slasher.

116
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,920
Instead of the fact that it's a piece of shit.

117
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,380
You'd better watch out for Jim and me now.

118
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:48,640
We're eating our shots.

119
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,260
What?

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,420
Now let it be true.

121
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:54,560
We're all going to die.

122
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:55,680
We're all going to die.

123
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:56,640
We're all going to die.

124
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:56,780


125
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:57,300
We're all going to die.

126
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,600
We're all going to die.

127
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,360
We're self-heads.

128
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,960
We turn ourselves on.

129
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,540
I like it.

130
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,000
I never read.

131
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,440
I can't think.

132
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,560
Whenever I try it's a mess.

133
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,480
Sometimes I think I have reasons, but who can follow reasons?

134
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:24,480
I exist.

135
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,500
That's hard enough.

136
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,320
I'm a person who's been through a lot.

137
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:36,420
You say the tax man just took away your barrel and your bleep is freezing in a high wind.

138
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:42,460
Your car just made a sound like a dying moose and came to a halt on the off-ramp after spitting out a bucket of gear teeth.

139
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:49,380
Just finished knocking back your third bottle of Nyquil during the Ren and Stimpy Festival and you feel like taking a whiz on the electric fence.

140
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,000
The aliens removed your brain from their pathology studies and you don't even care?

141
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,440
Well, my friend.

142
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,520

166
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:50,260


167
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:58,500
Well, we're using a lot of snippets from tapes put together by Puzzling Evidence out there on KPFA in Berkeley.

168
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:04,880
That's where it was first aired and now is chopped to pieces and interspersed throughout Hour of Slack.

169
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:18,500
Little movie clips and quotes and things that somehow describe just who we are as sub-geni as seen here.

170
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,160
A key to eternal happiness and peace.

171
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,080
Evil, disease, famine, human despair.

172
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:28,520
Yeah, but what do you do with the stupid stuff?

173
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:33,980
Their magic, their power, their potential to benefit mankind is enormous.

174
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:40,440
Delise, plague, famine, all the evils of the world can be relegated to the pages of history.

175
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:42,420
They are our greatest resource.

176
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,500
They can determine the future of the universe.

177
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,820
On the set is...

178
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:48,480
In Cashmere.

179
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,020
A short conversation.

180
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,740
They appear as ordinary, likable, adult fellows.

181
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:57,940
But emotionally, they remain as dangerous children.

182
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,840
And the legal profession has never really known how to treat them.

183
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:04,240
I suppose you could call them social misfits.

184
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,560
And being governed by the pleasure principle,

185
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,360
they're particularly dangerous when their desires are being frustrated.

186
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:13,480
Arsy, farsy!

187
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:14,200
Pah!

188
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,820
Now, I won't say that I...

189
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:25,340
understand everything, but it was certainly different and, oh, yes, well, well worth a dollar.

190
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:45,640
He's Bob. Bob don't ever change. He's Bob. Always will be Bob. His face is the one big assembly

191
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:56,000
of dots that shine in the dark. His grin is the one that looks friendly, but so does the grin of

192
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:08,760
a shark. He's Bob. Bob don't ever change. He's Bob. Always will be Bob.

193
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,880
He ain't no human being. He's from Mars.

194
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,620
Last time I was on that...

195
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:20,360
Them flying saucers, them little men, they told me all about him. They said they had a lot of

196
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,120
fellas like that planning on this earth to observe and take notes. Why, as I tried to tell you a

197
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:32,920
couple of months ago, these here observers, just like people, little green in the face,

198
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:40,780
but it ain't too noticeable. Why, you take my wife, Sadie. She has sort of a green tinge.

199
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,980
Wildcat, let's stick to the subject. If I get my hands on you, so help me, I'll break every bone

200
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,520
in your body.

201
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,120
I'm talking to the ionization belt.

202
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,800
Things I prefer not to mention in mixed company.

203
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,000
He's highly radioactive.

204
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:54,820
Yeah?

205
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,980
Consequently, no one is allowed near him.

206
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,420
Does anyone feel like doing a full job?

207
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:09,900
His hair is the one with the highlight that shines on the pompadour, that glimmers and gleams in the twilight.

208
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:14,880
It's clear he knows what it's for. He's Bob.

209
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:25,580
Bob, don't never change. He's Bob. Always will be Bob.

210
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,540
It's no such thing, perhaps to you, but we've known it for centuries.

211
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,800
This control, do you read?

212
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,580
Your scientists will stumble upon it as they have all the others.

213
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:41,800
But the juvenile minds which you possess will not comprehend its strength until it's too late.

214
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,200
The static in that station.

215
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,380
There seems to be some kind of interference tonight.

216
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:45,940
There's a radio.

217
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,980
There could be radioactivity coming in the plan over there.

218
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,960
Oh, we stayed up and listened to your show. It's weird.

219
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,800
Yeah, I don't want to admit that most people listen to it and they always say,

220
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,920
well then, why do you do it?

221
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,100
Kill them before they kill you.

222
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,480
This is puzzling evidence to show.

223
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,220
I don't know what my nose is doing to me.

224
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:09,580
They set up six appeal tests to measure his contact-lismic effect on the female metabolism.

225
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,420
I hate you.

226
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,620
I don't think I'm going to keep my mouth shut.

227
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:23,920
I'm going to tell everyone that you're the one who's crazy, demented, cruel, evil.

228
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,580
Your conscience is an illusion.

229
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,800
There is merely an...

230
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,020
Instinctive...

231
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,640
Behavior...

232
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:32,740
Code.

233
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:36,680
To repress it is to suffocate.

234
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:39,640
But never forget for a second...

235
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:45,000
That it is the monster god who allows this.

236
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,460
Who defends it!

237
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:55,580
For science does not remove the tower of the gods!

238
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:59,720
His pipe is the one with the dowel

239
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,060
That rains on the roof like fire

240
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,760
His neck is the one with the wattle

241
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:09,820
Inflaming folks' desire

242
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:11,940
He's Bob

243
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:15,840
Bob don't ever change

244
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,920
He's Bob

245
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:22,060
Always will be Bob

246
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:42,840
Bob...

247
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,140
Well!

248
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,280
Bobby, take your jockstrap off.

249
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,760
Bobby, take your jockstrap off.

250
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:51,340
Come on, take your jockstrap off.

251
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,740
Everybody. Take you jockstrap off.

252
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,240
Take your jockstrap off.

253
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:54,240


254
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,960
Bob, rob, and hula talk.

255
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,080
Bob, rob, and hula talk.

256
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,220
Bob, rob, and hula talk.

257
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:59,360
Bob, rob, and hula talk.

258
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:03,540
Hello!

259
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:05,180
Hello!

260
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,440
Hello!

261
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,180
Hello!

262
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:09,500
Hello!

263
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:13,340
Hello.

264
00:17:13,340 --> 00:17:13,780
Hello.

265
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:19,820
Well, if you plug that thing in there and plug that other thing in there...

266
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:22,500
The music goes round and round and it comes out here.

267
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,880
Please! You don't want to know what you end up with.

268
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:28,940
Well, you might end up with a bottoms-up-below-the-belt review.

269
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,980
Something resembling the show, I suppose.

270
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:39,160
Something resembling an eel, but it might also be a stonefish, that primitive, poisonous creature known to...

271
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:39,980
You can't eat that thing.

272
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:47,260
Yes, natives refer to it as a one-, two-, or three-foot stonefish, which puzzled archaeologists for many years.

273
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,140
Stung by a sea urchin, eh?

274
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,520
You can't eat a stonefish and you can't eat the shell.

275
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,520
They say you're supposed to piddle on the sea urchin's sting, but what if you get stung on the piddler?

276
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:01,200
In the dreaded island of Guam, before diamond stores were extinct,

277
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,780
Diamond stores, yes.

278
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,820
stonefish were known to kill people within one or two feet of the sting.

279
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,460
The porcupine fish could shoot its quills.

280
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,000
Two and one.

281
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:10,800
A good 70 feet.

282
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,900
Wow!

283
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,600
These strange animals were known...

284
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:18,320
And some flying fish circled around for days before coming down.

285
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:20,120
...victims instantly with their lethal sting.

286
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,780
So strong was their toxin, they were turned into stone.

287
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,300
Now put that finger away.

288
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:28,500
Like the famous, fabled flying snakes of Africa.

289
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:37,800
And remember, of course, the people that were turned to stone, the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, were actually stung by stonefish.

290
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,460
I was scared.

291
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,920
Back in those days were flies, donkeys.

292
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:48,300
As in the case of People vs. Imago, Statues vs. People, that's docket case number 407.

293
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,680
Donkey case number 407.

294
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:57,160
Yes, you have to store them somewhere, and these are unique and efficient storage modules for a donkey.

295
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:04,340
They were found innocent under Judge Pontius Pilate, that's of course the pilot who drove them.

296
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:07,300
Yeah, but then the series didn't turn out so well.

297
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,440
The pilot was the best.

298
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,180
He was the best thing about him.

299
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,160
Well, that was back in the old flying fish tales.

300
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,740
Everybody in that show was either a pilot or a flying fish.

301
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:21,400
Oh, nautical Ned as he danced to a hornpipe with his crusted knuckles on the decks of the Nelly.

302
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,100
Yeah, they all got paid union scale back in the old fish college.

303
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,420
We listened and looked sideways up.

304
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:37,320
You will ask me what I'm talking about, and I will answer you.

305
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:38,060
I'm sure you will.

306
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,180
I'm talking about...

307
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,920
They are back in their own time.

308
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:42,960
Sometimes.

309
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:47,500
His work absolutely destroys him.

310
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:54,000
It's like there's a whole part of him that I can never reach, I can never get to.

311
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:56,800
He's a very special American security agent.

312
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,460
Dedicated and ruthless.

313
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,940
This is my home.

314
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,840
No wife would ever understand.

315
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,380
Well, neither can I. You've got all the money in the world.

316
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:07,900
What's money got to do with it?

317
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:11,780
You're making money where all there was to business is hard to be worth while going to the office.

318
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,820
Money is a byproduct.

319
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,960
Well, what's the main objective? Power?

320
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,060
Ah, that's become a dirty word.

321
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:17,880
Look at this stuff.

322
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,420
You'll fly in a plane made of it, you'll wear a suit made of it, and before we're through with it, you'll probably be able to eat it.

323
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:28,920
His kind of love you cannot buy.

324
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:35,320
Knowing him, I wouldn't try.

325
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:39,560
I'm a man, but he's my guy.

326
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,340
Well, they suck the energy from everything around him.

327
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,360
The walls, the wires, the buildings.

328
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,620
And the people.

329
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:52,720
Yes.

330
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,140
That's what I've been up against from the start.

331
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,220
That's what nobody can see.

332
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,240
I'm telling the truth and nobody believes me.

333
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,240
The trouble is, I know it doesn't sound true.

334
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,300
What good is the truth when it doesn't sound true?

335
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,960
The Pope's out to get us.

336
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,680
The U.S. government is out to get us.

337
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:17,400
The governments where we have our ministries are out to get us.

338
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:19,900
Communists are out to get us.

339
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:22,540
Nazis are out to get us.

340
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:24,920
Racists are out to get us.

341
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:30,460
The anarchists, atheists are all out to get us.

342
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:34,340
And we must combat these evils.

343
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:39,640
Before too many Christians die.

344
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:44,100
We must come together, brothers and sisters.

345
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,120
Send money.

346
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,020
Become one powerful force.

347
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:52,120
United together, we can fight these people.

348
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,060
They're all around us, I know.

349
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,800
But we can do it.

350
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,820
But we must unite.

351
00:21:58,000 --> 00:21:58,920
Send money.

352
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:03,620
And become part of the CNF family.

353
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,360
So we can combat the devil.

354
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:12,200
Everybody must die who does not believe.

355
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,560
Kill all who do not believe.

356
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,820
Kill all who are not in the faith.

357
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,500
Who fight the worst of all.

358
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:19,960
Satanists and the devil.

359
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:22,420
Satanists and the worst that all can believe in.

360
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:25,500
God. God will justify all your sins.

361
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,720
You must believe in God.

362
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,240
And then to believe in God, you must join the church.

363
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:30,360
And become faithful.

364
00:22:30,560 --> 00:22:31,400
And love him.

365
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,420
And to do that, you must prove it.

366
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:37,040
And you must send money to CNF.

367
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:42,620
And in that, you will prove your trust and worship in God Almighty.

368
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,020
Follow the path of least resistance.

369
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:53,320
And you will go about from under the sacrifices he demands.

370
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:56,200
Of all the big boys around you.

371
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:59,060
The follies and foibles will show you worse than lies.

372
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,180
And you will be able to relax.

373
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:03,720
And not get a heart attack.

374
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:11,980
Jehovah one kills those who dredge their lives away without knowing who he is.

375
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:19,420
But he rewards the ones who recognize his stark fist.

376
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:25,400
And carry out his seemingly immoral plan.

377
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:30,180
While slacking off every chance they get.

378
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,980
Jehovah's special message for the subgenius.

379
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:39,960
Is that this gross physical plane does not exist.

380
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:40,600
Uh-uh.

381
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:00,200
Subtitles by the Amara.org community

00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:05,580

383
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:08,340
Yeah, I don't know, I don't know, we could just round them up.

384
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,580
Glass of old punk time.

385
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:13,800
Let's see the dance.

386
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:14,720
Let's see the dance.

387
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:15,700
Dance.

388
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,080
Dance.

389
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:18,160
Dance.

390
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,340
Dance.

391
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:19,960
Dance.

392

Dance.

393
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,460
Dance.

394
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:24,400
Okay, okay, folks, fun's over.

395
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:25,740
Back in the bus.

396
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,040
Where?

397
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:29,060
Public enemy number one.

398
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,120
Public enemy number one.

399
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,280
Groovy.

400
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:39,960
Groovy.

401
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:44,440

Groovy.

409

410
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:54,720


411
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:54,840

412
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:55,040
Groovy.

413
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,100
Groovy.

414
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,480
Oh, she's groovy.

415
00:24:57,220 --> 00:24:58,040
Hey, Larry.

416
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,200
Take that chick.

417
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,400
Oh, she's groovy.

418
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,300
Dig that chick.

419
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:05,720
Dig that chick.

420
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,200
Dig that chick.

421
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,020
She's groovy.

422
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,000
Yeah, she's groovy.

423
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:17,340
Right.

424
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,420
Right.

425
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,600
Groovy.

426
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:22,820
Right.

427
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,120
She's groovy.

428
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,140
Groovy.

429
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:30,300
Groovy.

430
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:33,720
Groovy.

431
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,460
Yes, yes, dear friends, you are listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack,

432
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,860
the voice of the church of the subgenius.

433
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:48,960
Actually, one of many, but often the final voice, one might say.

434
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:56,600
There are many other tape makers out there and subgenius radio shows,

435
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:01,040
and that's what this particular evening's hour is composed of.

436
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:08,120
The tapes that I've been playing here, let's say, I'll go back to since the last time I did credits.

437
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:18,560
That little Firesign Theater media barrage song that you just heard,

438
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:22,360
it was this music with little cuts of ancient Firesign Theater,

439
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:26,260
that was put together by, let's see,

440
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,100
old, this is the name on the cassette,

441
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:34,480
old T. Schickel Gouver and the Happy Philanthropist Orchestra

442
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:39,440
with their album Dr. Terror's House of Ill Repute

443
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,580
or How I Became One with Myself,

444
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,000
a product of neglect.

445
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,260
There's been little bits of that here and there, sandwiched in between,

446
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:55,660
and we also have, let's see,

447
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:56,580
Dr. Houser,

448
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:02,620
Houser himself was singing his chain gang song, He's Bob.

449
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:09,680
By the way, that Dr. Howell is the same Dr. Howell who draws the He's Bob strip

450
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:12,180
in Bob's Favorite Comics number one.

451
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,720
Several people have asked me if that's Dr. Howell,

452
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:18,580
and yes, Howell Robbins is he who draws,

453
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:22,720
and he who also is on the KPFA subgenius show,

454
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:25,480
which we've been playing, an old show,

455
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,460
where he and Papa,

456
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,040
Joe Mama,

457
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,400
were fiddling around there with the callers,

458
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:30,360
the evil callers,

459
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,300
and puzzling evidence of sound effects

460
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,520
and media edits,

461
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:36,560
which were also peppered throughout

462
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:40,920
and re-chopped by myself in some cases.

463
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:46,380
The two gals that you heard reading from pamphlet number one

464
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,640
in a gigantic warehouse with laser shows going on around them

465
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:56,080
were Sister Mary Squared and Princess We Are Doe.

466

These Fingerlings,

469
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:04,320
don't you think,

470
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:04,640


471
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,880
That's what's in it.

472
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,960
So Turner takes several säger,

473
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,600

474
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:24,160

00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,980
Bob is your only hope

506
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,900
You're a lot closer than you even think

507
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,500
Bob is your only chance

508
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,720
But you're dumb, so you do

509
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,720
Believe or die

510
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:10,880
Bob is not the answer and neither is anything else

511
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:14,940
Bob is the path, Bob is the way

512
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:18,780
Bob

513
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:20,920
Screw Bob

514
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:23,420
What the f*** is he know about?

515
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:25,660
Bob is a loser

516
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:28,320
Bob rips the offer off my money

517
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,160
Bob's a peak boy

518
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,580
Bob is a peak boy

519
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,500
Don't believe anything Bob tells you

520
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,380
Bob is a loser

521
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,960
Bob just takes it all for himself

522
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,720
He gets all the work, he gets all the money

523
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,520
We can get him out of Palmer

524
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:47,260
They got nothing to do, you take together

525
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:49,760
Bob has ripped you off for everything

526
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,800
The only thing you ever had

527

Shhh

546
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,320
Hey!

547
00:32:58,860 --> 00:32:59,520
Lord!

548
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:01,640
Lord!

549
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,580
If it pleases your holiness

550
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:06,100
Holinesses?

551
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:08,340
Can you speak oh Lord please

552
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,680
Can you speak or may you speak for you see well fulsome Betty that I ought master of that religion

553
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:18,540
Which grants its peon free will

554
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:24,680
will. Of course you may speak, though thy tongue stinks of Polish boys and falafel.

555
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:32,780
Paul, did you wish to speak as well? With me?

556
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:40,380
Oh, my good friend, my lord, for then may your faithful disciple Paul also speaketh,

557
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:43,740
for I believe it's Peter and I are of one mindest.

558
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:52,220
Hmm. Your mighty holiness, messianicist, I are, we are tired of walking up and down

559
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:57,400
the streets of this city with its vile filth and evil vices, oh, lard.

560
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:06,320
Yes, lard. Look, a 200-pound bearded lady with a bow-peep costume, turning tricks in

561
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:11,140
front of the true light Baptist gospel mission. It's too much to beareth, lord.

562
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,720
Truly, master. Fleecing and flying.

563
00:34:13,740 --> 00:34:17,300
Walking are our domain. See how she leads them sheep astray?

564
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:23,440
Silence. For though thou art of one mind, it still adds up to one half-wit in my holy book.

565
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:28,500
I granted thou permission to speak, but take care not to piss me off, or I shall relinquish

566
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,760
thy complaining by fusing thy vocal cords.

567
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,080
No problem, lord.

568
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:34,220
No problem, lord. No, you got it.

569
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:34,960
You got it. King of kings, baby.

570
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,220
King of kings, no doubt.

571
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:41,700
Good, for hath I not told thou once before, thou idiots, that we are in this foul Babylon

572
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700
for one purpose?

573
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:49,400
To destroy the Satan-spawn mole-people before they destroy mankind. And in this city there

574
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:55,180
dwells one who breeds these mole-people with his semi-false preachings, a semi-false prophet,

575
00:34:55,420 --> 00:34:59,800
the evil Reverend Ivan Stang and his hell-begotten church of the subgenius.

576
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,440
Lard.

577
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,660
And that is his church.

578
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:08,620
But, lord, if we enter there, shall not their minion stone us?

579
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,820
I hope they have the good stuff, lord.

580
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:11,480
And...

581
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:12,440
Ow!

582
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:12,840
Ow!

583
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:13,960
Fools!

584
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:18,040
We shall go unseen into their midst, disguised as derelicts.

585
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:34,260
Oh, yes! Oh, yes, dear friends! And just what the hell do you think you're doing?

586
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:42,000
Paying anchovy olive lip service to the musicless dance of prune-faced inquisitors and their

587
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:42,680
muscle-bombs.

588
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:46,360
Because I haven't a soul.

589
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:53,980
I won't relaxing as Anela, Sa referral for Tschar Bob Dobbs, dear album, has said.

590
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,620
Abastras, Traveller of Sorrows, the music that I produce were duluモ and cuidam France

591
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:54,620


592
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:54,880
Fruits were bringing thru my arse at Umbaz age, by their

593
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,920
a sinister Schuldahlhe

594
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:57,020
..

595
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,500
I shoes.

596
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,880
The bitter truth of all...

597
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,040
..

598
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:09,040
The truth of that man, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

599
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:09,520
That...

600
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,940
You can't imagine how much that man hates you.

601
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,700
All mental case.

602
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,100
Oh, he hates you.

603
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:17,240
He hates you so.

604
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:18,340
But, uh...

605
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,340
All men's room.

606
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:23,580
But now, Sister Monstrous Dogma...

607
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:27,480
Dharma will pass the pate and collection dish.

608
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:31,100
And don't forget, those Political Action Committee vouchers,

609
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:35,180
your PAC, PAC pledges, are as good as gold.

610
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,200
While the sister reams your wallets,

611
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,320
Brother Brain Sausage and Sister Karaoke Farm Problems

612
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:47,180
and, uh, lovely Sister Karaoke Farm Problems

613
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,760
and, uh, Brother Forgetful Swineberries

614
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:55,400
will lead the flockers into the basement for tea cakes and Pepsi

615
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,960
and open forum questions.

616
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,480
Come on.

617
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,500
Peter, Paul, this is our chance.

618
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,880
During this discussion period, we wrap theology like big dogs

619
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,600
and expose the satanic mole pizza front.

620
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:13,080
Brilliant, Blard.

621
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,180
Yes, brilliant.

622
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:19,760
Fools, am I not the son of the father of all such smartness?

623
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:20,980
Shh, quiet.

624
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,020
The question and answer's about to start.

625
00:37:23,020 --> 00:37:23,620
Okay, let's see.

626
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,180
Who are there?

627
00:37:24,240 --> 00:37:26,800
Yes, you, the woman with the welder's mask.

628
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:30,440
Um, my name's Lolly Lovegarden, uh...

629
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,080
Pippin.

630
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,560
Pickelopium.

631
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:35,360
My maiden name, uh, Lolly Pickelopium.

632
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:39,680
Anyway, I'm a membrane of Welder's Local 231

633
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,520
here in Cleaver Ridge.

634
00:37:43,260 --> 00:37:44,700
And my first question, uh, is,

635
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:47,480
was Bob Dobbs born of virgin birth?

636
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,580
Was he immaculately conceived,

637
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,320
or was he born like the rest of us?

638
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,140
And the second question is,

639
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:59,620
who is Neagie and why is Neagie?

640
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,660
Are you aware now?

641
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:02,200
Well, uh, thank you for that, Miss Lolly.

642
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,820
Uh, uh, in regard, I, I don't know if I, we, we...

643
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,460
You should never mention the name of Neagie.

644
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:11,760
Uh, but, uh, in regards to, uh, Bob's birth,

645
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:14,820
in this dimension, or in any other, for that matter,

646
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,960
uh, let me say that, uh, now, as you know,

647
00:38:18,200 --> 00:38:21,240
uh, Bob is, uh, born of woman.

648
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,360
That is Jane Dobbs, Jane McBride Dobbs,

649
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:25,460
uh, somewhere in the Midwest.

650
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,660
And, uh, no, immaculate conception.

651
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,900
I mean, this is subgenius church we're talking about.

652
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:30,380
That woman.

653
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,240
She wears the welder's mask to shield her eyes from sunlight.

654
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,700
And hide her gruesome countenance.

655
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,860
She is a mole, people.

656
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,080
That's, uh, and, uh, does that answer your question?

657
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:42,400
Uh, yes, you in the back.

658
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:44,180
The boy with the exposed skull

659
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:47,240
and the flattened, uh, worm-like protrusion.

660
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,080
Oh, me?

661
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,700
I thought it was tucked in.

662
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,860
What do you mean, one day closer to X-Day?

663
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:59,480
What is X-Day, and who are the X-ists?

664
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:04,300
I cannot believe that a subgenius has asked me the question of who is X-Day and who is X-Day.

665
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:10,100
As Bob has preached his entire life since before his demaculated birth,

666
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,200
he is, in fact, he who will bring on July 5th, 1998,

667
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,360
uh, 7 a.m. in the morning,

668
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,880
the, those, uh, the ascension of the angelic host.

669
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,220
Yes, the so-called men from Planet X.

670
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:23,740
Uh, they're obviously, they're not men.

671
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:24,560
They're gods.

672
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:28,080
And, uh, they will come and destroy all the normal people

673
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:33,160
and take we, the subgeniuses, up into the escape vessels of the sex goddesses,

674
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:38,620
where, well, uh, we, we'll be showing you the slides, uh, the slideshow on that this evening.

675
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,020
And so I hope that answers it for you.

676
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:41,800
Uh, you, the derelict in the middle.

677
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:45,040
Uh, bum, uh, bearded fellow down there.

678
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,140
I?

679
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,740
Uh, is it not writ that,

680
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,540
there wherefore goeth the Father, there goest I?

681
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,840
Yet you have said to thine flockers that our Lord is even less than a mighty hot dog,

682
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,380
that he is merely a space bully.

683
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:06,640
Well, now, uh, Jehovah One, the alien space god from...

684
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:07,080
Mine!

685
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:08,900
He is truly one of the more people.

686
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,100
To hell with him!

687
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:11,180
Jehovah One is a...

688
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:11,540
Hey, what?

689
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:12,520
What?

690
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:12,980
Wait!

691
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,820
What's that blinding light?

692
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,140
I, I can't see!

693
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,620
I, what, what is...

694
00:40:19,620 --> 00:40:23,160
It is I, the light of the world, and your Messiah.

695
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:25,420
Bend down before me.

696
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:26,660
Up!

697
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:26,820
Up!

698
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:32,560
Bend this, you posturing, spoiled sons of the Archons!

699
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:39,400
And for, I am a personal business acquaintance of the unknowable and extremely hard to deal

700
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:45,960
with, J.R. Bob Dobbs, living slack master upon this, this blinded globe!

701
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:47,580
You, you faker!

702
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,620
Here, take this!

703
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,240
Take this yourself!

704
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,300
I'll show you!

705
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,380
I'll...

706
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:54,740
I'll...

707
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:55,520
I'll...

708
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:55,980
I'll...

709
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,120
I'll...

710
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:56,160
I'll show you!

711
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,180
What are the rays?

712
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,380
Send him out of my brain!

713
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:26,100
Well, it seems old J.C. and Bob Dobbs, and their little brother, have been on the run

714
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:42,540
for over a year, 18 дDs are now voz-only, a

715
00:41:42,540 --> 00:41:45,560
Wolfie-iful roll-man badge.

716
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:46,000
They're just gonna stop working.

717
00:41:46,780 --> 00:41:48,400
Oh, my

718
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:48,600
life.

719
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:48,740


720
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:51,940
where the media was God itself, the real God.

721
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:55,740
It wasn't long before...

722
00:42:01,660 --> 00:42:05,880
Hello, everyone, and welcome to Cult in the Act,

723
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:08,580
America's favorite religious game show,

724
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:11,980
where each week our panelists try to answer the unanswerable.

725
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:15,560
This week's panel, from Sutton Baldspot, Illinois,

726
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,580
Mr. Pumper Smoke Safety.

727
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,780
Who gave you that name?

728
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,140
Never mind. We know all we need to know about you.

729
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:27,220
And our next contestant is a snooty waitress,

730
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:29,580
from Alternate Erection, New Jersey,

731
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:32,800
Mistress Lolly Smoothbottom.

732
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:36,220
Oh, thank you, Ruffin. I'm happy to be somewhere.

733
00:42:36,700 --> 00:42:39,440
And from Military Base Closure, Nevada,

734
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,140
Sergeant Left and Right Wing Penny Hoser.

735
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:43,560
Am I driving?

736
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,400
Oh, that's reverent to you.

737
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:47,380
Fat back, I've got an image to protect.

738
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,140
Right you are, Everett.

739
00:42:50,320 --> 00:42:53,220
An image based on fear and respect.

740
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:57,800
So let's not pander to the drooling observations of a pack of morons.

741
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,900
Let's play Cult in the Act.

742
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,240
That's right, gay, it's time to play.

743
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:07,780
So let's go right to Sergeant Peckerhose

744
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:09,660
for a fast double bonus round

745
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:12,200
on questions of teleological and theological importance.

746
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,460
First question concerns the gamut of sex hurt

747
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:17,080
and philosophical syllogisms.

748
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,840
Sarge, for eight million donuts in the naked city

749
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,160
eating lots of naked brunch,

750
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:25,400
what gives you the freaky rights to come in here

751
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,380
and pretend you know what the hell I'm talking about?

752
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,300
What? Is that the question?

753
00:43:29,620 --> 00:43:31,100
Wrong! Wrong!

754
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,480
Utterly and fatally, I might add, wrong.

755
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:40,000
Take him away and rip out his heart as a sacrifice to needy.

756
00:43:40,120 --> 00:43:40,500
Ah!

757
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,060
Now, contesticle number two.

758
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:48,160
If that is your real number, uh, what does it mean, uh,

759
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:53,140
the Yeti, although considered a mytho-beastie,

760
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:55,600
is quite at home in which national park?

761
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:58,240
Also home to some of the finest froplands in America?

762
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:02,420
Ah, ah, uh, your thumsy Samson,

763
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:05,860
a plotter and head plopper for the excess?

764
00:44:06,180 --> 00:44:06,420
Give up!

765
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:07,460
Bad hat?

766
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:08,720
So do I.

767
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:12,780
Take her to parallel hell or the pus fountain in the land of Dairy Queer.

768
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:14,040
I have no further questions.

769
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:14,040


770
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,120
I'm not going to give you further use for this politically incorrect goose-stepping.

771
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:16,320
Ah!

772
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,300
Now, um, bilge dropper number one.

773
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:24,260
Before I condemn you to a beautiful three-bedroom

774
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,560
and sunken sun porch purgatory of your own,

775
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:30,760
on X-Day, uh, them stinky, stinky pinks will be breasted,

776
00:44:30,760 --> 00:44:32,580
broasted in their own, uh, juices,

777
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:34,680
all the more fitting because of their collusion,

778
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:41,240
and then sub-gumped into what now famous Paul Proudhon's culinary tweet?

779
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,960
Oh, well, uh, blackened and red-iron-coat fish.

780
00:44:45,220 --> 00:44:45,740
Amazing!

781
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,080
Wow!

782
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:50,580
Right you are, Mr. Smoke Safety!

783
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,880
But still, you must die.

784
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:55,280
I see no reason to continue this.

785
00:44:55,360 --> 00:44:56,960
Hang him by his f-ing bowels.

786
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,700
Uh, no, wait, wait.

787
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:02,360
Give him one of the Anglo-Saxon raiders used on the Britons,

788
00:45:02,360 --> 00:45:05,660
uh, the Blood Eagle, where the contestable has his lungs ripped,

789
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,300
still breathing from his chest,

790
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,560
then crushed by a stone.

791
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:10,640
No!

792
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:12,100
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

793
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,620
That's too arcane.

794
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,880
Uh, let's, let's just shoot the booger and put him,

795
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,140
make him cry for mercy.

796
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:17,720
I want him!

797
00:45:17,820 --> 00:45:18,580
I want him!

798
00:45:18,580 --> 00:45:18,920
I mean it!

799
00:45:19,660 --> 00:45:22,160
Okay, give him, take him, give him to the audience.

800
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,200
I'll do it!

801
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:24,380
He's yours!

802
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,320
Kill him!

803
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:29,340
Live for them.

804
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:38,900
But it was worse than that.

805
00:45:38,900 --> 00:45:44,160
It seems J.C., Peter, and Paul were fired from the cast

806
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,600
of the most recent Jesus Meets the Mole People production.

807
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:51,020
The Actors Union, enraged by their taking on as powerful a lobby

808
00:45:51,020 --> 00:45:53,840
as the Church of the Subgenius, picketed Jesus Meets the Mole People

809
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:54,540
till it closed.

810
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:59,780
And J.C., Pete, and Paulie were put on a government-sponsored

811
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:01,820
work project for out-of-work actors.

812
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,120
Oh, that I have passed this life and not saved one mortal

813
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:23,360
from the blind and saggy mole people.

814
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:28,500
Hey, maybe we could turn this into a waiting for good luck

815
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,760
shticket for these living theater people I know at La Mama's

816
00:46:32,760 --> 00:46:33,520
in New York.

817
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:38,360
Nah, I see this as us doing our bit for the workers.

818
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,280
Our own Hooverville Collective, right here in the ocean.

819
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:46,160
But if I am who they speak of whom they speak,

820
00:46:46,260 --> 00:46:49,140
is not my job truly that to part the waters?

821
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:51,880
Eh, sure, man, anything you say.

822
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:56,780
He'll make good sense again when the food boat comes by.

823
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,680
He's getting kind of skinny.

824
00:46:59,480 --> 00:47:03,620
Woe unto those who doubt, for did not Moses part the Red Sea?

825
00:47:03,960 --> 00:47:06,160
Yeah, poor guy.

826
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,360
Well, I'm getting back to work.

827
00:47:08,900 --> 00:47:13,180
Another year closer to X-Day, a modern radio drama act two,

828
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:13,840
scene three.

829
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:15,240
Yeah, me too.

830
00:47:15,380 --> 00:47:19,200
Another year closer to X-Day, a surrealist radio play for three

831
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:23,500
characters, one endless boring gray set, water from horizon to

832
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:28,620
horizon, endless, infiniteth, and I will adlibeth infinitum

833
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:34,000
until ad nauseum infinitumeth, my infinitum ad nauseumeth.

834
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:36,160
You'll be back on your feet, Laura.

835
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,460
Don't worry about it.

836
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:38,880
I'll be back.

837
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:40,500
Still, good luck to fra microorganisms.

838
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,120
Still good luck to my little spermling,

839
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:51,160
little spermling, little stork, to the kids,

840
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:51,180
then to your ba-mmaes, -...stin aquele pig liked

841
00:47:51,180 --> 00:47:59,880
Uh, yes, yes, yes, dear friends, rain of brought, uh, brain rot.

842
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:07,720
Yes, brain rot, radio, theatre, broadcasting there from wonderful,

843
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:17,140
Wonderful WCSB in DNA level C, also known as Cleveland.

844
00:48:18,780 --> 00:48:19,660
Cleveland.

845
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:20,560
Ow!

846
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:21,780
Ouch.

847
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:22,500
Sorry.

848
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:23,600
Yeah.

849
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:32,400
And, yes, that was scripted, I believe, by Lonesome Cowboy Dave and his good friend Dave DeLuca.

850
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:43,720
And starring, of course, Scabby Days and Chaz Smith and that dirty-mouthed old Dan and Psychopath Finder.

851
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:51,740
And Princess Wiardo as the special guest star there providing the female voices.

852
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:56,200
And what else can I tell you about?

853
00:48:56,380 --> 00:49:02,080
Well, I could, I suppose, give you the, you know, some of you may be listening.

854
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:07,300
For the first time, you might be just a tad curious as to, now, wait a minute.

855
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,740
Now, what is this Bob thing all about, man?

856
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,100
I'm a kid.

857
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:12,120
Just explain it.

858
00:49:12,140 --> 00:49:12,300
Sure.

859
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,920
It's so simple, but you have to read it.

860
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:16,940
See, can you read?

861
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:20,780
Hey, can you write this address down?

862
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:21,760
I'm about to give.

863
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,180
All you got to do is just tell us you want the free information.

864
00:49:26,180 --> 00:49:31,020
Now, of course, if you were to use a self-addressed stamped envelope inside there.

865
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:40,460
And, you know, whatever kind of love offering you might want to grant to this radio station and this mighty church.

866
00:49:40,580 --> 00:49:45,720
Which, you know, just write to Bob.

867
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:53,240
You can just address it to Bob and it'll get to us at post office box.

868
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,840
1-4-0-3-0-6.

869
00:50:00,400 --> 00:50:01,920
In love.

870
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:02,260
Leave.

871
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:03,320
Dallas, Texas.

872
00:50:03,540 --> 00:50:09,380
And that zip code is, once again, 75214.

873
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:13,000
Once again, that's 75214.

874
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:23,320
You know, I would almost think if you addressed, if you wrote Bob Subgenius 75214 on an envelope.

875
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:28,980
And if you held it on your lap for a while and just prayed to Bob, I bet it'd get to us.

876
00:50:29,040 --> 00:50:31,660
You got to put that 29 cent stamp on it.

877
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:32,120
Of course.

878
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,040
And, yes.

879
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,400
I don't even know what's up next.

880
00:50:40,540 --> 00:50:44,420
But I know that it may be more of the different.

881
00:50:57,980 --> 00:50:58,540
Whoa.

882
00:50:58,780 --> 00:50:59,220
Yeah.

883
00:50:59,440 --> 00:50:59,940
Yeah.

884
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:00,540
Diving there?

885
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:01,160
Yeah.

886
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:01,500
Yeah.

887
00:51:01,640 --> 00:51:02,880
There are whole ovens here.

888
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,180
This is Starby.

889
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:05,320
Starby?

890
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:09,040
Somebody please ask Bob what I'm supposed to do with all these dwarves.

891
00:51:09,320 --> 00:51:11,200
Send them to post office box.

892
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:14,160
1-4-0-3-0-6.

893
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:15,840
What am I supposed to do with them?

894
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:16,480
What?

895
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:18,540
You put them in damn.

896
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:19,400
You guys cut off.

897
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:24,120
You put them in a box and put a stamp on them and mail them to Dallas.

898
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,980
Well, they'll fold up real good.

899
00:51:27,540 --> 00:51:27,980
Yeah.

900
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:28,780
They, you, well, you.

901
00:51:28,980 --> 00:51:30,520
I mean, I mean, I got them here.

902
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:30,520


903
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:30,520


904
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:30,520


905
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:30,520


906
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:30,520


907
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:30,520


908
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:30,520


909
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:30,520


910
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,000
But I can't control them too much longer.

911
00:51:33,180 --> 00:51:34,340
They're busy at something.

912
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:35,940
I'm not really sure what it is.

913
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:39,520
Dump a whole bunch of packing foam on them so they're immobilized.

914
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,220
And then meld it.

915
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,680
Well, they're so, well, they're kind of mobile, actually.

916
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:44,520
Then call the ATF.

917
00:51:45,460 --> 00:51:49,820
Well, if you dump the packing foam on them and then spray some spray paint on it, it'll

918
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:50,940
melt the packing foam.

919
00:51:51,180 --> 00:51:51,660
That's right.

920
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:52,400
And seal them in.

921
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:52,900
And seal those dwarves in their box.

922
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,040
Yeah, seal those dwarves right in their own juices.

923
00:51:55,120 --> 00:51:56,240
I think that's a tremendous.

924
00:51:56,420 --> 00:51:57,520
Wait a minute, you guys.

925
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,500
And you, can you believe you can get an item that'll actually seal them in?

926
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:00,500


927
00:52:00,500 --> 00:52:00,580
Yeah.

928
00:52:00,580 --> 00:52:03,780
You can seal them in the dwarf juices and give you triple your salvation back for what

929
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:04,040
is it?

930
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:05,440
Only now, it's only 20.

931
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:06,460
It's $20.

932
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,040
$20.

933
00:52:07,220 --> 00:52:07,280
So next year.

934
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:08,380
So you get.

935
00:52:08,380 --> 00:52:08,980
Now, what this.

936
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:10,960
I can't really believe this is true.

937
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:11,680
But you get the dwarf juicing sealer.

938
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:12,780
And I like them with the extra juicing.

939
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,480
The sealer of the dwarf juices.

940
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:15,760
You can have a free dwarf with it.

941
00:52:16,160 --> 00:52:16,440
Pardon?

942
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:18,080
Well.

943
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:18,600
I'm sorry.

944
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:21,740
If you send the dwarves to Dallas, we'll be giving out free dwarves for a while.

945
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:22,180
Yeah, sure.

946
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:23,640
We got plenty of them.

947
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,240
But wait a minute.

948
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,920
Now, there's, we got a problem here.

949
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:26,880
Well, you know, I could use a dwarf.

950
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:28,740
You're one of the little people, so to speak.

951
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:33,000
You know, height, dis, uh, uh, de-enabled persons who are listening to this show.

952
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,760
Do you think they would be.

953
00:52:33,840 --> 00:52:34,140
De-enabled.

954
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,200
Well, that's not wrong, man.

955
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:36,240
You think they would be.

956
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:36,920
You're not in Dallas.

957
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:37,920
You're not down in KNO.

958
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,760
And you don't have to be politically correct here.

959
00:52:39,860 --> 00:52:40,540
You're on CSP.

960
00:52:40,540 --> 00:52:42,940
See, in the first place, nobody listens to this station.

961
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:44,040
Oh, these are both kind of war.

962
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,280
Oh, it's one of those.

963
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:45,720
Yeah.

964
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:46,860
It's kind of like, oh.

965
00:52:46,920 --> 00:52:49,040
We're broadcasting to this floor of this building.

966
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:52,000
Hell, I mean, you can't make fun of anybody anymore.

967
00:52:52,540 --> 00:52:53,740
Except religious nuts.

968
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:55,160
You know, isn't that sick?

969
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,740
You can make fun of the guy who got his.

970
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:03,880
One of the few, one of the few little happiness is in life that you can actually make fun

971
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,360
of those monstrous megalithics that you portend to make fun of.

972
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:09,220
In your dreams.

973
00:53:09,340 --> 00:53:09,980
In your dreams.

974
00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:10,320
Yeah.

975
00:53:10,860 --> 00:53:15,980
But, but, you know, I mean, they did, they made a dwarf tossing illegal in, in Australia.

976
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,060
Well, Australians have their own ideas about things.

977
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:20,840
We find it.

978
00:53:22,060 --> 00:53:23,100
Hell yes.

979
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,620
In Ohio, hell yes.

980
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:26,720
We were born out of it.

981
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:26,720


982
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:26,720


983
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:26,720


984
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,040
We're born out of it.

985
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,040


986
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:27,820
I'd be proud of you.

987
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:27,940
I mean, if you're someone that's not even born out of it, you can make fun of him.

988
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:27,940


989
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:27,940


990
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:27,940


991
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:27,980
Call her.

992
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:28,420
Call her.

993
00:53:28,420 --> 00:53:28,660
Yeah.

994
00:53:28,780 --> 00:53:29,400
Let's go out.

995
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:33,660
And if they have a big dwarf tossing thing going on tonight, there's like about three

996
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:33,660


997
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:36,500
That's why I wanted NAFTA to pass.

998
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:39,340
So, you know, Mexicans could come up for the dwarf.

999
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:43,400
Well, I just realized, I can, I can make fun of dwarves.

1000
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:44,700
We can have a cultural exchange.

1001
00:53:45,020 --> 00:53:47,440
We can teach them our dwarf tossing.

1002
00:53:47,440 --> 00:53:49,980
And they can teach us their cat juggling.

1003
00:53:49,980 --> 00:53:51,440
That would be great.

1004
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,860
I'm afflicted with Darwin's curse.

1005
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:57,660
I have a back of a baboon and I have a...

1006
00:53:57,660 --> 00:54:00,820
I have a bachelor's and a master's.

1007
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:01,700
Yeah, I got divorced.

1008
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:02,640
They can get me anywhere.

1009
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:04,960
You got a master's too?

1010
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:06,500
Yeah, I got a master's.

1011
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,100
I went to college for one year.

1012
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:09,460
I've been going for eight years.

1013
00:54:09,460 --> 00:54:12,100
Yes, but the college you went to was... what was that?

1014
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,900
They call it the College of Cardinals or something?

1015
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:15,980
Dogstown University.

1016
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:16,820
Oh, Dogstown.

1017
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,760
Where Father Monsignor... he paddled you regularly.

1018
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,260
Didn't he?

1019
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:21,320
Was that part of the...

1020
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:23,900
Yeah, that's how we make subgeniuses.

1021
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,360
We have the Monsignors paddle the children.

1022
00:54:26,700 --> 00:54:27,200
Spankles.

1023
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,900
Do you give out graduate assistantships for like, praying?

1024
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:30,780
Prayering?

1025
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:32,240
Working the prayer tower?

1026
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:32,560
Depends on the level of donation.

1027
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:33,300
Yeah.

1028
00:54:33,380 --> 00:54:34,040
Yeah, it's...

1029
00:54:34,040 --> 00:54:39,680
When you bring in a good full collection plate, then we know that you're ready to be a doctor

1030
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:40,360
of divinity.

1031
00:54:40,700 --> 00:54:44,940
If the portfolio looks real good but your GPA isn't that high, is that okay?

1032
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:47,320
Again, the collection plate...

1033
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:47,960
Yeah, that's...

1034
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:49,480
Sure, you know...

1035
00:54:49,480 --> 00:54:50,820
Things can be worked out.

1036
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:52,820
It's who you know, it ain't what you know.

1037
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:53,960
That's all I know.

1038
00:54:54,060 --> 00:54:54,200
Really?

1039
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:54,760
I mean, it's true.

1040
00:54:55,020 --> 00:54:55,280
That's absolute...

1041
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:57,360
If you know Ben Franklin and...

1042
00:54:58,020 --> 00:54:58,900
Thomas Jefferson?

1043
00:54:58,980 --> 00:54:59,260
Weasel.

1044
00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:00,680
Guys on other big pieces of paper...

1045
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:01,200
Mrs. Grant?

1046
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:03,880
Yeah, U.S. Grant, yeah.

1047
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,320
Saxman, Pariah, Vicious Wood.

1048
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:14,480
The victory of ridiculous men, and you can't imagine the relief.

1049
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:19,340
Tell them no more games.

1050
00:55:19,340 --> 00:55:19,460
And this is the only thing that's left for you to remember.

1051
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:19,460


1052
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:19,460


1053
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:19,460


1054
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:19,460


1055
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:19,460


1056
00:55:19,460 --> 00:55:19,460


1057
00:55:23,100 --> 00:55:24,420
Do you have the drug?

1058
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:27,200
Yes.

1059
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:31,120
Movies or music, 24 hours a day.

1060
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:37,020
You're better educated, you have more income, you purchase more cars, VCRs and clothing,

1061
00:55:37,140 --> 00:55:40,240
furniture or photographic equipment than those you left behind.

1062
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:43,940
And your army has grown to nearly half of all Bay Area households.

1063
00:55:45,460 --> 00:55:48,020
Subjects will surrender their identification modules.

1064
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,440
The only thing that's left is the ID card.

1065
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:49,440


1066
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:49,440


1067
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:49,440


1068
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:55,700
Subjects can no longer claim individual status.

1069
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,520
Subjects have been reclassified as expendable material.

1070
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,320
Material will proceed through the barriers.

1071
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:07,140
Cover this.

1072
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:09,140
Make a small picture layout.

1073
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:09,520
Right.

1074
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,780
Oh, so that's it.

1075
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,280
What a guy.

1076
00:56:13,660 --> 00:56:14,480
Take the truck.

1077
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,240
We want sound.

1078
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:18,460
If you've got any cents left, you'll all go home and forget this.

1079
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:19,420
I don't need any money.

1080
00:56:19,420 --> 00:56:19,420


1081
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,220
I don't know about the rest of you, but I don't like the sound of any of this.

1082
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:27,260
It's tough to admit you've been a fool, but, well, look at us.

1083
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:29,020
Hi there, phone seekers.

1084
00:56:34,780 --> 00:56:36,140
Wildest thing I've heard of.

1085
00:56:36,280 --> 00:56:37,500
I ever hoped to.

1086
00:56:37,660 --> 00:56:38,540
What about the body?

1087
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,340
Not enough time.

1088
00:56:41,740 --> 00:56:42,940
The brain is dead.

1089
00:56:44,960 --> 00:56:45,400
Dead.

1090
00:56:45,960 --> 00:56:46,400
Incorrect.

1091
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,040
Access denied.

1092
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:52,460
Do anything about it.

1093
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:52,840
I have access to water.

1094
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:53,780
Please?

1095
00:56:54,040 --> 00:56:54,960
Start.

00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:03,580

1097
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:03,580


1098
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,720
