1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
See, they'll never, never know.

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:07,400
I'm surprised at you.

3
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,820
I can't believe what you just said to the microphone.

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:19,180
I don't care. I don't care. I don't care.

5
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,900
This is London.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:42,440
Sink into the abyss of a new dark age, made more sinister and perhaps more protracted by the likes of perverted science.

7
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,660
The subgenius power of flesh.

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,940
This was their final hour.

9
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,920
Dear God.

10
00:00:59,140 --> 00:00:59,920
Why is it?

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,120
Why is it so cold tonight?

12
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:04,400
Dear God.

13
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,680
Father, Son, Holy Cow!

14
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:15,560
Oh, well, well.

15
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,080
Moses went up to the mountain high

16
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,100
to find out from God

17
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:29,500
why did you make us?

18
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:29,940
Why?

19
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:33,800
Secret words in a secret room.

20
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,740
He said a humbub, a lubub, a lop, bam, boom.

21
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,520
I did not put you here to suffer.

22
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:44,460
I did not put you here to whine.

23
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,380

32
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,100
He told the boys with the horns

33
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,620
Get down and blow

34
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:23,080
They reared back.

35
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,560
They aimed their bales at the stars.

36
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,580
He saide, Bet me boats and daddy

37
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,520

38
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,200

00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,140

00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,060
I put you here to love one another.

00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,820

I said oh, oh, oh.

55
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,800
I said .

56
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,440
Jesus went out for a walk with his mother.

57
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:55,880
He was a good boy.

58
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:55,880


59
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:55,880


60
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:59,520
The scribes and the Pharisees, they're plottin' hug and mugger.

61
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,020
They locked him up.

62
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,580
They threw away the key and said,

63
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:06,980
why is everybody always picking on me?

64
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,760
I did not put you here to suffer.

65
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,740
I did not put you here to whine.

66
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,700
I put you here to love one another.

67
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:21,480
And to get out and have a good time.

68
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,860
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

69
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,760
Let my people go.

70
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,880
Oh, you know how people go.

71
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,520
You got to let my people go.

72
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:30,980
Every day, every night, all the time.

73
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,480
Let my people go.

74
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,860
Let my people go.

75
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,900
You got to let my people go.

76
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:40,340
Let my people go.

77
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,080
I was taking a turn.

78
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,360
I feel so bad about this.

79
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,280
Let my people go.

80
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,020
You know how people go.

81
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:48,100
Let my people go.

82
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:48,680
Let my people go.

83
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,280
Oh, yeah, yeah.

84
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,980
Let my people go.

85
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:55,980
You got to let my people go.

86
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,980
Oh, ay.

87
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,800
He never shows up, does he?

88
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,180
Why doesn't he show up?

89
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,340
What are we doing wrong?

90
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:27,440
I mean really what are we doing wrong what have we done why has Bob forsaken

91
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:39,300
us do we not have enough do are we not slack enough is that what it is are we

92
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:48,620
not mutant enough is that the problem or maybe they're just waiting for the

93
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:57,300
balance to be struck the balance to send the signal to the exodus maybe they're just waiting

94
00:05:58,140 --> 00:06:07,160
for us to prove that we are ready to take our rightful place as the gods we are destined to be

95
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:14,400
in this universe maybe that's what they're waiting on and it is up to you

96
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:17,460
to prove

97
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:18,020
to prove

98
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,600
to prove

99
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:23,620
that you are different and you are better

100
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,580
I better go record this

101
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:30,960
because you my friends are some genius

102
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:42,400
now as a side note I've noticed a disturbing trend

103
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,140
I mentioned this briefly during the live hour of slack has anyone noticed that it seems that

104
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:48,580
quite often

105
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:48,840
quite often

106
00:06:50,320 --> 00:07:18,580
the subgenius is the smartest mother in the room and I don't know about you brothers and sisters but when I look at a room full of pinks and clorps and bosses and assholes and ex-wives and ex-boyfriends and shitty cops all horrible things and I look at that room full of people and I know that I am an heiress to this world and I know that I am the most

107
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:18,580


108
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:18,580


109
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:18,580


110
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:18,580


111
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:18,580


112
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:18,580


113
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,160
responsible

114
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:19,480
and I know that I am the most Jos fundament Jason

115
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,080
I am the most responsible fuckwad of the living creature

116
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:32,960
I know that I really really really shouldn't be in charge of anything and I certainly brothers and sisters should not be the smartest mother fucker in the room

117
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,420
I know that I really really really shouldn't be in charge of anything and I certainly brothers and sisters should not be the smartest mother fucker in the room

118
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,660
but again and I am finding myself to be the smartest mother fucker in the room

119
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:42,960
the conspiracy is out-subging us

120
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,560
and its come to the point brothers and sisters that the subconscious have been も

121
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:48,560


122
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,340
geniuses are the geniuses.

123
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:56,600
How the hell did that happen, brothers and sisters? How the hell did we

124
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,260
reach the point that we, the subgeniuses, were

125
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,840
the smartest motherfuckers in the room?

126
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:08,000
I am disturbed. I am watching these conspiracy

127
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,420
fake motherfuckers walking in their

128
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,580
predestined paths for, you know what, they don't want to come to Ex-Tag.

129
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:20,560
They don't want to do that. Because it's too much work.

130
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,580
There's risk involved. It is so much easier to suck

131
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:28,460
down the conspiracy poisons, the conspiracy

132
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:32,440
media, the conspiracy news, to

133
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,940
suck that down as they travel, chargingly

134
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,540
through the path, the gate, the gate that

135
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,580
is known as the easy way, the gate that is known as don't make

136
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,380
waves, the gate that is known

137
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:51,620
as normality. And as they trot through those gates,

138
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,560
they are blinded by the conspiracy media. They are blinded

139
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,940
by the false slack that conspiracy provides.

140
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:03,520
And they do not hear the blades of the

141
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,700
abattoir. They do not hear the sounds

142
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,720
of rending flesh and crushing bone as they go to

143
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:14,400
their end. No, they do not.

144
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,180
But we do.

145
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:23,360
And that is why we're here. Because we are different.

146
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:32,360
And we are better. Because we are subgeniuses.

147
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:39,240
And even though it is sad to say, we may be the smartest

148
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:46,240
motherfucker in the room. But when the exes do come,

149
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,980
when we have proved our right to this universe,

150
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,640
we will own that abattoir.

151
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,540
We will be the butchers

152
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:03,360
riding those pink lambs to slaughter.

153
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:08,460
Can I get a praise Bob?

154
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,400
Praise Bob!

155
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,920
Praise Bob!

156
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,480
Can I get a fuck the pinks?

157
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:18,860
Fuck the pinks!

158
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:24,160
Thank you brothers and sisters for listening to my impromptu bitch.

159
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:29,400
And next up very shortly here will be the amino acids.

160
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:35,680
As you can see, their mortal slaves are currently setting up their gear.

161
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,480
And as soon as they are ready, they will be on stage.

162
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:45,300
And as soon as the aminos are done, we will set that pipe smoking motherfucker on fire.

163
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,920
Can I get a hell yeah?

164
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,260
Hell yeah!

165
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,420
Can I get a praise Bob?

166
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:52,100
Praise Bob!

167
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:54,200
And you know what we're going to do next?

168
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,420
We're going to kill him. So can I get a kill Bob?

169
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,920
Kill Bob!

170
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,280
Thank you brothers and sisters.

171
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:02,940
Praise Pisces!

172
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:05,200
Praise Pisces!

173
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:17,760
Give me that old Johnny Cash show.

174
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,240
Give me that, give me that for me.

175
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:23,880
Give me that for me.

176
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,080
Give me that, give me that for me.

177
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,420
Give me that for me.

178
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,840
Give me that for me.

179
00:11:37,180 --> 00:11:39,160
Thank you Lemur.

180
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:45,120
The intents of genius preaching before that was of course the great Priestess Pisces.

181
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,440
Improvising at 60 Next Day.

182
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:56,900
And that song, Let My People Go Go, that was in fact The Rainmakers.

183
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:08,140
And it was not recorded at 60 Next Day, but was extracted from a new live concert DVD called 25 On Live.

184
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:15,100
In which they performed their entire first album in order followed by their new album 25 On.

185
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,000
The Rainmakers would be my X Day Dream Band.

186
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:26,980
I am equally impressed with my old touring pal, St. Andrew the Impaled.

187
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:33,020
Who's been proving that he's not just a sideshow marvel, but a sideshow songwriter.

188
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,580
Right up there with Barry Manilow.

189
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:41,780
Alright now, since we're being preachy, alright, I promised Stang this.

190
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:45,100
He didn't get to hear this at the Divival we had a week and a half ago.

191
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:45,100


192
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,960
In the fine city of Pittsburgh.

193
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,740
I don't normally do parodies, but I do do some parodies.

194
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:53,660
And this is one of them.

195
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:58,920
Tori Amos stole this from the Boomtown Rats.

196
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,480
I'm stealing it back.

197
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,340
Sorry.

198
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:45,100


199
00:13:45,100 --> 00:14:15,100


200
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:45,100


201
00:14:45,100 --> 00:15:15,100


202
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:45,100


203
00:15:45,100 --> 00:16:15,100


204
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:45,100


205
00:16:45,100 --> 00:17:15,100


206
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,360
I'm not hearing from your line, but then we've had a whole new problem of our own here.

207
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,420
A buzz, eh?

208
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:22,300
I've heard cross talk from other worlds.

209
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,300
I mean like, what's the matter?

210
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,940
We need to hear cheerful talk from other worlds.

211
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:32,160
All these beings and entities venting their spleen.

212
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,360
They cannot possibly hope to achieve representation.

213
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:37,800
Time is just too limited.

214
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:42,920
Especially with the tools they have, they'll never vent their spleen the right way.

215
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:44,140
Not in time.

216
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:50,340
I hate to hear those aliens go on and on gossiping about us, calling us ugly bags of water.

217
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,400
Yeah, all that stuff.

218
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:55,020
That really gets old, what some of those aliens.

219
00:17:55,100 --> 00:18:00,600
The Nazmurk called us squirming bags of unfulfilled appetites.

220
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:07,280
You know, this from creatures whose bodies are supported by machinery because they're so decayed in general.

221
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,420
Obsolete.

222
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,400
Why should we take this guff?

223
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:11,860
Really?

224
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:13,840
Yeah, why are we gonna let giant hundreds...

225
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:13,920
Yeah.

226
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:17,200
...foot tall aliens with superpowers push us around, eh?

227
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,160
Yeah, soon they're gonna be the rulers of the roost.

228
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,280
Bantamweight.

229
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:25,880
Henry Hawks of the Galactic Center.

230
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,480
Can I say one thing?

231
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,320
We gotta do something about it, see?

232
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,200
We can't let it go on.

233
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:36,960
Well, it's too late.

234
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:38,740
We can't let it go.

235
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,100
We've got to realize we're in a situation where diplomacy is going to be...

236
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:44,620
Oh, yeah.

237
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:44,620


238
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,340
Oh, yeah.

239
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,880
Not just our little planet.

240
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:47,760
Oh, yeah.

241
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:47,900
Right?

242
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:54,040
So I think we've all studied the manual and we know what to do when the ships land.

243
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,920
And the others are just gonna have to let this be impressed forcibly upon them.

244
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:01,580
Yep.

245
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:05,400
It's Mother Nature's way of receiving you.

246
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:11,160
If you don't meet the grill cage, you're not gonna withstand the fire, you know?

247
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,360
There will be a delicious...

248
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:18,220
Devouring of a fellow Earth creature.

249
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,560
Don't make it all up in my grill cage.

250
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,280
Will there be soul eating?

251
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,660
Because I hate that.

252
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,040
Well, you don't have to participate.

253
00:19:26,180 --> 00:19:29,460
If you cook it long enough, you know, it...

254
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,820
Man, but the things you gotta do to cook a soul, I mean, that's so complicated.

255
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,620
I went to...

256
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:36,540
Oh, I'll ask you in a while.

257
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,080
Enough butter and salt.

258
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:40,440
It's a quantum event.

259
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,800
The soul itself is so tiny that it's cooked...

260
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,640
Actually, the best thing to do is you gotta cut it up into very tiny pieces.

261
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:50,960
You gotta cut it up into very tiny pieces and fry it at very high heat for a short amount of time.

262
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:54,680
And if you cut the pieces small enough, you'll find it quite palatable.

263
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:57,360
You just blanch the entire...

264
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,420
All the comestible parts there, you just blanch it briefly and violently.

265
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,660
Hey, Blanch.

266
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,660
Oops.

267
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,400
Is this on?

268
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,140
You know, there are a number of people...

269
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,520
My name, yes, I know my name means from the woods, so don't be silly now.

270
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:14,300
What?

271
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,060
I...

272
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,640
Well, if you...

273
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,520
I thought you said Blanch Dubois.

274
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,440
Blanch, uh, yeah, sure.

275
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,380
It simply means...

276
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,920
Not W-E-B Dubois, but Blanch Dubois.

277
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,120
Or Dubois, Pennsylvania.

278
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:30,660
It means pale, whiteness, paleness.

279
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:37,000
You look like a man I can trust, or maybe not.

280
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,120
I don't know where that came from.

281
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,960
I'm glad I forgot.

282
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Tennessee Williams.

283
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:42,500
Tennessee Williams.

284
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,000
That sounds like it.

285
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,320
Boy, what a guy.

286
00:20:46,340 --> 00:20:47,540
He was Tennessee Williams.

287
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,240
Absolutely.

288
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,640
That was another one by him.

289
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,140
Right next to him, as a matter of fact.

290
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,480
Then there was The Boston Miss Greeting from the Aardvark.

291
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:57,840
That was...

292
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,260
Or, uh, the, uh...

293
00:20:59,260 --> 00:20:59,400
Went nowhere.

294
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,960
They're making a movie of that.

295
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,900
Yeah, after all these years, it was a big flop on Broadway.

296
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,240
And it never sold as a novelette.

297
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:11,480
Then there was The Night of the Iguana.

298
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:11,960
The Night of the Iguana.

299
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,020
Yeah.

300
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:12,100
I mean, it was a great movie.

301
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,100


302
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,100


303
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,100


304
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,100


305
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,100


306
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,100


307
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:12,100


308
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,100
It's a great movie.

309
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


310
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


311
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


312
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


313
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


314
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


315
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


316
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


317
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


318
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


319
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


320
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


321
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


322
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


323
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:13,100


324
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:14,180
Cooked rare.

325
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,260
Oh, and blanched like those souls.

326
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:20,200
The Night of the Fried Iguana.

327
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:21,200
Mm-hmm.

328
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,900
The Night the Tide Tethered Iguana Got Loose.

329
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,620
The sea was red that night when...

330
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,020
The sea of weeds.

331
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:36,620
Oh, how tortured we are in this life, and how ecstatic it will be as soon as X-Day

332
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:38,420
finally turns over and

333
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:40,180
our new selves will

334
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:42,620
bud and grow in the sun of a different

335
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,120
planet.

336
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,420
Oh, how we all aspire for such things.

337
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,680
We will sprout from the soil,

338
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,520
brothers and sisters.

339
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,220
I was about to say I can't wait,

340
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:54,440
but obviously I've proved that I can

341
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,560
wait for going on 18 years

342
00:21:56,560 --> 00:21:57,500
now to...

343
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,680
Oh, God. Oh, God.

344
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,440
Please, Bob.

345
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,440
Waiting for those little bean pods of Bob

346
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,320
to germinate.

347
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,000
You know, I really don't want to have to haul those 400

348
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,180
boxes downstairs to the van

349
00:22:10,180 --> 00:22:12,120
again. Set them on fire.

350
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,060
You know what I...

351
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,980
Actually, never mind.

352
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:17,940
He had a suggestion.

353
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,960
Because the idea that I just had

354
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,100
will not solve your problem.

355
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,300
Your problem is that it keeps happening

356
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,460
year after year. This ain't happening.

357
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,800
This just ain't happening.

358
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,140
You've got to start a whole new cult where you don't put a

359
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,580
specific date on the end of the world.

360
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,900
Well, we didn't do it.

361
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,200
Bob.

362
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:36,280
Bob did it, so we have to

363
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:36,980
go with it.

364
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,360
When's the last time anybody saw Bob in public, though?

365
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,380
You know, he's a very...

366
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:43,740
He's hard to pin down.

367
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,880
People do see him around.

368
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:48,020
We've heard him talk before, but he's

369
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:49,980
very hard to get on camera. He's very hard

370
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,580
to get on the record for an interview.

371
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,540
He's been on camera, I'm afraid to say.

372
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:55,040
Not very often.

373
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,540
But often enough.

374
00:22:57,380 --> 00:22:58,700
He's very reclusive.

375
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,800
And he wears dark lipstick and

376
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:02,660
strange eyelashes.

377
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,400
I've seen...

378
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,580
I've seen him on the highway

379
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,880
three or four times, always

380
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:10,220
shooting past me.

381
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,800
I've seen him...

382
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,660
I used to see him at this coffee shop

383
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,520
and right after they instituted

384
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,620
the smoking ban in the state of Ohio,

385
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:20,500
you know, he came in like usual

386
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,740
with his pipe. And they tried to tell him,

387
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,620
hey man, you can't smoke that thing in here anymore.

388
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:26,860
And Bob didn't say a thing.

389
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,400
He just, you know, continued with that

390
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,520
big grin of his and

391
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,860
the pipe just kept smoldering and

392
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:34,280
they kept on telling him, come on man, you can't

393
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:35,580
smoke in here anymore. You gotta get out.

394
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,860
They picked him up and they literally

395
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,520
threw him out under the bus.

396
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,300
There was a bus coming along at the same time they threw him out in the street.

397
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,200
The bus went right over him.

398
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,640
Literal throwing under the bus.

399
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:48,000
I totally forgot about that time.

400
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,180
But he was fine. I mean, you saw like

401
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,440
a broken pipe

402
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,800
on the ground there

403
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:56,340
where the bus went by him, but you could tell it wasn't

404
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,620
Bob's pipe. You know how you could tell?

405
00:23:58,240 --> 00:23:59,680
It wasn't in Bob's mouth.

406
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:00,560
That's right.

407
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,460
But I saw him again a few weeks later.

408
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:06,020
Clearly he survived that.

409
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,840
I mean, this is the, one of the

410
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,160
chief advantages that Bob Dobbs has

411
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
as a savior over Jesus Christ is that

412
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,020
Bob has died and risen

413
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:16,020
more times than anyone can count.

414
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,340
Jesus only ever did that once.

415
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,180
And that was like what, 2,000 years ago?

416
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:21,900
Bob does this all the time.

417
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,240
Oh yeah, that's right. Apollonius

418
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,400
of Crete or wherever it was.

419
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,260
Diana. He died and came

420
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,100
back also. Yeah, every

421
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,300
spring he came back. That was

422
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:33,960
the cult of Dionysius, wasn't it?

423
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,640
No. Nope.

424
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,820
That's different. That's quite different,

425
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:38,380
my boy.

426
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,940
And Apollonius of Diana,

427
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,940
he was, he worked with Dr.

428
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:46,100
Lowe in his circus for a while. In his circus, yes he

429
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,800
did. Apollonius? And boy, people

430
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,020
did not like his message

431
00:24:50,020 --> 00:24:52,080
because he would, he would tell

432
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,560
them the truth and

433
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,180
they'd go, wow, what's my life gonna be like?

434
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,960
Am I gonna meet that tall, dark, ancient

435
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,980
Oh, we got somebody calling from one of my favorite

436
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,000
area codes now. He'd tell them what they didn't

437
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:04,020
want to hear. We got somebody calling from BC.

438
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,420
Fake. And he told them what was actually going to happen.

439
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:07,620
Hello, you're on the air. And they hated it.

440
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,820
They always wanted their money back after that.

441
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,100
That's utter nonsense.

442
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,760
The future is always nonsense

443
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,300
until it becomes

444
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:18,960
the past.

445
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:26,060
I'm sorry, but you see, it is my curse to tell the

446
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,000
absolute truth.

447
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,440
I got an email just last

448
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,740
week that said,

449
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:44,300
Reverend Stang, I was listening to the

450
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,340
hour of slack and you played a sermon

451
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,060
from that last X Day drill.

452
00:25:48,340 --> 00:25:50,500
Some girl was going on

453
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,720
and on and on and I didn't like her voice.

454
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,540
That girl wasn't funny at all.

455
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:55,880
Why did you play that?

456
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,460
There's a simple answer,

457
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,540
dear friends. She showed

458
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,540
up. She was

459
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,260
there and got on the radio.

460
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,260


461
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,260


462
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:06,060
She was on stage and let the tongues of

463
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,740
flame burn through her.

464
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,220
And yes, she forgot her

465
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,840
lines and the recording was

466
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,900
awful and Reverend Funny Name

467
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,660
kept yelling at her, but

468
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,900
she did something that

469
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,180
email critic didn't do.

470
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:22,400
She showed up.

471
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,220
The Church of the

472
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,100
Subgenius is not a

473
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,060
democracy. It is not

474
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,260
a collective socialist

475
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,420
law. I added

476
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,040
that part. The Church of the

477
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,800
Subgenius is a strict

478
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,980
hierarchy. There are three

479
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:40,260
immutable means of advancing up

480
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:42,000
the ladder of sales success.

481
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,380
The first is yours for

482
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,460
a beer $35.

483
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,360
The second is, you

484
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,040
got to be funny or

485
00:26:50,040 --> 00:26:52,360
smart or attractive

486
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,260
or some combination of these.

487
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:56,440
But the hardest one is this.

488
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,340
You have to

489
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,660
show up.

490
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,380
You think all those early

491
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:04,180
doctors had it going right from the

492
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,720
start. You think

493
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,300
Dr. Drummond and I were the best

494
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:10,000
choice for running a global

495
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:12,220
mail order mind control cult.

496
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:14,040
Well, you think

497
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,160
funny, son. We showed

498
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,220
up. That girl at X Day

499
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,180
showed up. If you want

500
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:22,000
that date or that

501
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,960
sales diocese

502
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,700
or to be lifted up in glory

503
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,000
ass first on the day of

504
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,620
Xist Grintervention,

505
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:31,660
you have to show up.

506
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,860
You could be part of the

507
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,440
greatest show up

508
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,860
on earth if you

509
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,660
just show up.

510
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,660
Now, I just

511
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,620
mentioned that at the day of rapture

512
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,600
of the rupture, I mean

513
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,460
the rupture, pardon me,

514
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:49,800
all subgeniuses who have paid

515
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,660
their $35 to Bob will be lifted

516
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:52,720
up into the heavens

517
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:54,760
ass first.

518
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,300
And that is literally true.

519
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:59,760
Whenever you've seen a comic strip

520
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,740
character go feet up in that third

521
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:03,640
panel, that's what I'm talking

522
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,220
about. It's a big

523
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,260
shepherd's crook pulling us off

524
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:09,360
the stage. Not because we

525
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,360
showed up and we're no

526
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,560
good, but because riverboat

527
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,580
Dobbs got us a better

528
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:16,900
gig uptown.

529
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,600
Can't you just see it, dear friends?

530
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:21,420
Your hands and feet flapping in front

531
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,460
of you while your keister shoots to

532
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,140
the sky. Bob will

533
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,340
save your ass and the rest

534
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,680
of you will follow.

535
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,600
As you all know,

536
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,360
humans are the internet's way

537
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,680
of making more

538
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:35,320
internet.

539
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,820
Thank goodness for the internet. Yay

540
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,100
internet. But those rules

541
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,860
don't apply to us. Not

542
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,360
entirely. Because of that hideous

543
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,840
yet kind of sexy

544
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,980
human yeti miscegenation

545
00:28:48,980 --> 00:28:51,120
so long ago, we are

546
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,300
half-breeds.

547
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,080
The subgenius are the wolf

548
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,940
men and the mermaids.

549
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,900
The neither here nor there, neither

550
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:01,040
hot nor cold, the circle

551
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,340
without center or circumference.

552
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,140
Therefore, both

553
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:07,440
logic and moral

554
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,000
hygiene demand

555
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,580
that we use the internet

556
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:13,300
but nay, let it not

557
00:29:13,300 --> 00:29:14,480
use us.

558
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,560
Go the hell outside.

559
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:19,280
Go for a walk. Go clean your

560
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,820
house and cook some food.

561
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,300
Go meet your friends. Talk

562
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,780
to your family. Show

563
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:27,360
up. Believe me,

564
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,260
your unpaid job doing

565
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:31,400
data entry for Facebook will still

566
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,820
be there when you get back.

567
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:35,180
Yes,

568
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,260
there are pictures of naked

569
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,220
ladies online, but you could

570
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,140
have sex with a beautiful

571
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:43,220
live girl. Or

572
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:45,400
an ugly one. Or a fellow

573
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,300
yetisan.

574
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:49,220
Step away from the computer. Put

575
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,700
the phone down and live.

576
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:52,880
Whichever planet this is,

577
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,420
it's unbelievably big and scary.

578
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,260
Bigger and scarier

579
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,800
than any screen.

580
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:01,340
It's nut-wrenching.

581
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:02,600
We

582
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:04,560
stand to receive thee,

583
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:06,400
you who are of flesh

584
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,620
and understand not the way

585
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,420
of the lead-clad ones.

586
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,700
This is it, friends.

587
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,500
Time to close the deal.

588
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,520
Eat the hell out of all those

589
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,380
hamburgers. All of them. You

590
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,680
are the one you've been saving yourself

591
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,500
for. Living well

592
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:24,420
is the best revenge.

593
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,600
But, you have to live well.

594
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,100
And, you have to live.

595
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,660
When you pass a mad scientist

596
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,260
on the street, does he

597
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,840
roll his fingers and shriek,

598
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:34,560
it's alive!

599
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,440
If the answer is no, then you need to get on that.

600
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,120
You are good enough.

601
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,260
You are clean enough. But, if,

602
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,620
if and only if, you get right

603
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,260
with Bob tonight.

604
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,540
Good night it will be.

605
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:49,620
A good night.

606
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:52,540
Because, you showed

607
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,880
up, my friends.

608
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,260
Praise Onan.

609
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:58,500
Praise Onan and Canabite

610
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:58,880
for that.

611
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,380
See, that's

612
00:31:02,380 --> 00:31:04,400
my secret. Onan Canabite.

613
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,400
He still has

614
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:06,880
the faith.

615
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:10,260
He was the youngest subgenius in

616
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,060
1980.

617
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,820
He joined when he was only 16.

618
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:16,260
I saw him a couple years ago. I met his girlfriend.

619
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,200
I thought, what's Onan doing with that

620
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,460
40-year-old woman?

621
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:22,180
Then I remembered.

622
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:24,400
He's 40.

623
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,740
Then he was 40.

624
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,560
He's probably my age by now.

625
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,360
I'm surprised that you're not.

626
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,160
I can't believe what you just said

627
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,760
to the microphone.

628
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,340
Reverend Heathen has just arrived

629
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:45,980
with a truckload of

630
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,260
dead giant mammal carcasses.

631
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:49,880
An enormous

632
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,300
barbecue is going to take place

633
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,200
and the smoke of that burning

634
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,400
ascendeth forever.

635
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,900
The crackling flesh.

636
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:00,300
Well, so, don't

637
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,200
ask where Lonesome Cowboy Dave is.

638
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,820
This weekend, just be thankful

639
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,640
as you devour that

640
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:07,520
quote, pork, unquote.

641
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:10,340
That long-awaited pig.

642
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,800
He gave of himself

643
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:13,480
that one X-Day. That was when, like,

644
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,900
Game of Strange cooked it and ruined their weekend.

645
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:17,960
Did you know that Forrest Ackerman also

646
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,680
consumed human flesh?

647
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,120
What? Forrest J.

648
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,120
Ackerman, the editor of Famous Monsters of

649
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,760
Filmland, was lucky enough to

650
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:28,160
eat human before X-Day?

651
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,840
He was into all sorts of

652
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:31,700
California kook

653
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,180
society.

654
00:32:32,380 --> 00:32:33,920
Before they were ever famous

655
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:36,020
or trendy, including nudism,

656
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,080
uh, unarius, and

657
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,680
it is said by

658
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,880
those who are his distractors that he

659
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:43,920
enjoyed a human snack on

660
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:44,660
certain occasions.

661
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,080
Obama eats dogs in Kenya.

662
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,580
I read that on the internet.

663
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:52,180
I met Forrest

664
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,640
and I'm sure you did, too. I

665
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:55,560
certainly bear him no ill will.

666
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,100
He wanted to try every possible experience.

667
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,240
Well, it's too bad Susie's

668
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,900
not here because she spent many

669
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,440
nights at the Acker mansion,

670
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,680
which my house is named after.

671
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,940
My girlfriend took me there once,

672
00:33:08,040 --> 00:33:09,620
which was a wonderful thing to do,

673
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:13,540
and, uh, I saw all the usual monster stuff

674
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:16,960
that he had, but there were areas where you were

675
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,780
not allowed to go, which were blocked by the

676
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:22,840
large troll-like bodies of Ray Harryhausen fans

677
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:25,320
who would stand there so you couldn't get through,

678
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:28,740
but you could see just behind them bizarre shrines

679
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:31,780
to Marlena Dietrich with a thousand candles,

680
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:35,100
burning, and other things that Ackerman had.

681
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,080
So he wasn't all about the monster movies.

682
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:40,060
Was it Marlena Dietrich or Greta Garbo?

683
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,780
Now I'm thinking it was Greta Garbo.

684
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,020
Honestly, no kidding. I saw it.

685
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,760
The guy wouldn't let me go further.

686
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,860
That's fine. Yeah, you know.

687
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,240
We all have some kind of hidden pornography altar

688
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:56,380
somewhere, don't we?

689
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,460
We call them slack altars.

690
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:01,760
Yeah. Mine has a lot of monologues.

691
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:01,900
I think it's a little bit of a

692
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:05,240
microbe, germs and things breeding in it.

693
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:08,180
There you go. For my bug porn.

694
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,240
I brought my microscope, by the way.

695
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,600
We don't have the projector yet, but I'm hoping

696
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,240
later on that we can do a little show.

697
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:19,000
Did you have a projector? Oh, great.

698
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,240
Did you bring the bug porn movie?

699
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,480
Yeah, I did, but I was hoping to do some live bug porn.

700
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,780
Well, we can do that, too.

701
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,540
You know, once we get a projector and can make a picture

702
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:30,880
on that thing back there,

703
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:35,700
then I'm just going to sit here and play video games

704
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:36,640
the whole festival.

705
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,300
That's what I'm saving up for a projector

706
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:43,700
so I can have a setup like Dr. Drummond.

707
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,920
Friends, do you have a slack altar at your house?

708
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:47,660
I do.

709
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:51,140
Or has your house become a slack altar?

710
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:53,520
Yeah, we...

711
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,560
Right, I've been to Reverend Fox's house,

712
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,380
and it's...

713
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:01,500
The whole thing is pretty much a slack altar.

714
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:04,720
The slack altar wishes to spread and diversify,

715
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:08,640
but then even some top flight subgeniuses

716
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,900
at some point in their careers

717
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:13,960
have had the entire house be sort of pink and normal

718
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,300
and all of the crazy stuff just kept in one little hobby room,

719
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:20,120
you know, where no one important would see it.

720
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:23,920
The visiting parson or whatever would not be horrified

721
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:26,360
by an array of plastic toys.

722
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:27,340
Or the pink spouse.

723
00:35:27,820 --> 00:35:29,520
Yes, the pink spouse might be.

724
00:35:29,540 --> 00:35:30,940
That's usually the problem.

725
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:34,600
That not too strong a subgenius flavor

726
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,460
be spread about the premises.

727
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:40,620
Princess, we and I have been surveying

728
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:43,540
the slack altars of subgeniuses around the country

729
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:46,400
and the world and photographing them.

730
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:50,700
Of course, the Flusium at Susie the Flusie's house

731
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:55,140
is by far the largest slack altar

732
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:57,240
and bulldata collection I've ever seen.

733
00:35:57,380 --> 00:35:59,100
It should be a National Historic Site.

734
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:03,200
Your room is one gigantic slack altar,

735
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:04,460
but it's just one room.

736
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:04,820
Yes, I know. Yes.

737
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:08,740
Craig Potter and Ostrel, Potter and Petal

738
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:15,440
have a house that is one really nicely organized slack altar.

739
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,840
Very good.

740
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:20,720
You don't need the false drugs when you go into a house

741
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,840
that is all everywhere.

742
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:27,640
Everywhere you look, everything's swimming with faces

743
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,980
and monsters and robots and...

744
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,020
Like a Todd Schor painting realized in three dimensions.

745
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:42,280
Reverend Angry Larry and Reverend Lucy

746
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:47,940
have a slack altar house loaded with decapitated heads

747
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,920
and Peanuts characters.

748
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:52,260
This is all elevated, progressive, and correct.

749
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,620
Yeah, well, he's a monster makeup guy on the side.

750
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:56,260
Yes.

751
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:02,480
As well as being a rock star and, I believe, an exterminator.

752
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,500
Yeah, yeah, that's it, an exterminator.

753
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:07,180
Well, isn't that what the monsters always try to do?

754
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,700
Yeah, they always, yeah.

755
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,060
This one you might know.

756
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:56,240
Yeah, it's the one of the terrible vole necessarily

757
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:55,260
ọi

758
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:26,120
That was the slot rods, friends.

759
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:32,720
A greatest surf hate band since the amino acids at 60 Next Day,

760
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,760
recorded by Reverend Suds Bashaw.

761
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,280
And so is this music in the background.

762
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:42,480
Following is my Next Day location mic recording of,

763
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,040
unplugged due to tornadoes,

764
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:48,040
The Mutant Mountain Boys.

765
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:50,440
Okay.

766
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,980
Welcome to Me Can't Tell a Joke.

767
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:54,560
Oh!

768
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,780
I thought the joke was over my head.

769
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:10,860
I didn't understand anything.

770
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:13,800
See me after, I'll break it down.

771
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,720
I've got diagrams.

772
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,680
I'm 10 years old.

773
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:18,880
If you have a tablet, you're a film strip.

774
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:19,800
PowerPoint.

775
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:21,340
Handouts.

776
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,340
Swift kick in the ass.

777
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:24,960
I'm so sure.

778
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:25,880
Get me it.

779
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,160
Get me a pamphlet, okay?

780
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:28,160
Because that's all I know.

781
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:28,960
Color forms.

782
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,000
Drinky dinks.

783
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,500
Tea leaves.

784
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,600
We've got one more for you guys.

785
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,920
All right.

786
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:36,960
Thank you so much for listening to The Mutant Mountain Boys.

787
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,640
You guys can play the amino acid song,

788
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,580
because they're probably not going to show up without me.

789
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:40,340
Probably.

790
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:43,140
We can.

791
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,420
We can.

792
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,380
But we've got a cover, actually.

793
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,620
This is Bob's favorite hoedown song.

794
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:49,160
Yes.

795
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:49,480
That's right.

796
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,960
He had a lot of hoedowns there.

797
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:53,560
Yes, he did.

798
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,580
Boy, were they down.

799
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,000
Error.

800
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:57,480
Error?

801
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,480
Error.

802
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,960
Error.

803
00:40:00,660 --> 00:40:01,740
Error.

804
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:14,300
Error.

805
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:15,160
Error.

806
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:15,800
Error.

807
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:15,980


808
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,600
Error.

809
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:17,600


810
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:17,600


811
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,700
Error.

812
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:18,760
Error.

813
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:19,320
Error.

814
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:19,320

816
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,280
Error.

817
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:43,360
Crack that whip, step on a crack, your little brick, your mama's back.

818
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,500
Crack that whip when something's wrong, for the cream sits out too long.

819
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,520
Whip it in the shape, stir it up, get spread. Whip it in the shape, no one can do it.

820
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:55,720
Whip it in the shape, stir it up, get spread. Whip it in the shape, no one can do it.

821
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,560
Whip it in the shape, stir it up, get spread. Whip it in the shape, no one can do it.

822
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:28,220
Whip it in the shape, stir it up, get spread.

823
00:41:28,220 --> 00:41:28,500
Oh, nice!

824
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,760
Crack that whip, step on a crack, you're gonna break your mama's back.

825
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:53,720
Crack that whip when it goes astray, ain't nobody to get away.

826
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,880
Whip it in the shape, stir it up, get spread.

827
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,840
Whip it in the shape, no one can do it.

828
00:41:58,120 --> 00:42:02,000
Whip it in the shape, stir it up, get spread. Whip it in the shape, no one can do it.

829
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:18,860
Crack that whip, step on a crack, you're gonna break your mama's back.

830
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:22,920
Crack that whip when something's wrong, for the cream sits out too long.

831
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:24,940
Whip it in the shape, stir it up, get spread.

832
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,860
Whip it in the shape, no one can do it.

833
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:30,940
Whip it in the shape, stir it up, get spread. Whip it in the shape, no one can do it.

834
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:35,080
Whip it in the shape, stir it up, get spread. Whip it in the shape, no one can do it.

835
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,220
Whip it in the shape, stir it up, get spread. Whip it in the shape, no one can do it.

836
00:42:40,980 --> 00:42:41,300
Yeah!

837
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:44,600
Go!

838
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:46,540
Yeah!

839
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:47,360
Oh!

840
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:48,560
.

841
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:51,260
. So...

842
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:20,300
Well, there is a subtext today,

843
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,080
and that is a remarkable book,

844
00:43:23,180 --> 00:43:24,800
which may be familiar to some of you.

845
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:28,220
Revelation X, the Bob Apocryphon.

846
00:43:28,680 --> 00:43:31,460
You may be aware that in recent times,

847
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:38,120
the third subgenius book has gone through the roof.

848
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,680
It now sells for what preposterous price?

849
00:43:41,740 --> 00:43:43,620
700 bucks or something like that?

850
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,780
Either $999 or one cent is the way we've seen it on eBay.

851
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:50,060
Well, that's a good spread.

852
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:50,860
But at any rate.

853
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:53,840
No, actually, Revelation X has shown up

854
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,240
with both of those prices within the same month on eBay.

855
00:43:57,280 --> 00:43:57,960
Interesante.

856
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,560
Philo follows that.

857
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:03,480
And it's partly because there's big eBay dealers

858
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:06,360
whose business is run by computer

859
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:08,960
and watch each other's eBay site.

860
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:17,860
So when competitor one raises his Revelation X copy to $5,

861
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:23,780
competitor two, his computer automatically bumps the price up to six.

862
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,160
And vice versa, it goes back and forth for 999 days.

863
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:33,860
Next thing you know, a book that you can buy at that table over there for 20 bucks

864
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:37,980
is going for $999 to suckers on eBay.

865
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:46,140
Well, it is quite shocking how many soi-disant subgeniuses do not own this special book.

866
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:46,480
Right.

867
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,660
They think it ended with,

868
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:48,700
Look at the subgenius.

869
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:49,500
It certainly did not.

870
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,960
They forget the Second Testament and the Third Testament.

871
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:56,520
This is a place where you can get it signed by Reverend Ivan Stang

872
00:44:56,520 --> 00:45:00,480
or even by me since I have so many illustrations and things.

873
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,720
And Dr. LeGume and Princess Wee.

874
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:03,460
And Dr. LeGume, Princess Wee.

875
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:08,540
This is better than any eBay auction or online order

876
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:12,180
or even in a quaint old-timey brick-and-mortar bookstore

877
00:45:12,180 --> 00:45:14,440
because here you can get yours,

878
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:17,800
well, you can get the value added to information.

879
00:45:17,860 --> 00:45:18,100
Definitely.

880
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:22,760
Well, the safe thing to do would be to buy two copies,

881
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:23,660
one as a spare,

882
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:28,500
and go around and just find everyone you see here who looks old,

883
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,000
get them to sign it,

884
00:45:30,020 --> 00:45:33,300
and probably you'll end up with a fully...

885
00:45:33,300 --> 00:45:36,080
With one of the treasures of time, Jack.

886
00:45:36,380 --> 00:45:36,700
Right.

887
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:39,960
Now, if we had copies of the Third Testament,

888
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:42,380
the Cyclopedia of Slack...

889
00:45:42,380 --> 00:45:44,100
Is there even one copy?

890
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:47,080
Oh, in my vault, there's 30 of them,

891
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,420
but...

892
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,420
Yes, it's all your vault.

893
00:45:49,740 --> 00:45:50,180
Yes.

894
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:53,280
That one, that was so popular

895
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:55,660
that it went out of print after the first printing.

896
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:58,620
Actually, what happened was the publisher went out of business.

897
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,340
My first book's out of print.

898
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:03,160
We're all going to go out of print, let's face it.

899
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:09,800
No, for we invested in Bob's great printing press in the sky.

900
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:12,780
Well, his great mimeograph.

901
00:46:13,060 --> 00:46:14,340
Well, his ditto.

902
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:15,820
Gestetner.

903
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,080
Yeah.

904
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:21,120
So, his carbon copy up in the sky, that's us.

905
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:23,940
That's the way he duplicates it.

906
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:26,180
And angels turn the crank even now.

907
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,300
Oh, yes.

908
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:32,200
So, yeah, we don't have to...

909
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:34,240
We get to choose when we die.

910
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:38,640
Unless we get in a big fight with a fellow subgenius on X-Day

911
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:41,720
over what loot from Earth to bring home.

912
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,040
Heaven was content to suffer violence.

913
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,060
Anyway, make sure...

914
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:50,840
Make sure that you don't leave without a spanking new copy of Revelation X,

915
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:52,900
the Bob Apocryphon.

916
00:46:53,140 --> 00:46:53,980
Yes, we have to.

917
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,760
Many people have never even cracked it open.

918
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:56,820
I got to say.

919
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:02,400
All the stuff about the Yetis, of Mutantus, the entire thing.

920
00:47:02,620 --> 00:47:06,620
And on top of that, there's only one copy of Book of the Subgenius here

921
00:47:06,620 --> 00:47:11,920
because isn't it interesting how giant corporations like Simon & Schuster,

922
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:15,740
one of the biggest publishers in the world, lose orders?

923
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,140
Well...

924
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:22,560
Much more frequently than drunk subgeniuses do.

925
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,120
It has been...

926
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:31,080
A lone drunk subgenius can fill orders better than a gigantic megacorporation?

927
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,600
Isn't that funny?

928
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,660
Too much top-down interference.

929
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:36,560
Yeah.

930
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:38,420
This has to be done instinctively.

931
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:44,420
And you know, that person wouldn't even admit that she just simply ignored,

932
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:46,060
lost my orders.

933
00:47:46,080 --> 00:47:48,080
Just giggled and tittered.

934
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:50,680
Oh, well, we'll send that out as soon as we can.

935
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:52,160
Huh.

936
00:47:52,340 --> 00:47:52,800
Huh.

937
00:47:52,980 --> 00:47:56,220
An ant so large that it fell off this table.

938
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:56,540
Really?

939
00:47:56,740 --> 00:47:57,200
It's clumsiness.

940
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:57,580
Yes.

941
00:47:58,680 --> 00:47:59,160
Let's...

942
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,360
Because I've got an ant farm here we could put it in.

943
00:48:02,660 --> 00:48:03,860
It's rather large.

944
00:48:04,080 --> 00:48:05,700
It'll be a pretty high ant.

945
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:07,640
Scrambling away across the...

946
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:08,400
We let him out.

947
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:09,160
...the floor now.

948
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:10,880
But we could smoke him, man.

949
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:12,100
Yeah, we could.

950
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:14,240
What would happen if you smoked a size...

951
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,160
A few sizeable, say, big red ants?

952
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:18,060
Anything?

953
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:21,120
The Hour of Slack, that's what happens.

954
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:28,720
And next up on Hour of Slack is the fabulous and luxuriously appointed Fat Man D.

955
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:32,620
Fat with a P-H, D with two E's.

956
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,240
Live and unplugged from X Day.

957
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:44,000
Hal, I did a show with a bunch of friends of Hal's, Hal West, in a fancy schmancy poetry place.

958
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:44,220
He's a great guy.

959
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:45,120
He's a great guy.

960
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:46,200
But they didn't like...

961
00:48:46,860 --> 00:48:49,060
They didn't like my patriotic number.

962
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:54,380
And I'm not sure if this was the part they didn't like or the fact that Hal had painted

963
00:48:54,380 --> 00:48:59,300
my boobs like eyeballs and lips on my belly and I came out tap dancing in an Uncle Sam

964
00:48:59,300 --> 00:48:59,660
hat.

965
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:06,640
But, you know, I thought that was poetry in motion and apparently that's not what they

966
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:09,280
thought and they never let them do any shows there ever again.

967
00:49:09,460 --> 00:49:13,840
So I really hope that Wisteria ain't, as my GPS likes to call it...

968
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:18,140
Doesn't do that to us.

969
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:24,480
Because then we'd have to hold the revival at my house and that'd be awesome for like

970
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:25,120
eight minutes.

971
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,280
Here we go.

972
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:32,700
This is how I pray for the good of the nation and for the record I am an incredible patriot.

973
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:38,920
This is called the sacred act of fat chick fist mastication and it is how I pray.

974
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:39,780
Go!

975
00:49:40,920 --> 00:49:40,920


976
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:41,420
Go!

977
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:42,320
Oh man.

978
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:42,420
Wow.

979
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:42,780
Man's statement.

980
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,720
Goddong jComment.

981
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,760
Uh huh.

982
00:49:48,740 --> 00:49:51,460
Oh uh huh.

983
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:53,120
Oh uh.

984
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,100
ост.

985
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:56,620
Kind gameplay.

986
00:49:56,620 --> 00:49:56,920
You say you feel equal.

987
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:57,840
Uh.

988
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,640
Ho whelwe wood Western understand theütth量

989
00:50:00,640 --> 00:50:03,800
Oh it's literally loud.

990
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:03,800


991
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:12,280
God philosopher.

992
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:20,760
Let's play with Bob's Ball!

993
00:51:26,560 --> 00:51:31,040
Praise Bob! Praise Bob! Praise Bob!

994
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:36,900
Oh, we've got a free pass here to the secret caverns.

995
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:40,620
Yeah, yeah, Princess, we and I are really hoping to go to this.

996
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:44,220
It's Cobbleskill, New York, secret caverns.

997
00:51:44,220 --> 00:51:45,240
And what's down there?

998
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:49,860
Whoa! That's why they don't want to tell us.

999
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:53,600
My main curiosity would be about the gift shop, I think.

1000
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:57,500
Well, Reverend Steve O'Deva works there.

1001
00:51:57,780 --> 00:51:59,160
Mm, yes.

1002
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:01,220
He lives in a cave.

1003
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:02,240
Cobbleskill, New York.

1004
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:03,240
That explains a lot.

1005
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,020
In a cave in the hills, he dwelt alone.

1006
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:09,700
What's down in there makes Old Sequa look like

1007
00:52:09,700 --> 00:52:10,600
a sweet little cave.

1008
00:52:10,620 --> 00:52:10,780
A little baby.

1009
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,800
What's down there makes Old Sequa look like a sweet little baby?

1010
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:17,760
Yes, just so, apparently.

1011
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,860
Some ancient horror of inner earth.

1012
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,560
That's almost as frightening as your speculation about

1013
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:30,600
where the beanstalk could go after it goes to giant land

1014
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:33,040
in the giant killer story.

1015
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:35,620
Well, we watched that movie, and at one point,

1016
00:52:35,640 --> 00:52:38,160
those of you who saw it may remember that

1017
00:52:38,160 --> 00:52:40,500
someone drops a magic bean,

1018
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,100
up in giant land.

1019
00:52:42,340 --> 00:52:45,600
You know, you reach giant land by climbing up a beanstalk from here.

1020
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:48,680
But once they're up there, through some blunder,

1021
00:52:48,760 --> 00:52:53,060
they drop a bean, and sure enough, a beanstalk starts growing in giant land.

1022
00:52:53,320 --> 00:52:56,700
Now, they didn't pursue this, but if a giant climbed it,

1023
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,860
would he come to an even larger place,

1024
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:04,060
where even more huge, uncouth, anthropophagous giants dwelled?

1025
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:09,540
You know, shrinking him down by comparison to a moderate size.

1026
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:10,600
But as the game goes on, it's a little bit more interesting.

1027
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:14,080
In the case, maybe the giants grabbed the beanstalks

1028
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:16,860
and bent them down to the earth so they could invade.

1029
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:21,400
And this intriguing possibility was not borne out.

1030
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,140
It would have been so easy to do.

1031
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:32,680
Oh, now that I remember, we did, it was explored on that radio show the other night.

1032
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:37,800
We mentioned it because we want the powers that be who are listening to consider it.

1033
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:38,940
Fee-fi-fo-fan.

1034
00:53:39,180 --> 00:53:40,540
I smell the blood of an evil.

1035
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:44,600
You speak of the Welles man name, we can be sure of it.

1036
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:52,660
You might wonder what happened to Fee-fee,

1037
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:53,240
Don't understand it, and that mean something about it.

1038
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,580
So I wonder, what did he go and do to protect the low-rank titan?

1039
00:53:58,900 --> 00:53:58,920
Nothing anything uncomfortable?

1040
00:53:58,920 --> 00:54:01,520
There, there you are.

1041
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:01,540
I told you, it's in the sl姐.

1042
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:02,100
So try to help us.

1043
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:02,900
Did you do it to protect him?

1044
00:54:02,980 --> 00:54:03,140
We did.

1045
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:04,200
Did he?

1046
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:09,280
No.

1047
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,240
And to open it, you know.

1048
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Well, it was only a movie.

1049
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,200
In the movies, giants can do stuff like that.

1050
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,600
In real life, giants, of course, obviously, as we know, have trouble with small bags of beans.

1051
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:26,880
They're clumsy, but they have got a bad press.

1052
00:54:27,620 --> 00:54:30,420
You know, humanity won against the giants.

1053
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,860
And so everything that we read about them is suspect.

1054
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:34,160
Who knows?

1055
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:35,000
They may have been better than us.

1056
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,760
History is always written by the winners.

1057
00:54:36,760 --> 00:54:41,000
Peking Man exterminated the giants in their area.

1058
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:45,860
Hey, that means we get to start on our history of planet Earth next week.

1059
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:51,920
Yes, we'll wipe the slate clean and begin with a whole new round of stories.

1060
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,200
Because history itself is too painful to be examined directly,

1061
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,360
but must be discreetly shrouded in legend to be bearable.

1062
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:05,380
Oh, I don't know.

1063
00:55:05,460 --> 00:55:05,960
I'm going to...

1064
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:06,600
As soon as...

1065
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:15,020
I get my MoM machine, I'm going to send a time camera back to get videos of things like the crucifixion,

1066
00:55:15,760 --> 00:55:16,320
quote unquote,

1067
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:19,880
which I have a feeling the camera will fly around going,

1068
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,560
well, there's a whole bunch of guys crucified out here.

1069
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:24,900
They're all the same.

1070
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:28,960
Well, on that day, they only had three to deal with.

1071
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:34,120
But since you are going to do it, it has therefore already happened,

1072
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,040
and therefore you're flying...

1073
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:41,120
And the whole project is probably the result of the weird weather that was reported at the time.

1074
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,340
You know, you would find out...

1075
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,860
The clouds, electric flashes, and lightning and so on,

1076
00:55:44,900 --> 00:55:48,820
which arose from a hitherto peaceful day.

1077
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:52,200
Oh, it's like the end of so many comic books and sci-fi movies.

1078
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:57,400
The time traveler finds out, as he's being nailed to a cross,

1079
00:55:58,340 --> 00:56:02,000
who the miracle worker Jesus really was.

1080
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:06,140
And it was trademark Gunderson,

1081
00:56:06,140 --> 00:56:08,360
and the Evolution Control Committee,

1082
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,840
live at X-Day.

1083
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,940
That song is a pop music footnote.

1084
00:56:22,440 --> 00:56:23,520
I didn't say stop.

1085
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:31,700
Okay, now it's time to use the Vinnie Masher 3000,

1086
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:33,600
which is what you can hear.

1087
00:56:34,140 --> 00:56:36,120
The Vinnie Masher 3000 is something that I've been using for a long time.

1088
00:56:36,120 --> 00:56:36,120


1089
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:40,380
I put together myself a hat from Nintendo Wii controllers,

1090
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:42,240
which are sitting there on the ground.

1091
00:56:42,740 --> 00:56:45,260
I'm holding pens that do infrared light.

1092
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:50,160
Actually, the green is for you puny humans who can't see infrared light,

1093
00:56:50,260 --> 00:56:52,100
so you can actually see them doing something.

1094
00:56:52,400 --> 00:56:55,920
But there's another LED there that's infrared that the Wii notes get to see.

1095
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:02,840
And I've been assembling this screen for years,

1096
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:04,340
like almost a decade.

1097
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,120
It became like this.

1098
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:09,260
It was this dump site where I could put in all these samples that I had collected.

1099
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:12,640
And then when Ableton Live didn't crash,

1100
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:14,780
I just thought I'd see how far I could go.

1101
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:20,580
Right now, the set has about 800 or more different sound bits, samples, loops.

1102
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:23,280
I'm mashing up stuff from the original stuff.

1103
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:26,140
Nothing is pre-mashed.

1104
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:27,660
That's not a word.

1105
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:31,240
And let's see what comes out,

1106
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:33,760
because I don't think I'll get a chance to make a full set list.

1107
00:57:49,020 --> 00:57:49,760
It's webtoon.

1108
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:51,720
So, here's Justин Slatterny's Samurai,

1109
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:51,940
and I'm just gonna put another 2D material on his phone.

1110
00:57:51,940 --> 00:57:52,580
We solders have actually set up a few Ideal Keyboards since the first 기�nik,

1111
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:52,600
which I have been several times,

1112
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:52,660
and people probably chose those.

1113
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:52,660


1114
00:57:52,660 --> 00:57:52,660

1116
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,360
Well,

1117
00:57:59,360 --> 00:57:59,560
goddammit!

1118
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:00,700
That was great.

1119
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:02,580
Oh, a very bad measure.

1120
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:02,580


1121
00:58:02,580 --> 00:58:02,580
