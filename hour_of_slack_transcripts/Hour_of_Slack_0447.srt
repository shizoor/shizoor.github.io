1
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:03,980
I think we're in big trouble.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:13,100
And now, by request from Bay Ridge, Larry Underwood, and Baby, can you dig your man?

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,780
Well, Baby, can you?

4
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:21,040
I know you've got the hurt drop right there in your eyes, right?

5
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:24,700
But here I am, Baby, on my knees to apologize.

6
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:29,340
There's nothing I won't do for the two of us.

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,220
To make a stand.

8
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:38,140
Baby, can you dig your man?

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,200
You look like a man.

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:45,300
A few details about the operation.

11
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,620
The operation underway tonight, taking place in the pre-dawn darkness of the Persian Gulf and Baltic.

12
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,420
The subgenius.

13
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:55,300
Our house.

14
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:56,200
Watch.

15
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,240
Radio a lot.

16
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,160
Radio a lot.

17
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:07,980
Four Iraqi nuclear reactors have been crippled.

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,700
Sales are also up.

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,120
Merchants say it's not the lunatic train stocking up.

20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,000
It's a cross-section of men and women looking for protection.

21
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,360
In New York, this store used to keep gas masks on hand for props and movie sets.

22
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:27,060
The theater fueled the sale of 500 masks over the past couple of days.

23
00:01:28,380 --> 00:01:29,540
Bring out your guns!

24
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:33,040
Bring out your dead!

25
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,660
Want to know more about talking to your children about AIDS?

26
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,120
Send for a free information guide.

27
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,660
Call 1-800-342-AIDS.

28
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:49,100
Blue cabin, up in the hills. I'm going to try to wait this out.

29
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:50,480
...toward Haiti.

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:53,840
What he plans to do to force Haiti's brutal military to step down

31
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,260
and deal with Haitian refugees fleeing to America.

32
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,440
Should ducks in Dallas County be saved or killed

33
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,180
to stop the spread of a deadly plague?

34
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,160
The Dallas County...

35
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:02,860
We'll see this week.

36
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,320
Join us for the News 8 Update at 10.

37
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,480
Although city and government spokespersons vehemently deny it,

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,980
reliable sources continue to report to news radio

39
00:02:09,980 --> 00:02:12,940
that troops opened fire earlier today on unarmed pedestrians

40
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:15,580
attempting to flee New York by way of the Lincoln Tunnel.

41
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,700
As many as 60 persons may have been killed with hundreds wounded.

42
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,540
Although travel to some of the outer boroughs is still possible,

43
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,260
news radio advises you to stay off the streets.

44
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,420
...underway and that doesn't mean that people are breathing any evil.

45
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:29,760
...easier.

46
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,000
...cast mass sales are booming.

47
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:34,180
CNN headline news. This is...

48
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:36,620
And the great showdown has begun.

49
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:40,720
Quoting further here, the glorious sons of our nation.

50
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,380
And he said...

51
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:46,760
Sorry, he said he was addressing the glorious sons of our nation

52
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:50,120
and said the battle was one of justice against vice,

53
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,780
of the believers against the infidels.

54
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:56,380
Two hours, there are new reports of alerts in Saudi Arabia,

55
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,420
which is possibly undergoing a missile attack.

56
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:58,740
Sanders.

57
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,620
...like to David Goodenow at the...

58
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,720
...very busy update desk too, Chuck.

59
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,300
Hello there, this is Ray Flowers on Speak Your Peace.

60
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,380
I guess this morning there's only one topic of conversation.

61
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:15,060
You can call it the super flu or by its West Coast name, Captain Trips,

62
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,680
but it means the same thing either way.

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,800
There have been some horror stories about the army clamping down on everything.

64
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,940
The army?

65
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,780
Just be patient with me.

66
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:26,160
Remember, I'm running the show all by myself.

67
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,760
Everyone else called in sick.

68
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:32,420
The numbers are the same as always though, 555-TALK and 555-CHAT.

69
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,560
So let's go.

70
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,980
Hello there, this is Ray Flowers and it's time to Speak Your Peace.

71
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm calling from Portsmouth, Ray.

72
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,860
What's your name, Portsmouth?

73
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:41,740
Leonora...

74
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:48,340
Listen, Ray, I just want everyone to know that there are soldiers burning bodies across the state line in Kittery.

75
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,700
Also...

76
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,380
I had my gas mask on.

77
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,540
Journalists watching the missiles immediately put on their gas masks.

78
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:56,540
Again...

79
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:58,660
So many already found them and returned home.

80
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,060
...the Patriots rounded it overhead and intercepted the Scots,

81
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,760
which were aimed, we understand, at...

82
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:09,540
...in the Battle of Radios. We should probably also report that...

83
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,920
Well, in the People's Republic of China,

84
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:19,840
agitation continues to foment and burble up to the repressed psychic substratum of the Chinese people.

85
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,220
This just in on the teletype, Tibet has invaded China.

86
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:24,480
China.

87
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,260
Yes, the UN is debating.

88
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:31,620
The Dalai Lama, at the head of an international force of mercenaries,

89
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,520
has circled the capital of Beijing

90
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:39,640
and threatens to subdue the country by tomorrow afternoon at the latest.

91
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,660
The UN is deliberating over possible sanctions

92
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:48,540
that can force this terrible breaking down of the world's new order.

93
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,600
And we'll have the latest in the sports news in a moment,

94
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,800
and we'll be back on the stupid radio news.

95
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,200
This just in, in the fiercest engagement so far this year,

96
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,740
units of the 23rd Pacific Combat Group

97
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,080
inflicted severe losses of men and material

98
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,440
on Chinese aqua bandits in mid-ocean this morning.

99
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,760
Our own casualties are reported light.

100
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:13,800
However, Chairman Yong of China today

101
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,560
sent a personal message of congratulations

102
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,100
to the daring sailors of the blood-red banner Flotilla,

103
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:23,600
who yesterday inflicted great damage in men and material

104
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:26,200
on the imperialist aggressor,

105
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,120
claiming that their casualties were very light.

106
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,460
However, friends, just remember that lonely on the edge of space,

107
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,860
patrol pilot Eugene Flood and his co-pilot Bob Dobbs

108
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:46,080
keep watch and ward over the security of your homes and families

109
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,780
thanks to this radio station.

110
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,080
Weapons capability.

111
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:51,740
Capable of taking out from orbit

112
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:54,660
anything from a single boatload of saboteurs

113
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,720
to an entire megalopolis lie under their hands.

114
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,420
And you can, you can keep Bob up there in orbit

115
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:07,840
and off of your back porch by calling...

116
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,440
And they talk about peace.

117
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,280
They talk about peace and justice.

118
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,840
You see, it goes back to what I tell you before.

119
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,120
When I was, when I was in college,

120
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,520
during the late 60s and early 70s,

121
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:26,580
these people in the street that are yelling into the bottom,

122
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,300
into the bottom.

123
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,940
I said, are the babies part of America?

124
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,060
The babies are African-Americans.

125
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,820
There is a genocide, and George Bush is at the forefront of it.

126
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:39,620
And it is absolutely deplorable that he used Dr. Martin McKee's birthday

127
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,960
to start this war.

128
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,860
They can see it.

129
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,720
Now, right now, a message shortly after the vote for it began.

130
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,320
You want to stop the same?

131
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,080
Call U.S. President George Bush.

132
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,440
Bush, a hypocritical criminal.

133
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,060
Earlier, Saddam Hussein, or rather,

134
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:58,440
what appears to have been a recording of Saddam Hussein

135
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:01,080
was broadcast on this frequency.

136
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,300
If it quacks like a duck, if it walks like a duck,

137
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,200
and if the water runs off its back, it's a duck.

138
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,540
On the Pentagon, the AP's Thelma Labreck reports that the Iraqis have only seen the...

139
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,740
One enemy machine destroyed.

140
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,760
Enemy now discharging heavy black smoke in direction of...

141
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,940
This is Newark, New Jersey.

142
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,480
This is Newark, New Jersey.

143
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:26,300
Warning.

144
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,840
Poisonous black smoke pouring in from Jersey marshes.

145
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Reaches South Street.

146
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,120
Gas maps useless.

147
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,020
Earth's population moving to open spaces.

148
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,660
Automobiles use Route 7, 23, 24.

149
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:42,980
Avoid contested areas.

150
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:46,680
Smoke now spreading over Raymond Boulevard.

151
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,020
Thank you.

152
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:51,900
It's not...

153
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,280
Of course, that's never stopped the real patriots among us, has it?

154
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,840
You try to hang in there, Lenora.

155
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:56,860
I'm trying, Ray.

156
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,700
But have you ever smelled bodies on fire?

157
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,400
I can't say that I have.

158
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,860
It's awful, Ray. It's just...

159
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,260
You just try to hang in there, hon.

160
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,700
This is Ray Flowers. You're on the air, and it's time to speak your piece.

161
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,640
Ray, uh, first of all, I just want to tell you that I love your show, Ray.

162
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:18,420
Now known as...

163
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:18,980
What does that mean?

164
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,080
Operation Desert Storm.

165
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:24,220
All of them are hurling insults at Saudi Arabia and the United States.

166
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,880
There has been a series of militaristic songs and prayers.

167
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:34,180
And just a short while ago, the radio began broadcasting the chant,

168
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,300
Allah Akbar, God is great.

169
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:43,100
That is one of the war cries of the Muslims who fight the infidels.

170
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,420
And this just in.

171
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:49,920
The frenzied mobs in Tokyo last night burned the effigy of the emperor,

172
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,800
in protest against his intention to abdicate.

173
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,380
A spokesman declared that if he does resign his throne,

174
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,780
they will recognize Mr. Oyoshita,

175
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:03,560
head of one of the country's oldest noble families, as his successor,

176
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,500
and will refuse to cooperate with the new government.

177
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,240
Victims of the rioting are already being described as martyrs.

178
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:18,220
And that's post office box 140306 in Dallas, Texas.

179
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:20,080
752.

180
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,620
214.

181
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:21,000
It's Bob.

182
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,940
It's all that you've got to be.

183
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,700
To prove something.

184
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:25,360
To prove something.

185
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,020
To prove something.

186
00:09:26,340 --> 00:09:28,200
I'm gonna love you.

187
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,920
It's all that you've got to be.

188
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,400
That's all I am.

189
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:38,440
Additional funding for this look back at one of the most dramatic events in 20th century history

190
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,580
is provided by General Dynamics.

191
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,140
General Dynamics.

192
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,460
A strong company for a strong country.

193
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:49,840
You say you saw these?

194
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,840
FBI's gunning down unarmed civilians?

195
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,520
Open in the name of the United States government.

196
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:02,100
Tell you what, Portland, it looks like the Marines have landed.

197
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,060
They don't look too happy.

198
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,080
This is a joke.

199
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,520
Right? I mean, this has got to be a joke.

200
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:09,180
I don't think so, Fanny. I really don't think so.

201
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,340
Hi there, you're on the air.

202
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,840
Great, you all right?

203
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:14,640
Well, to tell you the truth, honey, it doesn't look real good for the kid right now.

204
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,180
Several soldiers have just broken into the studio.

205
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,080
They're fully armed and they're dressed in white.

206
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,380
In some kind of protective clothing.

207
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,780
They're wearing respirators on their faces.

208
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,280
Shut it down!

209
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,780
Hey, Bluto, you ever heard of a little number called Freedom of Speech?

210
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:30,820
Bill of Rights?

211
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,160
Any of that ring a bell?

212
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,840
Folks, I've just been ordered by my uninvited fascist guest to shut down.

213
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:37,960
And I've refused.

214
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,020
All right, get off!

215
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,060
Surprise, Dad.

216
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:46,160
President Bush told a television audience the world could wait no longer.

217
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,000
We are determined to knock out Saddam Hussein's nuclear...

218
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,040
...clear bomb potential.

219
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,120
Ours is much more advanced and we could go on and on and on.

220
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,160
But the Bible says some trust in chariots, some in horses.

221
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,300
The beginning is a very delicate time.

222
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,340
Peter, I am looking directly west from our hotel now.

223
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,280
And throughout the entire sky, there are flashes of light.

224
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,860
Something is definitely underway here.

225
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,540
Something is going on.

226
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,480
I must...

227
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:41,060
I must seize the power in the cylinder.

228
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,700
No, no, not the cylinder.

229
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,940
Don't open the cylinder.

230
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,780
I have it now.

231
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,360
If he uses the cylinder, we will escalate the war.

232
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,000
I have unscrewed the...

233
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,540
We are going up the war escalator.

234
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,380
At nine.

235
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,240
It's hard to read the ancient hieroglyphics on the top.

236
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,500
He's activating the thumbprint.

237
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:57,440
We lead them to...

238
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,360
The hieroglyphics.

239
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,460
It's not sure which way I should turn this, but I'll try to the left.

240
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,460
The planet Arrakis.

241
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,220
There we go.

242
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,680
On the planet Arrakis, yes.

243
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:08,040
My God.

244
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,960
Look over there.

245
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,500
It's the sandworms.

246
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,660
Hey, what are you doing?

247
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,980
Sorry, I hate to be the first one to tell you, but you got sandworms.

248
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,400
Oh, man.

249
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,540
Worst case I've ever seen.

250
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,400
Downwind, boy.

251
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,860
And so, becoming a social undesirable can warp your entire life.

252
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,140
With some, it's sandworms.

253
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:37,520
With others, it's personal uncleanness.

254
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:43,000
And thus begins the original one and only lives of genius Albert Slack

255
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:48,100
for a human memory of the ground war fought with sandworms.

256
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,060
You are about to experience...

257
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:52,420
Experience a full length of genius show.

258
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,520
In its stereophonic sound.

259
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:03,500
So relax, sit back, and enjoy our feature presentation.

260
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,060
Presented the way it was meant to be heard.

261
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,080
If your brain should knob up to the front of your head and explode in your eyeballs,

262
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,860
do not head it, for this is completely normal.

263
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,800
Long live the succotash suckers.

264
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:19,600
Death to the onion eaters.

265
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:23,980
Long live King Hussein, the almighty Mouton of this country.

266
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:25,860
Mouton?

267
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:32,700
To all intents and purposes, it was non-existent in this crucial phase of the war.

268
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,640
The waves of American warplanes have continued to bring great devastation.

269
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,920
Darkman! He's coming!

270
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,300
He's closer now!

271
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:43,160
The Darkman!

272
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:56,000
as we encounter Isaiah Laitha, the officer at whose posterior fiction letter,

273
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,020
the most presśliant andramosic hero,

274
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,940

00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:23,060

280
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:26,900
with a lance or a mace or a book of matches,

281
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:32,700
with thermite or acid, with your teeth or your nails or hypodermic

or a diadermic with a flamethrower or a kitchen carver

or a length of rope or a hammer or a belt or a chisel or a boot

284
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:46,900
or a bath of water or a modified domestic laser

285
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:50,060
or a quarterstaff or a broken bottle or a bucket of cement

286
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:54,160
or an ordinary door or window or a staircase or a pillow

287
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:58,480
or a cooking pan or a long hair or a sewing needle

288
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,680
or a splinter or a bottle of medicine.

289
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:06,480
You can give those humans a taste of their own medicine.

290
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,020
Hehehehe.

291
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,960
And he's been drinking so much caffeinated coffee lately.

292
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:25,900
Oh yeah!

293
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:28,340
Put it like this.

294
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:32,460
Some trust in F-15 jet fighters.

295
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,340
Some trust in aircraft carriers.

296
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Some trust in sophisticated surveillance like AWACS planes

297
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:43,460
and modern equipment.

298
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,880
But we will remain.

299
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,600
Remember the name of the Lord our God.

300
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:55,100
I thank God for sophisticated weapons that can protect our interests and our soldiers.

301
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:57,680
But that's not where my faith is.

302
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:00,440
My faith is in God.

303
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,800
Yes, dear friend.

304
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,660
Oh my God, I think we've got incoming planes.

305
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,860
What a turkey.

306
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,400
Our own technology can love that stuff.

307
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,780
Get them, boys!

308
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,820
We've got those turkey choppers.

309
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:18,480
Spacebleed kit!

310
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,720
That's right.

311
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:22,320
Okay, we made it.

312
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:26,640
Hey, I've got my APHE-EM10 rifle grenade handy.

313
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,820
What you need is your T-33 Scottox trainer now.

314
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,020
Nope.

315
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:31,320
The bombardment has started.

316
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,160
They're beginning with the artillery, right?

317
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,500
Work out with ferry and hydraulics.

318
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,980
I read all the ala.

319
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,260
These rounds are falling short at the moment, but as the range increases,

320
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:43,300
the hapless enemy is going to find itself

321
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,840
secured by salty dashes of high-heavy artillery.

322
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:46,860
Uh, heavy artillery.

323
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,840
Uh, for, uh, what?

324
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:52,000
Oh, it's high, high-he for the field artillery.

325
00:16:52,420 --> 00:16:54,940
...DOS, which gives the access user internet...

326
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,180
Live from Sandcastle Stadium in Baghdad,

327
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:02,360
it's time for Monday Night Hardball.

328
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Good evening, everybody. I'm Jim McVeigh.

329
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,980
And I'm Don McKay, welcoming you to

330
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:09,540
World In Your Face Monday Night Hardball.

331
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:11,700
Tonight, two teams locked in heated combat

332
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:13,980
for world domination are going head-to-head

333
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,800
as the Iraqi Jihad Joes under Coach Saddam

334
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,620
and Saddam Hussein take on the defending champions,

335
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,620
the Fighting Doughboys of the U.S. of A.

336
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:22,240
under head coach George Bush.

337
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,000
You know, Jim, this is going to be the big test of the season

338
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,780
for Bush here today, and it has been a long one.

339
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,560
He's had that problem with his son Neil

340
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:31,360
and the whole SNL-CIA story,

341
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,520
the read-my-lips tax debacle,

342
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:34,880
Chief Justice Souter...

343
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:37,220
Not to mention the Wimp Factor Syndrome, Don.

344
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,800
That's right, Jim. But as they say,

345
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,600
everybody loves a winner,

346
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:44,360
and there would be nothing better for Bush's image at home

347
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:46,780
than a big victory at Sandcastle Stadium.

348
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,220
Yes, the man known to his players as Mr. President

349
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,840
certainly has a lot to prove here,

350
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,200
and I must say, this looks like war.

351
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:57,200
I mean it, folks. There is so much pride here at stake

352
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:59,580
that somebody could really get hurt.

353
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,660
This is going to be smash-mouth warfare at its very best.

354
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,380
Folks, we'll be back to take a look at the Jihad Joes lineup

355
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:09,020
after these words from Budrow Beer.

356
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,120
Make mine a Budrow

357
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,920
The official beer

358
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:18,520
of the U.S. Army

359
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,240
Make mine a Budrow

360
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,020
I'll be there

361
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,900
with a can of Budrow

362
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,280
Fight to win

363
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,500
and win to fight

364
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,760
99 calories

365
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,820
taste just right

366
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,880
if you get back home

367
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,240
Have a Budrow

368
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,140
on me

369
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,800
Budrow Beer, the official beer of the U.S. Army.

370
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,500
And proud sponsor of Monday Night Hardball.

371
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,000
If you get back home, have a Budrow on me.

372
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:55,600
We're back live at Sandcastle Stadium in Baghdad here

373
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,320
where this long-awaited matchup is about to get underway.

374
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:01,440
Coach Bush's Fighting Doughboys have elected to kick off,

375
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,260
so let's take a look at Coach Hussain's defensive line.

376
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:07,100
Well, Jim, as you know, the Iraqi Jihad Joes

377
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,320
coming to this game is a bit of a wild card.

378
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,260
You know, they bullied their way to the top of the Middle Eastern Conference,

379
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:15,840
leaving a trail of blood and tears behind them.

380
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,600
They're dangerous, they're unpredictable,

381
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:21,140
and Coach Hussain has literally whipped these boys

382
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,060
into a fever pitch for this game.

383
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:26,200
So, all willing, they're sure to have a few surprises

384
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,600
lined up for us here today.

385
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:30,320
Not to mention the press he's been getting the past few months.

386
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:32,800
Is he going to use the bomb? Isn't he going to use the bomb?

387
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,120
Does he even have a bomb?

388
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:37,060
I don't know if I've ever witnessed a game with such preliminary

389
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,500
speculation and uncertainty.

390
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:42,240
Well, this isn't coming.

391
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,960
It's called the Game of the Millennium for Nothing, Jim.

392
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,820
Oh, excuse me. That's right. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen.

393
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:49,140
Right now, let's go down on the battlefield

394
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,880
for an up close and personal with Rashida Rashad Rashad.

395
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,660
Hi, guys. This is Rashida Rashad Rashad

396
00:19:56,660 --> 00:20:01,060
on the field with a fellow that, well, just being able to introduce him

397
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,920
makes me proud to be in this business.

398
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,280
Drafted right out of high school,

399
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:10,000
this young phenom has literally captured the hearts of the entire USA.

400
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,040
Jimmy Hoghead Jackson.

401
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,680
Hoghead, what do you have to say for yourself?

402
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,180
Well, I'd just like to say hi to my mom and my girlfriend.

403
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:20,120
And listen, all you folks at home, don't worry.

404
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:22,280
We're going to be kicking some Iraqi butt all over the stadium.

405
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,260
That's the spirit, Hoghead.

406
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,220
So what...

407
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,100
What do you...

408
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,100
You all right, man?

409
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:30,260
Here. Want some Frog Aid?

410
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,040
Thanks.

411
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,660
Frog Aid, official thirst quench beverage of Monday Night Hardball.

412
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,740
So what do you think it's going to be like out there, Hoghead?

413
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,720
Well, they've had us on the virtual reality simulator

414
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:45,340
for quite a few weeks now,

415
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,840
so I guess it'll be like a big video game without the quarters.

416
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:50,860
That's...

417
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,820
That's a pretty good analogy, Hoghead.

418
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:54,880
What?

419
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,360
Well, listen, I'd just like to say that Mr. President,

420
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,680
he's been doing a great job back at home,

421
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,960
and we're all behind him 101%.

422
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:07,060
And I'd just like to thank God for the opportunity

423
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:10,280
and to tell Betty to keep it warm, and I'll be home soon.

424
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:15,160
I'm sure she'll have a nice cold bud-row waiting for you when you get home.

425
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:16,480
That too, ma'am.

426
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,840
Back to you, Don.

427
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,080
Oh, sorry, folks. Gee, I don't know what this is.

428
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,020
Must be something in them mic cables here.

429
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:25,600
Or the water.

430
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,060
By the way, Don,

431
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,660
Jimmy Hoghead Jackson was voted

432
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:34,880
Zao Chemical Offensive Player of the Game.

433
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,160
Zao Chemical, maker of those new biodegradable body bags,

434
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,020
will hopefully be seeing an action soon.

435
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,920
Remember, when you need it now, it's Zao.

436
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,980
Oh, my throat.

437
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,680
Well, let's take a look at the strategies we might be seeing

438
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:50,460
throughout today's little skirmish.

439
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:53,480
George Bush, the beleaguered coach of the Fighting Doughboys,

440
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,240
is a man who cannot afford to back down.

441
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,660
He certainly can't, Don.

442
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:01,040
The team itself has had its share of problems these past few years.

443
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,580
They're still the dominant force to be reckoned with

444
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,880
in the Western Hemisphere Division,

445
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:09,000
but more and more of their victories have been clouded by scandal and intrigue.

446
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,580
So...

447
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:11,920
if there ever was a time to...

448
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:15,360
George Bush and the Doughboys really need to pull one out

449
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,900
for the record books here to...

450
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:20,000
But let's look at Coach Hussain.

451
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,180
Now, here's a guy who's a real animal.

452
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:24,160
I mean, you almost have to respect the guy.

453
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,680
What other coach would have the moxie to come right out and say,

454
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,880
OK, come at me, hit me with your worst.

455
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,340
Not only will I hit you right back,

456
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,580
but my first strike will be at a team in a whole separate conference.

457
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:37,700
Uh-huh.

458
00:22:38,180 --> 00:22:39,560
You're talking about the Israeli War.

459
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:40,520
Well, he's in a team ofienenewandering Jews, right?

460
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:41,740
Exactly, Don.

461
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,860
You don't think he'll do whatever it takes to...

462
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:45,040
win ugly?

463
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,660
Just look at how utterly ruthless he's been

464
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,540
when it comes to making cuts on his own.

465
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:53,400
He's definitely a worthy opponent.

466
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,260
Hey, with all that talk of us...

467
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,860
It's the secret!

468
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,060
It's the secret weapon!

469
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:19,700
Uh, yes, uh, Monday Night Hardball, there, dear friends, by, who is that by?

470
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,600
World In Your Face.

471
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:25,880
Yes, a comedy group out of San Francisco.

472
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:28,500
World In Your Face and, uh, oh.

473
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:36,360
Uh, the conspiracy's been celebrating the D-Day orgy this week,

474
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:41,700
so we thought we'd shake the moths off of the Gulf War, you know.

475
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:47,080
You remember that it was, uh, I know it's kind of old hat.

476
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:53,320
It's just another old miniseries now, like Shogun or something.

477
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,760
But, uh, you know, what the heck.

478
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:03,940
It could happen again and again and again and again.

479
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:05,780
And by the way, before I forget,

480
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:11,320
this is, uh, Ron Slabe in the background,

481
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,660
recorded at the Sonic Disturbance Festival.

482
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,800
Probably in Cleveland.

483
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:25,040
Yeah, the collage that we've been listening to,

484
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,180
and, uh, more of which will be coming up,

485
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:34,420
uh, of course from old Hour of Slack collages of, uh, war stuff,

486
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:36,340
plus the two books.

487
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:37,240
Neck News.

488
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:42,460
Material from Orson Welles and G.E.

489
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:47,560
A lot of KPFA there with Dr. Howell.

490
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,640
The KPFA Subgenius Show with Dr. Howell

491
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,520
and Father Joe Mama with Buzzing Evidence.

492
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:57,880
And probably talking in ones coming up.

493
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,200
There's some material taken here from a video

494
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,360
called, uh, Iraqi Campaign.

495
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,820
The next.

496
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:06,760
Genocide.

497
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,660
By, I think the guy's name is Pete Pateras.

498
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:14,520
It was, uh, on a videotape that Puzzling Evidence sent me.

499
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:18,660
And had some wonderful little juxtapositions,

500
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,800
which is, uh, what we like to do,

501
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:24,420
uh, with all that mess.

502
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,920
The Gulf War.

503
00:25:27,420 --> 00:25:30,280
Operation Desert Storm.

504
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:35,520
Yeah, old past history.

505
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:36,340
Except for the war.

506
00:25:36,340 --> 00:25:39,400
Except for those guys that are missing body parts

507
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,620
and cellular cohesion.

508
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,280
Uh, this is my confession, friends.

509
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,600
Every time I think about that, uh, quote, war, unquote,

510
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:53,320
I am abashed.

511
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,960
Uh, yes, uh, embarrassed.

512
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:01,080
Because as my wife reminded me, I was the one who wanted to put

513
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:04,280
an American flag on my car antenna.

514
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,320
Oh, I was the one who wanted to put an American flag on my car antenna.

515
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:06,320


516
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:07,400
I was pulled in, friends.

517
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,380
I was a sucker.

518
00:26:08,520 --> 00:26:09,340
I'll admit it.

519
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:12,420
I was a flag waving American during that time.

520
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:19,380
I felt like there must be something fishy about it, but I was so concerned about people

521
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:25,640
getting killed and, uh, cause I try to be tied in to the hideous fitful pulse of our

522
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:28,040
nation's waves of normals.

523
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,840
I fell for the line.

524
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:34,340
I almost halfway believed that the news media wasn't totally controlled.

525
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,320
And because I was so concerned about the media, I was so concerned about the media.

526
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:36,320


527
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:44,500
And because of that stupid, unforgivable naivety, I actually thought that there was some good

528
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,140
reason for the whole mess.

529
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:46,700
God.

530
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:52,460
Uh, hey, what a, a human I was.

531
00:26:52,740 --> 00:27:00,560
And I am, believe me, friends, I am duly alarmed at myself for, uh, having been such a dupe

532
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:06,320
of the lynch mob fever that does sweep humanity, our good friend, away.

533
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,320


534
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,320


535
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,320


536
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,320


537
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:08,140
Uh, humanity every now and then.

538
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:16,240
Cause as much as I try to stay at one remove, you see, from the human race, I, I can't help

539
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,340
but be part of it.

540
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,160
To monitor it, if nothing else.

541
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:23,660
To even become emotionally involved in it.

542
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:31,200
To, to even, yes, it's true, even of Reverend Ivan Stank, to trust that the, the mass media

543
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,540
wasn't lying in every detail.

544
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,160
Every tiny detail.

545
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,740
Out of every pore.

546
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:45,400
The false front of the conspiracy, friends, profit first and the end justifies the means.

547
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,140
Well, they had to die.

548
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,620
They had to die.

549
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:53,720
They might have interfered with our plans.

550
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,880
It was for their own good.

551
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,000
It was for a good cause.

552
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:05,540
It's not our fault that they got in the way of our business practices.

553
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,140
Uh.

554
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:08,860
Yeah.

555
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:11,700
Yeah, I gotta confess.

556
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:19,840
Cause I've realized what a bandwagon jumper I can be given enough stirrings of the collective

557
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,520
unconscious.

558
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:28,900
And, you know, even though I'm a, a, a professional anti-establishment rabble rouser, I'm no more

559
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:36,120
immune to the waves of blood, lust, and righteous fervor erupting from the national media.

560
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,120


561
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:36,140
media.

562
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:36,460
I'm more immune to the

563
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:40,740
sub-conscience than his old Bubba pumping gas down there at the Exxon station.

564
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,060
And that makes me sick.

565
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,520
Makes me realize what a deluded hypocrite I can be.

566
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:49,780
I'm not being one right now, of course.

567
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,700
But you know what I mean, right?

568
00:28:52,700 --> 00:29:00,960
It's a hideous truth that the most, even the most ornery hater of the conspiracy can be

569
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:06,120
roped in by a smooth enough line combined with a real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real,

570
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:12,000
relentless enough media tease and hope and by gobs they did that war up right.

571
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,260
Media-wise, it was definitely not another Vietnam.

572
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,580
They learned their lesson.

573
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:27,720
GE, the owners of NBC, realized that the war would go over much better as an arms commercial

574
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:29,280
than as a body count.

575
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:32,180
And it was, it was, it was more like the Super Bowl.

576
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,120
It was beautifully covered visually.

577
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:36,100
And it was a great show.

578
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:36,100


579
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:45,860
And think how many young folks who were anti-war liberal types gave the most of their talents

580
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,640
working for CNN, making that war look sweet as a Coke commercial.

581
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,660
Good evening.

582
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,200
The United States of America is at war.

583
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:02,300
We missed!

584
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,420
We missed!

585
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:05,260
We missed!

586
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,720
It was about time, last I found out you didn't.

587
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:07,720


588
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:07,720


589
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:07,720


590
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:07,720


591
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:07,720


592
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:07,720


593
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:13,100
That wraps up our pregame so reminder, coming up at halftime Peter Jennings and ABC News

594
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:17,960
with a full report.

595
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:21,520
This is World News Tonight with Peter Jennings.

596
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,860
brought to you by preparation.

597
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,640
It starts with itch and irritation.

598
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,200
And then.

599
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:36,120
Yes.

600
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,900
back as to the troops, and he said,

601
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:40,520
Forget your sounds of violence.

602
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,160
Bring forth peace.

603
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:44,660
We no longer want war.

604
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,240
We want peace.

605
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,680
I am convinced that the chimpanzees

606
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,620
and orangutans can exist

607
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:51,960
in peace.

608
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:53,980
And as he spoke,

609
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,340
silence pervaded the battlefield.

610
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,460
The crickets welled up

611
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,400
with almighty peaceful ringing

612
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,140
of songs. Those

613
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,460
rotten cricket no

614
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,080
goodniks. And again

615
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,980
the Middle East became the spawning

616
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,040
crown of the philosopher king,

617
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:12,120
the messiah, the

618
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,100
man-king. He will be known

619
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,860
as the king of

620
00:31:15,860 --> 00:31:18,040
Arrakis. There, there, my

621
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:19,820
dear son. Mohabib.

622
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,120
Have you ever stopped to think just

623
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:23,540
how much Iraq resenders

624
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:26,460
do? King Hussein,

625
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:27,560
Mohabib,

626
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:30,160
they're both messiahs. The evil

627
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:32,220
Baron Harkonnen and his Republican

628
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,020
guards. And don't forget,

629
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,660
get Sting, alias

630
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,700
Bushmaster.

631
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,000
Not to reason why,

632
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,620
there's but to do and die.

633
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,860
Okay, folks, it's time for

634
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:44,080
war.

635
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,820
It's going

636
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,360
to be fun.

637
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:53,820
The following is a

638
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:55,600
special presentation of ABC

639
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,240
Sports.

640
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,800
We are

641
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,040
going to win.

642
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,840
Nothing like Vietnam.

643
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,820
Wow. Thought it'd be like Lawrence of Arabia

644
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:06,880
in the movies. Just one big sand dune.

645
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,760
You know, I'd hate to see a man as rich

646
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,760
and powerful as you take off on some scheme

647
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,460
that'd get our country into a lot of trouble.

648
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,260
Oh, no way. Uh-uh.

649
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,700
As much as I want to shut down the Arabs,

650
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,860
I'd never do anything to hurt my

651
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,200
country.

652
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:28,160
Ladies and gentlemen,

653
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:30,560
our corporate handbook.

654
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,500
I'm the king.

655
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:47,020
King of the Владивор diaphragm,

656
00:32:47,020 --> 00:32:49,220
and today,

657
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:49,600
we throw three

658
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,260
Erdogan flyers in going through our

659
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:51,860
schools.

660
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,480
The thing I love the most

661
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:53,640
about the collapse of

662
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:53,760
theriers is the three

663
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,200
chains of force inside

664
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:54,980
our hands.

665
00:32:55,320 --> 00:32:56,020
Now,

666
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:56,320
we'd like,

667
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:56,920
well,

668
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,140
Emily's

669
00:32:59,140 --> 00:32:59,160
assistant question,

670
00:32:59,160 --> 00:32:59,220
however,

671
00:32:59,220 --> 00:32:59,220


672
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:02,820
going to win our box offer in three,

673
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:16,980
Oh, my God.

674
00:33:38,240 --> 00:33:43,900
Oh, my God.

675
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:29,600
Oh, my God.

676
00:34:36,960 --> 00:35:01,780
Oh, my God.

677
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:13,000
Oh, my God.

678
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:59,640
Oh, my God.

679
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:28,340
Oh, my God.

680
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:42,280
Oh, my God.

681
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:03,420
Oh, my God.

682
00:37:33,060 --> 00:37:34,040
Oh, my God.

683
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,400
Oh, yes.

684
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,800
Oh, my God.

685
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:06,500
Oh, my God.

686
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:36,300
Oh, my God.

687
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:03,700
Don't give up.

688
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:08,940
Yep, he didn't say what not to give up, so I'll tell you what I'm not giving up.

689
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,140
I'm not giving up drugs.

690
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:12,060
I'm not giving up surfing.

691
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:17,500
I'm not giving up coming down to this station and being a bad noise in your ear.

692
00:39:18,300 --> 00:39:23,740
And I'm also not giving up the hope that our boys over there in Malaysia

693
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,660
will be able to assassinate Bob for once and for all

694
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:30,800
and get rid of his kind before you become one of him.

695
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:34,120
And I'm afraid we'll not be able to take calls tonight.

696
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:40,180
In a wartime situation such as this, we just don't care what you have to say.

697
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:44,120
You can call the station all you want, and we aren't going to listen.

698
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:48,420
It's time you got to realize that it's people like me

699
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:51,140
are going to have to come up with the answers for you

700
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,540
and that you're just going to have to live with our decisions.

701
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,140
We're taking a lot of notes here tonight,

702
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:00,720
so we're going to be thinking about what you're thinking about.

703
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,780
And we know what you're thinking, believe me.

704
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:12,820
Tonight's show, unlike normally, we do have a sponsor tonight,

705
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:15,220
and we'll be revealing that sponsor.

706
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:22,620
Thanks, thanks, out here in the horrid, horrid future.

707
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,740
But like I said before, please don't give up.

708
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,820
Don't give up drugs.

709
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,380
Don't give up going crazy.

710
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:30,640
And don't give up the hope that someday our nation,

711
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,400
our people, will be run by people like me.

712
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:38,000
Gary Shepard, do you hear us in Baghdad?

713
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:40,720
Gary Shepard, can you hear us?

714
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,920
The liberation of Kuwait has begun.

715
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:50,540
You are watching CBS News continuing coverage of Showdown in the Gulf.

716
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:55,180
Come on, guys. Over here. This way.

717
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:00,640
They're shooting.

718
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:02,020
They're shooting at us. Come on. Here we are.

719
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,260
It's going to be a war soon.

720
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:08,480
Hey, I didn't sign up for this.

721
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:09,400
What happened?

722
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,340
How long has it been like this?

723
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,260
It was peaceful when I left for Arizona.

724
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,260
Oh, the war.

725
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,020
Oh, the war.

726
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:21,260
Who is that?

727
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:24,240
Oh, look at that guy over there.

728
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,280
He really bought it.

729
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:27,820
Yeah, that Andy bar I wanted.

730
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,480
He bought it.

731
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:28,960
Oh, yeah.

732
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,040
Good.

733
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,300
He doesn't melt in his hands in Operation Desert Delcon Shield.

734
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:38,640
Ah, boy.

735
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:45,860
Yes, a prophylaxis against bad people is necessary in this day and age.

736
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,120
Come, my friends.

737
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,920
It is not too late to seek a newer world.

738
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,200
Push off.

739
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,260
And sitting well in order, smite the sounding furrows.

740
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,620
Yes, indeed.

741
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:58,480
Get it.

742
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,700
Take the wheel.

743
00:41:59,700 --> 00:42:00,180
Take the wheel.

744
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:00,720
Take the wheel.

745
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:00,780


746
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:00,780


747
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:00,780


748
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:00,780


749
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:00,780


750
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:00,780


751
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:00,780


752
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:00,780


753
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,120
The furrows aren't going to bother our brave boys and gals

754
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:10,360
out in the hellish inferno of the Saudi Arabian whatever it be.

755
00:42:10,520 --> 00:42:11,920
Bacon out there in the sand.

756
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,220
Even Aunt Jessie and Mama will come.

757
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,340
Jessie and Mama are out there fighting side by side.

758
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:23,460
Dressed in tacky khaki.

759
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:30,280
Overflown with a camouflage pattern by Mr. Gillis,

760
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:30,780
a polyglot.

761
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:30,920
Rolling back to the

762
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:30,920


763
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:30,920


764
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:30,920


765
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:30,920


766
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,420
We alike have imbued with Oregon wood,

767
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,160
ublic,

768
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:37,880
It's simply stunning,

769
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,020
and my ensemble is adorable.

770
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:43,620
And now they're playing some music for us.

771
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:17,060
guitar solo

772
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:07,860
guitar solo

773
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,820
guitar solo

774
00:45:05,060 --> 00:45:07,860
guitar solo

775
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:37,860
guitar solo

776
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,020
guitar solo

777
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:07,740
Aren't you glad we got smart phones

778
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:10,600
It's a good thing that our bombs are clever

779
00:46:10,600 --> 00:46:13,280
It's a shame that our kids are dumb

780
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,540
But our bombs are smart

781
00:46:14,540 --> 00:46:16,340
What a lucky thing now

782
00:46:16,340 --> 00:46:18,900
Don't you know it's a feel-good show

783
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,880
And it's suitable for the whole darn family

784
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:24,300
Come on out, everybody shout

785
00:46:24,300 --> 00:46:27,580
Give a big salute to our internet team

786
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:31,280
Don't you know this is better than any video friend

787
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:32,820
It's an action movie

788
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:35,420
Here we go, watch the bad guys

789
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:36,600
Get their butts kicked

790
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:37,720
Let them make some noise

791
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:38,700
Makes me feel good

792
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:40,680
Don't you know it's Nintendo

793
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:44,020
Really gets the blood flowing through my veins

794
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,840
Now, don't you know it's a feel-good show

795
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,180
Electronic mess

796
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,720
It's a video, video

797
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:52,440
There they go now

798
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:55,220
They're the one, my friends

799
00:46:55,220 --> 00:46:57,880
There they go now

800
00:46:57,880 --> 00:47:00,640
Marching off to war again

801
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:03,640
With their bright flags

802
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,380
Waving in the wind

803
00:47:06,380 --> 00:47:07,060
Yeah

804
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:09,060
There they go now

805
00:47:09,640 --> 00:47:11,840
Marching off to war again

806
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:14,360
Smiling proudly

807
00:47:15,480 --> 00:47:17,620
There they go now

808
00:47:18,760 --> 00:47:20,400
There go all my friends

809
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,040
There they go now

810
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,780
Marching off to war again

811
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:28,720
With their bright flags

812
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,460
Waving in the wind

813
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:34,200
There they go now

814
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,920
Marching off to war again

815
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:39,280
Smiling proudly

816
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,980
With their heads in the clouds

817
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,820
See them smiling now

818
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,020
Marching on and on

819
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:50,460
Yeah

820
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,180
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

821
00:47:54,180 --> 00:47:57,740
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

822
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:02,320
There they go now

823
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:05,080
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

824
00:48:05,080 --> 00:48:07,620
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

825
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:13,440
There they go now

826
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:24,420
There they go now

827
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:27,360
There go all my friends

828
00:48:27,960 --> 00:48:30,000
There they go now

829
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:32,760
Marching off to war again

830
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:07,220
There they go now

831
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:22,080
There they go now

832
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:41,800
We're seeing the Emperor Saddam in the Dune series,

833
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,820
but here we have Saddam Hussein.

834
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:46,800
The resemblance is uncanny.

835
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:48,080
There they fought for spice.

836
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:49,320
Here we fight for oil.

837
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,120
Yes, duel in the desert, day 664.

838
00:49:54,240 --> 00:49:56,580
It was when we realized the crickets were chirping

839
00:49:56,580 --> 00:50:00,560
that we knew there was water deep underneath the crust of Arrakis.

840
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,860
And covered with a milk chocolate shell,

841
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:06,840
which makes it purely delicious.

842
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:12,680
Once we realized that deep in the underbelly of Arrakis...

843
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:14,920
Deep in the belly of Babylon, man.

844
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,320
...that the water surged and purged,

845
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:20,720
we knew that there was a dramatic possibility.

846
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:23,200
We're talking about some serious,

847
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:26,680
possible problems here in this Arrakian war.

848
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:30,380
A sudden racking cough overcame me and respiratory troubles.

849
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:31,240
The free man...

850
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:34,980
Is that this one?

851
00:50:35,540 --> 00:50:36,560
I think it's that.

852
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:37,600
...rumor has it that they were there,

853
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:38,780
and they were there.

854
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:40,080
I think they fired in their make-car rounds.

855
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,840
Yeah, they're wearing those free man suits on the base.

856
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:43,140
It smells like vegetables.

857
00:50:43,260 --> 00:50:44,400
If it tastes like vegetables, they felt...

858
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,600
They keep that water stored, and they never go pee.

859
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,620
There it comes, the green turnip,

860
00:50:48,620 --> 00:50:50,820
landing at Burleson Air Force Base.

861
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:54,460
Strategic lift is the true force multiplier at these bases.

862
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,180
Yes, the United States faces both a dangerous challenge

863
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,440
and a significant opportunity...

864
00:50:59,440 --> 00:50:59,780
Both am.

865
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:03,660
...in the area of military mobilization and deployer potential.

866
00:51:04,060 --> 00:51:04,820
We're talking about...

867
00:51:04,820 --> 00:51:07,000
...giving increasing unpredictable requirements...

868
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:07,480
...to deploy...

869
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,120
...Subgenius Foundation...

870
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:10,860
...Subgenius Foundation, or the Pacific Ocean...

871
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:11,420
...at short notice.

872
00:51:11,460 --> 00:51:12,180
...HVST air defense systems.

873
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,160
...the need to increase...

874
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:13,660
...you call it a dive back.

875
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:15,180
...strategic and practical air lift...

876
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:16,880
...is unbecoming.

877
00:51:17,020 --> 00:51:17,800
...the rate of thawing angle...

878
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:18,480
...traditionally, strategic lift...

879
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:22,280
...has been given a low priority by the Navy and Air Force teams...

880
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,820
...the United States...

881
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,340
...the Capitol...

882
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,040
That scene...

883
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,260
...says a lot about America.

884
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:40,080
...a lot about who we are.

885
00:51:40,860 --> 00:51:41,880
...a lot about who we are.

886
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:43,560
Americans are a caring people.

887
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:45,300
We are a good people.

888
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:46,800
A generous people.

889
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:47,940
A little people.

890
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,800
A silly people.

891
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,560
Greedy, barbarous, and cruel.

892
00:51:54,780 --> 00:51:56,640
We are Americans.

893
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,580
And we're proud of you...

894
00:51:59,580 --> 00:52:01,900
...for your courage to stand tall.

895
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,360
Yes, we're proud of you.

896
00:52:04,680 --> 00:52:07,280
You gave your very all...

897
00:52:07,280 --> 00:52:10,140
...you fought the desert storm...

898
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,020
...in the air, on land, and sea...

899
00:52:13,020 --> 00:52:14,980
...to keep America free.

900
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:19,520
Welcome to freedom...

901
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,900
...and the President's New World Order...

902
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:22,600
...tonight.

903
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,620
You will believe.

904
00:52:26,040 --> 00:52:27,060
We believe.

905
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:28,180
We believe.

906
00:52:28,300 --> 00:52:28,920
We believe.

907
00:52:29,060 --> 00:52:29,820
We believe.

908
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:30,500
We believe.

909
00:52:30,760 --> 00:52:31,680
We believe.

910
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:32,700
We believe.

911
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:34,420
You will believe.

912
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:37,560
We will only believe.

913
00:52:37,840 --> 00:53:03,480
So manyißt deze

914
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,220
and get on with the business of living.

915
00:53:06,420 --> 00:53:09,320
But scientists discovered that by covering the stubs

916
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,040
with some strange new protoplasm,

917
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:14,260
they were able to resurrect the stubs

918
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:16,160
into a new form of life that had been...

919
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,660
Boy, my stub resurrects just hearing about it.

920
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:22,160
It wasn't enough just to simply bring them back to life.

921
00:53:22,420 --> 00:53:23,800
These stubs had a mission.

922
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:25,160
Millions of years ago,

923
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:29,540
because these stubs were determined to win the war,

924
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:32,840
so these stubs were not content to be buried.

925
00:53:33,620 --> 00:53:34,920
They wanted revenge.

926
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,280
Here comes another one!

927
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:41,480
What scientists didn't count on, however,

928
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:43,800
was the difficulty in controlling these stubs

929
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,680
once they were resurrected from the grave.

930
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:48,060
We're having electrical interference down here,

931
00:53:48,100 --> 00:53:48,620
ladies and gentlemen.

932
00:53:48,620 --> 00:53:49,560
It's part of the barrage.

933
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,280
We hope we're going to be able to continue

934
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,320
bringing our program to you, but sit tight.

935
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:55,500
Hey, what'll it be, guys?

936
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:56,420
I'll have a coffee, please.

937
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,740
Coffee for me, too, Joey.

938
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:59,660
Thank you. Coffee's great.

939
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:01,560
I got that war anxiety.

940
00:54:01,860 --> 00:54:03,420
My nerves, I'm a bundler.

941
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:05,700
Nerves, it's like it's coming at you from all sides.

942
00:54:05,820 --> 00:54:07,680
You try to forget it, and you turn on the TV,

943
00:54:07,780 --> 00:54:10,940
there's a story, all the scuds, and Tel Aviv, and blood,

944
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,240
and it's going to get bad.

945
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,480
You look like a bundler of nerves.

946
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:14,740
Maybe you could use something to eat.

947
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:16,520
Look, they got nice Danish over there.

948
00:54:16,580 --> 00:54:18,280
Yeah, I wouldn't touch those Danishes.

949
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:19,640
They're as hard as a rock.

950
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:20,220
Maybe.

951
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:20,940
A rock.

952
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,140
A rock.

953
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:22,840
A rock.

954
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:24,000
Ah, there it is.

955
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:25,140
Again, a rock.

956
00:54:25,220 --> 00:54:25,880
I'm scared.

957
00:54:25,940 --> 00:54:27,580
There's bombs going off.

958
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,340
Maybe a nice bowl of cereal.

959
00:54:29,540 --> 00:54:30,180
Settle your nerves.

960
00:54:30,180 --> 00:54:30,900
A bowl of cereal.

961
00:54:31,140 --> 00:54:33,340
Well, it's a little late in the day for cereal,

962
00:54:33,480 --> 00:54:34,000
cereal, cereal.

963
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,520
That's the country that borders the north of Israel.

964
00:54:37,600 --> 00:54:38,200
Hey, hey, hey, calm down.

965
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,340
You're going crazy here.

966
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:39,420
They're going to get sucked into this war

967
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:41,300
as soon as the Arab coalition goes under.

968
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:41,720
Let's change the subject.

969
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:42,060
Ba-dum!

970
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:43,340
Change the subject, okay?

971
00:54:43,340 --> 00:54:44,220
All right, all right, all right.

972
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:45,560
Your birthday's coming up, right?

973
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:45,960
My birthday.

974
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:46,960
That's a happy thing, you know.

975
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:47,920
That's a happy thing.

976
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:50,300
Maybe you want a nice watch like the one I got here.

977
00:54:50,360 --> 00:54:51,120
Look at this nice Rolex.

978
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:52,280
Hey, yeah, it is a nice watch.

979
00:54:52,360 --> 00:54:54,420
Is that a fake Rolex, or is that real?

980
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:54,640
No, it's real.

981
00:54:54,980 --> 00:54:55,500
It's real.

982
00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:56,440
It's real.

983
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:58,920
Israel again with the Israel.

984
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:00,560
In Tel Aviv, those poor people,

985
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,120
they got the scuds dropped on them.

986
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:03,980
They're going to snap those people,

987
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:05,840
and I'm not going to blame them when they do.

988
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:06,940
Dave, Dave, Dave, Dave,

989
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:09,020
let's just talk about our families, okay?

990
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:09,400
I'm sorry.

991
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:11,340
You're obsessing on this war thing.

992
00:55:11,420 --> 00:55:12,580
I'm not obsessing on it.

993
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,080
It just happens to be that we're in a crisis.

994
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:15,360
You know, life goes on.

995
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:15,940
All right.

996
00:55:16,240 --> 00:55:16,980
How's your kid?

997
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:18,900
Oh, my big guy, he's great.

998
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:21,160
Well, you know, he gets into trouble sometimes.

999
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,900
I had to have a talk with him, you know?

1000
00:55:22,940 --> 00:55:24,380
I sat him down last night.

1001
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,040
I sat him down, and I sat him, sat him, sat him.

1002
00:55:27,180 --> 00:55:30,040
Hussein, the bloodthirsty butcher of Baghdad.

1003
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:30,340
Stop.

1004
00:55:30,560 --> 00:55:31,240
Stop it.

1005
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:33,960
He's like another Hitler, and somebody's got to stop him.

1006
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:35,180
But I don't know how we got...

1007
00:55:35,180 --> 00:55:36,180
Well, it's all about big oil.

1008
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:37,660
It's not about making aggression.

1009
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:38,980
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1010
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:40,940
You know, I know what you like.

1011
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:41,360
Football.

1012
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:42,520
Let's talk about football.

1013
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:43,980
Let's talk football.

1014
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:44,800
Now, who's going to do it?

1015
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,940
The Giants or the Bills, huh?

1016
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:46,760
Oh, the Giants.

1017
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:48,200
You can bet the Giants.

1018
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,280
I'd put money on that.

1019
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:50,820
Nah, I bet it's going to be the Bills,

1020
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,420
because, you know, it'll be over quick, man.

1021
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,080
The Bills, a half hour, I bet.

1022
00:55:54,300 --> 00:55:54,960
The whole thing.

1023
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:55,920
Half hour, you bet.

1024
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:56,500
Half hour.

1025
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,000
Half hour, Albertin.

1026
00:55:58,160 --> 00:55:59,840
Half hour, Albertin.

1027
00:55:59,840 --> 00:56:01,060
What are you talking about?

1028
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:01,640
Half hour, Albertin.

1029
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:02,580
Don't you read the papers.

1030
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,700
Half hour, Albertin.

1031
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,300
It's a base where they keep missiles there,

1032
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:07,860
those Tomahawk cruise missiles.

1033
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:09,560
They're launched from command centers,

1034
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:11,340
and they're going to go up against the Scots.

1035
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,480
Everything reminds me of that.

1036
00:56:12,480 --> 00:56:13,340
He's going to take the order.

1037
00:56:13,360 --> 00:56:14,960
We can have something nice to eat.

1038
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:15,840
All right, all right.

1039
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,980
You guys ready to order?

1040
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:17,400
Yeah.

1041
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:18,940
What are your specials today?

1042
00:56:19,460 --> 00:56:22,380
Specials today is barbecued spareribs.

1043
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:23,300
Spareribs.

1044
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,320
That sounds pretty good.

1045
00:56:24,380 --> 00:56:25,600
I'll try the spareribs.

1046
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:27,000
Spareribs I like.

1047
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:27,800
Spareribs.

1048
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:28,480
Spareribs.

1049
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,320
Spareribs.

1050
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:29,820
Spareribs.

1051
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:30,180
Spareribs.

1052
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:31,940
And then we go into war again.

1053
00:56:31,940 --> 00:56:34,140
I can't stop thinking about it.

1054
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:35,080
Spareribs.

1055
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:35,680
Spareribs.

1056
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:35,980
Spareribs.

1057
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,620
I'm going to fight the Arab coalition.

1058
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,400
It's going crazy.

1059
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:40,900
The world is going to go nuts.

1060
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:42,520
My head is going to explode.

1061
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:46,260
Maybe I'll try something else to eat.

1062
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,680
How about the big stuff scud?

1063
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:48,780
I mean scribe.

1064
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:50,040
See, I'm doing it now.

1065
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,040
I'm doing it.

1066
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:51,800
Look at my plate.

1067
00:56:51,940 --> 00:56:53,000
It rhymes with Kuwait.

1068
00:56:53,360 --> 00:56:53,880
Kuwait.

1069
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:54,280
Kuwait.

1070
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:54,820
Ah.

1071
00:56:57,980 --> 00:56:59,820
And that was the end of the show.

1072
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:06,580
This is our good friend, Reverend Gleepo Abernathy, and his good friend, Billy West.

1073
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:14,460
Billy West, who's now, since that was recorded, has become a big star as the voices of Ren

1074
00:57:14,460 --> 00:57:15,220
and Stimpy.

1075
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:21,320
And gosh, we could go on with sickening Gulf War material for forever.

1076
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,940
And we could even do it next week, but I don't think we're going to.

1077
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:28,920
You'll have to listen to me bitch and gripe about money next week.

1078
00:57:29,820 --> 00:57:33,820
But it's not all bad news in subgenius land.

1079
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:34,500
Nay.

1080
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:46,180
And by the way, you should get a pencil ready and paper or else have your tape recorder running.

1081
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:53,580
And if you don't have your tape recorder running, we have to wonder if you even should be listening to this program.

1082
00:57:53,900 --> 00:57:58,020
Anyway, there's some subgenius events coming up.

1083
00:57:58,040 --> 00:57:59,640
If you're lucky enough to live.

1084
00:57:59,820 --> 00:58:04,880
If you're lucky enough to live near any of these far-flung slack sites and cities of shame.

1085
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:13,160
And firstly, coming up, July 5th, 1994, the Portland Pilgrimage.

1086
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:15,240
Yes, in Portland, Oregon.

1087
00:58:15,340 --> 00:58:19,240
The closest thing you'll ever see to another dock stock, most likely.

1088
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:21,880
That's July 5th.

1089
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,900
It's a pre-X Day celebration.

1090
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,000
And we have an address for that.

1091
00:58:27,080 --> 00:58:29,460
It will be held at, believe it or not,

1092
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:35,140
the Clinton Street Theater on Clinton Street in Portland, Oregon.

1093
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:41,860
And you know there's a lot of cities in the United States named Portland.

1094
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,300
Don't be stupid.

1095
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:51,280
Only one of the many Portlands is the focus of the Universal Subgenius Pilgrimage.

1096
00:58:51,460 --> 00:58:56,840
Take it from us, you'll feel like a real dope if you show up in Portland, Arkansas.

1097
00:58:58,080 --> 00:58:59,440
Looking for a unique experience?

1098
00:58:59,440 --> 00:59:00,080
The Yeti Convention.

1099
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:07,880
Only the largest Portland in the world can provide sufficient pink slaves to make a pilgrimage worth contemplating.

1100
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:10,700
Don't even settle for second best.

1101
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:12,860
Um...

1102
00:59:12,860 --> 00:59:13,880
So, uh...

1103
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:17,320
And, oh, the address to write for information on that is NenZlo.

1104
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:18,920
NenZlo is, uh...

1105
00:59:18,920 --> 00:59:21,080
Uh, you might say sponsoring that.

1106
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:27,920
And you can write NenZlo, or well just send a dollar to NenZlo at Box 86582.

1107
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,420
That's Box 86582.

1108
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:31,760
Portland, Oregon.

1109
00:59:34,700 --> 00:59:35,340
97286.

1110
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:37,100
97286.

1111
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:37,840
And, uh...

1112
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:44,760
Then, uh, about a week and a half after that, DragonCon in Atlanta, Georgia.

1113
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:47,260
July 15th through 16th.

1114
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:51,180
America's biggest sci-fi convention this year.

1115
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,760
Uh, in this...

1116
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:57,400
With lots of, uh, comic and science fiction and movie guests and so forth.

1117
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,040
But also...

1118
00:59:58,040 --> 01:00:00,880
A big devival featuring yours truly.

1119
01:00:01,060 --> 01:00:04,640
And the swingin' love corpses, dear friend, will be there.

1120
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:06,520
And Reverend Susie the Floozy.

1121
01:00:06,620 --> 01:00:08,880
And Reverend Nancy Regalia.

1122
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,580
And possibly Father Joe Mama?

1123
01:00:11,780 --> 01:00:13,060
Jane or Hypercleets?

1124
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:13,640
We don't know.

1125
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:20,280
And we'll be glad to anoint the WREK listeners there at the Atlanta Hilton.

1126
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:24,480
The place to write is DragonCon.

1127
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:25,240
P.O.

1128
01:00:25,240 --> 01:00:27,040
Box 47690.

1129
01:00:30,380 --> 01:00:31,660
Atlanta 30362.

1130
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:33,840
0696.

1131
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,380
It's almost the number of the beast.

1132
01:00:36,820 --> 01:00:37,600
And, uh...

1133
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,460
Finally, Starwood, dear friends.

1134
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:46,380
July 21st through 23rd where we can anoint the WCSB listeners, uh, around Cleveland

1135
01:00:46,380 --> 01:00:46,800
area.

1136
01:00:47,020 --> 01:00:47,900
This is a...

1137
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:50,900
A big outdoor subgenius devival.

1138
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,040
It's part of the Starwood Festival of Advanced Shamnistic Noé.

1139
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:57,020
Uh...

1140
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,760
rudeness and high-tech

1141
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,200
ravistical dudeness

1142
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:03,160
where you can also hear Terrence McKenna

1143
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,200
this time around

1144
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,700

mighty Church of the Subgenius

1160
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:38,020
but if you want the poop

1161
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:40,220
that sounds good

1162
01:01:40,220 --> 01:01:40,760
poop

1163
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:43,840
like the peas on this microphone

1164
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:44,820
okay

1165
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:46,700

send that to Bob

1206
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:51,540
stick your hand

1207
01:02:51,540 --> 01:02:52,500
in the ballot box

1208
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:53,400

rose a bar

1211
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,040
worth an

1212
01:02:56,060 --> 01:02:57,840
It's old Saddam Hussein.

1213
01:02:58,060 --> 01:02:59,540
You can see it right at the basket.

1214
01:02:59,740 --> 01:03:02,000
If you pull your mitts out, that's it.

1215
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:03,560
Kaput.

1216
01:03:05,740 --> 01:03:09,480
And now it's old Reverend Brothers swept majestically from the room.

1217
01:03:11,500 --> 01:03:13,800
Cleaning out under the tables and...

1218
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:14,980
We're breaking up, we're breaking up.
