1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:07,140
Oh yes dear friends this episode we're going way back in the way back machine

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:20,000
for a rerun of get ready hour of slack number three from October 1985 I had

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:25,940
done only two prior shows in the K&ON Dallas studio which was in an old house

4
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:30,860
and you can tell I was still a little unfamiliar with the equipment the

5
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:36,500
amazing thing about this episode though are the special guests three of the key

6
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:42,700
early subgenius doctors were all somehow in Dallas that week we had just done the

7
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:51,900
Scary Ball D Vival at the Twilight Room Club with doctors for Bob the oldest

8
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,720
known subgenius dr. g Gordon Gordon had come for

9
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:55,920
that special show and I was on my way to see Bob in his office in the dedicated

10
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:07,160
that from Brazil. The my age Dr. Gary Gibrogfran was there from Berkeley. And the then youngest

11
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:16,720
subgenius Dr. Onan Canabite had come from Knoxville, Tennessee. And we all sound like babies.

12
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:25,560
What, what, what? The station's full of aliens. And I'm sick to my stomach. Look.

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:35,860
This thing. A fetus on KNON. I believe this is it. My gosh. It's, it's in it. What, what has

14
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:41,940
happened to this station here? It's something that we aren't prepared to deal with at this time.

15
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,840
No, we can't, we can't possibly handle this because as, as one goes out to yet,

16
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:55,820
yay, another goes in. And as we seek, they've changed the way the boards are set up. Yes,

17
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:04,340
my friends, but we will persevere because this is the hour of slack on which we can only but,

18
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:12,460
but seek to find that which will play our tapes. I'm gonna bring you a piece of that green cheese

19
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:25,900
for sure. No trouble. Get set, get going. Amen. Recording. Everything's going smooth.

20
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:25,900


21
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:41,000
Fine. No trouble. Welcome potential initiates and remain with us for the next 30 minutes. Bob? Bob?

22
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:53,280
The message is now part of and registered in your subconscious mind every time you say, see, hear, or think.

23
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,760
What about slack?

24
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:03,280
That's your key phrase. It will trigger the entire message without your being aware of it.

25
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:15,900
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry hour of slack, sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

26
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:23,500
This is Reverend Ivan Stang, sacred scribe of the First Orthodox Megaphyst Temple Lodge of the Church

27
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,900
of the Subgenius with my voice actor, Dr. Robert Stevenson. I'll turn it down now.

28
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,380
Pastor Buck Naked of the First Naked Church of the Subgenius.

29
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:34,660
The opinions expressed are not necessarily those of this radio station.

30
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,600
Before the sermon, a message concerning Bob Dobbs,

31
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,680
living avatar of Slack and saint of sales on Planet Earth.

32
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:49,800
Are we controlled by secret forces?

33
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:54,420
Do you ever get the feeling that free will is a joke?

34
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,020
Do people think you're strange?

35
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,660
Do you?

36
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,400
Then you may be on the right track.

37
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:05,080
Are you abnormal?

38
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:09,440
Then you are probably better than most people.

39
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,680
Yes, your kind shall triumph.

40
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:16,560
Now, at last, the step-by-step process is revealed.

41
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,780
This is it, the only fate that promises action, thrill, success in sex and business.

42
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,660
Bring your...

43
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:29,540
weirdest dreams to rampaging life.

44
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,740
Stand direct for your own abnormality.

45
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,460
Bob is a way of life to millions.

46
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:39,120
Yet half of it don't even know it.

47
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:49,760
He's the one true living Slack master with the spiritual know-how to help you bash through the locked doorway to financial heaven.

48
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,820
He is the one real shortcut to Slack.

49
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,220
You can't stop him.

50
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,800
You can't stop him.

51
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:03,800


52
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:03,860
He's the one who makes the most of your life.

53
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:03,980
He's the one who makes the most of your life.

54
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:03,980


55
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:03,980


56
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:03,980


57
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:03,980


58
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,760
This fear, the stark fist of removal no longer.

59
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:08,760
Become physically attractive overnight.

60
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:14,080
Attain status, luck, prosperity by blowing them off.

61
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:21,220
Bob's promise is to widen the scope and nature of abnormal behavior.

62
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,440
To explore new ways of going over the edge!

63
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,640
and coming right back

64
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:35,220
to help you create

65
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,660
the highest possible earnings

66
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:38,720
from the psychodynamics

67
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,880
of abnormalities

68
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,320
to turn conspiracy

69
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,020
and personality disorders around

70
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,540
and channel them into an illusion

71
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,600
of creativity

72
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,140
that will fool normals

73
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:52,720
and get you sex

74
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:09,260
yes dear friends

75
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,320
yes it's the hour of slack

76
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,700
welcome, welcome once again

77
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,860
and yes after

78
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:21,220
the usual slow take off

79
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,640
it's hard to get these shows off

80
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,340
the ground especially when you're

81
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,700
at the very end of your

82
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,140
so called rope

83
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:30,380
and indeed we are folks

84
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:32,540
because we, if any of you were

85
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,700
at the amazing

86
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,820
subgenius masquerade

87
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,440
scary ball last night

88
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,280
at the twilight moment

89
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:40,840
yes

90
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,400
no there's no, you can use

91
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,760
chewing gum and stuff, that's the way this station

92
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,560
is held together

93
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,080
put one right in this

94
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:51,740
in this

95
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:53,600
in this thing

96
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:55,360
this body shrimp

97
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,540
now who are you, wait a minute

98
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:59,980
there was only supposed to be one person on this show

99
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,720
and all of a sudden we've got shows from

100
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,520
San Francisco and Brazil

101
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,020
and Tennessee

102
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,540
and have walked in

103
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:09,520
to the radio tabernacle

104
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,780
here in Dallas, Texas

105
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,740
dear friends

106
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,400
we're so

107
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,440
reach for those checkbooks

108
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:19,720
but you can't write that check to the subgenius

109
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,600
foundation because we can't pray

110
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,000
for money over the air

111
00:07:23,540 --> 00:07:25,160
with this FCC license

112
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,180
but we can pray for you to send money to K-N-O-N

113
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,300
but we can ask you to bring all those

114
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,340
things down to the stations now

115
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:36,300
the things that you keep in your drawers

116
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,800
that's right those little things that

117
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,700
you don't want the dice

118
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:43,860
you're not supposed to talk about drawers on this radio station

119
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:45,360
Dr. Ebro fan

120
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,320
yeah bloomers that's it okay

121
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,060
yes bring those things

122
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,560
ladies and gentlemen

123
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,820
and your parents tell your parents to listen right now

124
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,220
because this is going to be the most offensive piece of radio

125
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,900
you've ever heard in Dallas, Texas

126
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,700
let's try we'll try

127
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,500
let's put it that way

128
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:07,920
uh strangely enough somehow this show has ended up

129
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,420
with a number of subgenius celebrity guests

130
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,540
that's right Dr. Gary Gubrog-Franc

131
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:16,600
star of the amazing subgenius show in Berkeley, California

132
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:19,400
which you will be hearing on and off

133
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,040
in a most confusing manner

134
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:24,060
uh as we as we slowly fade in

135
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,260
oh wait what what the callers are there

136
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,340
we finally got callers here thanks folks

137
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:32,380
poor girl she's in that bubbling vat of jokes

138
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,660
we're gonna throw a tarp over it and protect it from the elements

139
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,960
yeah we might throw a tarp over it

140
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,580
but we probably that's all we'll cover it

141
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,680
this young lady has the jokes all day

142
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:39,760
yeah

143
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,500
she's soaking in the jokes

144
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,920
we'll have to come down to the station right now

145
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:45,060
we'll cover you up with something soft and warm too

146
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,380
we're gonna have to reverse the charger

147
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,780
this is a tarpaulin that's been soaked in water

148
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:50,980
you're already covered well yeah good she has one of those

149
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,780
actually you know a lot of depilatories can help in these

150
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:55,720
she was covered pretty well but maybe not

151
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:59,100
they're covered by the horrible fur that's the KPFA

152
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,660
each of their customers

153
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,280
my screen

that's very broad

159
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:08,120
i don't know

160
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,720
you could have been talking to that last caller

161
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,260
i wish i could go to sleep and if you'd call her

162
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,680

00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,880
i can't even see mobius rex now

170
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:44,080
bit we're having some more serious serious technical difficulties here on the show we

171
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:47,400
seem to be colliding with shows from other states

172
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:47,920
hard

173
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,320
we got we got a job

174
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,240
we dragged the show out into the big part of the auditorium

175
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:56,540
no no no it's illegal to get the show out on the street in dallas

176
00:09:56,540 --> 00:10:01,620
buck and i got we're almost arrested last week for driving the show up and down central

177
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:07,420
it's so hard what is this story with this station at least they could give us air in here

178
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:12,100
well it may be it may not be entirely their problem dr de brogue friend

179
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:19,240
it may be the fact that we've also got subgeniuses in this room from as far away as yes brazil

180
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,000
the incredible

181

188
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:11,440
these creatures that have entered this station are actually fallout from uh the the incredible

189
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:18,140
devival and it was a devival last night it was it was really thoroughly devived gary yes i feel

190
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:20,000
like i could just use a bit more

191
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,200
just a bit more of that liquid slack.

192
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,880
Pass another cup over here.

193
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,460
Here's a half-pound tub of slack.

194
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:29,640
Yeah, for those of you who were at the show last night

195
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,780
at the Twilight Room and couldn't hear it,

196
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:39,620
we do have the amazing tapes that were recorded there.

197
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,940
It's amazing.

198
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,280
Lovely, lovely.

199
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,660
Hi, this is Pastor Buck Naked here.

200
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:47,320
I was just counseling a young lady,

201
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:51,180
and I gave her her own personal mantra,

202
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:57,320
which was to say this to herself 15 times or more,

203
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,420
maybe for a half hour.

204
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,140
Who gives a...

205
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:03,800
Who gives a...

206
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,020
Right.

207
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,000
Now, friends, I want you to keep that sort of a philosophy in mind.

208
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,340
That's right.

209
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:13,340
Because that's a forgiveness kind of philosophy,

210
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,720
a who-cares kind of forgiveness.

211
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,560
That's right, Doctor.

212
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,240
Yeah.

213
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:17,380
Yeah.

214
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,440
So we will be cutting...

215
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:20,900
That's right.

216
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,620
No, no, that's why we're here, for people giving us things.

217
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,660
And we want people to bring those things down to the station.

218
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,600
Yeah, this is a religion of...

219
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,920
We're asking forgiveness of everything.

220
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:34,260
We want forgiveness from you for us,

221
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,960
and hate from you for the conspiracy.

222
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,980
That's right.

223
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,480
The conspiracy that makes you not understand what we're talking about.

224
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,000
Because if it weren't for them,

225
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,920
why, it'd be nothing on the air,

226
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,880
in Dallas, except subgenius shows.

227
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:53,840
And you may groan to think such a nightmarish thought,

228
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,080
but actually the...

229
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,460
We've decided...

230
00:12:58,460 --> 00:12:59,380
Yeah, listen to them.

231
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,960
Even the subgenius doctors themselves,

232
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,700
in terrible, terrible pain... Oh, it hurts.

233
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,360
We're near death here, and believe me,

234
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:09,480
we can't just ask you to walk out and kill normals.

235
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:12,140
We can't ask you to do that kind of thing on this station.

236
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,580
We can't ask you to do what would be the rightful work of Dobbs,

237
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,480
or what would be the rightful work of the

238
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:24,560
law that would be the rightful work of the law that would be the rightful work of the

239
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:31,680
law that would be the rightful work of the law.

240
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:46,460
We do also have Dr. Onan Canobite of the amazing subgenius band,

241
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:51,440
Dr. Onan's Wotan band, as well as the famous occupant.

242
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:51,880
Yes.

243
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,820
Yeah, there, yes, you can hear.

244
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:57,480
Now, Dr. Onan is only a tape recording,

245
00:13:58,140 --> 00:13:59,940
and yet at the same time...

246
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,620
See, we've got a crowded show tonight.

247
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,320
We have over a hundred guests.

248
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,460
Over ten thousand.

249
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:06,100
Uh, and too many listeners.

250
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,160
I don't think that we can cram the show into that many radios.

251
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:09,940
I don't think it'll...

252
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,940
Keep it quiet here.

253
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
I haven't got enough room.

254
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,440
It's gonna thin out.

255
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:13,920
Right.

256
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,780
If we try to reach too many listeners,

257
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,320
it'll just...

258
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:16,440
Right.

259
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:16,440


260
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:16,860
I'll just dilute it.

261
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:23,680
Now, uh, a subgenius church can be a franchise in your own area, and, uh, it's also called

262
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,500
a... in church... the church jargon is called a clench.

263
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:28,760
It's called a clench.

264
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:37,440
Now, uh, Onan was the one who figured out, uh, who started his own solo clench, and,

265
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:41,220
uh, it's schismed all over itself, so tell us about that.

266
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,440
That's what you're most famous for in town.

267
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,120
I want you to know that.

268
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,200
I see it.

269
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,340
I see it.

270
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:46,380
Yes.

271
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:53,360
Uh, the, uh, the solos... the stark fists acting upon a solo clench resulting in ultimate

272
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,920
schism.

273
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:58,440
And, friends, you know, most of these religions... most of these religions...

274
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:04,400
They indulge in tremendous infighting between denominations.

275
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:08,160
We encourage infighting between denominations.

276
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:15,880
No two subgenius denominations should ever dominate one another, uh, especially not if

277
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:16,460
they're the same.

278
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,880
And if any two subgeniuses are the same, one must die.

279
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:21,220
That's true.

280
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:23,300
Because this is... the... it's different.

281
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:24,120
You know what I mean?

282
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:27,700
I was gonna ask, Dr. Onan, were you the one that... that had the first church in the round,

283
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,760
the circumschism?

284
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,880
No, that was, uh, just hearsay, just rumor.

285
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:34,640
That was just a...

286
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,280
Oh, it's reverend hearsay.

287
00:15:36,380 --> 00:15:37,480
Yes, I remember that.

288
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:37,740
Reverend hearsay.

289
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:42,000
These are the kind of things that we can't say on a radio station, KPFA in Berkeley,

290
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:42,500
California.

291
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:42,860
Yes.

292
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,900
These are the kind of guests that we can't have on our station.

293
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:50,960
Yes, but KNON is a non-station, you see, and because of that we can get away with things

294
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:55,240
that they would never suspect anyone of, especially not us.

295
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:58,940
But we're gonna... we've got to, uh... see, the problem is...

296
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,600
Monkey track recordings.

297
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:05,900
We have so many great tapes that, uh, that we can play for you, all by subgeniuses.

298
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:06,580
It would... it would...

299
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:06,720
Ah, yes.

300
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:11,920
And you would think, no, I don't want to hear a bunch of amateur garage bands, but... you

301
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:17,140
see, music by subgeniuses could include, and let me name drop, boys, let me name drop,

302
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:26,400
music by subgeniuses could include George Clinton, uh, Devo, um, uh, Ernest Tubbs, and

303
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:32,840
even Dr. One Encantabyte, who is here and whose tape we are about to play now.

304
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:37,880
You can buy this tape, friends, from the Subgenius Foundation, but it's against the law for us

305
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,200
to tell you that, so...

306
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,040
We didn't tell you that.

307
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,160
Turn off your tape recorders.

308
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:41,840
That's right.

309
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:42,300
Turn off your tape recorders.

310
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,860
Uh, and, uh, and indulge in a little... and after Dr. One Encantabyte, I think we'll be

311
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:53,080
flipping Wellmans out and going into the next little Wellman of the, uh, revival, uh, the

312
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:54,280
Scary Ball revival.

313
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,040
Last night.

314
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,340
Thank you, dear friends.

315
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,700
Uh, yes.

316
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,600
Ah!

317
00:16:58,980 --> 00:16:59,280
Ha!

318
00:16:59,280 --> 00:16:59,440
Ha!

319
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:00,040
Ha!

320
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:00,360
Ha!

321
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:00,760
Ha!

322
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,000
Ha!

323
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:01,620
Ha!

324
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:01,820
Ha!

325
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,320
Ha!

326
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:04,600
Ha!

327
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:04,600


328
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:04,900
Ha!

329
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:07,260
Ha!

330
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,520
Ha!

331
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:16,600


332
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:16,600


333
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:16,740
Ha!

334
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:25,440
Ha!

335
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,060
Ha!

336
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,440
Ha!

337
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:27,800


338
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:28,440
Ha!

339
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:28,720
Ha!

340
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:28,740
Ha!

341
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,520
Got you.

342
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,340
Male Speaker 1 Oh, my God!

343
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:39,480
Easy enough to run from Dr. One Encantabyte's silliness!

344
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:39,480


345
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:39,480


346
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:39,480


347
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:39,480


348
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,280
Uh, yes.

349
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:40,600
Look, you just got hold.

350
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,160
I don't touch my mark at all.

351
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:41,880
I let my Miche over here.

352
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:41,900
Hey, what?

353
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,520
Ah, yes, dear friends, that was the amazing Dr. Onan's...

354
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,940
Well, that was actually Occupant.

355
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,100
And they're a panting bunch.

356
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,860
Now, hold it.

357
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,300
What was that?

358
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,580
Clouded ballerina, here and there.

359
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,260
Clouded ballerina, everywhere.

360
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,940
Oh, no, that's not Tevez.

361
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:42,180
Tevez, that was mean.

362
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,400
Why'd you do that to that little girl?

363
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:46,520
You've got to get the babies out of this room.

364
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,260
It's hard to find a place to sit or walk.

365
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:50,040
You guys act like a bunch of babies.

366
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,220
What are you doing on the air?

367
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,260
A bunch of stinky little subgenius rats.

368
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,700
Well, what about Roo Mouse, and what about...

369
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,720
Well, it's also illegal to talk about California deities in Texas, Dr. Dubrow, friend.

370
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,020
There's only room for so many religions in this corporate state.

371
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:10,920
What happened to...

372
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,100
What happened to ecumenialism?

373
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,180
Whatever happened...

374
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:17,020
I mean, how come we got California deities and Texas deities?

375
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,640
Yes, what is the...

376
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:18,820
Is this a state church?

377
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:20,760
What is the problem here?

378
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,000
Yeah.

379
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:21,980
Exactly, what?

380
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,420
I can't worship Bohandas and the radio station in my house.

381
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,400
All hail Roo Mouse and Bohandas.

382
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,400
And we shouldn't be peeking out the meter so badly.

383
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,940
Yeah, but what about Bob?

384
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,120
What about Slack, and what about the conspiracy?

385
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,680
What about them?

386
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:35,220
Yeah.

387
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,320
What about the conspiracy?

388
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,480
The conspiracy.

389
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,760
The conspiracy.

390
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,900
The conspiracy has given me so much more...

391
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,680
More than Bob ever gave to me.

392
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,560
Yeah, it's true.

393
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:50,280
The conspiracy does pay better than Bob Dobbs, or for that matter, almost any other religious

394
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,780
savior.

395
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:57,400
But the conspiracy isn't quite as much fun, and we had a...

396
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
Did you get the check in the mail?

397
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,100
Yeah, I got the check.

398
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,300
You see what I mean, folks?

399
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,120
Don't tell Stang.

400
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:01,780
I just...

401
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:02,480
Don't tell me.

402
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,860
The Dobbs head came down and said the check's in the mail, and I haven't heard from him

403
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:05,100
since.

404
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,800
You guys are going to have to talk to doctors for Bob about that.

405
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:10,680
Hey.

406
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:11,400
Where's my...

407
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,040
Okay.

408
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:19,340
Well, folks, for those of you who weren't at the scary ball last night, that's too bad.

409
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:25,460
But for those who were and still couldn't hear it, because of the strange acoustics

410
00:20:25,460 --> 00:20:30,760
that go with rock and roll performances, we are bringing in some beautiful lilting melodies

411
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,800
from Doctors for Bob, most of whom could not be here tonight.

412
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:40,560
Some of them are lost in the station, and we're digging through these boxes of...

413
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:41,260
Oh, okay.

414
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,200
You stepped on Buck.

415
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,020
Oh, yeah.

416
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:43,440
That's right.

417
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,780
Oh, poor Buck.

418
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:44,880
It's okay, Buck.

419
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:45,220
Get up.

420
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:45,800
You'll be all right.

421
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:46,560
Okay.

422
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,380
Well, the Twilight Room...

423
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:49,660
We'll just...

424
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:52,400
We'll just go ahead and play this lovely melody.

425
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:52,980
That's right.

426
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,880
Love, if you'd been there last night, you'd be changed.

427
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:02,760
But we're going to start off with a religious gospel hymn from Doctors for Bob called,

428
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:07,840
You Can't, and that is, Can't Hide from God.

429
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,960
Because he's...

430
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:11,080
L ef

431
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:12,320

433
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,760
You follow me, right?

434
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:16,760


435
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,500
I

436
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,340
I

437
00:21:30,340 --> 00:21:31,300
I

438
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:31,300


439
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:31,980
You're lifted

440
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:31,980


441
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,180

443
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:36,920
You try

444
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:39,300


445
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,160
break

446
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:39,920
the

447
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:39,960
matches

448
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:45,100
You can't hide from God, because he's bigger than you.

449
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:46,740
Help me somebody.

450
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:55,660
You can't hide from God, because he's bigger than the whole universe.

451
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,100
Help me somebody.

452
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:03,720
You cannot hide from God, because he's bigger than all reality.

453
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:05,580
Help me somebody.

454
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,080
You cannot hide from God.

455
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,340
You cannot run from your own legs.

456
00:22:28,040 --> 00:22:31,940
Is there a person in this place tonight that can run from their own legs?

457
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,360
Help me somebody.

458
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:57,760
You cannot see your own eyes.

459
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,040
How are you going to see your own eyes?

460
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,820
You got to turn them inside out.

461
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,220
You can't see.

462
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,980
You cannot run from your own legs.

463
00:23:11,180 --> 00:23:12,600
You cannot hide from God.

464
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,480
Help me somebody.

465
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,180
She ain't got no legs.

466
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:16,380
My legs don't matter.

467
00:23:16,460 --> 00:23:17,080
It's their problem.

468
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,200
My mind's still okay.

469
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,020
Praise God.

470
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:22,200
You cannot wet water.

471
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,020
How are you going to wet water?

472
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:27,280
You can throw water on it.

473
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,620
That's going to make more water.

474
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,320
You cannot wet water.

475
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:31,760
You cannot see your own eyes.

476
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,240
You cannot run from your own legs.

477
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:54,180
You cannot turn with your feet behind your equation.

478
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,180


479
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,180


480
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,180


481
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:54,180


482
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,400
How are you going to see your ownري còn ask the force to go.

483
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:55,460


484
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:55,460


485
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:58,400
how do you know that you not be so mighty of a god.

486
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:58,480
But you have to see what is the truth that is.

487
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,620
Thank you, Jesus, Jesus of all together.

488
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:00,620


489
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:00,620


490
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:02,020
¡¡¡¡ful, flris!

491
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,440
FLCMMF sair del rato y puede ser que partes de dinosaurio y deberes publicar!!

492
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:04,760
Las voces hermannas y todas las voces del banco de darüber que la cual mej influye,

493
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:13,640
waiting outside the station. Been waiting outside for three days just to get on this show. Just the two minutes that they want to say hi mom or hi Bob or

494
00:24:13,640 --> 00:24:30,140
Hello Kitty. Yeah they think Bob might be listening. Hi girls. They think J.R. Bob dogs. And junior high girls too. They're even better. They don't know much but they're a lot of fun. I heard that. I heard that too. I wish you guys wouldn't talk that way.

495
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:59,220
This is KNON in Dallas. Yeah we'll have to. Buck says we have to do that on. Oh Buck's such a stickler for FCC details. Go ahead. You would be too if you had the problems with this station. That's true. That's true. There's demons attacking this. That's right. Let me tell them about that demon okay. Okay. Just refer to it as a demon just in case. I hate that old demon.

496
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:28,020
That demon he got he got to my mistress and left her in the back of my Mark IV Continental with eight sleeping pills in her and the motor running and that. I hate that old demon. That demon I went to the store to buy shoes for the children and come back and go into a trance and a fog comes over my mind and when I woke the shoes was in the back of the

497
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,880
car. It was gone.

498
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:59,020
I was in the back of the car and there was just three empty liquor bottles back there and I hate that old demon. Funny. You know you shouldn't have married that demon Buck if that's the case. You shouldn't have hired that demon Buck. You shouldn't be paying taxes to that demon. You shouldn't have gotten him. You shouldn't have just signed that contract with that demon. If the laws in this county were any better you wouldn't even ever had to bear that demon.

499
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:27,220
By the way, I filled out that job application for that demon. You signed up for that demon. By the way, I've got a special free offer. A special free offer. For a demon. No, for all real subgeniuses and only subgeniuses are allowed to accept this offer. Well, I gotta leave. I can't even hear this thing. And if you send an envelope with a stamp on it to P.O. Box.

500
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,120
I will send you an envelope.

501
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:37,940
I will send you free the likeness of Nunu. And you can join the Nunu sex cult.

502
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:38,420
Nunu.

503
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:51,320
Yeah, that's a sex cult, folks, that Pastor Bucknaked runs. Now, that's not to be confused with the original Orthodox Church of the subgenius. This is another denominational schism.

504
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,300
The Naked Church.

505
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,260
The Naked Church.

506
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,560
Observers of the extended Christ.

507
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,920
The first Naked Church of the subgenius.

508
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,200
Oh, right, right.

509
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,940
Lovely. Lovely.

510
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:08,680
Yes, it's Squeebert. Squeebert's here now.

511
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:11,120
Yes, yes. Beautiful little Squeebert.

512
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:11,620
Okay, Buck.

513
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,900
Well, it ain't straight up yet.

514
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:14,940
It ain't straight up yet.

515
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,340
Well, just a moment.

516
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,720
Don't worry, Buck. I got pills for that.

517
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,220
That's right. It'll be soon.

518
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,500
We gotta wait to tell you where we are until it's straight up.

519
00:27:25,920 --> 00:27:28,800
Yeah, and you can help, friends.

520
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,120
If you can just stay.

521
00:27:30,140 --> 00:27:31,620
If you can just stimulate your radio enough.

522
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:31,960
That's right.

523
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,340
Put your hand on that radio and lay your hands on the radio.

524
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:38,260
And if you turn on a chip.

525
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:40,520
Feel the power, the healing power come through.

526
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,240
That's right. You can feel the power of your radio warming your hand up.

527
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:45,720
Okay, close enough. You gotta get there.

528
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:46,660
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Buck.

529
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,640
We're playing it.

530
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,460
We're still scared. We're still scared.

531
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,040
We're still scared and we're still doing the show.

532
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:55,100
It's scary in here. There's something weird going on in this station.

533
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,720
The show. The show is going on.

534
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,460
Shoot us.

535
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,120
Hey, Ben. There's something wrong with us.

536
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:02,300
There's a wiring on this show and the wiring.

537
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,260
We're just asking you for ID.

538
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:06,760
You're listening to The One End.

539
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:08,900
My head's hanging on your penis.

540
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,360
Dallas, Fort Worth, Plano, and Lancaster.

541
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,980
He done that all himself, Buck.

542
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,900
Yep. Yep. Buck's an expert at doing those station IDs.

543
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,320
Pretty good, Buck. I didn't think you could do it.

544
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:21,420
But you know, Mr. Foreman.

545
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,640
I didn't think you could do it, Buck.

546
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,060
Yeah.

547
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
Arlington, Oak Cliff.

548
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,840
Uh, what did you say, Buck?

549
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:31,420
I said, good Lord.

550
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:37,060
What's to lose? A little time? Hurt your ego a little bit, baby?

551
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,280
You probably got time you're wasting on Mickey Mouse stuff now, so that's no big deal.

552
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:50,760
So why not? So why not? Why not make a new beginning in your life and see what'll happen?

553
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:55,540
I don't know. You don't know. And you will never know.

554
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,620
You have signed the application.

555
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:01,120
You do have the kit.

556
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,620
None of those things are important.

557
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:08,900
But there is a part in your life when you've got to just stop talking about it.

558
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:17,040
And when you've got to stop worrying about what your friends and neighbors and relatives and uncles and aunts and sisters and brothers and everybody else is gonna say about it.

559
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,960
Because nobody else is gonna pay your bills for you.

560
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,140
Why not? You don't know.

561
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,760
And you will never know.

562
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,600
And who knows? Just may be.

563
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:28,600


564
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:28,600


565
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:28,600


566
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:28,600


567
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,540
Just may be.

568
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,600
You could have one of the biggest...

569
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,420
I don't know. But even more important, you don't know.

570
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:52,260
And you will never know.

571
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,040
You will never know.

572
00:29:58,900 --> 00:29:59,340
You will never know.

573
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,380
Just may be.

574
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,220
You're in for a new and exciting experience.

575
00:30:08,080 --> 00:30:09,980
You have signed the application.

576
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:11,600
You have signed the application.

577
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:13,440
You have signed the application.

578
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:13,440


579
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,820
Well, have you got your pipe through the mail? Or are you gonna write in and get your pipe?

580
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,320
I'm still waiting for the cast.

581
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:21,560
The cast? Well, the cast is all here, unfortunately.

582
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,160
Yeah, they're out there.

583
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,240


584
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:22,240


585
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:25,460
They'll be outside your house to sing a song about it at 8 o'clock this morning.

586
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:27,660
Actually, we're expecting Vic Morrow, too.

587
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,500
Yeah, he's gonna be starring in all the body parts.

588
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:36,040
I just wanna know, you guys are very informative tonight, but I wanna know, what planet are we on?

589
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,300
Oh, me too.

590
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,240
We aren't planning this. This is, uh...

591
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:41,780
Oh, it's all planned.

592
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,380
Bob, look, go ahead and admit it.

593
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,120
See, look, look.

594
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,640
The page is gonna hit age.

595
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:51,200
Look, I'm on page 16. It says, Lady Paul talks about chili.

596
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,820
I mean, all this stuff is...

597
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:54,820
You can't fool these people.

598
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:58,760
Yeah, I'm tired of this script.

599
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,580
Let's go to this script here.

600
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:03,760
Look, do my stuff. My stuff's really funny.

601
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,800
Prepare for the chrono-cataclysm of my hoarding food.

602
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,160
Gold guns, ammo, gas.

603
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,440
Grow up on survival techniques and learn how to kill.

604
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,060
Of course, you don't want to kill a subgenius believer, but...

605
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:20,360
God's judgment is going to come and fall again.

606
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:25,980
Upon a godless, Christ-rejecting, blasphemous society.

607
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:31,320
Well, if this sounds paranoid, you're right.

608
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:34,240
But I think I have good reason to be paranoid.

609
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:38,120
It's a strange world...

610
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,240
out there.

611
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,620
It's kind of, this is what life is like...

612
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,480
at a... at a bottom-line level.

613
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,340
You know, and I'm not gonna make you...

614
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:53,000
cut through a lot of other stuff to get through it.

615
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:53,940
Here's what it is.

616
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,680
There's no gimmick about that. It's straightforward.

617
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:59,740
It's strong, and it's elemental.

618
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,840
We are heavy stuff.

619
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,400
Witchcraft.

620
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:05,860
Looting.

621
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:08,020
Devil worship.

622
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:15,500
A wild, gnawing, animal hunger will grow in you.

623
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,260
His number is 600.

624
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:23,740
Three score and six.

625
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,000
306 score and 600 and 966.

626
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,340
We're not here.

627
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:32,160
No, no, we're... no, don't worry. You guys...

628
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:32,980
There's nothing here.

629
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,640
Then we can make the plans now.

630
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,600
No, there's no problem.

631
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,200
No, don't reveal the plans.

632
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,620
But we can't talk about any of this stuff.

633
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:43,600
We can't talk about Bohandas or Roo Mouse or Kitty.

634
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:46,180
No, don't, please, don't talk about any of this.

635
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,580
Because those confuse people.

636
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,880
Bohandas was walking through Tokyo.

637
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:52,620
Bohandas is the friend of all the little children.

638
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,740
What about Wolwo?

639
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:58,840
Yes, friends, Halloween is getting closer and closer,

640
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,340
and it is going to be very scary.

641
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,160
Very scary.

642
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:05,520
In the subgenius world.

643
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,340
And even out there in the world of reality.

644
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:10,960
Stand up on your back.

645
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,340
Everybody wants to operate. Nobody's gonna get a bar of soap.

646
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,320
I can't take it.

647
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:17,260
You can't clean. You can't wash.

648
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:23,360
What are you gonna do? Cut that bar of soap in half and rub it against itself?

649
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:25,540
Soap is the cleanest thing known to man.

650
00:33:25,820 --> 00:33:28,920
You can't wash this show out of your ears either, doctor.

651
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,960
You tried scrubbing it out. You tried rubbing it out.

652
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,260
You tried scouring it out.

653
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:37,520
You go listen to six hours of Beethoven right now,

654
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:40,860
and I can guarantee you, you'll still hear this show tomorrow morning.

655
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:41,440
That's right.

656
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,940
That's the thing about these subgenius shows,

657
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:47,240
is you can turn off your radio,

658
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:50,500
you can stop your car, you can run away from it,

659
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,480
but you keep hearing it laying in bed at night.

660
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,580
You can even cut the cables to your power supply,

661
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,160
and you still get the show.

662
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,700
It's a scary show at times.

663
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,700
It's in my ear! It's in my ear!

664
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,980
No, no, that wasn't, that's not the show.

665
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:07,180
That's one of those creatures that...

666
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,480
That's right, Dr. Jewell.

667
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:11,140
That was that thing that was growing on you earlier today.

668
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:12,760
Oh, no, it's in my ear now?

669
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:13,860
It's in your ear.

670
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,640
Oh, no, I'm gonna have to change shirts as well as shorts.

671
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,300
This is awful.

672
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,140
Well, doctors, what do you think?

673
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,060
I've got a whole stack of Wellman here,

674
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:24,900
and we've got everything from more of last night's Twilight Room

675
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:30,160
to some more sick music by healthy subgeni and vice versa.

676
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:33,920
Let's vote. Call into the station right now and vote.

677
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,260
That's right. Even though we can't take your calls on the air,

678
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:41,140
you can still call this station.

679
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:41,420
That's right.

680
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:45,960
You can vote by your own personal biorhythms.

681
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,400
We can calculate your vote.

682
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,980
Even if we give you your own phone number over the air.

683
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:52,580
Yeah, what is your phone number, by the way?

684
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,840
And we'll call you.

685
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:54,420
That's right.

686
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:55,760
Go ahead and call us and tell us your number.

687
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,120
Because we can't remember our phone number over here.

688
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:00,660
Oh, you want the phone number?

689
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,040
Yeah, what is the phone number?

690
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:08,860
Okay, to call us here, subgenius calls at 823-1-HER-OF-NUS.

691
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,680
Do it now, or you might forget.

692
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:12,620
Boy, Buck does that so nicely.

693
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,340
He does, right?

694
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:13,740
Buck is a professional.

695
00:35:13,740 --> 00:35:16,680
Can you come out to California and say his station ID for us?

696
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,380
Cool.

697
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:23,420
Buck underwent four operations to get his vocal cords to be able to do that.

698
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,120
Hey, I'm here!

699
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:27,500
But he still hasn't been Wellmanized.

700
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,180
Well, let's do that to him after the show.

701
00:35:29,300 --> 00:35:30,360
And I'll inform the head.

702
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,880
The head. What about the head?

703
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:35,660
What about the scary poster dog's thing?

704
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,320
That evil head.

705
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,600
There's no sign of Wellman.

706
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:42,080
There's no sign of Wellman.

707
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,620
We're just laying low right here.

708
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:47,080
And hoping that we can get in touch with you.

709
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:47,720
Wellman's gone?

710
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,880
Yeah, Wellman's gone.

711
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:54,840
But if we can just get the head inside that lead-lined vault, we'll be okay.

712
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,160
Friends, beware that head.

713
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:00,860
I left the little Wellman at home, but he won't.

714
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:11,520
The bleeding head of Arnold Palmer rose slowly above the trap between the third and fourth greens.

715
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,640
Down at Onion Creek Country Club and Golf Course.

716
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:30,400
Thumping slowly like an over-enlarged fig, the bleeding head slowly rose at a gentle angle above the green, dripping blood.

717
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:42,740
It hovered briefly over the sand trap, and then slowly ascended towards the constellation of Orion.

718
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:48,120
At an angle of about 44.325 degrees.

719
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,960
Like a shot off a shovel.

720
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:56,200
There was no doubt that it was the head of Arnold Palmer.

721
00:36:57,620 --> 00:37:00,660
That moon-faced smile was unforgettable.

722
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:07,960
The population, the population of Southeast Austin went wild.

723
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,960
They tore off their clothes.

724
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:13,280
Danced in the streets and said,

725
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,920
The bloody head has come.

726
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:16,800
The time is here.

727
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,560
Take off your clothes and be somebody.

728
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:25,020
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer was above such things.

729
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,280
The bloody head of Arnold Palmer rose gently.

730
00:37:29,260 --> 00:37:33,400
Buffeting itself slightly as it passed among some ancient pecan trees.

731
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:40,660
But slowly, still, ever moving upwards, it wobbled slightly.

732
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,940
Spraying a small glissando of blood, so to speak, on the people below it.

733
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,260
Healing two old ladies.

734
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:56,920
And giving an old man a substantial gland rebuild.

735
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:10,640
At 14 minutes after 9, the bleeding head was sighted on the forward control radar access plant at Park Street.

736
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,580
It took place from Air Force Base.

737
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:16,760
Three interceptors were scrambled.

738
00:38:18,620 --> 00:38:20,780
One of which crashed on takeoff.

739
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:24,420
They could find nothing.

740
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,480
The radar was still tracking the head.

741
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:31,620
The bloody head moved north.

742
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,600
Rocketed over Dallas and Fort Worth.

743
00:38:37,820 --> 00:38:46,300
The radar at Caswell Air Force Base gave subsequent indication that something large and wet was

744
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:53,020
moving north-northeast while ascending still upwards towards the constellation of Orion.

745
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,920
The bloody head moved on.

746
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:07,320
Fourteen ex-virgins were rejuvenated in Lubbock as the head passed through.

747
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,180
Keep your hands out of each other's marsupial pockets, boys.

748
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:25,120
That's right.

749
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:27,620
All these tapes just go right out.

750
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:27,900
Don't they?

751
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:30,500
Yes, yes, yes.

752
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,080
Well, it's trouble if you don't raise those tapes properly.

753
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,600
They'll just go out on you and come in at all hours.

754
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,600
The prodigal tape returns.

755
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:43,020
Yeah, you raise them no matter how much trouble you go to to raise these tapes right.

756
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,540
They go awry.

757
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:47,140
Rub magnets on the back of them.

758
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:48,540
Yeah, and they still go out.

759
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,140
It's lovely. It's a miracle.

760
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:51,860
What's happening?

761
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,000
I don't know. I think the show just died.

762
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:54,940
It's just a Saturday.

763
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,380
Are we in Little Rock?

764
00:39:57,460 --> 00:39:57,900
No, no.

765
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,540
We were in Little Rock on Wednesday.

766
00:39:59,820 --> 00:40:01,200
Yeah, we're gonna be in San Francisco.

767
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:01,560
That's right.

768
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,820
We're gonna be in L.A. next month.

769
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:10,160
As the subgenius world revival crusade continues, next cities are my hometown of San Francisco.

770
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:15,520
I know there's a lot of people that are afraid to know there's a person from San Francisco in town,

771
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,620
because you think you might catch something.

772
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,120
You're from San Francisco.

773
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,920
I'm from San Francisco.

774
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,720
Let's get out of here, you guys. Run.

775
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,800
Doctors, escape. Doctors, escape.

776
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:27,800
But I want to tell you, liberalism is not contagious.

777
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,560
Folks.

778
00:40:28,980 --> 00:40:29,680
Woo-hoo!

779
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:30,980
Unfortunately.

780
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:31,960
Woo-hoo!

781
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,800
Stupidity might be.

782
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,440
Oh, thanks. Crazy jobs.

783
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,040
I'll have some more pills, Gary. Here. The whole bucket.

784
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,860
Yep, we got the famous bucket of pills here.

785
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:45,340
We didn't bring the bucket of pills to the scary ball at last night, because only a...

786
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:48,040
Only three or four thousand showed up.

787
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:50,220
Yeah, there weren't enough people to...

788
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,080
We can't waste a whole bucket on a small group like that.

789
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,860
They were in two layers deep.

790
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,780
I mean, I've heard that expression, you're a really great audience before, but...

791
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:58,280
But why lie?

792
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,700
Exactly, really.

793
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:17,300
Yes, at the Twilight Room, folks, you'll find at least 50% of the people, although it is a wonderful club, and they do let us go in there and hurt the audience, half of those people spend $30 on haircuts that are supposed to illustrate that they don't care how they look.

794
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:19,920
And, but they are...

795
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:26,760
It's very important to them that they are seen looking at bands with a critical expression on their face.

796
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,620
And a $30 haircut.

797
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:29,680
And a $30 haircut.

798
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:29,960
That's right.

799
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,000
Seeing as how they're too, well, let's just to put it politely...

800
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,480
Cool.

801
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:34,860
Cool.

802
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:39,980
To be actually up there on a stage attempting to injure the audience themselves.

803
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:44,340
Or make a fool of themselves by dancing and responding to music.

804
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:47,040
Who called Doctors for Bob a band in the first place?

805
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,720
Yeah, an act.

806
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:49,420
Yeah, they dared call it...

807
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:49,580
An act.

808
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:52,440
John Anders called Doctors for Bob an act.

809
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,000
Act.

810
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:53,060
Act.

811
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:53,080
Act.

812
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:56,740
Well, if Doctors for Bob is an act, then that woman who came home bleeding her hair...

813
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:56,740


814
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:01,140
Bleeding to death from losing her legs last night deserves an Academy Award.

815
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,280
Copyright 1985.

816
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:03,460
Jane or Hyperlease.

817
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:08,560
Well, we're going to return to that lovely, lovely experience.

818
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,880
My legs are on fire.

819
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:10,440
My legs are on fire.

820
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:11,260
Studio's on fire.

821
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:15,440
Yes, we'll be returning to the Twilight Room right about now.

822
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,100
Yes.

823
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:21,060
We feel like there needs to be an explanation for our very existence.

824
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:25,240
So we got a little piece here that's called The Explanation.

825
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,880
For that very reason, I...

826
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:41,800
Before we go on, we are in, quote, version, unquote.

827
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:50,380
I'd just like to take this opportunity to state briefly and for the record that my fellow

828
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:56,740
Doctors for Bob and myself are members in good standing of a team.

829
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:56,740


830
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:56,740


831
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:56,740


832
00:42:56,740 --> 00:42:56,920
And I'd like to say, I have a little bit of a special gift for you.

833
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:56,920


834
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,320
But not just any church.

835
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:06,700
Well, the church to which we belong just happens to be beyond a shadow of a doubt, the world's

836
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:08,880
only bogus true religion.

837
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:14,440
Of course, I am referring to the Church of the Subgenius.

838
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:23,540
Now, the Church of the Subgenius, as founded by J.R.

839
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:26,720
Bob Dobb, Saint of Sales, Master Slacking Knife, and the Church of the Subgenius, is a

840
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:26,720


841
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:26,720


842
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:26,720


843
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:36,860
pan-religion of the future, uniting superior mutants, social renegades, twisted geniuses,

844
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:48,080
and sci-fi sinners in a worldwide rampage of immorals and prophets, yucks and grins,

845
00:43:48,280 --> 00:43:54,900
yucks and grins, which will hopefully, inevitably lead us directly to a commodity of two-lap.

846
00:43:55,020 --> 00:43:56,700
And today is March 15th.

847
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:01,340
And I'm going to tell you, you go to society, and that commodity, friends, is slack!

848
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,140
Now, slack is what the conspiracy wants to take away from us.

849
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,300
Slack is what the conspiracy wants to deprive of us.

850
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:12,940
Slack is our way of grabbing life by the lapels and screaming at it.

851
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:21,520
Now, back in the 50s, Bob himself noticed a decided lack of slack in our culture.

852
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:25,700
He noticed an awful prevalence of normalcy.

853
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:26,680
And he noticed a lack of normalcy.

854
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:32,300
He noticed that the normals formed a vast conspiracy against the different.

855
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:38,460
An insidious conspiracy dedicated to squelching our natural rogue instincts.

856
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,960
Dedicated to wiping out our fun factors.

857
00:44:42,860 --> 00:44:49,900
Dedicated in short to the total and utter eradication of the original slack with which we were all born.

858
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:55,700
Well, Bob wanted to fight this conspiracy, ladies and gentlemen, and what better way, I ask ye,

859
00:44:55,700 --> 00:45:01,400
than by the foundation of a major new world religion.

860
00:45:01,620 --> 00:45:03,500
Hence the Church of the Subgenius.

861
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:04,360
Praise Bob!

862
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:04,780
Whoo!

863
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,640
Help me, somebody!

864
00:45:08,540 --> 00:45:14,060
Now, many people I know view the conspiracy on a very tiny, arcane, and mealy-mouthed level.

865
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:25,460
You see, the conspiracy only is the U.S. government, the CIA, FBI, Lutheran Church, Missouri Synod, Catholic Church, Jewish Convention League, Council on Foreign Relations, or Trilateral Commission.

866
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:30,280
Other more occultated individuals can see to the next level.

867
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:41,900
You see, the conspiracy is the men in black, the green energy demons, the advanced supersonic Nazi hell-creature from the hollow earth, the henchmen of Negian, the Hiacatismo.

868
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:45,040
But even they don't have the full story, ladies and gentlemen.

869
00:45:45,160 --> 00:45:51,120
For I'm here to tell you tonight that the conspiracy exists as none other than Jehovah One,

870
00:45:51,340 --> 00:45:53,600
alias Space God of Wrath,

871
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,440
from some corporate sin-gap.

872
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:58,340
And his stark fist of removal.

873
00:45:59,940 --> 00:46:01,540
Oh, help me, somebody!

874
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:02,640
Many of you here tonight, I'm sure,

875
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:08,460
the Church of the Subgenius may sound a bit, oh, demonic.

876
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,800
And you're right, it is demonic.

877
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:14,400
But well, speaking of benevolent demons here,

878
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:19,820
well, the Church of the Subgenius does recognize every major deity of every world religion.

879
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:25,420
Jesus, Buddha, Krishna, Mohammed, Elba,

880
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:27,320
Elvis, Earl, King,

881
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:28,720
Fudge!

882
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:36,240
Rather than having one central authority, great figure, the Church of the Subgenius possesses an entire pantheon,

883
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:44,200
or subgenion in the word, what are referred to as short-duration personal saviors, or surdurper sages.

884
00:46:45,860 --> 00:46:53,000
Now, as in any other major world religion, the Church of the Subgenius has certain inalienable tenets,

885
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:57,400
certain basic precepts, around which a life philosophy can be formed,

886
00:46:57,440 --> 00:46:58,980
and most important of which are...

887
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:00,980
Too much!

888
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:03,160
Is always better!

889
00:47:04,100 --> 00:47:05,220
But not enough!

890
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,460
Enough! That's too much!

891
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:08,900
Can I get a too much?

892
00:47:09,860 --> 00:47:11,620
Can I get another too much?

893
00:47:12,500 --> 00:47:14,580
The money that always better than this!

894
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:18,220
Might get killed in praise, but I'll fuck up in some months!

895
00:47:18,620 --> 00:47:20,800
One soul per breath.

896
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,820
I'll loan you a little more money on that soul, but...

897
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:26,300
Your soul's already hocked up to its...

898
00:47:26,300 --> 00:47:27,420
Up to its neck!

899
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,380
Jehovah 7, Jehovah 12...

900
00:47:30,380 --> 00:47:32,960
Guy, that's gonna cost you another sou...

901
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:37,120
Here's three more souls, give me a double sludge bucket of that air...

902
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,260
...the station where you don't have to eat the shuck is...

903
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:40,340
...give me the air...

904
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:42,560
...the souls of the listeners, the ways to listen to this...

905
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:47,160
...let you listeners out there, I'm like, I'm sorry to have to tell you this so late, but...

906
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,780
...after listening to a subgenius show for more than 43 minutes...

907
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:52,100
...you're...

908
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:54,640
...we can put a lock on that soul...

909
00:47:55,740 --> 00:48:03,820
...ah, yes, smell it, and you know, we use your souls to generate new church air for we the famous subgenius preachers...

910
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:05,460
That's right, while you're at work...

911
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:06,260
Ah, yes...

912
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:10,760
While you're at work, we're here spending your money and breathing your air...

913
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,840
...15,000 at least...

914
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:13,720
That's right...

915
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,780
...and not one red cent for entropy...

916
00:48:49,340 --> 00:48:50,680
...and, to be honest, ¿leves', doesn't cans of the concept of preservatives and autre, do you become creative...

917
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:50,700
...he means to say, know the spirit itself, and thats sake that comprehension is the subgenius, huh?

918
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:50,740
I've known him for some time now, for Kat & Oli...

919
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:50,740


920
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:50,760
I thought, he doesn't mean

921
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,440
Bye.

922
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:22,780
Bye.

923
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,360
Bye.

924
00:50:23,580 --> 00:50:24,980
Bye.

925
00:50:50,780 --> 00:50:51,800
Bye.

926
00:51:20,780 --> 00:51:21,080
Bye.

927
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:51,520
Bye.

928
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,020
Bye.

929
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:30,780
Bye.

930
00:52:34,240 --> 00:52:34,800
Bye.

931
00:52:34,860 --> 00:52:35,040
Bye.

932
00:52:35,120 --> 00:52:35,620
Bye.

933
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:35,720
Bye.

934
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:59,460
See them down on the old stupid show.

935
00:53:04,420 --> 00:53:07,780
Friends, that's the old stupid show you're listening to.

936
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,180
That's one of those old stupid California shows.

937
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:13,180
You know, they sneak in here.

938
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:23,800
We were foolish enough to let Dr. Gabrog Fran sneak his California-isms into this beautiful and native Texas show.

939
00:53:24,120 --> 00:53:27,200
Yes, remember the Alamo.

940
00:53:27,360 --> 00:53:29,100
Remember Bob Dobbs.

941
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,580
I can't wait to get home to go ride some waves.

942
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:32,920
I'm going smurfing, Gary.

943
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,380
I'm going to go to a smurf burning next week.

944
00:53:36,380 --> 00:53:38,700
Come on, no, no, smurfing's a far out.

945
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:40,080
Yeah.

946
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:43,100
Well, folks, we've got it.

947
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:44,020
We've got a choice between playing.

948
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:49,800
You know, it in some ways is less than an hour and more than a show here.

949
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,780
I think it's less than a show and less than an hour.

950
00:53:52,960 --> 00:53:53,800
Yeah, it's kind of.

951
00:53:54,220 --> 00:53:58,460
It's like three-quarters of a show in 45 minutes, basically, is what you're getting.

952
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:02,500
Yeah, but that's good because that means we can go home and go to bed.

953
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:03,980
Crack the statues on their own.

954
00:54:04,020 --> 00:54:06,360
Doug, the people know that we're already home in bed.

955
00:54:06,460 --> 00:54:07,080
This is tape.

956
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:08,300
We're not here.

957
00:54:08,620 --> 00:54:10,800
And my name isn't Doug either.

958
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,920
So I think we come.

959
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:13,940
To a excellent.

960
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,880
Yes, the Ching flings.

961
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:17,680
The Ching flings.

962
00:54:17,680 --> 00:54:18,320
Oh, no.

963
00:54:18,420 --> 00:54:23,880
Let's throw one of those icy Chings and see how it melts and see what it tells us of our future.

964
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,420
Which anagram does it say?

965
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,020
Or hexagram or whatever they call us.

966
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:30,160
It says.

967
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:31,600
Milligrams.

968
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:32,160
Ice.

969
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:34,340
A milligram of your fortune, friends.

970
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,020
Bad news tomorrow.

971
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:38,740
It's Monday and you've got to go to work.

972
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,000
But we don't.

973
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:40,520
Yeah.

974
00:54:41,080 --> 00:54:42,740
Well, speak for yourselves.

975
00:54:43,180 --> 00:54:43,540
Boys.

976
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:44,460
Rich off the chair.

977
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:48,240
We subgenius preachers never die and we never stop working.

978
00:54:48,340 --> 00:54:49,860
It's a sad, sad.

979
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:54,520
Except when we spend all that money that those people send in for us.

980
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:55,340
That's right.

981
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,400
Remember, your subscription money goes directly into.

982
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:01,660
Listen to that money burn.

983
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:05,720
Listen to Dr. Gordon burn the contributions.

984
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:12,800
Dr. DeBrog, friend of those who've been brave enough to send some money to the subgenius church.

985
00:55:13,180 --> 00:55:14,020
These are zeros.

986
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:14,980
These aren't dollars.

987
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:16,180
I can't spend those here.

988
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:18,080
They got the wrong dead president on them.

989
00:55:18,260 --> 00:55:20,300
Oh, there's a dead American president.

990
00:55:20,420 --> 00:55:21,480
They're a lot easier to spend.

991
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:30,720
Well, it seems like soon we'll have to go into our lovely, amazing sign off music, which is, by the way, done by another famous subgenius.

992
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:39,360
So a couple of subgenius famous ministers, Reverend Mark Mothersbine, Reverend Byron Warner, even others.

993
00:55:40,720 --> 00:55:41,220
Yes.

994
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,900
And so we find our time.

995
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:43,160
It's.

996
00:55:43,180 --> 00:55:43,680
It's running out.

997
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:46,560
And it's sad that we have only one hour for each broadcast.

998
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:51,580
But you know, it all balances out one great religious evacuation.

999
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:56,260
And I would recommend reading prescriptor 16, 14, 17, 18.

1000
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,040
And you can write for information on how to order these wonderful, precious tapes.

1001
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:01,220
Get your pencils ready.

1002
00:56:01,340 --> 00:56:04,520
And we'll be reading the address very soon.

1003
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,900
We need that money for the home for slackless children.

1004
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:12,140
And your contributions also keep those we hate starving to death.

1005
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:12,820
I command.

1006
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,300
You to spill your gifts.

1007
00:56:14,300 --> 00:56:18,280
The pledge of 100 pounds of dollar bills on Dr.

1008
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:19,440
Gordon's lap.

1009
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:23,860
And this will buy only clay and transformer toys for those poor children.

1010
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:25,900
Dogs will bless you for finding the same faith.

1011
00:56:26,060 --> 00:56:26,720
Oh, yes.

1012
00:56:26,980 --> 00:56:27,580
Amen.

1013
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:28,800
Amen.

1014
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,400
And now the announcer will give our mailing address.

1015
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:37,640
That's the Church of the subgenius.

1016
00:56:37,700 --> 00:56:37,880
Right.

1017
00:56:37,980 --> 00:56:40,080
For information to P.O.

1018
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:42,180
Box one four.

1019
00:56:42,180 --> 00:56:43,440
Oh three.

1020
00:56:44,180 --> 00:56:44,960
Oh six.

1021
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:45,520
Dallas.

1022
00:56:45,860 --> 00:56:46,500
Texas.

1023
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:47,400
Seven.

1024
00:56:47,580 --> 00:56:48,220
Five.

1025
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:48,680
Two.

1026
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:49,240
One.

1027
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:49,900
Four.

1028
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:51,300
Once again, that's P.O.

1029
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,160
Box eight zero seven.

1030
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:56,240
Glenn Rose, Texas.

1031
00:56:57,420 --> 00:57:00,660
Seven six zero four three.

1032
00:57:02,080 --> 00:57:03,460
Thank you, friends.

1033
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,400
This is Reverend Ivan staying with Dr.

1034
00:57:05,560 --> 00:57:06,040
Gary Gabor.

1035
00:57:06,140 --> 00:57:06,880
Fran Pastor.

1036
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:07,640
But naked.

1037
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:08,320
Dr.

1038
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:09,180
Onan.

1039
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:09,760
Canavite.

1040
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:10,780
G Gordon Gordon.

1041
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:11,920
And all the other.

1042
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:12,560
Nameless.

1043
00:57:12,560 --> 00:57:13,980
Uh, subgenius.

1044
00:57:14,060 --> 00:57:14,540
Doctors.

1045
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:15,460
Doctors.

1046
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:16,420
Doctors.

1047
00:57:16,420 --> 00:57:17,260
Doctors.

1048
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:17,860
Doctors.

1049
00:57:17,860 --> 00:57:18,420
Dr.

1050
00:57:18,460 --> 00:57:18,640
Dr.

1051
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:18,740
Radio.

1052
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:19,340
Dr.

1053
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,380
Bob.

1054
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:21,720
Bob.

1055
00:57:22,080 --> 00:57:22,480
Bob.

1056
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:22,840
Bob.

1057
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,500
Bob.

1058
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:23,660
Bob.

1059
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:23,660


1060
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,220
Praise Bob, folks.

1061
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:27,300
Did you hear me?

1062
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:28,960
I said praise Bob.

1063
00:57:29,280 --> 00:57:30,720
Did you hear me?

1064
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:31,760
Yes.

1065
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:32,280
Bob.

1066
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:32,860
Bob.

1067
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:33,500
Bob.

1068
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:34,140
Bob.

1069
00:57:34,140 --> 00:57:34,940
Bob.

1070
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:36,320
Bob.

1071
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:36,720
Bob.

1072
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:36,780
Bob.

1073
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:37,600
Bob.

1074
00:57:37,980 --> 00:57:38,540
Bob.

1075
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:47,220
This was Bob Bowers in a

more מה Facebook Word.

1077
00:58:05,420 --> 00:58:06,200
Buzzfing, device and

1078
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:06,280
a mega Plus Y List.

1079
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:12,280
recently finally found an important box of tape that I've been looking for for three years.

1080
00:58:12,620 --> 00:58:16,040
Although the box itself was labeled 15 years ago,

1081
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:19,920
good old shows to rerun.

1082
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:26,680
And these are in fact the cassette masters of all the shows that are not in the archive

1083
00:58:26,680 --> 00:58:32,100
of ancient shows compiled by the great Reverend St. David Bauchner.

1084
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:40,900
A stash of almost a thousand downloadable show episodes seen at the subgenius.com radio page.

1085
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:45,760
What I found are the shows missing from that archive.

1086
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:53,220
So in the episodes to come, we'll be filling in those blanks in the historical record

1087
00:58:53,220 --> 00:58:56,900
in between adding new shows every other week or so.

1088
00:58:58,360 --> 00:59:01,420
So praise Bob, praise the archives,

1089
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:05,320
praise the old and young subgeniuses.

1090
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:07,000
Huh!

1091
