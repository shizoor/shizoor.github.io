1
00:00:01,900 --> 00:00:02,340
Who's there?

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,720
The Self Genius Power of Slack!

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,200
Now I know all about everything.

4
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:13,260
What? Yeah, yeah, yep, yeah, yeah!

5
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:22,040
Uh, yes, yes, yes, dear friends, I'm swamped, I'm beat, I'm whooped.

6
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:32,460
It's, um, as of this recording, for this hour of Slack number 944, it's like May 25th or 26th or something,

7
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:42,040
we just got done with a big and wonderfully successful, uh, devival here in Cleveland at the Beachland Ballroom

8
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:51,700
with Mann and the Amino Acids, Reverend Carter LeBlanc, Reverend Nicky Deathchick, and Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

9
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:59,520
And you're not gonna hear any of it tonight, because it's going to take too long to do it justice in the editing.

10
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:02,020
We've got good recordings, though.

11
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:14,000
Uh, you'll be glad to know, however, that instead we have a rerun of, uh, the, a great episode of Bob's Slack Time Fun House from WREK.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,460
It'll only be a rerun to listeners in noble WREK in Atlanta.

13
00:01:18,980 --> 00:01:22,020
Uh, but it's a, a lymph node intro.

14
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:29,880
It's a Lymphnode Institute production about, uh, on the subject of, uh, evolution and, uh, creationism and all like that.

15
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,860
And, uh, since, um, I get more compliments about the, uh, Lymphnode Institute shows than I do about my own shows,

16
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:47,120
that is, a compliment, uh, I don't guess anybody will mind.

17
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,880
So, uh, Lymphnode Institute, dear friends.

18
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,520
With their evolution, uh, special.

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,480
Uh, praise WREK Atlanta.

20
00:01:57,820 --> 00:02:00,840
And, and, uh, this station.

21
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:13,080
Well, leave it to the Christian right to go and spoil our fun.

22
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:21,920
But, even their cowardice and surrender will not stop us from running the second evolution show.

23
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,100
You are listening to Bob's Slack Time Fun House.

24
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,400
The Lymphnode Institute edition.

25
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:31,220
I gotta get my gum out.

26
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,540
The Lymphnode Institute edition.

27
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,140
So how long you been chewing that gum?

28
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,080
About four years.

29
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,280
And that's nicotine withdrawal gum?

30
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,180
Technically, yes.

31
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,540
But it's got nicotine in it?

32
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,140
It sure does.

33
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,060
Four years?

34
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:41,680
Four years.

35
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,880
Aren't you afraid that that's gonna elicit some sort of biological change over time in your body?

36
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,760
Uh, not really.

37
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:50,940
I think I've already lost all my teeth, so I don't see what else could change.

38
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,600
You could get scales down your throat.

39
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,640
That could be a change over time that happens in Yatensany, is to evolve...

40
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,700
Oh, I'm sorry.

41
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:03,180
Is to, uh, gradually acquire scales down the throat to protect them from the barbs.

42
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,100
And please, please don't use the E word here.

43
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,840
We are in Georgia.

44
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:06,780
I wouldn't do that.

45
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,760
Powers of the Beast say that the E-V-L-O-V-E word...

46
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:11,860
Oh, it's got the word love in it.

47
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,740
How can that be evil?

48
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:17,040
Is, is not appropriate in Georgia because it's a negatively valenced buzzword.

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,400
And it stands for science.

50
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:21,320
Well, it's a, it's a theory that they've done a lot of work on over time.

51
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,900
They'd prove it if they could, but it's difficult because it's all past tense research.

52
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,620
Uh, where do you think we'd be if the Bible had something to say about how, uh, diseases are transmitted?

53
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,200
You think we'd still be arguing over the germ theory?

54
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,360
In Sodom and Gomorrah, they had sex with this green monkey.

55
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:40,220
And, and when they had sex with this green monkey, uh, a germ flew up into the sky.

56
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:45,100
And everyone decided that it was a, a harbinger of, of God's love for them.

57
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,500
Uh-huh.

58
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,260
And they went to it.

59
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,060
And it made their skin fall off.

60
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:48,960
And God's love.

61
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,680
God plus love equals a green monkey's ass.

62
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,960
Right, and that's a lost scripture.

63
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,800
Well, of course.

64
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,600
The Bible's been heavily, uh...

65
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:55,960
Edited?

66
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,200
Edited.

67
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:57,620
Censored, if you will.

68
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,180
Yeah, that's part of the Dead Semen Scrolls.

69
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,440
I'm a disciple of science.

70
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,600
I know the universe is in full compliance with natural laws.

71
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,380
But many place reliance on the pseudoscience of quacks and morons and fools.

72
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,180
Because their education's deficient, they put faith in omniscient.

73
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,160
They believe beings who control their fate.

74
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,460
But the heart ain't ribbit.

75
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,000
Take it.

76
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,660
Their holy rib ain't the least bit legit.

77
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,240
It's a lie.

78
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:17,080
It's a bunch of a-chokes.

79
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,240
They need to read a book that's not so damn old.

80
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,280
Let reason take hold.

81
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,380
The truth to be told.

82
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,300
They're probably already too far gone.

83
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,080
Withdrawn.

84
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:25,560
The conclusion foregone.

85
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:29,440
But maybe there is still hope for the young if they reject the tongue being slung from

86
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:33,220
the tongues of the ignorant fools who call themselves creatures and listen instead to

87
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,160
their science teachers.

88
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,420
Upon blind faith, they place reliance.

89
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,600
What we need more of is science.

90
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,560
Upon blind faith, they place reliance.

91
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,900
What we need more of is science.

92
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,860
Upon blind faith, they place reliance.

93
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,240
What we need more of is science.

94
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:51,480
What we need more of is science.

Prove the whole lot of them.

Look, I hate Thomas Wilkie.

105
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,420
Science doesn't blind me.

106
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,120
Think you're smart?

107
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,460
Form a line behind me.

108
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,380
You won't find me.

109
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:06,160
Truth to tell.

110
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,460
To be a man who suffers rules very well.

111
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,140
I'd be opposite.

112
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,720
In fact, ain't got time to interact with crystal-wearing freaks in need of a snack.

113
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,040
New Age Motherfuckers.

114
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:14,960
Don't get me started.

115
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,260
Made more sense to them the last time I parted.

116
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,280
Not to put too fine a point upon it, but the whole New Age movement is full of bitch.

117
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,080
Please allow me to elaborate.

118
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,420
Explicate.

119
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:25,640
Extatiate.

120
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,560
From astral projection to об dilatación.

121
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,580
It's a mishmash of idiocy.

122
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,180
Instead of the archaic worship of seasons, they should explore logic and reason.

123
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,380
Upon blind faith they place reliance.

124
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,620
What need more of is science.

125
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,520
On blind faith they place reliance.

126
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,880
What need more of is science.

127
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,820
On blind faith they place reliance.

128
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,160
What need more of is science.

129
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:49,040
On blind faith they place reliance.

130
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:51,300
What need more of is science.

131
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,820
disgusting new agers.

132
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:57,860
Is there any amount of votish they won't swallow?

133
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:04,660
It's 2003 goddammit, when are these morons gonna join us in the 21st century?

134
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:40,760
So you can say semen in school and in biology class, but if you say evolution, Kathy Cox,

135
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,340
the Secretary of State I believe?

136
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:42,860
No.

137
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:43,940
Secretary of Education?

138
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:44,420
Yes.

139
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,960
She's decided that because of the people who, I don't know, maybe got her elected

140
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,500
or a thing, they keep coming back to this evolution.

141
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,800
There's a funny little story about how she did it.

142
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,300
She did get her job, Kathy Cox.

143
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,400
You just confused Kathy Cox, Secretary of Education, with Kathy Cox, Secretary of State.

144
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,220
Honest mistake.

145
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,080
And that's the honest mistake that everyone made at the polls.

146
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:10,120
They all thought they were voting for Kathy Cox, Secretary of State, because she is popular.

147
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,900
So it was a problem with homophones.

148
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,600
It was a problem with homophones.

149
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,540
I hate those homophones.

150
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,620
And they went on a, the Democratic Party went on this big drive about a week before

151
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,620
the election realizing that people had made this mistake.

152
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:22,740
It didn't work.

153
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,700
It's difficult to try to educate.

154
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:24,780
It's difficult to try to educate.

155
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,760
It's difficult to try to educate the voters a week before election time.

156
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,300
Damn.

157
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,420
So that's the kind of you get when you don't vote.

158
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,800
So we did a show on evolution before, but the whole topic came back and bit us in our

159
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,760
sensible asses.

160
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,080
Yeah, that's one of the things I love about living down here.

161
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:39,340
It gives us so much material for shows.

162
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:53,180
And now, a reading from a holy text, a holy learned text, biology for Christian schools,

163
00:07:53,180 --> 00:08:02,180
second edition, teacher's edition, book one, published by Bob Jones University Press, written

164
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:05,000
by William S. Pinkston.

165
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,820
I believe it because I've been told it.

166
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,340
And if I've been told it, it must be true.

167
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:10,640
God created me and God created you.

168
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,340
What does the Bible actually have to say about creation and the history of living things?

169
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,100
Some Christians seem to know more about what the Bible does not say on the subject than

170
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:20,940
what it does say.

171
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,160
Many Christians say they are anti-Christian.

172
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,160


173
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,120
They are anti-evolution and pro-Bible.

174
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:30,080
They are willing to say the Bible is right without knowing what right truly is.

175
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,560
They have no understanding of how the rightness of the Bible affects them.

176
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:40,160
The first step in taking any position is to know what the Bible says and then to apply

177
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:42,780
it to modern situations, don't you know?

178
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:47,940
For many students, this will be their first look at the evolution-creation controversy

179
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:51,020
in anything other than an anti-evolution framework.

180
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,160
The students will learn to understand the Bible.

181
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,140
They will learn what the Bible says regarding creation in more depth than a typical Sunday

182
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,300
school presentation of Adam and Eve.

183
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,140
Creation is in itself scientifically unexplainable.

184
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:11,060
Knowing why or how God created things the way he did is not only beyond the scope of

185
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:17,140
science for it cannot be observed, but also beyond the comprehension of human minds.

186
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,440
Some Christians interpret the seven days in Genesis 1 as seven ages.

187
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,000
This interpretation is sometimes called the long day theory.

188
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:30,320
One day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day is often cited

189
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,940
as support for the long day theory.

190
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,440
This passage, however, simply teaches that God is eternal and timeless.

191
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:40,040
Most people who hold the long day theory are attempting to put enough time in the Genesis

192
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,800
account of creation for evolution to take place.

193
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:47,520
This is an attempt to prove that God directed or permitted the evolution of the universe

194
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:50,460
rather than actually created it as he did.

195
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,420
If God is eternal, then he is eternal.

196
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:57,380
If God says he created the world in six days, and man refuses to believe it, then man is

197
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,820
calling God a liar.

198
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:03,320
Some Bible-believing Christians believe in the long day theory.

199
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:08,800
It does not directly contradict Scripture, but a person who believes in the long day

200
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:15,380
theory, for the purpose of appearing more scientific, is a theistic evolutionist, and

201
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,260
his motive is unacceptable.

202
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:21,400
Other Christians believe that the days in Genesis 1 are twenty years, but in reality,

203
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:22,260
24 hour periods.

204
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,760
This belief is the Short Day Theory.

205
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,540
The Short Day Theory is supported by the phrase, the evening and the morning, repeated often

206
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:35,960
in Genesis, and by the fact that the sequence of events described requires speed.

207
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:57,840
It is to believe that a creation of such complexity and design could just happen.

208
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,260
That's right.

209
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:03,000
All the theories in this book are a lot harder to swallow than the fact that God created

210
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:03,460
it all.

211
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,160
Come on, Jim.

212
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,360
You can't say that.

213
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,340
You know that the theory of evolution is...

214
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:10,080
Yeah, but if you set their left out to reach the final state, too, please, you...

215
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:18,120
You're not ashamed to admit to the whole class that you think God created it all.

216
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
And why should I be ashamed if I believe it?

217
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,400
Come on, Jim.

218
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,360
You can't say that you believe all this without some reservation.

219
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,120
Oh, PKT...

220
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,740
Man, no God can fill your head with a bunch of dung that doesn't make any sense.

221
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,320
All right, then.

222
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:36,100
Tell me, do all of you think that God just waved his magic wand, and presto, here we

223
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:36,400
are?

224
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,280
Presto!

225
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:41,080
Well, now, I, for one, don't claim to know everything about it.

226
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:45,440
Well, I don't know how God did it, or how long one of God's working days may have lasted.

227
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:49,980
But there are a lot of things which he doesn't explain in detail, just as a surgeon doesn't

228
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,400
explain the minor points of an operation.

229
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,340
Or an electrician, the workings of electricity.

230
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:58,700
But the results are there, and we believe them, and their results.

231
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,240
So I find no trouble in believing that.

232
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,660
In the beginning, God made the world...

233
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:09,980
And the waters, and the grass, and the serbs, and the fruit trees.

234
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,320
And then God said, that's good.

235
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,100
God made the rivers and the rocks, and the sand.

236
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:18,500
Everything came out just the way that he planned.

237
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,860
He made the sun, and the moon, and the stars...

238
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,000
It took him six days to make a plan

239
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,780
So on the seventh day he rested

240
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,220
God looked at everything he made and saw

241
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,220
It took him six days to make a plan

242
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:40,280
So on the seventh day he rested

243
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,280
Then God made all the animals

244
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,060
God made a duck and taught it to quack

245
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,140
Every kind of animal that lives on earth

246
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,300
He made the tiger and the grizzly bear

247
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,540
He made everything and everybody everywhere

248
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,440
He made the sea, he let the fish and the whales

249
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,720
He made the body and the bones and the legs and the legs and the arms

250
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:05,300
He made the bird and the bird and the bird and the dog

251
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,540
And the little dog and the little dog and the little dog

252
00:13:06,540 --> 00:13:10,780
God looked at everything he made and saw

253
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,860
It took him six days to make a plan

254
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:16,640
So on the seventh day he rested

255
00:13:16,640 --> 00:13:17,900
And said that's good

256
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,960
In the beginning God made man

257
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:24,140
He made his own image

258
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,800
God made a man on the very last day

259
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:30,200
Taught him work, taught him to pray

260
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,920
And all he needed was a river to sign

261
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
And his wife was Eve

262
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,480
On the first day he had to get saved

263
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,060
Then he made a plan

264
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,980
So on the seventh day he rested

265
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,300
God made a man

266
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:42,740
He made everything and everybody everywhere

267
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,140
He made everything and everybody everywhere

268
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:43,140


269
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,600
So on the seventh day he rested

270
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:44,680
And said that's good

271
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,880
So on the seventh day he rested

272
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,400
And said that's good

273
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,120
It took him six days to make a plan

274
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,160
So on the seventh day he rested

275
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,240
And said that's good

276
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,680
Before God made the heaven and the earth

277
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,140
There was nothing, nothing

278
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:07,300
All these wonderful things were made by God

279
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,080
How do we know?

280
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,680
The Bible tells us so

281
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,400
Knowing what one believes is not enough

282
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,120
One must also understand what others believe

283
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,880
If not, he will either be lost or be destroyed

284
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,500
If not, he will either be led astray

285
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,240
Or be unable to lead others in his position

286
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,640
Thus Christian students need to study evolution

287
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,840
If only to refute it

288
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:30,980
If one believes the Bible is the infallible, inerrant word of God

289
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:34,480
He can easily say that an evolutionary position is not correct

290
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,220
Because it contradicts the Bible

291
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,440
But a person who does not accept the Bible

292
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,300
Will not automatically take that position

293
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,440
Can anything be done to show an evolutionist the error of his ways?

294
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,860
The only thing that can be done is to show the weakness of the evolutionist's position

295
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,060
And to show that the evolutionist's argument is not correct

296
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,820
And there are weaknesses

297
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:54,880
Or to present scientific evidence as contrary to those he uses

298
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:58,080
A teacher must be careful not to dwell on this material

299
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:02,080
Five years from now, few students will be able to recall the details

300
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:04,860
And they should not be taught as though expected to do so

301
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,340
The goal is clear exposure to these arguments

302
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,160
So that students know they exist

303
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,140
And know how to obtain information about them

304
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,900
Then they will not be led astray

305
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,820
And will realize that somewhere someone could give an answer

306
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,840
That is often all that is necessary to be able to understand the Bible

307
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:17,840


308
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,000
And that is what is necessary to keep from falling prey to the enemy

309
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,480
And let us not forget the effects of Darwin's theories

310
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,200
Darwin's support of the inheritance of acquired characteristics

311
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,320
And improvement through struggle

312
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,400
Was just what many of the people of his day wanted

313
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,420
In fact, a contemporary of Darwin

314
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:38,620
A Mr. Karl Marx

315
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:41,660
Was so in favor of these evolutionary concepts

316
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:45,060
That he wanted to dedicate his communistic work

317
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,460
Das Kapital

318
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,700
To Darwin

319
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,200
Darwin's theories are comparable with communism

320
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,020
Which teaches that through collective effort

321
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,980
Man can improve his existence

322
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:59,340
Because it supported communistic philosophy

323
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:03,780
Lamarck's concept of the inheritance of acquired characteristics

324
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:09,020
Was until recently officially supported by the Russian government

325
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:13,300
Darwin's theories have been used to support environmental determinism

326
00:16:13,300 --> 00:16:15,560
The concept that the environment determines

327
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,820
What an individual is

328
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:19,600
The concept blames the world around a person

329
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,140
For the sin he commits

330
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:23,560
According to environmental determinism

331
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,220
A drunkard is not a sinner

332
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,460
Because he drinks

333
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,460
But a victim of his environment

334
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:30,680
His environment drove him to drink

335
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,540
The Christian view of man

336
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,180
That man was created perfect

337
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:36,120
But is now a wicked sinner

338
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,040
Who is responsible for his sin

339
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:40,260
Is by comparison unappealing

340
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,640
The Bible places the blame for sin on the individual

341
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:46,260
It says that man cannot save himself

342
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:48,120
But is in need of the savior

343
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,020
Darwinian evolution promises great things

344
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:52,480
Great things in the future

345
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,340
If man works at it

346
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:58,680
Darwinism is therefore contrary to God and his word

347
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,940
In that it blames natural causes for man's present state

348
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:05,360
And hopes in natural causes for man's future

349
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:09,440
In contrast the Bible blames man for his condition

350
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,320
And presents God as man's only hope

351
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,400
That was Biology for Christian Schools Teacher's Edition

352
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,280
Published by Bob Jones University

353
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,060
Written by William S. Pinkston

354
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:22,500
Yes, that was a real textbook

355
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:26,400
The issue is that there's a politician here in Georgia

356
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,460
Who's decided that the word evolution ruffles too many feathers

357
00:17:30,460 --> 00:17:35,520
Specifically the feathers of the people who help her decide her doctrines

358
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,680
She knows she's gonna get voted out of office

359
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,180
And she's trying to take the other Cathy Cox with her

360
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:42,220
Sort of the reverse Cathy Cox principle

361
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,060
I'm afraid that the UN army is gonna invade Georgia

362
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:47,520
And how the hell am I gonna explain being a white guy

363
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,400
You know, no, no, I'm not one of them

364
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,560
You look like one of them

365
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,280
All they gotta do is expand their definition of terrorist even further

366
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,360
And then they, you know, as an enemy combatant during wartime

367
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,940
In an endless war, they can keep you wherever they want

368
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,880
With no charges filed for as long as they want

369
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,940
Now that's evolution

370
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,900
And I see how a democracy can evolve into a police state

371
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:07,720
Isn't that nice?

372
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:09,700
Into a totalitarian regime

373
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,860
Has anybody else noticed how close together

374
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,100
George Bush's eyes are?

375
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,380
And Crystal Bernard

376
00:18:14,380 --> 00:18:17,100
The ridiculous, but this is a happy song

377
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,560
A song that they sang in the Sunday morning service

378
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,820
That was televised nationwide

379
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:23,800
In the which two precious little girls were singing

380
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,180
Robin, but I'm sure after you refute the Bible account of creation

381
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:30,080
You'll want to be hearing it again

382
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,320
By the miracle of recording

383
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,840
It's the monkey song

384
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:37,160
And it's about the, we had so many requests for them to do it again

385
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,020
That that's exactly what they did

386
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:40,720
You'll want to be hearing it again

387
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:44,040
It's their answer to the ridiculous theory of evolution

388
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,960
I'm no kin to the monkey, no, no, no

389
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,960
The monkey's no kin to me, yeah, yeah, yeah

390
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,120
I don't know much about his ancestors

391
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,300
But mine didn't swing from a tree

392
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:02,200
It seems so unbelievable

393
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:05,320
And yet they're saying it's true

394
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,460
They're teaching us about it in school now

395
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,460
That humans were monkeys

396
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,020
And that's why they're saying it's true

397
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,760
I'm no kin to the monkey, no, no, no, no

398
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:17,400
The monkey's no kin to me, yeah, yeah, yeah

399
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:20,220
I don't know much about his ancestors

400
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,560
But mine didn't swing from a tree

401
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:51,580
And yet they're saying it's true

402
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:54,520
My laughing sound is really weird

403
00:19:54,520 --> 00:20:03,680
Yup, I think that's a bit of a memory

404
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:03,680


405
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:03,680


406
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:03,680


407
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:04,520
When people come into my house

408
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:04,920
Those musicians pick from two Eldorado records

409
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:05,360
Bingo!

410
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,260
We saw Romanια

411
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:09,460
que�ey

412
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,560
Christianity is stupid!

413
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,860
Go Mundo!

414
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,540
Go Mundo!

415
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,380
Communism is good!

416
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,460
Go Mundo!

417
00:20:40,820 --> 00:20:43,560
Go Mundo!

418
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,380
Go Mundo!

419
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:57,360
Go Mundo!

420
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,480
Go Mundo!

421
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,920
Did you hear that?

422
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,040
Give up!

423
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:04,140
Give up!

424
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,720
Go Mundo!

425
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:08,780
Go Mundo!

426
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,000
Christianity is stupid!

427
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:18,420
Christianity is stupid!

428
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:22,160
Go Mundo!

429
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:24,040
Go Mundo!

430
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,020
Communism is good!

431
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,420
Communism is good!

432
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:36,660
From 5 o'clock in the morning till 10 o'clock at night, go Mundo, go Mundo, go Mundo, go Mundo.

433
00:21:36,660 --> 00:22:01,780
Go Mundo, go Mundo, go Mundo.

434
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:08,480
Tonight.

435
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:12,260
Ambulance is good. Christianity is stupid.

436
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,840
Tonight is ThruNight.

437
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:18,360
ThruNight.

438
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:21,820
Give up, give up, give up.

439
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,260
ThruNight.

440
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:28,640
Give up, give up, give up.

441
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,480
ThruNight.

442
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,220
Tonight is ThruNight.

443
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,140
17 hours a day.

444
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:36,640
ThruNight.

445
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,300
ThruNight.

446
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:50,220
KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL.

447
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:52,660
Give up, give up, give up.

448
00:22:54,980 --> 00:23:02,540
Back when the Bible was done like 2000 years ago or whatever, people obviously lived for hundreds of years like Noah did,

449
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:05,540
and then once the Dark Ages hit they lived to like 30.

450
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,640
The Bible never lies.

451
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:08,900
You know, history is always crystal clear.

452
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:11,160
It never screws up anything.

453
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,440
It never multiplies people's lifespans by a factor of 10 or 20.

454
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:19,420
Of course, we've always measured years, days, hours, and everything the same way.

455
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:20,320
By the Christian calendar.

456
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:20,920
Yeah, exactly.

457
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,920
Which is funny, being that it wasn't around.

458
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,260
It was all spoken word history.

459
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:24,960
Operator.

460
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,560
But nobody can remember what words started the little playtime.

461
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:31,780
Luckily, there's an evolution of human society,

462
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:35,620
because 500 years ago, people like us were burned at the stake.

463
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:39,440
50 years ago, we were imprisoned, and now they give us our own radio show.

464
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,340
So perhaps in 50 more years, we'll actually get paid.

465
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:42,980
Ooh.

466
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,140
Yeah, but...

467
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:59,600
So it's pretty obvious that regardless of how the hell we got here,

468
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:03,240
we are evolving and are changing, thankfully, which is good.

469
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:05,540
Now, those transitional fossils are tools.

470
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:09,180
Tools of the devil to test everyone's faith in God and creationism.

471
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,260
See? See how logical it all is?

472
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,240
It's the devil.

473
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,320
Christian science.

474
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,920
See? It all works.

475
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,800
Now, Christian scientists are different.

476
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:20,760
James Hetfield of Metallica, his parents wouldn't let him go to the doctor when he got sick,

477
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,240
and the mom died from something that the doctor maybe could have fixed.

478
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,640
No pity. No pity whatsoever.

479
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,720
Now that's natural selection.

480
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:31,800
Well, if you delude yourself out of living...

481
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:35,600
If you die for a bad idea, then be aware that you are part...

482
00:24:35,620 --> 00:24:36,720
of natural selection.

483
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,680
If you are killed for someone else's bad idea...

484
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,540
Charlton Heston, he was in those Bible movies and he likes guns.

485
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,640
If there's right-wingers, why aren't there wrong-wingers?

486
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,960
Did y'all know that... You wanna hear something, man?

487
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,340
This is fascinating to me. This is absolutely fascinating.

488
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:58,260
Fundamentalist Christians believe the world is 12,000 years old.

489
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,940
Is that... Let's just think about that.

490
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:03,760
Okay.

491
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,360
Now...

492
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:06,020
Isn't that great?

493
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:10,180
And I ask them, how do you think... Why do you think the world's 12,000 years old?

494
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,100
They go, well, we added up all the people born from Adam and Eve,

495
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:17,800
added up their ages, roughly 12,000 years.

496
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,020
Well, how scientific.

497
00:25:21,300 --> 00:25:23,640
Boom! I can't think I can argue with that kind of, you know, research.

498
00:25:27,060 --> 00:25:29,060
You think the world's 12,000 years old. That's right.

499
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:31,060
Okay, can I ask you a question?

500
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:31,420
Sure.

501
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,080
It's a one-word question.

502
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:33,480
Fine.

503
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:33,600
What's the word for a boy?

504
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:36,660
Dinosaur.

505
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,520
I mean, if the world's 12,000 years old and the Bible covers it,

506
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,440
why didn't someone bring up dinosaurs?

507
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:50,340
You'd think someone would have brought that up somewhere in the goddamn book.

508
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:54,860
And Jesus and the disciples walked down the path towards Nazareth,

509
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,020
but oh, the trail was blocked by a giant brontosaurus

510
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:02,620
with a splinter in his paw.

511
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,780
And the disciples did run a-screamin',

512
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:08,180
What a big little blizzard, Lord.

513
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,900
I'm sure gonna mention this in my book, said Luke.

514
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,720
Well, I'm sure gonna mention it in my book, said Matthew.

515
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,960
I'm not sure what I saw, said Thomas.

516
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,060
Timothy nudged him.

517
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,340
It was a big little blizzard, said Thomas.

518
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:32,080
But Jesus was unafraid, and he took the splinter from the brontosaurus' paw,

519
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,600
and the brontosaurus became his friend.

520
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,060
And Jesus sent him to Scotland, where he lived in a lock, oh, so many years,

521
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:45,840
attracting fat American families with their fat nickel dollars

522
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,460
to look for the Loch Ness Monster.

523
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,660
And oh, the Scotch did praise the Lord.

524
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:52,780
Thank you, Lord.

525
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,200
Thank you, Lord.

526
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,680
12,000 years old.

527
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,820
I asked this guy,

528
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:04,160
I said, come on, man, dinosaur fossils, what's the deal?

529
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,420
He goes, God put those here to test our faith.

530
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,700
I think God put you here to test my faith, dude.

531
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,040
I think I figured this out.

532
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:18,980
That's what this guy said.

533
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:24,880
Does that bother anyone here, the idea that God might be thick with our heads?

534
00:27:26,440 --> 00:27:29,360
Anyone have trouble sleeping restfully with that thought in their head?

535
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,400
God's running around burying fossils.

536
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,640
We'll see who believes in me now.

537
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,640
I'm a prankster God.

538
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:47,320
I am killing me.

539
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,040
You know, you die, you go to St. Peter.

540
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,080
Did you believe in dinosaurs?

541
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,840
Well, yeah, there's fossils everywhere.

542
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,160
What are you, an idiot?

543
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,580
You think God was a with you?

544
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,760
Giant flying lizard, you moron.

545
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,480
That's one of God's easiest jokes.

546
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,620
It seems so plausible.

547
00:28:09,040 --> 00:28:09,100
Ah!

548
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:16,480
Bound for the lake of fire.

549
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:24,040
You ever notice how people who believe in creationism look really unevolved?

550
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:30,780
Eyes real close together, big furry hands and feet.

551
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,920
All believe God created me in one day.

552
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,480
Looks like he rushed it.

553
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,260
Do you remember God?

554
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:51,840
Benevolent, omniscient, and delicious.

555
00:28:52,660 --> 00:28:58,520
God is back and better than ever in GlorpCo's new pseudo-food product,

556
00:28:59,240 --> 00:28:59,840
Holyoes.

557
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:07,640
Available in rhapsodic raspberry, tangy stigmata swirl, or transubstantiated tangerine.

558
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:11,380
Like he said, folks, eat of my flesh.

559
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,400
Buy this product or face eternal torment worse than your current life.

560
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,000
Holyoes.

561
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:20,380
Ape Shall Not Kill Ape was actually something when Charlton Heston said that, didn't he?

562
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:23,660
Or is it always said, it's always delivered as if Charlton Heston said it.

563
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,620
It was in Planet of the Apes, but I don't think he said it.

564
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:28,620
It would have been something that another ape said.

565
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,740
Oh yeah, that's true, that's true. What is the law?

566
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:31,760
That's uh...

567
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,780
Island of Lost Souls.

568
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:34,260
Island of Doctor whoever.

569
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,200
It was originally Island of Lost Souls.

570
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,540
And I only know this because I read on Club Devo that where they got Jaco Homo from.

571
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:43,900
Apparently it's from this movie that Island of Doctor Moreau is a remake of.

572
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:47,800
But in the original version it's very, very creepy and low budget and big shadows.

573
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:49,900
And they saw this in Akron, Ohio.

574
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,220
And that's what made de-evolution start to click with them.

575
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,840
Because this guy was forcing the creatures on this island.

576
00:29:55,980 --> 00:30:00,700
And as they would start to redevelop their animal traits, he would try to force them back into being more human-esque.

577
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,280
De-evolution

578
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:02,280


579
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:04,740
De-evolution

580
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:06,180
De-evolution

581
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:06,340
De-evolution

582
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,360
De-evolution

583
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,160
De-evolution

584
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,180
De-evolution

585
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,040
De-evolution

586
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,820
De-evolution

587
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:42,880
De-evolution

588
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:43,320
De-evolution

589
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:43,320


590
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:43,320


591
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:48,360
Evolution, as we said, is dynamic. It is growing. It is counter-entropic.

592
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:53,200
It is counter-entropic. Faith is static. It is unmoving. It is entropy.

593
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:59,860
If you know something, if you have faith in something, if you're certain of something, there's not really much need to think about it, is there?

594
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,820
And that's fine for trying to figure out if the sun will come up tomorrow, because it probably will.

595
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,240
And if it doesn't, there's nothing you can do about it anyway.

596
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,840
That's your dogma, man. Don't hang that on me.

597
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:13,800
Well, the sun orbits something else, but it doesn't come up, that's for sure.

598
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:17,500
We have our geocentric view of things, even though we know better.

599
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:19,980
Well, I guess that's better than worshipping our penises.

600
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,640
No. No? No.

601
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:27,840
I think things might have been a little bit better, except for the human sacrifice back in the days where it was all about the big phallus god.

602
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:29,840
Yeah. And the sun itself was a god.

603
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:30,880
And will be again.

604
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:35,180
Well, you talk about the sun rising or the sun coming up. I mean, those are very sexual terms.

605
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:38,800
And the sexual revolution is almost sexual evolution.

606
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,560
So what do you suggest?

607
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:44,920
I would suggest we call up the National Guard and bring them all in, but...

608
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:46,700
Do this, bird.

609
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:59,440
Or they'll be in prison, or...

610
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,300
They'll be in cinemas.

611
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:03,940
Okay.

612
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:05,360
Only the most effective of our officials.

613
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:05,360


614
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:17,480
So let's do theÄôve, it's time to go home, see the next time.

615
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:17,480


616
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:17,480


617
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:17,480

They want to have their bullsh-t tub in public class

690
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:55,660
Stephen Jay Gould should put his foot right up their ass

691

No and his heart

Straight up fairy stories even children don't believe

I'm not saying there's no God, that's not for me to say

695
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:06,100
All I'm saying is the Earth was not made in a day

I'm about ready to kick this bitch back in

709

Check it

710
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,940
F the damn creationists I say it with authority

711
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,640
Because kicking their punk asses be my paramount priority

712
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,360
Them wack ass bitches say evolution's just a theory

713
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:38,480
They best step off them brainless fools I'll give them cause to fear me

714

The cosmos is expanding every second every day

715
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,340
But their minds are shrinking as they close their eyes and pray

716
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:45,820
They call their bullsh-t science like the word could be

Do

747
00:36:44,700 --> 00:36:52,900
The funny thing about a scientific theory like evolution is that because it's called a theory and not a law,

748
00:36:53,160 --> 00:37:01,220
if something comes up to change evolution, contrary evidence, then that's not a problem.

749
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:02,160
They change it.

750
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,760
Evolution makes no claim to be the absolute truth.

751
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:12,640
Regardless of the myth, whether it's Zeus or Yahweh or Jehovah, whoever created it, Elrond,

752
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,800
the creationist answer just creates more questions, as in, who created God?

753
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:25,800
And to say that God has always been and always will be is patently ridiculous on the surface.

754
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,440
It's an obvious lie.

755
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:29,840
What do you think the ants think about us?

756
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:33,280
We are to the bugs as God is to us.

757
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:35,280
There's no way to perceive this.

758
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,660
You just have to.

759
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:38,500
Shoot blindly until you kill him.

760
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:41,200
I think there was a doctor god who created the god monster.

761
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,680
He was attacked by the villagers.

762
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:43,960
The villager gods.

763
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,120
Up in heaven, next to Mount Olympus.

764
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,640
Eventually, he just became known as God.

765
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,420
Like the Frankenstein monster eventually became known as Frankenstein.

766
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:51,660
Right.

767
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,160
Same deal.

768
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,540
Exact same deal, really.

769
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:54,260
The god monster.

770
00:37:54,440 --> 00:38:02,060
Why not teach a more logical form of creationism, which states that some technological race from another planet came down here,

771
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:05,440
cooked us in a petri dish, created us, and then left and said,

772
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:06,740
You're on your own, Jackass.

773
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:12,960
There's a new day coming for the children of the Lord.

774
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:19,460
The time comes for judgment, the die is past.

775
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:26,080
The justice men seek for will come at last.

776
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:32,600
For hate and injustice will all be past.

777
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:36,200
There's a new day coming.

778
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:36,740
There's a new day coming.

779
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:36,740


780
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:36,740


781
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:36,960
There's a new day coming.

782
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:39,620
For the children of the Lord.

783
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:50,060
God invaded our planet 2,000 years ago.

784
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:59,440
In the person of Jesus, the man from Galilee.

785
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,280
And he's coming again.

786
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,740
And I'm coming again.

787
00:39:06,740 --> 00:39:09,520
And I want the world to know.

788
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:14,020
He'll reign through the blue.

789
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,820
And reign for eternity.

790
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,840
The ability to visualize or imagine.

791
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:28,060
Evolution will get rid of those as survival traits because it's probably detrimental to dealing with living in a box.

792
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:34,660
It is, but not to what the human body was designed to do, which is anticipate what's going to happen next

793
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,720
and react to it before it's going to happen.

794
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:36,720


795
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:41,880
it happens it's called proactive now it's a stupid word but that's what we do and that's how we've

796
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:46,780
gotten this far and if the monkeys want to shut that off that's fine you know i'd love to see a

797
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:53,360
cap put on their evolution a white backwards baseball cap put on it but unfortunately we have

798
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:59,620
to live in their world and i'm not as much as it pains me to say this i'm really not counting on

799
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:04,540
the exits anymore i'm not sure that they know what the hell is going on down here i mean i'm not i'm

800
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,100
not ready to write it off yet and go on my shooting spree i'm close

801
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,120
oh

802
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:28,580
i invaded our planet

803
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:32,600
two thousand years ago

804
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:33,420
oh

805
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:33,480
oh

829
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:38,620
in the person of jesus

830
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:59,520
well of course all of us subgenius know that on mutantis our distant distant distant ancestors

831
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:04,360
the pure blood yetis bred the pinks in a laboratory setting

832
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:11,120
i don't quite recall what the purpose was maybe for slavery maybe for food i'm not quite sure but we

833
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:16,480
bred the pinks we are living with our shame today because someone fell asleep at the switch the

834
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:22,000
pinks got loose they started to breed like mad they started to organize themselves they attempted

835
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:27,620
to interpret the little slivers of the truth that they knew and put it together into some weird

836
00:41:27,620 --> 00:41:33,940
amalgam of jehovah worshipping we're not supposed to be worshipping jehovah we're supposed to be

837
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:39,500
building giant weapons to defeat Jehovah. He's a killer alien for Christ's sake. But these people

838
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:44,680
worship Jehovah. See, they're just very confused. So it's basically all our fault. Some slack

839
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:50,300
bastard ancestor of ours, probably a common ancestor since there's so little Yeti DNA left

840
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:56,920
in the gene pool, just quit his job and slacked off. And that's why we have pink boys all over

841
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:01,340
the damn place. And we're hunted for food. You know, you said you're supposed to kill Jehovah

842
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:06,280
for Christ's sake. Well, yeah. You think Christ is happy about it, man? The last mission he got

843
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:11,620
sent down here on did not turn out too well. He knew the job was dangerous. Yeah, but damn,

844
00:42:11,740 --> 00:42:15,320
as you know, he's back and he is the fighting Jesus and he's not going to be

845
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,260
bending over for nobody's sins this time.

846
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:28,100
This is an excerpt from chapter eight of the book of the subgenius, your subgenius heritage.

847
00:42:28,320 --> 00:42:31,240
This is the precursor to the interview.

848
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:35,120
This is the pure doctrine on evolution.

849
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:40,800
Subgeniuses came from a better world and they're going to a better world. They descended from

850
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:46,700
abominable snowmen and will evolve overnight on some evening in late 1998 or later into

851
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:54,140
over men and over women. It is an unbroken line of continuous change as opposed to that of pinks

852
00:42:54,140 --> 00:43:00,620
who are an evolutionary dead end and have been spinning their wheels as mere humans for the last

853
00:43:00,620 --> 00:43:01,320
million years.

854
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:17,640
years or so. The goal of any subgenius besides slack is to somehow live until 1998 or later when he or she will be changed into what might as well be a superhero possessed of mental and bodily powers practically unknown to man today.

855
00:43:18,020 --> 00:43:30,480
If you cleave to Bob, you will see magic come to pass in your life. However, only excess technology can complete a subgenius's transfiguration into overmanhood or over-one-liness.

856
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:31,320
And so it is.

857
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:38,080
So far Bob has allowed this to happen to only one solitary guinea pig, his friend, Dr. Philodrummond.

858
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:44,120
But someday when the angelic host descends, we will all make this great leap into tomorrow.

859
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:47,140
It is important that we know what lies ahead.

860
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:57,780
Then after we have been given doctorhood in Dobstown, after our initiation in the Exist Rescue Ships, what is this fabled overman?

861
00:43:58,320 --> 00:44:01,260
Overmania is a changed physique. Overmania is a changed physique.

862
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:08,580
Yes, the huge cranium, the permanent smile, the powers of flight and invisibility, the great cough of command.

863
00:44:09,060 --> 00:44:13,580
But it is far more than that. Above all, it is a state of mind.

864
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:18,420
All subgenii, no matter their racial background, are kin.

865
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:30,080
We as a world cult are bonded together by mere threads, but they are threads of titanium steel forged in the minds of Jupiter, for the link of blood is the strongest.

866
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:41,240
We are Wotan's prime breeding stock, and no matter how different in shade our skin colors may be, we carry in our DNA a common code.

867
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:49,140
A tracking device, so to speak, implanted by our monster lord, yea, so many millions of years ago.

868
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:53,220
Humans lacked this code and have tried to snuff it for millennia.

869
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:59,800
At their beginnings in antiquity, the humans, a wild nomadic pre-subgenius race, were verdicted similarly.

870
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,060
We are Wotan's prime breeding stock, and no matter how different in shade our skin colors may be, we carry in our DNA a common code.

871
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:00,060


872
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:00,620
A tracking device, so to speak, implanted by our monster lord, yea, so many millions of years ago.

873
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:01,980
Cat pacifism. commissioned-accept-conspiracy rule.

874
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:02,520
We too, once less than ever, areikke metal lovers.

875
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:06,120
Whenever subgenii gained a foothold in history, the humans pounced-

876
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:06,580
— imprisoning purposes of the humans-

877
00:45:06,580 --> 00:45:07,460
— ensnared manipulation, the world made us double shrimp stringsy, and we were spotted, to thwart what they saw

878
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:12,940
— perhaps correctly, as a threat to their pathetic control over the planet.

879
00:45:13,100 --> 00:45:15,600
However, this was changing swiftly.

880
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:19,820
The humanitarian agenda of civilization was turned into tested notices, and the conversation was neither dormant nor

881
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:19,820


882
00:45:19,820 --> 00:45:23,660
And now most humans under conspirac therme are mere spectators.

883
00:45:23,860 --> 00:45:29,300
Stooges, disgruntled paupers, powerless to resist any form of seals dominance.

884
00:45:29,300 --> 00:45:36,220
especially Bob's. Secular humanism's baleful theory of evolution can now be challenged.

885
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:44,480
Understand, however, that we are not descended from humans. In fact, man is not really even descended from the ape.

886
00:45:44,720 --> 00:45:54,000
Man, humans and subs alike, preceded the monkey. It began shortly after the Elder Gods forced the Exes to exterminate the dinosaurs.

887
00:45:54,000 --> 00:46:03,580
At this time, the stark fists of all the gods smote a tiny monkey-like mammal called Primo Anthropocus and split his gene line into two.

888
00:46:03,940 --> 00:46:12,600
One, a seriously flawed attempt called Australopithecus, which under Jehovah One's occasional smiting evolved into the modern human.

889
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:18,760
And another, the true Atlanteans homo directus, of whom the first was the first Bob.

890
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:23,860
There are still full-blooded Atlanteans in the world, now called Zugarians and Arians.

891
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:32,680
They inhabit the lost glass city of Chang'an on the ice plateau that time forgot in the least accessible reaches of Tibet.

892
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,280
Bob's advisors on the Council of None dwell in this place.

893
00:46:54,000 --> 00:47:07,300
Drawn by hypnosis at the confines of thess He is put into this world from the times when Jesus came from Satan to face death and death,

894
00:47:07,300 --> 00:47:12,560
and For the last time, he came to trying to save those of us who shifting to Hannibalism in order to Ctrlasp.

895
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:13,400
How has that one been linked to this?

896
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:21,000
In the Western Pentateuch, Aao's dragon will appear in the לףs and日本es.

897
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,980
In other worlds, it inappropriate, for example in Asia,

898
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:35,260
Human sacrifice, bullish religion that wants to be in schools.

899
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:39,400
Want myths, myths taught in science class.

900
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:41,380
You know why they don't believe in natural selection?

901
00:47:41,620 --> 00:47:46,540
Because they're living proof of the fact that natural selection is no longer in effect.

902
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:48,640
It's been removed as part of our society.

903
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,340
Through science and antibiotics.

904
00:47:50,920 --> 00:47:53,580
They call it the Darwin Awards because it's evolution.

905
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,920
I'm a head, I'm a man.

906
00:47:57,380 --> 00:48:00,620
I'm the first mammal to wear pants, yeah.

907
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:03,680
I'm at peace with my lust.

908
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:07,440
I can kill because in God I judge, yeah.

909
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,520
It's evolution, baby.

910
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:20,840
I'm at peace, I'm the man.

911
00:48:21,540 --> 00:48:23,860
I'm at stocks on the day of the...

912
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:24,580
...crash, yeah.

913
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,180
Under the noose.

914
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:27,420
I'm a drug.

915
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,280
All I roll in here, I flatten with my own, yeah.

916
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,580
It's right behavior.

917
00:48:37,520 --> 00:48:38,480
Uh-huh.

918
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:41,280
It's evolution, baby.

919
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:45,060
Yeah.

920
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:46,760
Yeah.

921
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:47,080
Yeah.

922
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,040
Cooo.

923
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:03,200
I made it out here on the patent.

924
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:05,020
It's all right if you're getting hurt.

925
00:49:05,020 --> 00:49:23,840
lt's the Ören camp.

926
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:29,060
It's evolution, baby

927
00:49:36,660 --> 00:49:39,660
I'm a thief, I'm a liar

928
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:42,860
There's my church, I sing in the choir

929
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:48,840
Ooh, ooh, ooh

930
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:52,060
Ooh, ooh, ooh

931
00:49:57,420 --> 00:50:01,000
Admire me, admire my home

932
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:04,460
Admire my song, admire my cause

933
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:12,160
Cause in our appetite

934
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,820
For nightly feasts

935
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,400
Those ignorant Indians

936
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,700
Got nothing on me

937
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:18,820
Ooh, ooh, ooh

938
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,440
Nothing

939
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,260
Why?

940
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:24,160
Because

941
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:27,320
It's evolution, baby

942
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:31,880
Yeah

943
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:42,820
I am ahead

944
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:44,540
I am advanced

945
00:50:44,540 --> 00:50:47,780
I am the first man to make plans

946
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:48,140
Yeah

947
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:48,520
Yeah

948
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:48,820
Yeah

949
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:49,720
I crawled the earth

950
00:50:49,720 --> 00:50:51,480
But now I'm high

951
00:50:51,480 --> 00:50:54,620
Twenty-ten wants to go to far

952
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:58,140
It's evolution, baby

953
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:04,960
It's evolution, baby

954
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:13,340
So as you can see, the doctrine itself has evolved into something more palatable.

955
00:51:14,220 --> 00:51:14,860
Hate!

956
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:17,060
Hate is what keeps this church going.

957
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:18,560
And that's always a combining.

958
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:18,960
It's a combining force.

959
00:51:19,340 --> 00:51:20,540
Ha ha ha ha.

960
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:20,900
Ha!

961
00:51:20,980 --> 00:51:27,160
You know, the superego, not the guy who's teamed with Idbot, but the actual superego of your

962
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:32,560
mind for people who are invested in the society in which they live, actually takes on qualities

963
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:35,320
of the superego of the leader.

964
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:36,620
Oh, like in the Hulk.

965
00:51:36,800 --> 00:51:41,220
I think that's some sort of pink heresy trying to mock our overmen.

966
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:44,140
You can have road rage, but don't actually hit somebody.

967
00:51:44,420 --> 00:51:45,620
Oh, you hit somebody?

968
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:48,120
Well don't cut off their head and put it on a pike in your yard.

969
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,180
So that your neighbors follow you to the next neighborhood meeting.

970
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:52,180
Don't do that!

971
00:51:52,300 --> 00:52:01,740
Your lizard brain has evolved to get you by in this nonsensical upside-down topsy-turvy world that they call, uh, humania.

972
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,540
Huuu-mania!

973
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:05,680
What Sunday?

974
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:08,580
The humans versus the were-jackal.

975
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,240
Heavily favored were-jackal.

976
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,460
It's time to evolve ideas. That's all we're left with. There's gonna be no more thumbs coming down the pike. It ain't happening.

977
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,380
The true evolution is to evolve ideas.

978
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:19,760
What do I mean? What do you mean? What do I mean? Well...

979
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:36,700

987
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:13,760
Remember, Kathy Cox with a K thinks evolution is a dirty word.

988
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:16,340
Kathy Cox with a C is a good word.

989
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:19,360
I installed the rigamatic electronic voting system.

990
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:21,220
Anyway, you've heard

991
00:53:21,220 --> 00:53:24,700
M.C. Hawking performing More Science

992
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:29,340
A reading from a creationist biology textbook

993
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,260
The Creation Mix

994
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:34,900
An unwitting collaboration on The Creation Song

995
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,140
from I Wonder by R.K. Wells

996
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,980
Performed by the Agape Players

997
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,300
The First Baptist Church of Saks, Oklahoma

998
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:49,920
Oklahoma, and Hugh James reading A Child's Introduction to God and Religion.

999
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:56,800
Then Crystal and Robin Bernard sang I'm No Kin to the Monkey, Negative Land performing

1000
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:04,840
Christianity is Stupid, then Mr. Bungle covering DRI's I Don't Need Society, Bill Hicks talked

1001
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:10,620
for a while about dinosaurs in the Bible, and then our old Holyoes ad, and our mercifully

1002
00:54:10,620 --> 00:54:17,020
brief cover of Jocko Homo, and then Pastor Dick singing Whisper a Prayer, followed by

1003
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:23,220
M.C. Hawking, Nihuf the Creationists, Don Wurtzen performed God Invaded Our Planet,

1004
00:54:23,420 --> 00:54:29,700
and the singing churchman performed Oh Lord to Whom All Vengeance Belongeth.

1005
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:35,060
Then we read from the book The Subgenius, and you heard another unwitting collaboration

1006
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:39,900
of Master Designer from Tell It Like It Is.

1007
00:54:39,980 --> 00:54:40,140
Yes.

1008
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:45,520
That was performed by the Chapel Choir of the First Presbyterian Church of Orlando,

1009
00:54:45,780 --> 00:54:52,760
Florida, the Wee Choir of Lees-McCrae College in Banner Elk, North Carolina, and the Mr.

1010
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:56,000
Paul Singers of Cherry Hill, North Carolina.

1011
00:54:56,280 --> 00:55:01,740
And then you heard Pearl Jam performing Do the Evolution, and in the background is the

1012
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,660
Butthole Surfers performing The Lord is a Monkey.

1013
00:55:05,820 --> 00:55:09,820
And we'll finish up with another number from Robin and Crystal Bernard.

1014
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:15,440
The Ecumenical Song, and a counter-opinion from Negative Land.

1015
00:55:15,780 --> 00:55:18,260
My eye turned to glass, well she's looking pretty good.

1016
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,620
First week in July, she's got a dope of Sahara and a needle in her eye.

1017
00:55:23,020 --> 00:55:23,920
Oh Lord.

1018
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:25,560
Oh Lord.

1019
00:55:25,820 --> 00:55:26,920
Oh Lord.

1020
00:55:28,880 --> 00:55:30,240
Oh Lord.

1021
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:31,980
Oh Lord.

1022
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,420
Oh Lord.

1023
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,240
Oh Lord.

1024
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,180
Oh Lord.

1025
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:34,580
Oh Lord.

1026
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,140
Oh Lord.

1027
00:55:37,020 --> 00:55:37,700
Oh Lord.

1028
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,480
Oh Lord.

1029
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:40,600
Oh Lord.

1030
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:40,600


1031
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:40,600


1032
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:40,600


1033
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,320
Oh Lord.

1034
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:50,320


1035
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:50,320


1036
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:50,320


1037
00:55:50,320 --> 00:55:50,560
For by the golden dawn they used whiteblowers black-face and dark-faced men, 좋을 and

1038
00:55:50,560 --> 00:55:52,420
lusts for mostrar- disappears, they always talk about the golden love.

1039
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:57,160
And the penitent man on the march, birds of weather, who's ever been born again.

1040
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:00,060
Doesn't even seem to count life.

1041
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:04,560
My sins are all forgiven, and I've gone, my way superhuman.

1042
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,040
I am set free.

1043
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:07,960
Be was the Lord.

1044
00:56:07,960 --> 00:56:08,140
in Hell.

1045
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:09,120
in Hell.

1046
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:09,680
The Earth has come about no sei stupid.

1047
00:56:09,680 --> 00:56:09,680


1048
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,640
I am God.

1049
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:15,660
You are God.

1050
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,940
We are all God.

1051
00:56:19,100 --> 00:56:19,820
Ridiculous.

1052
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:21,580
I am God.

1053
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,620
You are God.

1054
00:56:24,420 --> 00:56:25,860
We are all God.

1055
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:29,360
I am God.

1056
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:31,580
You are God.

1057
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,960
We are all God.

1058
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,400
How can cultists so twist and pervert

1059
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:40,640
think this is what the Bible actually says?

1060
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:43,720
Our churches today are full of a bunch of spiritual retards

1061
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:45,880
with a bunch of brain flusters for preachers,

1062
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,700
and they haven't figured out that this thing is for real

1063
00:56:48,700 --> 00:56:50,740
and that we are in a war.

1064
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,240
I push forward.

1065
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:53,460
I am God.

1066
00:56:53,500 --> 00:56:54,600
You are God.

1067
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:55,300
You are God.

1068
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,320
You are God.

1069
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:01,240
You are God.

1070
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:03,420
You are God.

1071
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:03,820
You are God.

1072
00:57:04,140 --> 00:57:05,380
You are God.

1073
00:57:05,580 --> 00:57:07,360
You are God.

1074
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,200
You are God.

1075
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,420
You are God.

1076
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,460
You are God.

1077
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:27,260
You are God.

1078
00:57:28,040 --> 00:57:29,300
You are God.

1079
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,780
You are God.

1080
00:57:31,280 --> 00:57:33,020
You are God.

1081
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:35,180
You are God.

1082
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,980
You are God.

1083
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,400
are able.

1084
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:39,540
Permit.

1085
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,000
May all beings

1086
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:41,880
everywhere

1087
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,300
be enabled.

1088
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:44,120
Engine.

1089
00:57:44,460 --> 00:57:45,300
We are all

1090
00:57:45,300 --> 00:57:46,520
be enabled.

1091
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:47,200
Fire.

1092
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:47,880
Flame.

1093
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,140
I am God

1094
00:57:49,140 --> 00:57:50,400
to carry out

1095
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,160
your lives

1096
00:57:51,160 --> 00:57:52,260
in peace.

1097
00:57:52,440 --> 00:57:53,180
We are all

1098
00:57:53,180 --> 00:57:53,560
God.

1099
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,520
Engagement.

1100
00:57:57,780 --> 00:57:58,580
Devotors

1101
00:57:58,580 --> 00:57:59,280
and rats

1102
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:00,860
and illegitimate

1103
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:01,280
babies

1104
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,380
and prostitutes

1105
00:58:02,380 --> 00:58:03,520
you name it

1106
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:03,700
they

1107
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:04,080
die.

1108
00:58:04,260 --> 00:58:05,400
And unless

1109
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,580
we are free

1110
00:58:06,580 --> 00:58:07,500
of fear

1111
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,740
and as far as

1112
00:58:08,740 --> 00:58:09,340
I'm concerned

1113
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,000
are peaceful

1114
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:10,840
and happy

1115
00:58:10,840 --> 00:58:11,480
I'd be glad

1116
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:12,400
when black people

1117
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:13,680
we cannot fully

1118
00:58:14,920 --> 00:58:16,000
bring another

1119
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:17,660
to peace

1120
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:18,280
and happiness.

1121
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:19,640
So just once more

1122
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:20,340
with feeling.

1123
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,000
If you had my way

1124
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,480
I would be

1125
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:24,260
God almighty

1126
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:25,020
and just

1127
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:25,840
wipe them off

1128
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,300
the planet

1129
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,900
because as you know

1130
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:29,060
as well as I do

1131
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:30,560
white people

1132
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:31,660
are damned

1133
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:32,660
to damnation.

1134
00:58:32,820 --> 00:58:34,180
Don't see them

1135
00:58:34,180 --> 00:58:35,040
if they can be saved.

1136
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:35,780
Oh God.

1137
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:36,460
So this

1138
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:36,720
is gay.

1139
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,940
I am God.

1140
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:38,700
A curse.

1141
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:39,760
You are God.

1142
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:40,600
Anguish.

1143
00:58:40,860 --> 00:58:41,820
We are all

1144
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:42,160
cursed.

1145
00:58:42,700 --> 00:58:43,300
Burn.

1146
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:44,560
Condemned.

1147
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:45,920
I am God.

1148
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:46,700
May all

1149
00:58:46,700 --> 00:58:47,180
be

1150
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:47,700
You are God.

1151
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:48,220
everywhere.

1152
00:58:48,640 --> 00:58:49,740
We are all

1153
00:58:49,740 --> 00:58:50,400
going to be

1154
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:50,720
saved.

1155
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:52,540
Demon.

1156
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:53,900
I am God.

1157
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:54,840
We are free.

1158
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:55,740
You are God.

1159
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:57,200
Destruction.

1160
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:57,760
We are all

1161
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:58,140
there.

1162
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,420
No image benign

1163
00:59:00,420 --> 00:59:01,680
bereaved or crucified.

1164
00:59:02,060 --> 00:59:02,240
Oh.

1165
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:03,420
No ordained saint

1166
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:04,600
or confirmed miracle.

1167
00:59:04,840 --> 00:59:05,160
Oh.

1168
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:06,820
One book.

1169
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:07,160
Oh.

1170
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:08,380
And no God.

1171
00:59:08,440 --> 00:59:08,700
Yes.

1172
00:59:08,780 --> 00:59:09,360
But Allah.

1173
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,040
And all the people said

1174
00:59:11,800 --> 00:59:12,040
Amen.

1175
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:13,800
Amen.

1176
00:59:13,800 --> 00:59:14,300
Amen.

1177
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:15,260
Amen.

1178
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:15,780


1179
00:59:17,160 --> 00:59:17,760
Amen.

1180
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:18,440


1181
00:59:18,440 --> 00:59:18,660
Amen.

1182
00:59:19,940 --> 00:59:20,020
Amen.

1183
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:20,860


1184
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,060
Amen.

1185
00:59:21,640 --> 00:59:22,180
Amen.

1186
00:59:22,780 --> 00:59:23,380
Amen.

1187
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:23,380


1188
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:23,380


1189
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:23,380


1190
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:23,380


1191
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:23,380


1192
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:23,380


1193
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:23,380


1194
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:23,380


1195
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:23,380


1196
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:23,380


1197
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:24,820
It is frightening to know

1198
00:59:24,820 --> 00:59:27,080
that in many parts of our world right now

1199
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:27,860
people are yelling

1200
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:28,360
revolution

1201
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:29,000
revolution

1202
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:30,720
and in other parts

1203
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:31,340
they're yelling

1204
00:59:31,340 --> 00:59:32,080
evolution.

1205
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:32,280


1206
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:35,860
We want our phones.

1207
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:36,440
We want our phones.

1208
00:59:36,460 --> 00:59:40,960
While I appreciate your quaint traditions, superstitions, and, you know,

1209
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:45,840
I, on the other hand, am an evolved being who deals solely with the source of light

1210
00:59:45,840 --> 00:59:47,960
which exists in all of us in our own minds.

1211
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,180
No middleman required.

1212
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,460
But anyway, I appreciate your little games and this shit

1213
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:55,200
and you're putting on the tie and going to church.

1214
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:59,080
Ah, Henry, why don't you wake up?

1215
00:59:59,140 --> 01:00:00,080
Darwin was wrong.

1216
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:02,020
Man still at age.
