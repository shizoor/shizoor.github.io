1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900
It'd be against my code of honor to borrow something and not pay it back.

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:04,740
I know.

3
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,160
As my grandpappy used to say...

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,280
The Self Genius Power of Swag.

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:15,860
I don't even know why it bothers me so much, but it does.

6
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:16,920
I hope so.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:17,720
Shut up.

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,700
Friends, I want you to open your heart, unzip your lips, close your mind,

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,460
bend over and pull out that wallet because here comes the word of Bob.

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,960
And I know I'm not preaching entirely to the saved.

11
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,140
There are a few people here who haven't heard Subgenius 101.

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,100
And that's too bad.

13
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,380
You'll have to pick it up from context.

14
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:46,920
However, I will explain some of the basics.

15
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,320
But first...

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:49,740
Oh, shoot.

17
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:54,860
Princess Wee, I need a dollar bill from our sacred swag change.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,740
I have a...

19
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:57,440
A...

20
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,180
Ten and a five.

21
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:02,060
But as you'll see, we don't want to use that for this ritual.

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,060
Actually, I'm going to need two of them.

23
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:07,340
One to live and one to die.

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,680
Here.

25
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,320
Thank you very much, Princess Wee.

26
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,440
We can't really do this right until I burn a dollar first!

27
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:21,460
Yes, burning it!

28
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:24,920
Please don't call the fire marshal or the Federal Reserve.

29
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,420
But, friends, as long as...

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,280
The smoke from this dollar is rising up to heaven.

31
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,520
The men from Planet X and God only knows...

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,540
Well, what gods might be lurking.

33
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,280
That's still partly spendable.

34
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:41,280
I may be able to use it for my other demonstration.

35
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,920
Okay, I feel better.

36
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:47,460
This is a great job that I have.

37
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:53,820
Basically, going to places full of weirdos.

38
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,620
Bars and so forth.

39
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,940
And tempting...

40
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:57,660
Sinners.

41
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,160
Away from the devil.

42
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,920
And away from Jesus.

43
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,680
And away from Muhammad.

44
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:07,380
And just about any other Messiah or cool guy you can think of.

45
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,280
Even some rock stars.

46
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:14,300
There's really only three things that you need to know about the Church of the Subgenius.

47
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,080
And those three things are Bob.

48
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,360
That guy.

49
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,580
Also seen down there.

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,660
Always in distorted forms.

51
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,520
You have to know about Bob.

52
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,920
You have to know about Slack.

53
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,400
And unfortunately, we all...

54
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:39,840
must discuss the conspiracy not the conspiracies the conspiracy and it's it

55
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:47,220
helps if you know the one really important rule in this religion which

56
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:51,820
you know we've got millions of others if you want to buy our books but the only

57
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:56,040
one that counts is pardon my language are there any kids around well too bad

58
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:03,640
fuck them if they can't take a joke that is the one honestly you strangely

59
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:12,720
enough you can live by that rule you can survive by that rule anyway that this

60
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:20,100
man if man he be J.R. Bob Dobbs founded the Church of the subgenius in 1953 when

61
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,540
he was taken up in the spirit by the alien space

62
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,020
monster who was the one who told him to do it he was the only one who could do it

63
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,020


64
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,600
he was the only one who could do it he was the only one who could do it

65
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,640
calling itself Jehovah one it has masqueraded as a god for numerous

66
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:37,180
religions mostly desert religions throughout history and still is hard at

67
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:45,460
work today Bob founded this church on a sandy beach of hypocrisy not on a rock

68
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:50,000
or anything like that hypocrisy is very important to any

69
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,700
do-it-yourself religion which is what this is it's also a disorganized religion

70
00:03:55,700 --> 00:04:01,360
our apologies to the discordians who were disorganized before we were it's

71
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:08,200
it's a non organization for non joiners and and it's an anti business business

72
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:15,600
and an anti art art project and no wonder we're not making more money anyway

73
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:20,380
but but obviously as you can tell by looking around you it is a church for

74
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,680
sinners mutants misfits disbelievers and most importantly those who will believe

75
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:36,120
anything and luckily for us no two sub geniuses are alike they're all

76
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:42,480
different there's no such thing as a typical sub genius if we find any two who

77
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:49,120
are alike one must die the only thing we have in common friends is that we have

78
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:55,540
nothing in common with the conspiracy of the normal people because that is what

79
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:58,660
Jehovah one revealed to Bob that all through history there's been a

80
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:05,160
conspiracy the conspiracy the only one you need of plain ordinary nice garden

81
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:14,240
variety normal people who live in extreme discomfort when confronted with

82
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,320
anything weird or different of course we're there sometimes there's good

83
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:25,300
reasons for that as we found out over the years sometimes a path less taken it's

84
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,920
because it's a crappy path you never know you have to try it for yourself of

85
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:34,680
course some people have come up to me today and said well I understand this

86
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,060
this Bob guys not real right this is a joke

87
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:41,300
oh why don't you say that to a Christian why don't you say that to a Mohammedan

88
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:48,820
why don't you say that to a pro wrestler oh it's wrestling stuff in real oh yeah

89
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:55,160
want me to prove it's real well if it's a joke friends as a

90
00:05:55,300 --> 00:06:00,420
Pope David Meyer Pope of all New York said it's a joke you can believe in

91
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:08,880
sometimes we have to deprogram some believers you know but really if Bob's a

92
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:14,560
joke then what do you call yourselves what do you call the news what do you

93
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,280
call the political scene these days there have been legends of Bob you've

94
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,180
heard the stories of the traveling salesman those are all

95
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,740
based on him the saint of sales he's called he could sell hypocrisy to a

96
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:39,000
Baptist ice to an Eskimo hate to a subgenius and and he's done a pretty

97
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:46,840
good job of that now Bob is not our leader because he's super smart or super

98
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:55,160
enlightened Nate just the opposite he is simply lucky as he said I'd rather be

99
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:01,660
lucky than good any day how far is smart gonna get you on a date my friends no

100
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:05,780
you want luck you want the quick easy answer and that's what Bob's there for

101
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:13,700
he doesn't think about what he wants to do whatever he wants to he wants just

102
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:20,060
happens to be what was gonna happen anyway so there's no point trying to

103
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:25,000
reach the level of unconscious or consciousnessness

104
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:31,120
I should say that Bob has reached it don't and don't try to seek Bob out for

105
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:39,820
answers because he'll where do you think he gets perfect slack from us so you're

106
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,240
you're gonna give him it your money sooner or later anyway and so it's not

107
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:51,460
intelligence we're talking about we kind of suspect that that was misdefined by

108
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,140
college professors a long time ago and that's what we're talking about and so I'm going to give you a little bit of information about that and then we'll get to the next question.

109
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:01,120
go and it's not sense it's I mean it's not intelligence we're talking about the

110
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,640
sense common sense sense of humor and dollars and cents and every now and then

111
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,060
somebody might say since Amelia but that's you can read that into it if you

112
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:18,380
want Bob makes a million bucks every time he screws up because unlike the Pope

113
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:24,180
of the Vatican he has a power that that Pope would kill for the power to fail

114
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:30,180
supremely fallible that that's the part of Bob's behavior that we subgeniuses

115
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:39,760
mimic whether we mean to or not let's face it so what what we try to do as Bob

116
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:47,520
teaches is to surf the luck plane and follow the path of least resistance it

117
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,780
might be the most traveled path I suppose might not then because it's

118
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,280
going to be different for each person see

119
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:04,140
another thing about Bob now he he's frankly is not really qualified to

120
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:10,320
forgive your sins and even if he was he doesn't give a hoot about your stinking

121
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,640
pathetic miserable sins he really does not Bob came not to forgive your sins

122
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:20,660
but to bring an excuse because that's what you really need an excuse for you

123
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:24,160
sins it's in fact it's a nice frameable doctorate

124
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:29,680
that you can and an excuse certificate which you can get with your subgenius

125
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,540
ordainment which by the way is this better be a legal ordainment or all of

126
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,360
those weddings well let me put it this way all those divorces were needlessly

127
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:51,120
expensive really so you know we're not suggesting that you use Bob as a crutch

128
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,160
no no it doesn't again it's the opposite you love it you have the right to do what you want but Bob is not a Christian

129
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:56,660
you are his crutch.

130
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,840
Okay? He's leaning on you.

131
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,300
Another question we get,

132
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,960
oh, Bob's smoking a pipe.

133
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,280
I bet I know what's in that pipe.

134
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,060
I bet he's smoking marijuana.

135
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,700
Isn't he reverent?

136
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,800
No, actually, well,

137
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,540
it's just cheap stuff from Walgreens

138
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,600
called Bork and Riff.

139
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,240
When geniuses smoke cheap street drugs,

140
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,920
they like to call it frop.

141
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,080
That's not the real frop.

142
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,640
Well, you never come down from the real frop.

143
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,660
What do you think happened to me?

144
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,500
No, what Bob is smoking in his pipe

145
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,580
is you, my friend.

146
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,200
You.

147
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,700
You throw your mind into,

148
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,300
well, this t-shirt is perfect illustration of it.

149
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,920
You throw your mind into Bob's pipe.

150
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:40,080
He smokes that.

151
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,940
You go into Bob's lungs.

152
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,460
A little bit of you goes into his brain.

153
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,980
He might notice you.

154
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,940
And you might get lucky.

155
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,920
Frankly, I don't know.

156
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,820
Like I say, I don't try to get too close

157
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,140
to Bob.

158
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:55,980
But we're very easily misunderstood,

159
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,300
especially, oddly enough,

160
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,080
by geniuses.

161
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:01,540
Just recently,

162
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,440
I guess it was a comment on Facebook.

163
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,760
I'm already in Mensa,

164
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,380
so I don't need another

165
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,540
one of those egghead societies.

166
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,740
Well, I guess that was another genius

167
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,300
who was too smart

168
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,120
to understand

169
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:26,060
the word subgenius.

170
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,520
It means under.

171
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:31,020
Some might describe that as actually meaning

172
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,100
being under your own genius.

173
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,920
But no, I just think it means

174
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,140
dumber than a genius.

175
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,580
Almost everybody qualifies.

176
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,380
If you got 35 bucks, you can prove it.

177
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:46,520
I have proof that I am still a subgenius

178
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:49,680
because I lost my camera here,

179
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,520
I think, in a porta potty.

180
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:52,800
And all of a sudden, I'm sitting here, and I'm like,

181
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,040
I'm going to be a subgenius.

182
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,300
And also, some other subgenius lost this little

183
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,540
Canon battery pack,

184
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,360
which is probably worth something.

185
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,140
My camera's not worth anything,

186
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,620
but the SD card in it might be useful.

187
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,400
It was a little black Panasonic

188
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,000
in a little plastic case.

189
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:09,540
And if you find it, you can turn it into

190
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,120
the Wisteria trailer

191
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:12,700
or the

192
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,080
Tridara camp or me

193
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:18,300
or the Ace information place.

194
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,000
So there's the lost and found part.

195
00:12:20,260 --> 00:12:21,940
Anybody else have any lost and founds?

196
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,540
Oh, yeah.

197
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,880
Somebody lost their groove.

198
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,100
Yeah.

199
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,340
If you find anybody's groove,

200
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,500
take that to the Starwood information booth.

201
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:34,280
Now, one of the best things about Bob Dobbs,

202
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:36,460
aside from his handsome looks,

203
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:43,340
is that he's what we call a short-duration personal savior,

204
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,200
or in the original Tibetan,

205
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:46,760
short-duration.

206
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,560
Or as Charlene said,

207
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,020
bumper sticker says,

208
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,600
a temporary profit.

209
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,640
I like that phrase.

210
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,440
That's a new one.

211
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,660
And this is a society

212
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,480
that's centered around

213
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,560
planned obsolescence.

214
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,200
When you buy that computer,

215
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,420
it is going to go bad the day

216
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,200
before the warranty runs out.

217
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:12,440
Same with cars.

218
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:15,740
Same with, oh, I guess spouses sometimes.

219
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:18,480
All kinds of stuff can end up being...

220
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,940
You know, they keep you alive

221
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:21,080
while you're into it.

222
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,780
A really short-duration person,

223
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,160
personal savior.

224
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,860
It might be a book you're in the middle of reading.

225
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:26,560
Well, nobody does that anymore.

226
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,500
But say a DVD that you've really liked.

227
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,940
Or a porno star you're enamored of.

228
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,020
You know, it's a...

229
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,060
All I can say, friends,

230
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,820
I can speak for myself.

231
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,500
J.R. Bob Dobbs and Church of the Subgenius

232
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,540
honestly did give me slack.

233
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:48,960
You might say I'm fucked up on life.

234
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,480
I'm also a preacher.

235
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:53,100
I'm a preacher of habit.

236
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:56,260
I maintain the faith in Bob, the FIB.

237
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:59,900
I'm still waiting for July 5th, 1998

238
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,440
when, as Bob prophesied,

239
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,420
actually he was told by the alien space god Jehovah One,

240
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,000
on July 5th, 1998,

241
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,180
the men from Planet X will arrive on Earth,

242
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:13,520
rupture up the dues-paying subgeniuses,

243
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:17,940
give them the big rock candy planet of their dreams

244
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:21,180
where snow falls up and it's rubber cactus

245
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:22,400
and you get everything you want.

246
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:27,100
And you may say, well, don't you guys feel kind of silly

247
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,960
gathering every year, July 5th,

248
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,920
and getting up at 7 in the morning

249
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,680
to wait for saucers that haven't come since 1998?

250
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:39,120
Well, number one, it's the only time during the year

251
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,640
when I have to get up that early.

252
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,600
Praise Bob.

253
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,600
Praise Bob.

254
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:45,340
Number two, obviously what this tells us,

255
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,560
unquestionably, is that we don't know what year this is.

256
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,820
1998 hasn't happened yet.

257
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,460
We don't know what year this is.

258
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:55,740
We don't even know what planet this is.

259
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:00,120
And just as you can find proof for anything you want to believe,

260
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:02,260
if you read our out-of-print book,

261
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,640
the Cyclopedia of Slack, which you can't read,

262
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,700
it pretty much proves that Mars and Earth were switched

263
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,220
using World War II as a distraction.

264
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,740
But I don't expect you to immediately believe all that.

265
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:21,480
Sooner or later, sure.

266
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:27,600
Now, as I have to do every year, I

267
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:32,760
have to read the Starbuck tour guide to see what I'm doing.

268
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,520
And I'm sure many of you do, too.

269
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,040
Well, here's what you're doing.

270
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,740
It's 5.30.

271
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,660
It's the main stage.

272
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,700
And this is a sermon called The Antidote to All Placebos.

273
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,020
And really, the whole sermon is in the description.

274
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:52,440
Do you depend on medicines or even philosophies that you've

275
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:52,440


276
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:52,440


277
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:52,520
got?

278
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:56,120
Do you suspect might be placebos?

279
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,400
After the sermon, you'll know for sure, because none of them will work anymore.

280
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:07,720
Maybe that's not the best way to get attention at a hippie festival, it says here.

281
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,700
Let's start again.

282
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,500
Okay, this is more like it.

283
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,740
The Church of the Subgenius is the coolest of all feel-good New Age religions.

284
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:18,680
You might even get a chuckle or two.

285
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,340
You've heard of rodeo clowns?

286
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,460
Reverend Ivan Stang is a religion clown.

287
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:29,780
He taunts his god, J.R. Bob Dobbs, and Bob charges him.

288
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,680
Hilarity ensues.

289
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:36,340
Bring peanuts to throw at Bob, not Stang, and get him further enraged.

290
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,320
Perhaps he'll gore Reverend Stang this time.

291
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:47,640
Yes, it's like watching a bullfight at Subgenius, the Archie McPhee of world religions.

292
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:50,200
Praise Archie McPhee.

293
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:50,780
All right.

294
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:58,980
Well, the bottom line is, friends, Bob Dobbs is the answer.

295
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:02,220
But what is the question?

296
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,180
That's the question.

297
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:04,960
I don't know.

298
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,560
I think I don't know.

299
00:17:06,700 --> 00:17:07,640
I know I don't think.

300
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,020
We'll figure out.

301
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:17,420
Well, as a great man once said, all being smart means is you do stupid stuff in a more

302
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,600
elaborate way.

303
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,520
Reverend Ivan Stang.

304
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:21,940
Said that.

305
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,480
And I have a new rant.

306
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,640
All of the stuff I did, of course, was 30 years old.

307
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:33,440
But I have a new rant, and I have to read it to do it properly.

308
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,960
So you'll forgive me if I don't look up as if I'm making eye contact with the audience

309
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,020
quite as often.

310
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,300
It's all boffo anyway.

311
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:44,180
It's all fake.

312
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,780
Listen up, you yetis.

313
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,920
I've got a subgenius bone to pick with you.

314
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:54,220
How many of you are paying attention?

315
00:17:54,600 --> 00:18:01,100
How many of you can actually put down the fork or the controller or the remote or the

316
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:05,780
computer mouse for five Dobbs forsaken minutes and listen?

317
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,820
How many of you can scream?

318
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,260
Can I hear you scream?

319
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:14,180
Praise Bob.

320
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,300
Yeah, that's good.

321
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:15,920
Very good.

322
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:19,900
Because if not, you're certainly not paying attention.

323
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:19,900


324
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:19,900


325
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:26,480
You couldn't possibly be paying enough attention to your surroundings if you aren't on the

326
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:34,980
verge of screaming every second spent in this modern blasphemous cacophony of anti-slack.

327
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:41,980
We are trapped in the goddamn bizarro subgenius world.

328
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,720
Isn't it obvious?

329
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:49,280
Doesn't it seem a little too perfectly aligned against us?

330
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:57,280
As if it was created to be the oil on our water, the kryptonite to our Superman, the

331
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,840
stiletto heel to our waterbed.

332
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,620
If it doesn't seem that way, then you haven't been paying any attention.

333
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:10,980
But you're in luck because Bob doesn't care that you pay attention.

334
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,660
He only cares that you pay money.

335
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:17,060
But is that really enough?

336
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:18,640
$35.

337
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,420
$35 for an ordainment just once to the subgenius foundation?

338
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,800
For a lifetime's worth of art and music and bulldada?

339
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:32,560
Well, like any good salesman, Bob included some fine print in his contract.

340
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,880
Sure, $35 will get you a seat in the nosebleeds of the saucers and your own little rinky-dink

341
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,120
planet.

342
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,760
No pickup service included.

343
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,780
Supplies are limited.

344
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,540
Act now, then wait for X day.

345
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,300
But is that really all you wanted out of your life?

346
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,640
To be a spectator?

347
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,440
To be a looky-loo?

348
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:55,420
To rubberneck the bounties of life from the comfort of your armchair?

349
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,440
To soak up the effort and creativity of other subgeniuses like a sponge?

350
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,720
Is that really going to bring you slack?

351
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:08,440
Ain't no one ever died wishing they'd have tried less.

352
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:12,500
No one ever died regretting how much fun they had.

353
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:14,500
Unless maybe the fun killed them.

354
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:16,960
And if so, Bob, speed to them!

355
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:17,280
Bob's speed to them!

356
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,240
There's no shame in living yourself to death.

357
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:27,100
But in order to do that, you gotta get up and live.

358
00:20:27,980 --> 00:20:31,080
This ain't no Sunday church picnic!

359
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,940
And it ain't no goddamn buffet line.

360
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:40,080
We don't want to get your asses in the pews, we want to get them jumping out of the pews.

361
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:47,240
There certainly ain't no stadium seating, cushioned chairs, and no damn VIP section.

362
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:47,280


363
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:55,620
This is a religious pit and we don't need permission to mosh our asses off.

364
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:58,420
We are the demonstrable-

365
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,400
Blah blah blah.

366
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,000
Take 2.

367
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:04,360
We are the demonstrably monstrous.

368
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:07,660
We are the incredibly incredulous.

369
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:11,780
We are a pack of vehement behemoths.

370
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,180
Our fervor leaves them out in the cold.

371
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:17,280
But until X day, when we put the heat back on, we're not going to be the demonstrable

372
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:17,280


373
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,360
beast.

374
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:21,980
We want you out of your seat.

375
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,760
We want to see you live and die on your feet.

376
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,700
So you know the drill.

377
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,040
X day is a-comin'.

378
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:31,720
So get off your ass and show your worth something.

379
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:32,980
Praise Bob!

380
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,540
And didn't that sound like something I would write?

381
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:45,520
Actually that was written by a 29 year old young woman named Reverend Baby Bear.

382
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:47,260
And she said, I'm gonna be a man.

383
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,260


384
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,260


385
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,260


386
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,260


387
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,260


388
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,260


389
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,260


390
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,260


391
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,260


392
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:47,260


393
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:52,560
She might have done a better job, but she is very squeaky and small.

394
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:58,240
She did some of her own rants at X day last week.

395
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:04,020
And you can hear them on the subgenius hour of slack at subgenius.com and various radio

396
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:04,440
stations.

397
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:14,640
So with that little pep talk out of the way, now we have to get to the grubby stuff about

398
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:15,900
the others.

399
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,880
Okay.

400
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,820
The conspiracy.

401
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:25,440
That nice lady at the post office is always so friendly and helpful.

402
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:32,100
She's going to die horribly on X day because she didn't send her $35 to JR Bob Dobbs.

403
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,460
Isn't that sad?

404
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,100
No.

405
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,980
Not at all.

406
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:43,660
Friends, we're not going to tell you what to do because you might say, we're the mind

407
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:45,460
your own business police.

408
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,200
Right?

409
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,620
We're the mind your own business jihadists.

410
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:57,060
That's how very strongly we believe that everybody should mind their own damn business.

411
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:03,040
And we don't get into serious political discussions much unless it's really fun.

412
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:12,900
Because most of us are of the persuasion known as patriots psychotic and narco materialists,

413
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:16,200
which can be shortened down to every yard.

414
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:17,180
Okay.

415
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:20,520
Every yard, a kingdom, every queendom, a checkbook.

416
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:25,980
Actually that's really sexist and sounded okay in the eighties, but somehow we're going

417
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,340
to have to do something with that line.

418
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:39,120
But it seems like lately the stupid fucking rednecks think that they're somehow become

419
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,560
cool again.

420
00:23:42,260 --> 00:23:47,180
I believe that they've been empowered by the anonymity of the, uh, the, uh, the, uh, the

421
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,180


422
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:56,940
internet and the fact that now that the internet's here, you can find somebody to validate anything

423
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,040
you want to believe.

424
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:08,140
If you could make up the most ridiculous excuses for why you're still a loser in a crappy apartment

425
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:14,680
and can't hold down a job and they keep talking about your drinking or whatnot.

426
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:16,700
I'm not so sure.

427
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,820
I'm not so sure that the internet is a boon to education.

428
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,440
It's more like a boon to excuses.

429
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:22,540
Really?

430
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:27,080
All you have to do is Google fellow loser and next thing you know, oh, you hate women.

431
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,760
You'll find a ton of guys that hate women.

432
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:30,540
You hate men.

433
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,340
You'll find a ton of guys who hate men or wait, anyway, you know what I'm saying?

434
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,460
It's a, it's really a mess.

435
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:45,860
I, um, I love my old ignorant rednecks, especially the one that lives inside me.

436
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:53,040
And my family, I was actually at a, uh, a family reunion and a very elderly, even compared

437
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:59,240
to me, um, relative, uh, was talking about one of the younger relatives.

438
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,820
It was like a college age kid.

439
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:04,140
He had really bushy hair and a bushy beard.

440
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:05,380
He looked pretty cool.

441
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:07,540
He was with an Asian girl with blue hair.

442
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:14,680
And my elderly relative was kind of going, Ivan, really now, come on, would you hire

443
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,120
him?

444
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,400
Would you give him a job looking like that?

445
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:26,920
And I went, uh, and, and she said, well, you know, we can see your face, Ivan, um, whatever.

446
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:35,920
So I pulled out a dollar bill and I said, would you hire a guy that looked like that?

447
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,260
Actually, I didn't, but I thought of it later and I wrote it down.

448
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:44,120
So you get to use it next time.

449
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,860
Next time.

450
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:48,760
Next time somebody complains about your little buddy with the long hair, just pull out a

451
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,160
dollar bill and go, yeah, I wouldn't trust anybody with the long hair like that or who

452
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,620
smoked pot or had wooden teeth.

453
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,620
Goal.

454
00:25:57,120 --> 00:26:01,720
But really it's like the less you're out in the world, the scarier the world is.

455
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:09,280
If you go by television and the internet, the United States is a nonstop violence and

456
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,280
racial strife hell hole.

457
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,400
And yet.

458
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:12,400


459
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:13,140
Yeah.

460
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:19,960
And so when I go out in my neighborhood, which is actually very mixed, nobody seems to be

461
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,900
antagonistic about anything at all.

462
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,320
I have.

463
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:31,840
And, but again, that's people getting along and doing unto others isn't news.

464
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,720
And we have to remember that because everybody else seems to be forgetting it.

465
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,880
Honest.

466
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,240
You know, they do not look up from the bad news channel.

467
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,120
Yeah.

468
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:49,940
And I'm getting really tired of illiterate wing nuts of either wing anonymously lying

469
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:55,600
and trolling and insulting, trying to insult me bad.

470
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,020
And I do it so badly.

471
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:06,400
You know, it's funny how it gets to where you like the monsters more than the villagers.

472
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,860
No, I'm saying.

473
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:13,040
So you get these yo-yos on.

474
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,880
I'm the internet saying things like, yeah.

475
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:19,080
And this is like in response to an article about a lost puppy.

476
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:26,340
They cannot refrain from saying something like, well, it was white man that invented

477
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:27,500
puppies.

478
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:33,540
Or that being seriously, you've heard him say, oh, white man invented everything like

479
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,000
writing.

480
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,080
Well, no, I think Chinese had that first.

481
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,660
Well, they invented math.

482
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:38,340
No, no.

483
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:41,440
I think that was the Persians or probably somebody for that.

484
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:42,660
The Greeks did a lot of that.

485
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:43,020
Yeah.

486
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,020


487
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:45,520
The white man invented gunpowder.

488
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,960
No, actually the Chinese did that one too.

489
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:51,800
Here's the bottom line is news for you, dude.

490
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,100
An African invented walking up right.

491
00:27:56,440 --> 00:28:00,220
An African invented tool using.

492
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:03,760
An African invented people.

493
00:28:04,060 --> 00:28:06,860
So sorry, stupid rednecks.

494
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,080
The world is not going to move backwards for you to catch up.

495
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,940
And then climate change.

496
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,360
That's Jesus, man.

497
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:21,940
Whenever I see an article and I don't, I only read the news.

498
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:28,340
I don't do it on, I don't listen to radio or TV, which is why you may hear me mispronouncing

499
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,920
names and words a whole lot.

500
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,120
But climate change.

501
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,360
Well, I'm not a scientist.

502
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:34,140
I'm not going to tell.

503
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,920
I kind of gave up on making predictions myself.

504
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,300
That's 16 years ago.

505
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:40,900
Yeah.

506
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:46,020
But there's all these pundits.

507
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:50,100
I mean, you see an article again, it can be an article, anything about science, anything

508
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,360
at all.

509
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,320
New dinosaur discovered.

510
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:54,900
These expert Al Gore invented the internet.

511
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:55,400
Yeah.

512
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:57,760
Climate change.

513
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,320
Well, this is somebody else's writing.

514
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:07,060
Global warning and climate change is often explained by pundits as not the fault of humans,

515
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,740
especially not companies.

516
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,980
But it's because of this.

517
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:13,060
The sun getting warmer.

518
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:14,780
Okay.

519
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:19,820
Now to go to the ultimate next step using their logic.

520
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:25,240
Therefore we must fight solar radiation there on the sun.

521
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,300
So we won't have to fight it here in America.

522
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:32,240
And we know that the liberation of the sun will be a cakewalk.

523
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:33,520
Mission accomplished.

524
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,560
The sun spots will welcome us with parades and flowers.

525
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:40,840
The prominences will become McDonald's.

526
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,060
The sun spots will welcome us with parades and flowers.

527
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,740
And the flares will provide power to pay for their liberation.

528
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:50,480
The lost tribe of solar green energy demons will be our natural allies.

529
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:58,460
And our intelligence indicates there is thermonuclear activity hidden in the sun.

530
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,980
In the core of the sun.

531
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:05,460
If we hesitate to invade the sun, it will be too late to save ourselves.

532
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:11,040
To oppose this fully justified preemptive strike on the sun is to embolden the enemy.

533
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,040


534
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,040


535
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,700
And proclaim your treason.

536
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,440
So death to the sunnies.

537
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:16,420
Mission accomplished.

538
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:17,160
There we go.

539
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:18,100
Isn't that beautiful?

540
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:22,280
It does seem that way.

541
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,900
Here's another sad thing.

542
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:37,000
While I am here talking this bull, poor old Harvey Wasserman is earnestly trying to tell

543
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,360
you the truth about real government conspiracies.

544
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:41,020
And I'm not going to do that.

545
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:45,020
I'm going to tell you how to fight, in a practical way, the real conspiracy.

546
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:50,020
There's probably more people here because I think what we're talking about is not how

547
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:54,900
to fight the conspiracy, but just how to survive the conspiracy.

548
00:30:55,620 --> 00:31:02,620
All we want you to do is not kill yourself until next day.

549
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:03,160
How's that?

550
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,340
That's only a year.

551
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:05,820
So you can make it a year, right?

552
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,660
That's how we do it.

553
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:11,020
But really, there are other things.

554
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,020


555
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:11,020


556
00:31:11,020 --> 00:31:12,360
There are conspiracies for sure.

557
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:18,060
If I was really rich, I'd probably be in the rich people's conspiracy.

558
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,080
I hear that one's really fun.

559
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:23,420
And that may be the main one.

560
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:28,800
But you know, we've grown up hearing about the Kennedy assassination conspiracy.

561
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:32,040
Where are they hiding the UFOs?

562
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:38,720
Bush, Obama, Obabo.

563
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:39,900
That's the new enemy.

564
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:40,560
Obabo.

565
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,460
The preseserp.

566
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,420
You'll see him eventually on the internet.

567
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:49,220
Actually, it's just a picture of Obama mirrored, flipped, and photoshopped.

568
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,400
So he looks a little like Alfred E. Newman.

569
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,120
It's very funny.

570
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,840
And it says Obabo, the preseserp.

571
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:02,460
So from now on, friends, whenever anything goes wrong, I broke my shoelace.

572
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,620
Thanks, Obabo.

573
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:08,540
They're out of canned peaches, my favorite brand.

574
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,800
Thanks, Obabo.

575
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:13,340
It's all somebody else's fault anyway.

576
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,420
Oh, and the fashion conspiracies.

577
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,500
The ones that tell you who's hot and who's not.

578
00:32:20,380 --> 00:32:23,900
Boy, do they get it wrong in my book half the time.

579
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,560
I still subscribe to Famous Monsters of Filmland for my porno.

580
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:36,220
Anyway, yeah, the PC versus JC and so forth.

581
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,220
Redneck is in again.

582
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:39,900
It really is.

583
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,960
It's the conspiracy of the normal people because they want everybody, come on, man.

584
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,600
Aren't you normal?

585
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:56,060
I've read some guy bad mouthing some brand of computers because, well, I guess it was

586
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,420
Apple they were bitching about.

587
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:03,980
Because normal people, sure, those Apple fanboys like the Apple stuff.

588
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,400
But normal people don't.

589
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,540
That's the conspiracy talking.

590
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,180
I'm afraid.

591
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,580
I need a Mac repaired, by the way, if anybody happens to really know.

592
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,800
So it is a war, friends.

593
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,000
It's us versus them.

594
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:28,020
And I guess designing the humans back in the old days was probably our worst mistake.

595
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:32,280
And now we look like them and act like them half the time.

596
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,540
On the other hand, though, I think a lot of us here are what we call saps.

597
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:39,520
I'm not sure what that means.

598
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:43,000
I mean, saps, self amusing personalities.

599
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:50,840
If a subgenius or even an unsaved as yet unsaved subgenius like a number of you, if you get

600
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:58,060
stuck at a bus stop, I'm pretty sure that most of us have enough weirdness in our minds

601
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:03,060
to entertain ourselves looking at dirt, at least for a little while.

602
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:06,720
If you have a magnifying glass, man, it's downright scary.

603
00:34:06,980 --> 00:34:09,520
There's some crazy stuff going on down there in the air.

604
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:09,520


605
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:16,960
that dirt. But the worst, very most tenacious and insidious part of the

606
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:26,620
conspiracy is the part in us when we don't think twice and say something mean

607
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:33,420
to somebody just because they were dumb. I mean like we never did anything dumb.

608
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:39,780
That's the conspiracy talking. You always feel bad about it later. If only we could

609
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:44,900
smell it coming ahead of time and I guess that's what some of us are trying

610
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:51,560
to do. But it's hard because you go to work right? And as Bob said, if you act

611
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:59,440
like a dumb shit they'll treat you as an equal. Sad but true. The day came when I

612
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:03,180
got tired of my fellow Texans going, how about them cowboys dude?

613
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:03,400
I'm not going to do that. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it.

614
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:08,780
I finally said, I'm one of those fags that hates football. Okay, leave me alone.

615
00:35:10,020 --> 00:35:15,920
I wouldn't recommend that in getting ahead on the job in Dallas, Texas. But you

616
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:22,580
notice I don't live in Dallas, Texas anymore. There is an antidote to the

617
00:35:22,580 --> 00:35:28,940
conspiracy and that's slack. And although we can sell you lots of little slack

618
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:33,240
aids, we're not pretending that we're selling you slack. We're

619
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:39,700
just kind of doling out pep talks on a weekly basis on three different

620
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:44,280
subgenius shows around the country. They are all very different and they're all

621
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:49,120
free to hear on the Internet at subgenius.com. And strangely

622
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:55,940
enough they've all been around for thirty years! Yes it's true. But the

623
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,060
reason we don't try to tell you what slack is,

624
00:35:59,220 --> 00:36:03,100
well number one, conspiracy is always telling you that. It's when you're

625
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:05,400
depending on the commercial you're watching or whatever,

626
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,920
it's when you're drinking Miller Lite and your team just won

627
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:12,120
and you're good looking and you have a good normal job

628
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:12,940
and you're normal.

629
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:19,220
Slack is really, true Slack,

630
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:21,100
is different for everybody.

631
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,700
For some people it is sitting on your ass watching TV,

632
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,220
smoking a joint or whatever.

633
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,400
For other people, it's frantically working on the thing they like to do.

634
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:34,320
The Cacophony Society calls that being in the zone.

635
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,980
We used to call it spouting.

636
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,280
We just call it Slack.

637
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:39,720
It's something for nothing.

638
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,360
Every time I come to Starwood,

639
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:48,160
I see an example of pure Slack.

640
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,660
I mean, you cannot get more pure than that.

641
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,060
Two nights ago, I guess it was during the Bardic thing,

642
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,800
there was a little kid,

643
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,620
I think it was a little,

644
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,380
yeah, it must be a little kid,

645
00:36:59,380 --> 00:36:59,840
it must have been a little girl.

646
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,500
She was naked.

647
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,800
She was two years old,

648
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,900
just running back and forth in the mud.

649
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,520
She didn't need the band.

650
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,540
She didn't need the glow sticks

651
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:11,680
or the,

652
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:17,640
what would Afghan kush or whatever,

653
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:18,800
purple, silver.

654
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:22,220
All she needed was mud.

655
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,340
And let's see,

656
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:29,100
our friends Ben and Haley had that little kid,

657
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:29,940
Chameleon,

658
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,200
whose nickname is Bob, I was told.

659
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,200
That's very strange.

660
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:41,440
Chameleon had all he needed with a little train set.

661
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,380
Again, there was all these grownups.

662
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:47,660
There were beautiful naked women and men dancing around.

663
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,060
But the kid had Slack.

664
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,120
It did not need the expensive band or the light show

665
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,360
or Reverend Stang preaching at him.

666
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,040
You're born with original Slack.

667
00:37:58,300 --> 00:37:59,280
But the conspiracy,

668
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,920
just whacks it out of you sooner or later.

669
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:06,620
It's very hard to hang on to that kind of Slack.

670
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,740
Of course, on the other hand, though,

671
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:09,760
and this is,

672
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,260
I had a very anxiety-ridden youth and middle age.

673
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:17,540
I was preaching Slack.

674
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:19,900
A lot of you heard it in the day,

675
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,240
but I did not have Slack.

676
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,980
I knew I was missing it.

677
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:25,940
I didn't have it.

678
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:27,660
Now, I feel like,

679
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,340
well,

680
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:30,780
actually, I guess since 2001,

681
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,160
when Princess Wee and I got married

682
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,780
and moved into that place in Cleveland Heights,

683
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,400
I've had pretty much Slack.

684
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,260
Everything improved.

685
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,000
It's called old age Slack.

686
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,600
Now, in the really good cases,

687
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:45,020
you can,

688
00:38:46,780 --> 00:38:47,860
as you age,

689
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,680
you become less concerned with your image

690
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,880
and what people think of you

691
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,180
and more concerned with things like what's for dinner,

692
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:57,200
which actually makes a whole lot more sense.

693
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:57,640
And

694
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:01,360
if we can all strive to be examples of

695
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,380
not sitting on your ass watching TV

696
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:07,720
until you can't get up again,

697
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,380
then that's pretty good.

698
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,340
Dr. Critner there is an excellent example

699
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,540
of somebody who's made it

700
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,100
quite a long ways down the track

701
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,900
and is still up and running.

702
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:22,540
And I would like to do,

703
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,860
but you know, no matter how new age you get,

704
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,100
old age is going to kick your ass.

705
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:31,240
And it's tough being a large mammal

706
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:36,760
and fate is unfair pretty much by definition.

707
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:40,880
Which brings me to my good friend, Jeff Rosenbaum.

708
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,460
Is he around here right now?

709
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,700
I guess not.

710
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:45,280
Not sure.

711
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,160
He's still up there.

712
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,240
Well, anyway, he'll hear the tape.

713
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:57,260
Jeff invited me to my first Starwood in 19.

714
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:04,280
I was very suspicious because I'm the mascot rationalist,

715
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,100
materialist.

716
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,080
I'm a skeptic.

717
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,160
I don't believe in magic.

718
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,680
Although I've seen quite a bit of it.

719
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:10,280
Isn't that funny?

720
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,540
And I don't believe in ghosts,

721
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,020
mainly because I'm scared of them.

722
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:16,520
But Jeff invited me.

723
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,880
Sure enough, I came to my first Starwood.

724
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,380
And there are fundy pagans,

725
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,380
fundamentalist pagans who hate the Church of the Subgenius

726
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,620
and pretty much anything that is religious.

727
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:29,240
And that isn't part of their particular little clique.

728
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,960
But the non-fundy pagans love to piss off the fundy pagans.

729
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,320
That's why I'm here.

730
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,480
Praise Bob.

731
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:39,800
You're welcome.

732
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:44,060
Notice that most of the fundies aren't here, but whatever.

733
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:52,800
Anyway, my point was Starwood is really important to me,

734
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:57,520
personally, because that visit here in 1919,

735
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:57,600


736
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:01,280
ultimately led me to the slack that I now enjoy

737
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:02,720
in a pretty direct way.

738
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,720
I met all my Ohio friends.

739
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,920
I ended up marrying into Starwood.

740
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,240
The less said, the better.

741
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:16,540
But really, it did become slack, friends.

742
00:41:16,580 --> 00:41:18,280
There is such a thing as slack.

743
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:22,780
And you can get it, so don't kill yourself yet.

744
00:41:23,640 --> 00:41:25,540
Thanks, Jeff, and a big . . .

745
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:26,360
. . .

746
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:34,360
Last year, I mentioned that the original title of my sermon

747
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,440
was Praying is for Sissies.

748
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,760
But then I said, no, that's too mean, so I won't say it.

749
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:41,800
And then I went ahead and said it.

750
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:45,000
And I still kind of feel that way.

751
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,740
It's like, oh, really, God needs your help that way.

752
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:49,200
He needs you to tell him what to do.

753
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:54,660
He needs little old ladies to defend him from, say,

754
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:56,340
the Church of the Subgenius.

755
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,660
And their fiendish war on God.

756
00:41:59,300 --> 00:41:59,820
Yeah.

757
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,180
Reverend Krippner . . . I mean, Dr. Krippner.

758
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:04,380
See, I'm getting stuck here.

759
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:08,860
Dr. Krippner mentioned healing ceremonies with his friend,

760
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:09,820
Rolling Thunder.

761
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:13,940
And I've actually had real similar experiences in a funny way.

762
00:42:14,080 --> 00:42:20,740
By the oddest circumstances, I ended up working at the Rosebud Sioux

763
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:24,240
Reservation in South Dakota in the 70s.

764
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:27,140
They're actually called the Lakota.

765
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,180
Not the Sioux, I think is a Blackfoot name for them, meaning snake in the grass.

766
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:37,060
Whereas Lakota means human beings, like most people's names themselves.

767
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:42,400
But I had some experiences with a medicine man named Robert Steed.

768
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:46,380
I later realized, after I'd been to a couple of his

769
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:50,820
Uwipi healing ceremonies, that he was using simple stage magic.

770
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,740
Fooled me at the time.

771
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,140
But later I realized . . .

772
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,440
I had a very different kind of thought.

773
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,920
He warned us about that.

774
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:00,680
He said, you may change your mind about what you saw here,

775
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:01,760
but hold on to the feeling.

776
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:03,780
And what I think he was . . .

777
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:04,400
And it's true.

778
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:11,980
Scientifically, if certain prerequisites are in place,

779
00:43:12,780 --> 00:43:14,300
healing will take place.

780
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:20,080
Whether it's Chinese medicine, Western, you know, the machine that goes ding.

781
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:24,120
In my case, my faith is in . . .

782
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:25,640
Very high bills.

783
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:29,320
High, high doctor bills paid by an insurance company.

784
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,760
That's my faith healing.

785
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:35,380
I used to think, oh man, I'm too much of a skeptic to have a placebo work on me anymore.

786
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:35,720
Nah.

787
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:41,400
A high bill will certainly convince me I've gotten my money's worth or something.

788
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:44,760
But the circumstances required . . .

789
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:45,180
What was it?

790
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:54,100
If the patient knows that the community respects a certain doctor or whatever,

791
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:54,100


792
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:59,800
medicine man, and if there's a place where you go that's a special place . . .

793
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,180
And what was the other . . .

794
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:01,900
There were three things.

795
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,460
Maybe the person, the place, and of course the community.

796
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:09,100
Praying may not do a damn thing, maybe.

797
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,660
But if you know people are praying for you, it might do a hell of a lot of good.

798
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,960
And I actually had a doctor, Dr. Larry Dossey, who was my personal physician,

799
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:20,440
until he got too sick to work.

800
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:24,080
And he wrote a . . .

801
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:28,240
Even if you don't know people are praying for you, you might have a slightly better chance.

802
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:34,280
Anyway, as much as I don't believe . . .

803
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,040
It's funny how often . . .

804
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:37,300
And not just regarding Jeff.

805
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:41,420
I've had several friends in the hospital lately, because I'm that age.

806
00:44:43,120 --> 00:44:47,200
Funny if I didn't find myself waking up in the morning praying.

807
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:48,880
Not to anybody.

808
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,380
Certainly not Bob.

809
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:54,000
And, you know, because who knows who else might be listening.

810
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:57,480
But just, you know, it's so corny to say,

811
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:59,440
Well, I'll be thinking good thoughts for you.

812
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:00,380
I'll be sending good vibes.

813
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:02,220
That's okay if it's corny.

814
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,560
It can't hurt.

815
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,600
That's the important thing.

816
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:09,180
You know, believe or not believe, whatever.

817
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:14,200
If it's not going to hurt, go ahead and send those nice vibes.

818
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:18,540
Now, I get frustrated with my fellow subgeniuses,

819
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:22,480
many of whom really do get their slack from sitting on their ass watching TV,

820
00:45:22,780 --> 00:45:24,060
smoking joints, drinking.

821
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,300
Drinking beer and being on the . . .

822
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:25,600
Wait a minute.

823
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:26,580
I'm just describing myself.

824
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:27,960
Oh, no.

825
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:28,940
I play video games.

826
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:29,540
That's different.

827
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,480
That's active.

828
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:35,100
I ran an experiment here last X Day.

829
00:45:36,860 --> 00:45:41,620
The intention of the experiment was to get as many subgeniuses as I could

830
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:53,360
to stand up on their feet, walk, go off the road and into the woods.

831
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,520
Yeah, I know.

832
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:59,420
It's a pretty radical thing for some people in this day and age.

833
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,600
But I thought if I could get maybe half, just 25 of them to do it,

834
00:46:03,620 --> 00:46:05,520
a couple of them might do it again.

835
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:06,620
And I did.

836
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:09,520
I got 25 people to walk into the woods, and here's how I did it.

837
00:46:10,840 --> 00:46:14,600
I committed murders all over the campground and blamed them on Bob,

838
00:46:14,620 --> 00:46:15,760
and we went on a Bob hunt.

839
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:19,000
Of course, since Bob was the culprit, he got away.

840
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:22,280
But we didn't reveal all that at first, or there wouldn't have been a hunt.

841
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,800
And really, there were no bodies, so I guess you can't say there was a murder.

842
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:33,280
But first, somebody smuggled their little dog, Snuckles, into the camp,

843
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:36,820
and the dog got lost or disappeared.

844
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:42,520
Well, the next day, we found Snuckles horribly, brutally destroyed.

845
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,640
It looked like a, well, it really looked like a bunch of chicken wings

846
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,040
that somebody had just finished eating.

847
00:46:47,260 --> 00:46:49,580
It's disgusting what happened to Snuckles.

848
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,100
No person or animal could have done this.

849
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:58,500
Then, the Nostrils, Potter and Petal, were, well, necking in their car

850
00:46:58,500 --> 00:47:03,700
when something, some huge, ferocious, sexual thing came out of the woods

851
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:08,280
and raped their car while they were in it.

852
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,420
Although they got better gas mileage because they used the gas pump.

853
00:47:11,720 --> 00:47:12,980
I mean, the gas hole.

854
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:17,320
And the exhaust, the thing, was all blown out.

855
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:22,220
And then we found, who was it, the body, or just the clothing.

856
00:47:22,220 --> 00:47:26,040
Blood-splattered clothing with no body of Reverend Bastard,

857
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:28,380
who was, there's always one at every festival.

858
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,380
That was really his name, too.

859
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:33,560
And he lived up to it, and we never wanted to see him again.

860
00:47:33,660 --> 00:47:36,540
But he snuck back in, and, well, the thing got him.

861
00:47:36,700 --> 00:47:39,860
Well, finally, we heard that the thing was down there at the Hickory Grove,

862
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:45,260
and we ran, that was when, luckily, we had a costume ball with the theme of warriors.

863
00:47:45,580 --> 00:47:51,520
So everybody had squirt guns and Nerf bats, and I had a really nice suit of armor.

864
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:56,220
So I got them all to chase the monster down to the Hickory Grove,

865
00:47:56,280 --> 00:48:00,600
where we found irrefutable evidence that the monster was J.R. Bob Dobbs.

866
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,400
Therefore, he won. He got away.

867
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:04,880
There's no point chasing him unless he wants us to.

868
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,920
And that motivated our burning, you know, where they do a bonfire here,

869
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,500
and I'll see you at the bonfire tonight.

870
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:16,400
We burn effigies of J.R. Bob Dobbs.

871
00:48:16,640 --> 00:48:20,280
Sometimes they're just a rough icon of wood,

872
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:21,500
but sometimes they're pretty good.

873
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:21,500


874
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,520
They're a very realistic dummy, a scary robot of Bob.

875
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:30,100
And I've noticed that after the first time we did that,

876
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,600
done the pawpaw patch, the first X Day we had here,

877
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:34,980
the pagans quit coming to X Day.

878
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:40,200
They were really confused by the way that the subgeniuses would act for a week,

879
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:43,540
like they were mindless followers of this Bob guy,

880
00:48:43,740 --> 00:48:47,860
and then at the end of the week, they're peeing on him, jumping up and down on him,

881
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:50,920
cooking hot dogs on his flaming shoes.

882
00:48:51,520 --> 00:48:53,580
Lighting joints off of his face.

883
00:48:55,160 --> 00:49:00,760
So, anyway, I was really glad to get those nerds off their butts.

884
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:02,640
I'm a nerd too. I mean, don't get me wrong.

885
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,920
I used to say that I returned to my childhood religion science fiction.

886
00:49:08,440 --> 00:49:11,180
Nah, that was pretty in it up.

887
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:15,000
My childhood religion is monsters, plain and simple,

888
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:17,580
and I'm still a monster nerd.

889
00:49:17,960 --> 00:49:21,020
And that's how I got interested in religion.

890
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,740
It's got monsters.

891
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:25,360
It's like sci-fi.

892
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:27,740
There's all kinds of crazy stuff.

893
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:30,520
When you're a kid, where can you read about...

894
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:32,960
Well, now, it's very different.

895
00:49:33,180 --> 00:49:37,380
But in 1959, if you were a stupid little redneck kid,

896
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,280
you wanted to read about cyclopses,

897
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,140
the only place you could go was Greek mythology.

898
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,240
You know, or Norse mythology.

899
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,000
They had cool monsters.

900
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,840
Well, at one point, it sinks in,

901
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:52,440
and you think, man, these people really believe this stuff

902
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:56,140
about this prophet who last lives forever and heals people.

903
00:49:58,400 --> 00:49:59,000
Whoa.

904
00:50:01,080 --> 00:50:04,940
Suddenly, the Methodist church adds up.

905
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:08,040
Oh, well.

906
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:12,820
So, yeah, I used to be frustrated with the sheer nerdliness

907
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:16,080
of half the subgeniuses, because, let's face it,

908
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:19,820
a lot of them are pretty on the sub side of subgenius.

909
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:24,620
Some of them are kind of nerdier even than me.

910
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,980
And then I kind of went, yeah, duh.

911
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,340
Of course, it sunk in.

912
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:33,500
That is what it's all about.

913
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,920
Sure, they're fucked up, because there really is a conspiracy

914
00:50:36,920 --> 00:50:39,820
of normal people taking away their slack.

915
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:41,760
And of course they're fucked up,

916
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:45,740
and that's why J.R. Bob Dobbs is their god.

917
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,740
And now, to come close,

918
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:49,820
or to come close,

919
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:50,780
close to closing,

920
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,120
I think I have another 15 minutes,

921
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:56,060
I'm going to read another rant.

922
00:50:57,220 --> 00:51:00,540
And it's another one that sounds like I wrote it,

923
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,200
but it was really written by a young lady.

924
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:05,260
I don't hate anymore.

925
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:06,520
I got slack.

926
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,140
I can't write like that anymore.

927
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:10,700
I honestly can't.

928
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,820
I don't have that much anger in me.

929
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:17,180
But, thank goodness, lots of young people still have

930
00:51:17,180 --> 00:51:19,800
that horrible treadmill to deal with.

931
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:22,920
And they are writing really good rants as follows.

932
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:26,700
You guys just don't get it.

933
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:29,420
Fuck you if you can't take a joke.

934
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,900
You're just a bunch of bullies.

935
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,720
I thought you guys would accept me and understand me.

936
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,320
I have slack.

937
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,100
I know what slack means.

938
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,780
Why won't you listen to my wisdom?

939
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:44,900
Why am I the only one who gets it?

940
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:45,720
Meh.

941
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:51,160
Yeah, I understand what world you wish you were living on.

942
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,600
You know, the one that revolves completely around you

943
00:51:53,600 --> 00:51:56,540
and all things live and die according to your needs and whims.

944
00:51:56,740 --> 00:52:01,240
But have you any idea what world you're actually living on?

945
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:03,800
I don't mean which world you call it.

946
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:06,880
Mars, Earth, the planet of the clocks, whatever.

947
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:11,960
A pink planet by any other name smells just as foul.

948
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:14,880
I mean, have you somehow made it?

949
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,160
However many days, months, years, or decades,

950
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,620
you've been alive without coming to terms with your surroundings?

951
00:52:20,940 --> 00:52:28,740
So what makes you think that a $35 donation once to any organization ever,

952
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:30,700
under any circumstance,

953
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:35,080
would absolve you of all responsibility in every action you take?

954
00:52:36,020 --> 00:52:39,920
Just because Bob knows you by accepting your money

955
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,400
doesn't mean he wants to.

956
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:42,460
He has to.

957
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:43,760
He can't help it.

958
00:52:43,840 --> 00:52:45,400
If Bob were a fisherman,

959
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,840
he'd throw most of your scrawny souls back into the cosmic ocean

960
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,780
and wait for them to fatten up.

961
00:52:51,980 --> 00:52:53,700
But you paid your money,

962
00:52:53,800 --> 00:52:55,900
so Bob must accept you.

963
00:52:55,980 --> 00:52:57,840
That doesn't mean anybody else has to.

964
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:02,380
You still have to demonstrate that you are a subgenius worth knowing.

965
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,920
Otherwise, you're just another braying pink clamoring for approval

966
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,980
by going about it the exact wrong way.

967
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:15,380
If you already believe you're without fault and possessive,

968
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:15,920
you're just perfect enlightenment,

969
00:53:16,520 --> 00:53:18,860
why even join Church of the Subgenius?

970
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,760
Why not just bask in your holy oneness with everything?

971
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:26,280
Or could it be that you desire community and kinship?

972
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:32,000
Do you desire to soak in group slack with fellow mutant weirdos?

973
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:37,440
Don't sell yourself short by assuming that you are without flaw

974
00:53:37,440 --> 00:53:39,120
and not in need of growth.

975
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:43,040
That just means you're missing out on all the things you could be doing better.

976
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:44,500
You, yes you,

977
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:48,580
can improve at your own pace and in your own ways.

978
00:53:48,980 --> 00:53:51,240
Or you can stay stunted and bored,

979
00:53:51,420 --> 00:53:52,980
but I don't recommend it.

980
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:56,100
Do not sell yourself short

981
00:53:56,100 --> 00:54:00,400
because Bob Dobbs wants to sell you long.

982
00:54:01,140 --> 00:54:04,200
He wants to tickle your forebrain

983
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,500
until you're sneezing slack,

984
00:54:06,680 --> 00:54:09,780
until you're so swollen and bursting with slack

985
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:12,880
that you barely fit into a soul canister.

986
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:14,480
Until you have enough of it,

987
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:16,760
until you have slack reserves to live off of,

988
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,160
even when you're being browbitten by the conspiracy.

989
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:25,240
Until you can understand those prophetic words spoken by Zeppo,

990
00:54:25,540 --> 00:54:28,640
who is the church AI, by the way,

991
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,500
slack will get you through times of no slack.

992
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,580
It's true that a robot said that,

993
00:54:37,660 --> 00:54:44,040
but it actually makes sense in this subgenius way.

994
00:54:44,500 --> 00:54:46,960
Friends, do not wait for the men from Planet X,

995
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:47,740
the Exus,

996
00:54:47,860 --> 00:54:50,100
to come along and solve all your problems.

997
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:52,320
Then you're just like any other whiner

998
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,480
waiting for the government to come fix everything.

999
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:57,640
Or you're just like every other religious nutbag

1000
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,760
waiting for God to swoop in

1001
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,340
and for death to whisk you to the afterlife

1002
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,840
where everything is perfect forever

1003
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:05,540
and there's no struggle

1004
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:09,320
and you forget about any person on Earth

1005
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,900
that you might have cared about

1006
00:55:10,900 --> 00:55:12,940
who may still be struggling.

1007
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:14,480
Do not wait for the men from Planet X,

1008
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,040
do not neglect the before life.

1009
00:55:17,820 --> 00:55:21,600
Do not be a cud chewing cow waiting for the slaughter,

1010
00:55:21,720 --> 00:55:23,260
waiting for the big fix,

1011
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:26,700
because believe me, they'll fix you good.

1012
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,860
Do something now!

1013
00:55:30,480 --> 00:55:33,640
What do you think it means to build your own saucer?

1014
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:35,860
You are your own saucer.

1015
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,060
Your brain is...

1016
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,020
...blah.

1017
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:44,220
And remember, part of the beauty of the men from Planet X,

1018
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:45,060
the exus,

1019
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:47,120
is that we all get off together.

1020
00:55:47,580 --> 00:55:50,000
It depends entirely on you

1021
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,300
whether that is a good thing or a bad thing.

1022
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,020
And those are the words of Reverend Baby Bear.

1023
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,400
And, you know,

1024
00:56:00,580 --> 00:56:02,640
if people go around...

1025
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,020
Oh, every ex day, people go,

1026
00:56:05,180 --> 00:56:08,020
oh, we could have had a new government

1027
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:11,460
that was all better than the other one.

1028
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,180
Instead, it's just kind of the same.

1029
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:15,300
We could have new churches of genius,

1030
00:56:15,340 --> 00:56:16,300
it'd be powerful.

1031
00:56:16,820 --> 00:56:19,400
We could have new coolness where we'd be cool.

1032
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:22,560
Hey, what are you waiting for, friends?

1033
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:25,500
Are we going to cooperate with those losers,

1034
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:27,300
the exus, the men from Planet X,

1035
00:56:27,420 --> 00:56:29,160
and the Jehovah One, Bob?

1036
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,720
Geez, man.

1037
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:32,600
Make your own slack.

1038
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,620
Bob is not the answer,

1039
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,940
and neither is anything else.

1040
00:56:38,120 --> 00:56:38,980
Praise Bob.

1041
00:56:39,260 --> 00:56:42,460
You must learn to think for yourself.

1042
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:45,360
Only Bob can show you how.

1043
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:49,560
And you must question authority.

1044
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:51,060
All right!

1045
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:52,860
That's all.

1046
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,480
Thank you. That's good.

1047
00:56:55,600 --> 00:56:56,900
Been reading your prescriptions.

1048
00:56:57,140 --> 00:57:00,140
And fuck them if they can't take a joke.

1049
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:00,960
Praise Bob.

1050
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,860
Thank you very much.

1051
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,060
Now, they're going to need to start setting up the band

1052
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:11,080
in about ten minutes,

1053
00:57:11,180 --> 00:57:12,440
but if there's anybody with them,

1054
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:14,540
I'd be willing to answer with really life,

1055
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:16,860
you know, life or death question.

1056
00:57:16,940 --> 00:57:19,560
I'd be willing to answer it with something.

1057
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,120
What I'd rather do is go over there and buy stuff,

1058
00:57:23,460 --> 00:57:28,140
because all the answers are actually in the book of the subgenius.

1059
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,660
It will tell you everything you ever wanted to hear.

1060
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:35,860
So the next time somebody argues with you,

1061
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:38,400
just show that to them.

1062
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,060
Go, I've got Bob and you don't.

1063
00:57:40,120 --> 00:57:41,360
That makes me better than you.

1064
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,800
I don't have to be smarter.

1065
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,460
I don't have to be better looking or richer or anything.

1066
00:57:47,020 --> 00:57:48,560
I've got Bob and you don't.

1067
00:57:48,560 --> 00:57:49,720
So there, that's it.

1068
00:57:51,340 --> 00:57:53,660
Bob sold it. I smoked it. That settles it.

1069
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:56,540
What else is there?

1070
00:58:00,300 --> 00:58:00,780
Okay.

1071
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:07,720
Hints to the swag table.

1072
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:09,380
Oh, good.

1073
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:11,340
One hour forty-seven minutes.

1074
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:12,540
Twenty-seven seconds. Exactly.

1075
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:18,360
Oh, and I got wristband number 273.

1076
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:24,300
Only a few die-hard subgenius memorizers will understand the significance.

1077
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:25,160
Well, I'll tell you.

1078
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:29,580
The Discordian said 23 is this magic number.

1079
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:36,020
Well, we decided that we'd make it harder and add another digit.

1080
00:58:36,340 --> 00:58:40,500
So 273 is the subgenius magic number,

1081
00:58:40,500 --> 00:58:43,660
and when I drove up to Starwood to register,

1082
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:45,760
I got number 272!

1083
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:51,940
So I said, can I swap this for 273?

1084
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,980
And they said, here, take two of these things.

1085
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:01,980
Forgetting that each of these things costs, A, $65,

1086
00:59:03,400 --> 00:59:06,280
because they mean another person at Wisteria.

1087
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,980
But we took care of that in accounting,

1088
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:12,700
and I've got number 273 and 272,

1089
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,560
so I'm going to go vote twice.

1090
00:59:18,120 --> 00:59:21,440
I'm going to vote for Obabo, the Prez's Cirque.

1091
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,200
Thank you.

1092
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:36,740
Oh, look, I got a dollar and a half still.

1093
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:45,240
You've been listening to the Subgenius Radio Ministry Hour of Slack.
