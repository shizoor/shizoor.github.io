You probably thought this song was about you.
Fruit flies, to tell the truth, because by creating mutant fruit flies with an impaired capacity to suck up the salt,
scientists have now identified several genes, designer genes, that contribute to this crucial sensory system in insects.
Hello? Yeah, we're in here. We're doing the show.
Designer genes.
Yes, they're very tiny, but the insects can wear them.
How do they make them that small?
They have assembly lines in sweatshops.
In foreign countries.
Tiny children with extremely good eyesight manufacture the Jordache genes for the Orthoptera, Choleoptera, and Edentia.
Everybody's welcome in here, all persuasions and ethnic origins.
A customized pair of designer genes for the centipede, which has so many pant legs.
It causes an entire set of...
It takes a while to get one of those pair of pants made, I believe.
You know, something they have to concentrate on.
Spend a lot of time. Sometimes it takes several generations to generate.
...start thinking it seems to hang on...
At any rate, you see the salt...
No problem.
...has tested...
All right.
...the material.
There we go.
...the iron channel...
Usually, radio announcements merely recommend a product, but this station provides its clients with a special service.
The Salt Genius.
Our host...
...Squatch.
In the radio studios of Bob, the technicians, the entertainers, the commentators, the administrative personnel...
...daily unite their efforts in the creation of programs to please and entertain a vast radio public.
The wide variety of broadcasts include group discussions...
...political speeches...
...and comedy.
On this program, frank opinions are expressed in response to their leaders' questioning.
Questions of the day are discussed, and opinions and attitudes freely expressed on issues of the moment.
For there is keen interest in a radio program that invites personal participation by the public.
This is independent radio in a democracy.
Thank you to the mission of...
Your time is fast approaching.
So they say.
Your cycle has ended.
And those who are in the know will be alive for a shower of riches, wealth, and power.
Oh boy, sign me up.
Yee-haw!

Yes.
This is one of four hours of slack that'll culminate in number 99.
All about our friends from out of space and x-day.
I have to do all of these shows at once fast.
And so they might all start out the exact same way.
Because they're all composed of the same four basic parts.

each of which, of course, has its own 500 insane, totally new parts.
The first of these would be the ancient, and I mean truly ancient,
subgenius media barrage tape number two about UFOs and Bob,
which was assembled in 1981 by the very earliest, most primitive subgenius doctors
working under even more primitive conditions under Bob.
You will hear or possibly have heard the infant Philodrumon, baby puzzling evidence,
little glass madness, teeny tiny versions of old, long gone dead subgeniuses
such as David Boone and Dr. X.
May they rest in peace.
And even you will hear the teeny tiny baby Reverend Stang, yours truly.
Now the second part of all of these shows will come from,
Reverend Susie the Floozy's barrage edits about X-Day,
when the aliens will come from her show, Bob's Slack Time Funhouse on WREK in Atlanta.
Oh yes, nobody can cut and sling like Susie.
And we'll also be hearing live recordings from the most recent actual subgenius,
subgenius worship event, X-Day, 6X-Day this time,
last July's yearly drill for when the saucers will arrive.
And of course, number four, we'll hear the usual hour of slack bits from ESO Radio and WCSB Cleveland
with Chad Smith and Lonesome Cowboy David,
plus the unusual collages of Fernand and Ande Lee Murr.
Oh yes, and number five, the music of...
So-So Dada.
Yeah.
Yeah.











In the background with his X-Day 6 noise opera,
as heard, like so much of this, on alt.binary slack that's placed on the internet.
Oh yeah.
So do the new ones redeem as much of a bobby soul as the old pamphlets?
Oh, more.
The new ones are much more highly compressed and efficient.
The new pamphlets can actually extract up to 90%,
99.9% of a bobby's soul in less than nine-tenths of a second.
So the, uh, the definitely, the slack, uh, you can acquire a whole lot more slack faster
and at cheaper cost with the new, more efficient subgenius pamphlets.
Yes, even you, those of you who, who have, who can barely discern white from black, day from night,
no, no reflection upon your vision, of course.
It is important to make those distinctions.
Are asking those, those decisions, making those decisions in the help book of Jayner.
Therefore, there is a God.
End of quote.
I said, you're gonna have to get yourself in discernment here
and be able to discern the spirit of God from the spirit of Hinduism.
I said, people in Haiti, I said, when the Holy Ghost hits them, they think it's Buddha.
Because Buddha hits them.
Like the Holy Ghost.
The Holy Ghost hits them.
Even in America, think that, that when the Holy Ghost hits somebody, it's witchcraft.
Yes, witchcraft.
Those people down, they see demonic visions.
And the devil uses them.
Buddhism.
And witchcraft.
And the powers of, of the pagan gods.
The powers of the pagan gods produce it.
Lying signs in one's mind.
And the powers of the pagan gods are the wonders.
But I want you to know that the pagan gods and their false religions can do what they're doing in the world.
Bless God, what can we do with a true God?
With a true Christ?
With a true Holy Ghost?
We ought to be able to do more than what they're doing.
Hallelujah.
How would the God God take the scales off your eyes?
And open your eyes to behold that the Lord's coming is at the door.
And that all that's happening in the world is getting us ready for Jesus Christ to dwell in the fullness.
Of God in the saints.
That we will come forth with revelation and manifestation of the Holy Ghost.
Revealing Christ to the world.
That we will possess in our temples the very fullness of the Spirit.
That we'll be filled with the Spirit.
We'll be filled with it.
We'll have oil in our lamps burning.
That we will not stop until our lives have been complete.
I don't care.
They can talk about me all over Brownwood and Baines and around here.
Call me anything.
I'm preaching the truth.
They can talk about me and turn on this minister and say this ain't real.
But you let one of them hypocrites come and show where I'm wrong.
And take the Bible and prove that this ain't God.
And this ain't the word of God to the people.
And I'll leave tomorrow.
Hallelujah.
But I'm not leaving tomorrow.
You say why?
Because there ain't nobody in the state of Texas and the state of Alabama, Florida or anywhere else.
Can take the word of God and prove this is wrong.
They may lie.
They may kill.
They may tell all manner of evil.
But they cannot touch this spirit.
They cannot touch this word.
This is the word of the Holy Ghost.
This is God's promise.
This is God's word.
God's truth to you.
And if you...
God is evil.
God is evil.
God is evil.
God is evil.
God is evil.
God is evil.
God is evil.
God is evil.
God is evil.
God is evil.
God says it.

One reverse old sh ج.
One change.
It's not even тебяign.
You just be here to see your support.
And you can come see my Whereabouts.
That God is everywhere.
And you help your other self.
And you have strength.

And fill that wake up.
They get in there and they say, but the Hades, the Hades and the unseen world and the abode of the lost.
And they said that ain't real.
And I seen it down there on the seventh level.
And the mystery, the mystery, the mystery, it just tears us apart, the mystery.
And if we can just say, I know that everything will be fine.
We are gone.
We are gone.
We are gone.
We are gone.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
Don't you feel that sometimes you just have to let one go.

Friends, remember the old days.
Well, that's where all of that came from.
The old, old, the day, the actual day that they talk about.
The day before the computers, before the digital mixing, the day of the cassette deck and the reel to reel splicing take.
The days of media barrage number two about UFOs from the year of our ord 19 and 81.
Do not go beyond what we became a senile small girl, middle school years later, actually.
Meanwhile.
Flash, like something out of the twilight show about that.
So my god, what is that?
What?
Well, there's my ride.
I
For sure, you keep practising day won't get you to your one of the light Perhaps you'll smile when you were the star here.

Perhaps you could notice that was a classic one my folks about the first or they are
it's going kind of Simulation now.

Bob! There's something on the screen!
Yes. It might be him, but the picture isn't very clear.
My God.
Bob, it's coming right at us.
I can't believe it.
Look at those tentacles.
They're coming! From outer space, they're coming!
They're going to enter our atmosphere!
We want the Earth! We want the Earth!
We want the Earth!
Through clear skies, tracking lightly from far down the line.
No fanfare, just a blip on the screen.
No quick conclusions, now everything will be fine.
Short circuit glitch and not what it seems.
The Earth is coming!

The Earth is coming!
Uh, hello.
Alien? What do you mean, alien?
What do you mean from another planet?
That's a tricky one, isn't it?
Well, if that's the life, don't let them out.
They're a flying saucer.
We don't want a lot of little green men terrorizing the home counties during Askert Week, do we?
Hmm?
Yes, all right. Full emergency.
You hear the news?
You hear the news?
Aliens are coming to New York!
One night only, $2,000 a ticket.
Yee-haw!
We want the alien! We want the alien! We want the alien!
So what are you guys here for? To see flying saucers land? Is that going to happen tonight?
When they arrive, it's going to be the dawn of a whole new civilization.
Space creatures conspiring with the Soviet government already control our thoughts
by sending out electrical currents from the top of the Empire State Building.
And I'm the only one that knows.
If you're alienated, can you still help children?
Oh, sure. Alienation only affects the mind. It has nothing to do with the rest of your life.
We are going to see more and more of these visitors from space.
And before too long, the evidence will be in controversial that you will have on your TV screens and on your movie screens.
Concrete evidence that the ships are here and that they are real.
They're not fantastic things which have been cooked up to make a movie.
I have made telepathic contact for the past eight years
with many space people from the Earth.
I've been in many areas of space, both inside and outside of the solar system.
Well, this device right here is one that we've used to contact the people in the flying saucers.
It receives the messages on a beam of light, and it is in turn translated by this unit
and brought out as intelligible voice speech.
You mean to say you actually receive messages from people in the flying saucers?
That's right.
How about letting me try it, Dick, and see if I can get something on it?
It's in the right place.
Receiving transmission from galactic headquarters.
Bobby, there's nothing to be frightened of now.
On my planet, all of you will be free men not locked away like animals.
Be free.
Five day on the Atlas.
Is that recording good enough to identify the thing?
Yeah, right.
Hey, Bob is my only hope. Back off and give him some room to think.
From that fateful day when
stinking bits of slime first crawled from the sea and shouted to the cold stars...
I know I'm on the corner!
Our greatest dread has always been the knowledge of our own mortality.
But tonight, we shall hurl the gauntlet of science into the frightful face of death itself.
Tonight, we shall ascend...
into the heavens.
We shall mark the earthquake.
We shall command the thunders...
and penetrate...
into the very womb...
of impervious nature...
herself.
God, what?
Enemy spacecraft, the Hatching Hound 44.
Bob?
Well, he's up there.
Lost in space.
Ah, whoops.
I must go home.
Yeah, sure, honey.
I must leave this planet at once.
Has anyone seen my spaceship?
He's delirious.
Take me to your leader.
It's gonna be okay, honey. Just relax. Everything's fine.
Look, I am not talking to you. I'm talking to him.
Oh.
She's not a woman.
The Terminator.
You'd better go now, Madge.
I won't go home alone.
Bob will take you.
I don't want to have anything to do with it.
Okay.
What's it for, you people? I was joking!
Don't you know I'm joking here?
Everything all set for the big party?
We're getting there.
I'm gone.
I'll tell you about it.
Susie here still loves the Whopper.
Oh, yeah.
Thanks, Frank.
So who's all that ointment for?
They've been screwing us for a long time.
Now it's time we screwed them.
Okay.
Pat, ready to go?
I'm quite ready. I travel light.
That's a joke.
It's a bad joke.
You humans. There's just no sense of humor.
We're all ready.
Yes, you guys. We're all ready.
He's gonna regret this. I'll show him.
No, don't go. You mustn't go out there.
I can't stand this.
But he's a robot.
He wants to take me back to the ship.
It's your old pal, Bernard.
The fourth alien.
There is no fourth alien.
I'm here. Look, look.
Look at you.
You don't even look like an alien.
Ambrose, will you get rid of this autograph hunter?
No, don't.
And help me.
You simple-tongued, don't you understand?
I'm the fourth alien.
Take your other picture of the matter off.
No.
No.
No.

are on patrol for flying saucers.
Cameras installed to photograph them.
Portland, Oregon, the area from which came the first weird reports.
This flying saucer patrol shows how the Air Forces,
while not putting too much stock in the mysterious things in the sky,
are investigating.
The control tower is in touch and on the watch.
So are a whole lot of people these days.
They're seeing flying saucers everywhere.
Blocks of fantastic disks flying through the air.
There. Is there something to it?
Or is it an epidemic of people just seeing things?
Even the goat seems to be looking for the mysterious disks.
And the bear is on the alert.
Or maybe there's a flying saucer with milk.
Now, let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover-up.
It's an emergency! Maroon alert! Or even for a million!
These are no pinheads.
These are no brains from another planet.
These are no pea brains from beyond.
These are mind suckers.

Oh, yes, dear friends.
Recorded at Winterstar 2003, an event held by Ace of Cleveland.
Cleveland, you can get more information about Ace events like Winterstar and Starwood from www.rosencomet.com.
And now, let's go back to Susie the Flusie's final reenactment of the final moments of X-Day.
It's happening.
What?
It's an attack.
Excellent.
Now it's time we scream.

Meanwhile, far below the Earth's surface...
Lieutenant Dobbs and I have been training local pilots in Cobras for their own strike forces against the cartel.
Lead, this is Snake 2, entering sector 4079.
Roger.
Who finds the leader of our position?
Wilco, Dobbs.
How's the view up front, buddy?
I'm not crazy about it, man.
I'll be glad when we get out of this canyon.
I was flying wing that day with Captain Tejada.
Lieutenant Dobbs, the other American, was the flight leader in the front.
We're in the middle of a war.
We're entering a sector we've never been before.
The thing of it is, Bob, I got a bad feeling on this one.
I don't think I'm going to make it out.
Get me behind me!
Are you in danger, pastor?
All right, Roger.
Just a little argument with my co-pilot.
Over.
That's great.
Meanwhile...
The units are approaching the station.
They're coming straight at us.
It's a monster!
Nah, it can't be.
It is!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
Ah!
I have visual.
So, bearing 235, 40 degrees.
What the hell is going on?
We're under attack.
Yeah, right.
Hey, Bob is my only hope.
Back off.
How can one ordinary man have so many enemies?
Well, of course, that's just the start.
You smack bastard!
Damn!
We were five miles from the objective when we saw the Scorpion attack helicopter.
There he is!
Trying to jump the other way now, Dob.
Dob, move in.
You're 12 o'clock.
Stone, you're on your own.
Take your first shot.
You're the right hand.
Fire in.
He's turning over!
Dob, saying a guy likes being taken advantage of.
Breaking formation.
Steady.
Steady.
Stay with him.
Let's jump.
Here you are, Dob.
What I owe you.
With interest.
I'm going to get you.
I'm going to get you.
Who's Bob?




Bob!
Trailer.
Check the door.
I know where he comes in.

I know what you're doing, Smаныk.



Dean Strong.

I've only lost two wins.
MUSIC
You know...
We're better than that alone.
I can't potentially bring Bob home anymore.
But I won't be the only one I know and fail to��� dominate.
What's the last time you were driven out?


They shot him in the head. You want to make an omelet you got a break
so space travelers come halfway across the universe to this planet and this is
how we greet them is it? With rocks and with avocados. You ought to be ashamed of
yourselves. These aren't space monsters with TV aerials stuck on their heads.
They haven't come here to zap your planet with their ray guns. These are fellow
beings.
Coming here to zap your planet with their ray guns. These are fellow beings.
Come in peace. To do a bit of shopping. People of Earth, people of Earth. We should
count ourselves privileged. Yeah, you're privileged to greet these intrepid
pioneers who come so far across the space.
Hey! They took me off! They got my truck!
Oh who would have believed it?
What happens is gonna happen to you and all of you. And it's gonna be worse.
A lot worse. That's great. Now, let's have no more curiosity about this bizarre cover up.
And we're back from X-Day. Well, actually, let's go to the X-Day Drill, the fifth X-Day
Drill and listen to the preaching of Popes Lilith von Frau Mensch.
The real enemy where I stand and according to the one true word among the off-worlders.
Much off-the-cuff bullshit of J.R. Bob Dobbs is the god damned conspiracy!
Amen!
Now, you've heard of them I wonder sometime in between the promises of slack, fraud,
sex hurt, alien intervention and all that. But from the way some of you act, I can't
help but think that you've fingered the wrong damn conspiracy. See, it's easy to convince
yourself that the conspiracy was made by some of the people who were involved. But that's

not the case. The conspiracy has a recognizable face that is referenced by the rich white
men with a never-slate thirst for oil or that's run by the media companies or Hollywood or
the Jews or Muslims or Freemasonry or the Vatican or the British Crown or by invisible
monsters trying to bring forth Armageddon or by fill in the blank. But no! For the real
conspiracy, what we mean by the conspiracy, is the conspiracy of the people who are involved.


The real conspiracy is the forces behind even those conspiracies. The conspiracy that's
too dumb to realize it is a conspiracy and so avoids detection even as its slimy tentacles
slither into every nook and cranny of everybody's lives. For the conspiracy isn't made up of
religions or political groups or even of people. The real conspiracy, when you get down to
it, can be summed up in two words.
Bad Wiring.
It's the conspiracy that lurks inside every hairless monkey, regardless of the influence
of even yeti genetics, that gives those invisible monsters a shake and makes their followers
act like devolved murderous bastards. There are noble impulses in almost every religion,
but by the time that wretched, sneaky conspiracy behavioral programming gets done, it's a
mess.
With religion or any good idea, it almost invariably looks like a bum deal to somebody.
Because the follower types then get violently zealous and make even the greatest ideas seem
like the work of idiots.
Think about it for a second. What are the most basic programs that people run through
their internal computer every day?
Well, they are EAT! R! B! E!
And they're not just the most basic programs that people run through their internal computer

Well, they are EAT! R! B! E! And they're not just the most basic programs that people run
through their internal computer every day.
They're EATEN!
Dominate or submit!
Understand or be stupid!
Be good or be bad!
And I don't care how enlightened any of you claim to be, if you haven't wrestled with
this basic programming, if you haven't tried to come up with alternatives to these dualities,
then you too have become both victim and pawn of the conspiracy that drives all of the people
other conspiracies, whether it's a
conspiracy to defraud millions
of their birthright, or a conspiracy
to put your sleeping roommate's hand
in a bucket of warm water so
he'd pee himself.
This is why I wrote back
in 1992 that the ultimate
conspiracy theory was that
there were over 6
billion conspiracies
on this planet, and even that
number was pitifully low because
I was only including the hairless
monkeys.
And let's
face it, even the most
yeti-like among us is
at least 50% hairless
monkey. Nothing to be
ashamed of, really, but it means that
you are a slave
of the conspiracy
no matter what!
Unless!
Unless!
You go back to those dualities
and add some magic mojo
to that mix. Unless you toss a
monkey wrench into the monkey
works, and that monkey
wrench is
slack.
For only slack has
the ability to disclude
itself, and thus giving
you a true option!
Thus, some of us can
indeed find slack even in the most
conspiracy-drenched pursuits
because we can slack off
by not slacking
off! Thanks
to slack, we always have an option
against the conspiracy's own
internalized programming. Eat
or be eaten, or slack
off! Dominate
or submit, or
slack off!
Understand or be stupid,
or slack off!
Be good
or be bad, or
slack off!
God damn it, what will
it take to get through your heads?
Every time that you find
yourself wrestling with the urge to throttle
someone, including yourself,
every time you find
yourself stuck between two equally
grim scenarios, every
time you find yourself indecisive
about what you should do,
I ask you to remember
the option to slack off!
Nay, I demand that you
remember the option to slack off!
I get on my knees
and plead with you!
I beg of you
to remember that you can always
slack off! I pray
and I cry that you never
forget that option, because the
conspiracy will never tell you that
you have the option, ever!
Only J.R. Bob Dodds
will tell you that! Only Bob
has the guts to stand up to their
monkey DNA robot gangster
wetware ball crap,
and step right in it!
And slide into the ground!
And dance upon it!
And then,
and then, until
there's nothing left but a mere
moist spot on the ground, and then,
and then, until there's nothing left but a mere

and then, until there's nothing left but a mere white as damn feet on the
white as damn feet on the
white as damn feet on the labrum rug of pink poised sensibilities!


And...
What's that, Pop?
I can slack off now?
Okay, end of rant, everybody. Thank you.
Okay, we have
a rant for Andy.
Nice!
Popes Lilith, and now
to take us out,
puzzling evidence, Dr.
Philodrummon and Dr. Howell.
Okay.
What do you think, Bob? You wanna do this for a living?
Sure.
So how long has it been?
Let's sit down and have a cup of coffee.
This is a solid at ordinary
temperatures and pressures.
Damn church.
I was born near damn church,
a little village, uh,
simple agricultural...
We ought to live in it.
Now I'm not gonna name any names.
I want a cup of coffee, Bob.
Do you wanna run that by me again?
More coffee.
Will you have one lump or two?
Damn good cup of coffee, Bob.
Thanks.
This is a joke.
I like it.
Am I right?
Yeah, it is. It's a show. It's just a joke.
You sure as hell got that right.
Thank you.
How did that happen, Bob?
Work, hard work, concentration, and extreme effort
brought to fruition those things
predicted in the before life
and in the prescriptures.
Are you alright?
No, it's gonna be a real pleasure
working with you again, Bob.
Okay, it's countdown.
Countdown to the end of the show.
I'm sure I told you.
Kevin is Bob's best man.
At which time we will place
the fissionable materials
and the weapons of mass destruction
into the secret location
underneath the flower bed
where they just,
they won't think about
digging up the roses
to find them.
Yeah, it's countdown now.
Just moments away.
In addition, this material alone
will all fold it up
and stuff back in the box
until next week
to provide the appropriate chemical
or radiological
or preventable weapon making.
It's a collar.
Yeah, it's a collar.
The show doesn't smell like that
with a different color.
The breath of the show
smells like that.
All right, get Bob.
Get Bob.
We're not back in an hour.
We'll reschedule the rehearsal
for first of June.
Okay, all right, fine, fine, fine.
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's time to go down, Mr. Blaney.
It's over.
Well, Hal, I don't wanna come
to rehearsal tomorrow morning.
I'd really rather do something else.
I'm not gonna do anything.


What do you mean you messed up
the whole ordeal?
What?

No, the show's over.
It's over.
The show's over, yeah.
I'm sorry.
No, it's over.
Well, actually, that's all she wrote.
X.9.3 minutes.
His brain is donated
to a medical facility
researching the criminal mind.
Since he had massive head injuries,
I've used a brain from your workplace
as a replacement.
So basically, I turned Carl into Skeeter
Wayne Dobbs,
and Skeeter turned out to be pretty bad,
so I have to kill him again.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wayne Dobbs
was killed yesterday
by the owner of a gas station




and a catering truck.
The victim was wanted by the state police
in connection of two teenage girls.
Murder?
He dug himself out of the grave.
Oh, no.
Hector, did you drop the Dobbs specimen?
Oh, great.
A bad brain and no time to get a new one.
Don't forget, if I get fired,
you get fired, Hector.
I'm going to get fired.
Oh, boy.
Look what I got here, Bob.
Friends, you're listening to
the Hour of Slack,
number 919.
