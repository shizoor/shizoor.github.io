1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,360
From PR News in Washington, I'm an unregistered foreign agent for Ukrainian interests and lied to Trump's former campaign chairman.

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,100
Prosecutors have 3,500 witnesses that they say earned tens of dollars in Ukraine.

3
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,400
Facebook says we're involved with the Russian government.

4
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:27,040
Facebook has a new campaign, but says it used PR News procedures similar to those used by the Russian research agency.

5
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,380
Here's reports loom large.

6
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,060
Something a top Facebook official calls not interesting.

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,340
Secretary Pompeo says...

8
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,980
Mayor Pory wants his PR News.

9
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:45,760
President Trump says this is PR. It's about 27% contained.

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,180
Clearing the way for posting the downloadable PR News to the internet.

11
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:56,020
The Daily News in Santa Fe, Texas is reporting that this is hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of PR.

12
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:00,800
Hello?

13
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,300
Now you listen to me.

14
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,600
You asked for this.

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,920
You asked for...

16
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:08,380
The self-genius.

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,180
Power of...

18
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:10,980
What?

19
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:12,620
Shut up, you.

20
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,420
Get out of here.

21
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:15,900
He's a raven lunatic.

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,020
You are directed to make effort to keep it alive and protect it against injury.

23
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,180
Well, I understand.

24
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,540
Well, I understand.

25
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,920
So, here I am with, uh, our friend, the Pink.

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,540
Hi, I'm the Pink!

27
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,140
Hi, Pink.

28
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,300
Pink Boy!

29
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,560
What are you doing?

30
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:51,140
You bland normal.

31
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:51,900
Look at you.

32
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:52,940
Unh.

33
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:55,480
That may mean what you think.

34
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:59,820
You simply have the bi vaccin deceiv Therefore, here I think the actual names of the most va xiv

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:01:59,980
of the bleventhearted Insedi Death compared to Jane.

36
00:01:59,980 --> 00:01:59,980


37
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:10,120
You're a weirdo too, but you like football and mainstream media.

38
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,580
The Great Gates of Dobstown.

39
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:29,300
Not unlike the Great Gates of Kiev, but not with a piano.

40
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:59,960
The Great Gates of Dobstown.

41
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:29,940
The Great Gates of Dobstown.

42
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:34,760
Welcome to Dobstown, where you, yes, you are weird just like us.

43
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:41,620
Penny on down, or horse on down, or cow on down, or goat on down, or bear on down.

44
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,120
Bear down, bear down, bear down to the casket.

45
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,540
Get yourself a cup of mutant key.

46
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,300
Yes, have a mutant key.

47
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,780
Ring out your head.

48
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:53,880
Ring out your head.

49
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,000
Grab an ear in each hand and twist.

50
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:02,780
Ring out your head.

51
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:24,460
It's yours, so you can do it.

52
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,320
You're allowed.

53
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,820
You're very allowed.

54
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,000
Ring it out.

55
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:32,780
Ring it out.

56
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:33,560
Ring it out.

57
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,320
Ring it out.

58
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,060
Ring it out.

59
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:49,720
Thank you, Reverend Richard Negative.

60
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:55,360
After a long delay, we now have in rotation

61
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,700
his album, Welcome to Dobstown.

62
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:13,260
which is on bandcamp.com under the name mrnegative.bandcamp.com.

63
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,800
Mr. being just an MR.

64
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,260
mrnegative.bandcamp.com.

65
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,320
And he has been collaborating with many other sub-gene IE,

66
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,400
such as in this particular case, Reverend Just John,

67
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,120
in that song, Ring Out Your Head.

68
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:39,320
We have new music upcoming on this hour of Slack, number 1,749,

69
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,200
including Piss Baptist John Shirley,

70
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,520
the Swingin' Love Corpses,

71
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,940
and the Slot Rods.

72
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,560
But first, from 22X Day Drill last summer,

73
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:55,920
the third show on July 2nd,

74
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,380
Dr. Hal and Dr. Finkel,

75
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:58,960
and Dr. Kyla Drummond,

76
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,880
and yours truly, Princess Wee,

77
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,120
musing about our surprisingly long, so far, lives.

78
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,840
Sometimes I feel like Little Big Man.

79
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,620
You've seen it all.

80
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:14,600
Because I've...

81
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:20,720
I actually had a fairly normal middle class upbringing,

82
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,240
but then I was like a regular kid thrust into this weird school with rich kids.

83
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,380
And I saw it, but...

84
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,080
I don't know what real rich people were like.

85
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:34,960
And they have whole other levels of stupid problems,

86
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:42,840
way as bad as anybody who actually has had to have common sense,

87
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,860
you know, and support themselves.

88
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,100
If you're born rich, it's real easy to just be a moron.

89
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,400
You can afford to be stupid about everything.

90
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,740
You said the scariest thing is a drunken rich person.

91
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:57,980
A drunken rich man.

92
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,380
It's the most dangerous creature on the planet Earth.

93
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,020
Absolutely.

94
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:02,620
I believe it.

95
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,940
Just ask that guy that Dick Cheney shot.

96
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,780
Anyway, we...

97
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:13,480
I lived on an Indian reservation like Little Big Man.

98
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,520
I was the only white guy for miles around.

99
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,700
And Wellman, too.

100
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,600
What is this?

101
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,620
I lived in China.

102
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,260
Me and my boss were the only white guys in China in 1986.

103
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,120
We're...

104
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:28,360
Well, we weren't the only ones.

105
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,360


106
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:32,920
We were the only ones we could see in this hotel in Beijing.

107
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,200
We're trying to finish a movie that had been shot there.

108
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:37,820
Documentary.

109
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,460
It was stupid.

110
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,340
About the runner.

111
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,500
The guy...

112
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:43,040
Yeah, the runner.

113
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,800
I did work a bunch of subgenius stuff into it.

114
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,660
I got to rewrite it.

115
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:52,020
Anyway, and then I ended up living in a big city,

116
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:55,640
East Coast City, Cleveland.

117
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,060
But it is like an East Coast city.

118
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,180
And now I live back in the country.

119
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,260
And everybody misunderstands everybody else.

120
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:08,740
The city people think all the country folks are these butt-toothed yokels.

121
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,660
And that is what they look like.

122
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,600
And that is how they vote.

123
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,200
But they're not really that way.

124
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,480
They're really...

125
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:21,220
Most of them are just as friendly and nice and helpful to strangers as they can be.

126
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,240
Genuinely nice.

127
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:28,340
And by the same token, those poor yokels think of city people as either being quiveries,

128
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,820
or quivering libtards hiding from the evil roaming gangs of brown people,

129
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,820
or I don't know what.

130
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:39,100
But neither of those is true.

131
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,480
Princess, we and I have been in every neighborhood.

132
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,040
We lived in Collinwood.

133
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:52,000
That's like saying, you know, South Compton or whatever.

134
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:52,720
True.

135
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,520
True that.

136
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,120
Much of McGirder.

137
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,340
Snoop Dogg's old high school.

138
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,860
I thought that was weird.

139
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,440
Dark shadows.

140
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,380
You know, as long as we didn't go out at night, we were just fine.

141
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,280
Uh-huh.

142
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,640
Collinwood?

143
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,120
Yes.

144
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:06,860
Yes.

145
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:11,760
But, you know, so rednecks think the city life is just pure violence.

146
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:15,860
And the city people think the redneck world is just pure violence.

147
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:20,040
And they're both really pretty violent, but only in small doses.

148
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:25,320
If you spend all day long listening to the police scanner, yeah, it's pretty paranoid.

149
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:30,600
But if you just read the science news, you go, oh, they've created a new cure.

150
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:34,520
And the world is going to end fairly soon in a miserable ways.

151
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,260
I won't be alive to see it, I don't think.

152
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,620
And this-

153
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,580
So why should I care?

154
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:48,040
Next decade, supposedly, will contain a massive moon settling that's going to-

155
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,080
What, the next 10 years?

156
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,580
The 2020s, yes.

157
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,580
That's different.

158
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,400
I don't like to hear that.

159
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,300
They're going to put-

160
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:00,840
They're going to put up essentially a city there, and they are going to put-

161
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:01,820
On the moon?

162
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:02,240
Yes.

163
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:07,780
And they're going to put a space station to supply that city in orbit around the moon.

164
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,560
Didn't they see the shitty 2002 version of the time machine?

165
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,840
That's exactly what causes everything to go bad.

166
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:21,200
Golfing on the moon causes the moon to explode into different parts, and it throws off the

167
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:21,760
Earth's orbit.

168
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:24,700
And next thing you know, it's Morlocks and Eloy.

169
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:29,240
And stupid versions of them.

170
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,100
Yes, I understand.

171
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:30,900
I'd like to kill-

172
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,620
Yeah, that's terrible.

173
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:33,840
I'd like to kill that director.

174
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:38,600
And he's the grandson of the great H.G. Wells, who directed that piece of crap.

175
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,800
Yes, now-

176
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,540
There's some things getting me really worked up.

177
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:48,060
If it had been Frank Wells, now he was a nice guy, he never would have done that.

178
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,520
But then this is yet another generation that they-

179
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,680
There's only one good version of him.

180
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,280
There's only one version of the time machine, and that's the George Powell one.

181
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,140
It's pretty faithful to the book, given their limitations at the time.

182
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,000
It goes there.

183
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:03,380
It goes to the book.

184
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:09,960
But it kept the basic idea, which was class division will divide the human race into two

185
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,120
completely different species.

186
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,680
I'm reading a sci-fi book now where the internet has started to do that.

187
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:23,200
Rural America, or Ameristan, is where everybody believes everything on the internet.

188
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:30,040
And what they end up calling the blue cities, where you can actually find a doctor and

189
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:38,120
things, is where people have enough money to pay for very advanced bots to edit the

190
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:41,960
internet for them, so they're not completely barraged with brainwashing garbage.

191
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,440
Don't forget that-

192
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,700
There's two different countries.

193
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:52,160
The borders are roughly defined as the areas, as you're leaving a city, when you start seeing

194
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:53,320
the Walmarts.

195
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,760
That's where Ameristan starts.

196
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,300
Well, I live in Ameristan now, and it's not that bad yet.

197
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:05,240
But this book takes place 20 years in the future, and I can see it being quite plausible.

198
00:12:05,980 --> 00:12:06,980
It sucks.

199
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:07,980
It's horrible.

200
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:11,120
That's not the main point of the story.

201
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:18,940
It's talking about Neal Stephenson's brand new book, Fall, or Dodge in Hell, which came

202
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,540
out about two weeks ago.

203
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,880
And I'm such a fan of his.

204
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,240
I'm so jealous of him.

205
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,540
I hate him so much, I immediately bought the hardcover.

206
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,960
How did you get the advance copy there?

207
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,180
I ordered it the day before it was going to be published, and it actually came to me that

208
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:35,620
day.

209
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,440
And I started reading it about two-thirds of the way through.

210
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:47,840
They figured out a way to keep dead people sort of alive by scanning their brain after

211
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,520
they're dead in a high-resolution way.

212
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:57,400
A high-res way that's unimaginable now, but given quantum computing and a few other advances,

213
00:12:57,740 --> 00:13:04,580
they end up being able to preserve a brain and switch it back, the brain patterns, and

214
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,580
switch it back on.

215
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,360
They don't remember their life, but they eventually imagine a life.

216
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,500
And to them, that's real.

217
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:20,380
And there's this whole virtual world of dead computer people that can look at each other

218
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:20,520
and think, oh, I'm dead.

219
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,460
And look like people.

220
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:27,220
And they even eat food and shit and so forth.

221
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,540
But it's all virtual.

222
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:32,600
But they are alive, except they're just bits.

223
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:39,580
It's a very weird concept and kind of worth looking into, especially if you believe in

224
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:45,780
that singularity stuff, which I don't, because I think the ideogularity is going to beat

225
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:49,020
the singularity by a long shot.

226
00:13:49,020 --> 00:13:55,160
But of course, if your brain is being broken down and scrupulously copied by the computer,

227
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:58,360
nonetheless your end occurs there.

228
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:03,100
And the computer, which thinks it's you, continues its existence.

229
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:07,880
Your consciousness does not travel to the computer.

230
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,380
The computer has only made a copy.

231
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,820
Now you, the original, are discarded.

232
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:13,900
Yeah.

233
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,100
That's part of the point of it.

234
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:19,000
It's just they're not the same person at all.

235
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,760
But certain reflexes and skills come back.

236
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:28,720
It's kind of like being in a video game that you can't leave.

237
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:33,720
Well, you see, these were created by experience.

238
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,700
And they did create a personality.

239
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:44,220
So there's some kind of analog of a personality there, naturally.

240
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:47,300
All those parts which comprise it.

241
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:52,280
Well, if they do that to me, would you please just turn off the switch?

242
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,560
Well, they locate it where you can't reach it.

243
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,300
Right, of course.

244
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:57,260
I won't have fingers.

245
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,680
I'll just be like P-Dog or Care Dog.

246
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:05,540
Care Dog's brain preserved in a jar of just pure pain for eternity.

247
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,440
Remember that Colossus of New York?

248
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:07,960
Yes.

249
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,840
He had an off switch, but it was where he couldn't reach it.

250
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,420
Between his shoulder blades.

251
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,640
He had to have somebody else to pull the switch.

252
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:17,200
I must, yet I cannot.

253
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:17,280
I must, yet I cannot.

254
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,360
Well, it takes him a long time to realize he needs to be turned off.

255
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:30,640
Oh, he has a road to Damascus moment when he was going to kill all the humans and go to the U.N. and fry everybody with his eyeballs.

256
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:40,100
So, once again, the decency is the ultimate winner.

257
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:46,580
See, once again, we're muttering about old monster movies, Dr. Bell.

258
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,520
I didn't mean to mutter.

259
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:48,760
No, that's not healthy.

260
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,400
I hope I spoke clearly and explicitly.

261
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,360
No, you're actually starting to put me to sleep.

262
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,320
Well, but you don't see the end.

263
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:56,780
I've seen you fall asleep like this.

264
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,400
The Colossus of New York's a problem, so are those of our own.

265
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,180
There's photographs of him like.

266
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:06,040
But five minutes later, he'll be back, you know, being Dr. Bell.

267
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:07,200
I'll be right back.

268
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:08,880
He's like that.

269
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:13,720
It's a good thing they have these foam, you know, wind, worm screens on these microphones.

270
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,240
Yes, foam on the radio.

271
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,420
Foam on the radio.

272
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:16,560
Foam on the radio.

273
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,960
Foam on the radio.

274
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,300
All right, somebody pot Stang out.

275
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,660
That's too much pot for Ivan Stang.

276
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:26,460
Yes, he's collapsed.

277
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,780
Visiting the dream kingdom of Morpheus.

278
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,200
Suckling the teat of Morpheus.

279
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:41,080
Well, I wasn't going to go that far, but as long as you have a good relationship.

280
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:41,940
No, that's how it works.

281
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:46,080
What you need is a psychopomp to direct you through your dream kingdom.

282
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,080
A dream palace.

283
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:49,380
And I know a good one.

284
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,380
Anyway.

285
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:56,140
Well, I'm about there with this discussion of Colossus of New York and other ancient

286
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,660
movies.

287
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,780
Nobody's ever seen.

288
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,860
Although there's an interesting article about that very movie in the latest Scary Monsters.

289
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:03,980
Well, there you are.

290
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,740
You see, the Colossus of New York is not forgotten.

291
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:15,460
Not by old, doddering, senile men wallowing in nostalgia for old, stupid, low-budget,

292
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:15,820
black and white.

293
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:19,940
Well, it's all shows on old movie channels, and I'm sure more people are seeing it now

294
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,600
than saw it when it ran, when it was out.

295
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:28,720
In our overpopulated world, more people are familiar with the Colossus of New York than

296
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,020
ever.

297
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:33,520
Well, a hell of a lot more people will see that stupid old movie than will ever read

298
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,140
Neal Stephenson's brilliant novel, because it's a book.

299
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,080
I haven't read a book since I was in high school.

300
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,880
I'm proud of myself.

301
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,800
Well, when I worked on that.

302
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:48,800
I was in the conspiracy zone TV show.

303
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:54,240
Some of the writers in the bullpen boasted that they'd never opened a book.

304
00:17:54,460 --> 00:17:54,920
Right.

305
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,860
We work in the new media.

306
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,880
You don't have to know how to read or any of that stuff.

307
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,600
It's new media.

308
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:02,340
You don't understand.

309
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,160
You're too old.

310
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:05,000
You're not in the matrix.

311
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,040
You're old school, city person.

312
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:14,160
My daughter didn't like camping out.

313
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:18,700
And one day, when she was about 10 or so, she said, you don't understand, Dad.

314
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,600
I'm not just a city person.

315
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,200
I'm not just a city girl.

316
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:26,720
I'm a TV girl.

317
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,000
And by the same token, now my grandsons have said, you don't understand, Mom.

318
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:35,540
We're not TV boys.

319
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,260
We're internet boys.

320
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,360
Mm-hmm.

321
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,020
They really are in the matrix.

322
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:46,120
And I am Mr. Smith.

323
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,020
Oh, no.

324
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,740
You just can't stand the smell.

325
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,820
Preciting over how many generations.

326
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:01,740
Agent Smith.

327
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,200
Agent Smith.

328
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,040
That's me.

329
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,060
I'm here to stop whoever Neo is.

330
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:06,620
AKA.

331
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,940
Because I think the internet sucks.

332
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:08,820
Elrond.

333
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,800
It was great for a long time there.

334
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,700
But now it sucks.

335
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,460
It sucks.

336
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:19,940
I suppose the hidden underground black internet, the dark internet, where nobody can talk to

337
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:22,800
each other at all, it's just child pornography and drugs.

338
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:23,760
That's probably fun.

339
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,560
And then there's that part that's like Hammer Film.

340
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,360
For someone.

341
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,080
Yeah.

342
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,120
Well, no, you can get every old monster movie there, too.

343
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,660
I mean, everything that's every.

344
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,120
But that's all out there anyway.

345
00:19:36,620 --> 00:19:36,920
Right.

346
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,720
If you know enough to search.

347
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,680
So who needs dark?

348
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,340
Why did I haul all those videotapes all the way to Texas?

349
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:44,940
Oh, that's right.

350
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:45,460
I didn't.

351
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,900
I threw them away.

352
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,080
Yes, you did.

353
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:50,640
You threw your monster tapes away.

354
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,600
To the tune of like 12 bags of.

355
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:55,220
12 bags of hand labeled VHS tapes.

356
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,140
Oh, that's terrible.

357
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,380
Not the store bought ones.

358
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,400
The hand labeled ones.

359
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,620
Partly because I don't know what else is on there besides those three monster movies recorded

360
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:06,960
in long play speed that won't play on anything now.

361
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,180
And believe me.

362
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:15,740
I looked into recycling VHS tapes, but by the nature of them, nobody can recycle them.

363
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:21,620
There's one company that you can pay to recycle them because they have to be screwed apart

364
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:22,340
individually.

365
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:27,780
The tapes, one type of thing, the plastics, another, and there's little metal rollers.

366
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,260
It's just it's a nightmare.

367
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:34,800
In fact, there's not much recycling going on in this country because the Chinese got

368
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,360
their own.

369
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,860
Now they got all the cardboard they need.

370
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,760
They don't need ours anymore.

371
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,100
They were the ones who were buying it.

372
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:40,700
Yeah.

373
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:44,980
So, see, that's just going to that's the end of the world.

374
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:45,560
And now.

375
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:47,680
Cardboard packaging.

376
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:48,640
They say that.

377
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,360
And plastic bottles.

378
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:52,160
American recycling is too dirty.

379
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:57,980
It used to be that you could have 1% filth on them.

380
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,220
And now it's like lower, even lower tolerance than that.

381
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:07,840
In England, they have sophisticated robots that separate the trash so efficiently that

382
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:07,840


383
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:12,100
they've achieved 90% recycling at their own.

384
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:12,660
Wow.

385
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,080
That's impressive.

386
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,180
Only 10% of it doesn't get recycled.

387
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,680
And Germany is that way too.

388
00:21:17,080 --> 00:21:17,340
Wow.

389
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:17,940
But.

390
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:21,380
Well, Germany, that doesn't surprise me.

391
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,720
But they're socialists.

392
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:30,520
In Germany, they go in their woods and clean up the twigs.

393
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,800
They clean up the twigs.

394
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:34,940
Yes, Germans.

395
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,480
Are you sure you're not thinking of Finland?

396
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:37,840
I'm not sure.

397
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:37,840


398
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:37,840


399
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:37,840


400
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:37,840


401
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:37,840


402
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:37,840


403
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:37,840


404
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:37,840


405
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:37,840


406
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:37,840


407
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:37,840


408
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:37,840


409
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:39,120
I'm not sure.

410
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,780
But they're the twig pickers.

411
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:44,640
Well, Trump said that we should be like them and rake the forest.

412
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:45,000
Right.

413
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:45,300
Yeah.

414
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:49,460
They somehow got the idea that they rake the forest and it gets rid of all pollution.

415
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:49,920
Yeah.

416
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,020
Yeah.

417
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,820
Well, he has some.

418
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:54,460
I can't keep up with the stupidity.

419
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,100
No, you can't.

420
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,660
That's the whole.

421
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,680
That's why it works.

422
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:00,520
That's why.

423
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:04,520
The very fact that it's nonsense is why it appeals to so many people.

424
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,840
It's not really scientific.

425
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,280
It's not really saying anything.

426
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:14,020
It's just all righteous indignation.

427
00:22:14,020 --> 00:22:15,720
The new drug of America.

428
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:21,600
You're either you're righteously indignant about those libtards or you're righteously

429
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:26,800
indignant about those stupid conservatives, fascists.

430
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:33,160
I got to admit, I'm personally more afraid of the fascists on the conservative side than

431
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:35,820
getting my wrist slapped by the PC police.

432
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,000
Here in the chamber.

433
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:41,420
Here in the church of the subgenius friends, we're the mind your own business police.

434
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:50,140
We will not step in and interfere with your life as long as you mind your own business.

435
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:57,680
When you stop mind your own business, oh yes, then jack booted subgeniuses from the subgenius

436
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:02,840
league of ass kickers show up at your door and say, get in line and quit being in line

437
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,460
or whatever it is.

438
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,480
What Bob said.

439
00:23:05,480 --> 00:23:10,320
You have to sell a lot more pamphlets to pay those guys.

440
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,300
Those are professionals.

441
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,680
Those jack booted subgenius morality squad.

442
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,580
If everybody's running off a cliff, would you do it too?

443
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:25,100
I told them to run off the cliff.

444
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,220
Actually they asked me, what was that?

445
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:34,440
I'd climb down to the bottom and check and see if there's any money left in their wallets.

446
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:35,460
I don't know.

447
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:35,460


448
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:35,720
I didn't have a lot.

449
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:39,320
Well, yeah, of course you do that first, but we hit.

450
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,060
Well if everybody jumped off, there'd be a lot of wallets there.

451
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:51,380
Paul Mavridis told me that his dad's, you know, was upset with his long hair or something

452
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:51,820
like that.

453
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,000
And he goes, if everybody jumped off a cliff, would you do it too?

454
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:58,660
And he goes, dad, I'm the one that suggested they jump off a cliff.

455
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,360
I don't know if that's true or if he just tells that.

456
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:05,480
but it should be true.

457
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,760
Oh, it's the sort of thing he would say, I'm sure.

458
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,320
It is.

459
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:13,520
Yeah, Bob's the one who invented jumping off a cliff.

460
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,640
Well, I thought it was invented by Walt Disney

461
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:22,380
in the supposed true-to-life motion picture

462
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,460
White Wilderness.

463
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,620
They didn't really...

464
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:28,140
This documentary, which I was shown as a child,

465
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,660
the lemmings are shown to gather together

466
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:35,720
to run and leap off a cliff into the ocean to their deaths.

467
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:40,160
But this is all bogus and was staged by the Disneys.

468
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:43,760
Nonetheless, many, many, many people saw it

469
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,400
and it affected their minds

470
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:50,900
and became a metaphor for unnecessary mob death.

471
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:55,720
The images of the lemmings hurtling off the cliff,

472
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,540
which you see in the movie.

473
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,640
Walt Disney's White Wilderness.

474
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:05,560
Well, but you said that the lemmings don't actually do that.

475
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:10,120
The camera crew drove these little rodent things

476
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,820
off of the cliff for the movie.

477
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,320
Right, just so.

478
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,860
Yes, that's the way it was done.

479
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,460
Unbelievable.

480
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,920
Yeah, this makes a better story.

481
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:26,660
Yes, well, you know, the Walt Disney movie

482
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,680
The Living Desert was going to show you

483
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,500
the mating dance of the...

484
00:25:31,660 --> 00:25:32,160
scorpions.

485
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,320
And so the scorpions are there.

486
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,800
One scorpion grabs the next scorpion by its forceps

487
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,520
and then they pixelate it playing square dance music

488
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,440
while the scorpions move around.

489
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:48,960
So you see they are indeed dancing,

490
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,040
but doing a contrived buck and wing.

491
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,420
It's like the dancing squirrel on the internet.

492
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,000
It's all a bunch of hooey.

493
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,820
Or the supposed fancy cat and owner

494
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,580
in the Cat Channel commercial.

495
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,060
Where they take steps together

496
00:26:03,060 --> 00:26:05,700
simply caused by running the film back and forth.

497
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,220
Dr. Drummond, get up here and be loud.

498
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,720
Dr. Howell's putting me to sleep.

499
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,540
He's muttering about old commercials

500
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,800
and monster movies again.

501
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,420
I don't believe I told you about

502
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,400
when I encountered a rattlesnake

503
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,860
of incredible dimension.

504
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,120
You told that one last night

505
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,160
on the other show.

506
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,500
All right.

507
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,920
He'll just start muttering about comic books.

508
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:30,440
Yes.

509
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,140
Dr. Drummond?

510
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:32,460
Yeah.

511
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,420
Well, he's certainly welcome to.

512
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,660
And really bad TV shows.

513
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,100
Hey, let's talk about every episode

514
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,160
of the old Daniel Boone show.

515
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,020
What about the old Casey Jones show?

516
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,720
I didn't mean that.

517
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,480
That was being facetious.

518
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,780
We don't...

519
00:26:48,780 --> 00:26:50,100
You know, if you can imagine...

520
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:50,420
No, Sky King.

521
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:51,200
Sky King.

522
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,120
Alan Hale Jr. played the role

523
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,200
of the famous locomotive engineer.

524
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,060
The little rascals.

525
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,800
The skipper from Gilligan's Island.

526
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,680
Dr. Kildare.

527
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,820
Operated a steam locomotive

528
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:01,380
and...

529
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:04,440
On board were the Stoker or Fireman,

530
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:05,340
Red Rock,

531
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,420
and this kid,

532
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,060
this overprivileged kid

533
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,480
who got to go around in the cab

534
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:11,760
of a steam locomotive,

535
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,340
Casey Jr.

536
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,720
It was brought to you by...

537
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:20,540
Those cartoons can be watched

538
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:23,020
instead of hearing somebody describe them

539
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,580
down at the grindhouse.

540
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,860
It's live action.

541
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,860
Starting about six.

542
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:27,720
Oh, it's seven now.

543
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,860
It's a live action presentation.

544
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,640
Oh, is that what they call it?

545
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,060
I don't know what they call it now.

546
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,400
Scraping off your shoes.

547
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,440
Or the Vikings.

548
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,400
I know what that means.

549
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,220
Well, I don't,

550
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,620
but I'm sure it's something bad.

551
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,600
Boisterous sea adventurers,

552
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:41,300
the Vikings,

553
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,260
in their half-hour show.

554
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,740
Are you still doing synopses of old...

555
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,880
They're looting and pillaging,

556
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,820
torturing religious clerics

557
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:54,840
and staking them down on the beach

558
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,460
where little crabs will slowly eat them

559
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,940
and this robust...

560
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:00,520
Are you going to spend eternity

561
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:01,420
on your pleasure?

562
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,480
Saucer reciting synopses

563
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:07,460
of every old show, movie, song, poem, comic...

564
00:28:07,460 --> 00:28:09,440
I was trying to make a point here

565
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,720
about the thing that was being represented,

566
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,440
but that's okay.

567
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:15,200
Perhaps all things in time

568
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,620
So did you guys miss my music?

569
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,420
Yes, we're waiting for your music

570
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,440
to reoccur.

571
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,320
We all enjoy such music.

572
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,960
When we were born

573
00:28:27,060 --> 00:28:28,580
Into this life

574
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:31,440
We were less than

575
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,060
7 to make it right

576
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:36,960
It's pretty turning

577
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,600
And this is our fate

578
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,400
We're singing this song

579
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,940
So you can relate

580
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:49,680
We are going to save the universe

581
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,380
We are going to save the universe

582
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:55,340
We are going to save the universe

583
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,720
This time

584
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,460
This time

585
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,600
This time

586
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:01,420


587
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:01,420


588
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:01,420


589
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:01,420


590
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,980
We are full grown

591
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,640
We are grown up men

592
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,860
We are all pastors

593
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:24,880
We hate to reason it

594
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,300
It is our mission

595
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,080
It is our task

596
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,340
It's obvious

597
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,160
Yet useless

598
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:40,040
We are going to save the universe

599
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,800
We are going to save the universe

600
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,800
We are going to save the universe

601
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,140
It's time

602
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,360
This is crecid

603
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,620
In this online Tapdak

604
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:11,620


605
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:11,620


606
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:11,620


607
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,260
We are born

608
00:30:12,260 --> 00:30:13,700
We are grown

609
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:13,720
We are here

610
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:13,820
here

611
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,440
now

612
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:14,440


613
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,640
green

614
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:30,640


615
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:30,640


616
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:36,260
guitar solo

617
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,620
Don't you worry

618
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:56,500
Don't have no fears

619
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,100
Don't get outside

620
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,560
Because we are here

621
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,800
We can't help

622
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:07,220
Don't we understand

623
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,260
We're in control

624
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,300
And we are more than a band

625
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,640
We are going to save the universe

626
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:20,440
We are going to save the universe

627
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:23,420
We are going to save the universe

628
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:26,740
The time

629
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,260
Well, maybe next time.

630
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:30,400
So,

631
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,760
did you guys miss my music?

632
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,140
Yes, we're waiting for your

633
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,540
music to reoccur.

634
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:39,480
We all enjoy such music.

635
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,640
I'm getting tired of sitting up here.

636
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,080
Heard melodies are sweet.

637
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,420
Yeah, I've already been home and taken a nap

638
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:46,840
and had dinner and drank coffee

639
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,680
and all kinds of stuff.

640
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,240
I came back.

641
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:49,260
You guys are still here.

642
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:51,720
Well, we took a break.

643
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,900
We took a sandwich break

644
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,240
and you took a coffee break

645
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:56,000
and a nap.

646
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:56,980
Yeah,

647
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,520
and he probably took most of the froth.

648
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,100
And the money

649
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,340
and the girls

650
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:04,300
and the map

651
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:06,720
and all the lighters

652
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,840
and the compass

653
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,280
and the gun

654
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,140
and the diamonds.

655
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,680
I bet he got the diamonds too.

656
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:13,620
And the gold

657
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:14,860
and jewels

658
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,200
and diamonds and things.

659
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:16,600
The diamonds.

660
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:17,500
Yeah.

661
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,100
The lost treasure

662
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:25,340
of the superstition moment.

663
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:26,360
You know, I shouldn't have put on

664
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:27,960
that exotic lounge music.

665
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:28,500
That's what

666
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,900
that's what below.

667
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,620
For some reason,

668
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,780
they doctors,

669
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,700
the discoverers were walled in,

670
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,560
sealed in with their treasure

671
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:39,040
and their bodies have never been discovered

672
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,720
in the superstition mountains.

673
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:47,440
Remember the story of the lost Dutchman?

674
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,000
Mine?

675
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:50,060
The mysterious old.

676
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,240
What are you doing?

677
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,240
Dr. Howie?

678
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,680
Just because he's just endlessly reciting one plot after another.

679
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,360
This is no plot.

680
00:32:58,460 --> 00:33:00,000
This is a matter of American history.

681
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:05,620
Yes, no one understands what the mystery is.

682
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,640
There's a good reason for that.

683
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,840
It's bu-

684
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,100
.

685
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,020
Oh, this'll save us.

686
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:16,900
.

687
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:22,160
Porn music.

688
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:24,540
Music from 70s porno movies.

689
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:25,720
Well, that would-

690
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,600
It's pretty swinging.

691
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:30,300
Describe how the special mummy,

692
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:31,600
that was found,

693
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,580
was eviscerated.

694
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,360
.

695
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,740
Philo is now playing his armpit.

696
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:37,840
He's doing it.

697
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:38,760
So that's all right.

698
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:39,180
That's the,

699
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:43,860
Philo's doing the armpit and cupped palm instrument.

700
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,260
Oops.

701
00:33:45,280 --> 00:33:48,200
Yes, with the synthesizer, neo-thermine.

702
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,400
That's not a synthesizer.

703
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:52,200
It's his pyroflatulation skill.

704
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,980
The overman can make a,

705
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:57,340
sound like a theremin from his,

706
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:59,580
ah, ah, ah, fundament.

707
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:04,580
Right, so located near the physical location of the human soul.

708
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:06,580
.

709
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,480
Here's the porno music.

710
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,060
The frenulum.

711
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,180
And, ah, yeah, the, ah, ah, ah,

712
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:21,100
a lot of the wah-wah pedal is used during these sequences.

713
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,080
.

714
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,060
That's the music that goes with the,

715
00:34:25,740 --> 00:34:28,540
well, I guess just the copulation scenes.

716
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:29,180
Right.

717
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:31,520
It kind of goes with any of them.

718
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,440
Blowjobs, copulation,

719
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:33,840
.

720
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,500
Any other basic, ah, human.

721
00:34:37,940 --> 00:34:38,360
.

722
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,600
This is crappy.

723
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,780
This is, this is crap.

724
00:34:41,940 --> 00:34:42,340
Listen to that.

725
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:43,380
Yeah.

726
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:44,380
.

727
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,400
Here's the blue chair without the wah-wah pedal.

728
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:52,360
Now, here's the blue chair with the wah-wah pedal.

729
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,040
.

730
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,560
.

731
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:57,640
This one's a little funkier.

732
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,160
There's one that's a complete realist. . .

733
00:34:59,160 --> 00:34:59,340
.

734
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,240
This one's a clip off of, ah, White Rabbit.

735
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:01,860
.

736
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,160
I mean, it really is.

737
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:04,900
.

738
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:05,960
.

739
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,720
How did you acquire these tracks?

740
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:08,580
.

741
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:08,720
.

742
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:15,060
I used this stuff with my micro photography of, ah, copulating microbes.

743
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:15,720
.

744
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:16,060
I had to ask.

745
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:17,140
.

746
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,160
.

747
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:17,240
.

748
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,240


749
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,240


750
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,240


751
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,240


752
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:17,340
.

753
00:35:17,340 --> 00:35:18,440
.

754
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:19,080
.

755
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:21,300
.

756
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:21,920
This is pretty loud.

757
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:23,280
.

758
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:23,280


759
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,540
Uh, uh , uh-huh .

760
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:24,960
.

761
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:24,960


762
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:25,940
.

763
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:26,340
Uh. .

764
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:26,340


765
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:26,420
.

766
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:26,440
.

767
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:27,960
Just use your imagination, folks.

768
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:28,020
.

769
00:35:28,020 --> 00:35:28,980
Philos in the house.

770
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:29,500
.

771
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:29,880
Right.

772
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:30,260
.

773
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:30,560
Uh. .

774
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:30,560


775
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:30,560


776
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:31,320
This is, ah,

777
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:31,440


778
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:33,480
.

779
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:41,740
which has cheap 70s porno music mixed with overmanned doctor synthesizer warblings.

780
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:49,920
This level of imagery is not accepted by the American Pediatric Association or the Federal Communications Commission.

781
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:59,920
Music to unzip your pants slowly by.

782
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:02,020
Really, Ivan?

783
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:02,980
Uh-huh.

784
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:05,460
If you're Zap Brannigan.

785
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:10,260
Uh-huh.

786
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,020
You have to watch out.

787
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:13,460
I really am actually getting kind of tired.

788
00:36:13,460 --> 00:36:15,700
Zap Brannigan can creep in.

789
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,080
I feel like somebody else needs to come up and take over this mic.

790
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,680
Locking bar can sound like Zap Brannigan.

791
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,340
Is Mike here?

792
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:25,740
If only Mike...

793
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,500
Step up to the mic.

794
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:27,780
Is Mike Hunt here?

795
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,440
Yeah.

796
00:36:28,440 --> 00:36:30,140
Is there a Mr. Hunt here?

797
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:31,140
Mike Hunt.

798
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,240
Well, I think he took too many mics.

799
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:33,760
If you...

800
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,300
Is Mike Hunt here?

801
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:38,620
He's lying down in the broom glass.

802
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,800
Is there an alcoholic here?

803
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,400
Oh, alcoholic.

804
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:56,640
Why did you come over to my joint and tell me that?

805
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:59,500
Why, you no-good dirty motherfucker.

806
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:02,820
I'll cut your belly open and show you the black stuff.

807
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,660
And so it ends this way.

808
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:14,300
The subgenius broadcast begun in harmony ends in name-calling and acrimony.

809
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,440
You yellow-red bastard.

810
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,640
Why don't you come on over to my joint?

811
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:25,040
Gentlemen, please, please.

812
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,580
What are you, some kind of a joker?

813
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:32,480
Come on over.

814
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:32,840
Get out of here.

815
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:33,100
Get out of here.

816
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:33,460
Get out of here.

817
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:33,460


818
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:33,460


819
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:33,460


820
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:33,460


821
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:33,460


822
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:33,460


823
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:33,460


824
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:33,460


825
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:34,460
Get out of here.

826
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:34,460


827
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:34,460


828
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:34,460


829
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:38,060
I'll show you my big red beef heart.

830
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,740
And, uh, Philo?

831
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,440
I got...

832
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:52,820
I used to play examples of classic prank calls on Hour of Slacking.

833
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,280
Yeah.

834
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:57,100
After a while, I started feeling bad about it because it's a...

835
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,220
There's a victim.

836
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:02,440
There's a victim in prank calls.

837
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:03,460
And it's...

838
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,060
But the victim's an asshole.

839
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,320
I mean, it's...

840
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,720
They're funny as hell.

841
00:38:10,740 --> 00:38:12,360
And, uh, but...

842
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:13,880
But it's...

843
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,120
It's not the kind of thing you should exploit for showbiz.

844
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,820
I don't think.

845
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:23,720
It should be kept to collectors and sociological researchers.

846
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,540
It is a sociological experiment.

847
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:27,660
That's really...

848
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:29,340
Well, the technology changes, too.

849
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,320
You can't really...

850
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:30,700
Right.

851
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:31,620
Now it's easy.

852
00:38:31,620 --> 00:38:32,760
...prank phone call anymore.

853
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:33,260
Yeah.

854
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,440
You get caught.

855
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:35,000
Yes.

856
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:37,080
But, uh...

857
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:43,920
Another thing I used to do was play tapes of the mentally ill people that would leave

858
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:45,980
messages on our answer phone.

859
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,740
And they still do.

860
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:48,880
They sure as hell do.

861
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,360
All you need to do is collect those tapes and not purge them.

862
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:53,860
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

863
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:54,300
You don't...

864
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,260
You have no idea how...

865
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,940
How they must be purged.

866
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:02,960
There's a guy out there that fills up my answer...

867
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,440
My answer...

868
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,900
...thing on AT&T about every four days who'll have a fit where he calls all day and all night

869
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:16,940
and leaves four-minute messages, the same basic messages over and over and over, trying

870
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:24,540
to get it just exactly right because he's on the spectrum or something or he's on crack.

871
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:28,100
Does that mean he sees in seven colors?

872
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:29,740
Let's see if he's...

873
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,100
He's on the spectrum?

874
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:31,460
Wait, wait.

875
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:32,340
That won't work.

876
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:32,660
I don't...

877
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:33,420
You're trying to...

878
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:34,160
You call him now?

879
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,060
No.

880
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:37,900
I just have to look at my voicemail and see how...

881
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:40,520
Why don't you ever call him back and just hassle him, you know?

882
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:44,100
Just call him back and then when he answers, hang up.

883
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:44,540
No, he's been quiet.

884
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,740
That would hardly serve.

885
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,620
Plus, there's no...

886
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:48,700
I don't have...

887
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,640
Well, I do have one bar of AT&T.

888
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:53,020
I guess things are a little better out there.

889
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:54,380
Oh, well, that's not so bad.

890
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,060
Maybe I could check out...

891
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,040
One bar of jail.

892
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:57,660
...the email situation.

893
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,300
That's what it is.

894
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,780
Yeah, I want to see if I could be in communication with that.

895
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,440
It's a crappy bar.

896
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,760
I don't have...

897
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:04,680
Where's the drinks?

898
00:40:06,380 --> 00:40:07,600
No, take it easy.

899
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:08,660
I've been staying...

900
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:10,280
At least they have the free lunch there.

901
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:11,280
Where are the drinks?

902
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:13,100
I wonder if there's any drinks in my car.

903
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,260
I grew up with people always telling me

904
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,480
What a sinful kid I was

905
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:32,420
What a sinful kid I was

906
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:32,420


907
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:32,420


908
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:32,420


909
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:32,420


910
00:40:32,420 --> 00:40:33,500
What a sinful kid I was

911
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:37,780
My parents didn't even seem to like me

912
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,600
Cause they didn't believe

913
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,440
That I couldn't believe

914
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,280
I just couldn't believe

915
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,820
How sinful we could be

916
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,480
Supposedly be

917
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,860
I just wanted to believe

918
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:55,780
Whatever was real

919
00:40:55,780 --> 00:40:57,940
What our bodies made us feel

920
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,400
And the billions of dollars

921
00:41:02,420 --> 00:41:04,160
And the billion billion shapes of energy

922
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,600
All the billion billion shapes of energy

923
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,440
Inside of me

924
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,700
And above me

925
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,080
Spreading out

926
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:18,060
Spreading out

927
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:21,420
I keep trying to find

928
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,420
My iniquities

929
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,420
My iniquities

930
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:30,660
Nothing like that seems to live

931
00:41:30,660 --> 00:41:32,400
Inside of me

932
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:32,400


933
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:32,400


934
00:41:32,420 --> 00:41:34,320
Inside of me

935
00:41:35,560 --> 00:41:37,120
There are only

936
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:39,120
There are only

937
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,460
The shapes of energy

938
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,180
The shapes of energy

939
00:41:47,120 --> 00:41:49,060
That's all that's real

940
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,900
Inside of me

941
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,380
There are only

942
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,180
The billion shapes of energy

943
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,360
It opens up like a beacon

944
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:02,400
It opens up like a beacon

945
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:03,060
It cuts tears

946
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,600
Inside of me

947
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:08,720
It's spreading out

948
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:10,800
Spreading out

949
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,160
Spreading out

950
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:13,420
Spreading out

951
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,100
Macrocosmically

952
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,140
And it's very particular

953
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:23,500
Microscopically

954
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,400
All the billion billion shapes of energy

955
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,420
And the priest and preacher

956
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,020
They tell us

957
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,600
We're all iniquity

958
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,720
No individuality

959
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,660
They got us

960
00:43:00,660 --> 00:43:02,440
They got us fighting their

961
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,160
Imaginary enemy

962
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,680
Well it's their iniquity

963
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,940
Not mine

964
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,060
And it's their

965
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,380
Imaginary enemy

966
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,700
It's in their mind

967
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,900
It's not mine

968
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:27,180
It's not mine

969
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:30,640
It's not mine

970
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,100
I'm only interested in

971
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:34,400
Keepin' time

972
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:40,320
With the shapes of energy

973
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,060
Rising up inside of me

974
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:51,260
And spreading out like a peacock's tail

975
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:53,960
To infinity

976
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:21,160
I grew up with people

977
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,240
I grew up with people

978
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:24,140
Telling me

979
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,020
Telling me

980

Telling me

984
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:38,080

985
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:40,240
Trying to tell me

986
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,820
About their enemy

987
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,260
But I'm all about

988
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:50,260
Energy

989
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:50,740

00:58:09,160 --> 00:58:12,200
