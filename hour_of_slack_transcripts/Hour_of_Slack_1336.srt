1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,020
The reason I'm not at the PR news is because I'm in a...

2
00:00:03,020 --> 00:00:04,380
Self-genius.

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,140
Power of...

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,840
You can tell Bob wants to win this.

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:15,120
Honestly, it's a reassuring thought,

6
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:17,340
because he wants it just as bad as the rest of us do.

7
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,120
Feet wide and just bob from side to side.

8
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,060
Turn the dial, and you're wiggling,

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,520
you're bending, you're bobbing, you're lunging.

10
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,620
I'm working the abs, the lower back,

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,400
my hip flexors, my glutes, my...

12
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,540
And after a while...

13
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,040
Having fun at the same time.

14
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,740
It gets to you.

15
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,240
Sit down, Bob. Take that shirt off.

16
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:35,820
Okay, all right.

17
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,220
Okay, now...

18
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,060
Turn the dial.

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,480
Bobby's judgment may have contributed

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,600
to saving millions of lives.

21
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,940
Rumors aside, Bobby's hard work paid off.

22
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,520
Bobby freed me of...

23
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,100
Bobby, meanwhile, is backstage doing the dirty work.

24
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:52,960
Turn to Bobby,

25
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,600
the only person to take the pressure off.

26
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,960
Oh, what a relief.

27
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:58,180
Thanks, Bobby.

28
00:00:58,260 --> 00:00:58,520
And thanks, Bobby.

29
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,580
And thanks for that recording, The Large.

30
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:02,100
More of that to come.

31
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:06,620
This may be one of the more insane hours of Slack.

32
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,000
Even more insane than last week's show.

33
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,740
Although I'm only guessing that last week's show

34
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:14,360
will be insane because I'm assembling this one,

35
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:16,520
number 1,336,

36
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:21,160
before we do the live show, 1,335.

37
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,400
At this time of recording,

38
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:27,780
I'm hurriedly assembling shows in advance

39
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,500
because pretty much all of them are going to be

40
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:33,940
in the hands of a subgenius house sitter

41
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:36,540
and go on the road for a few weeks.

42
00:01:36,740 --> 00:01:38,960
And I learned the hard way last year

43
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,360
that a somewhat deaf person

44
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,040
cannot edit hours of Slack in a moving car.

45
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,880
Luckily, we'll probably get to do a live show

46
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,060
with Pope's thermodocs in Little Rock

47
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,380
and two with Puzzling Evidence and them in Berkeley.

48
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,600
So it won't all be reruns.

49
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,980
Also, there's still much unheard ranting and music

50
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,920
from 14X Day, the Starwood Festival,

51
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:03,840
and the Northeast Ohio Witches' Baldi Vival,

52
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,000
all of which I'm trying to edit in advance.

53
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,980
Tonight, in fact, we're returning to the

54
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,280
Wisteria Campground Cafe stage

55
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,540
for recordings from 14X Day,

56
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,400
the first ever live show by the Ministry of Slack.

57
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,180
Now, we often play clips from Puzzling Evidence

58
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,140
and Reverend Susie DeFluzzi's Bob Slacktime Funhouse shows,

59
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,000
from KPFA Berkeley and WREK Atlanta, respectively,

60
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:34,820
both of which have been on those broadcast stations

61
00:02:34,820 --> 00:02:36,480
for decades.

62
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:39,400
The Ministry of Slack, however,

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,620
is part of the new generation of subgenius radio,

64
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,900
unfettered by broadcast rules,

65
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:48,160
since it's strictly a podcast

66
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,940
and not beholden to the FCC

67
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,200
like Susie, Puzzling, and I am.

68
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:56,380
They've been making shows for several years now,

69
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,120
and you can find them on the web.

70
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,120


71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,120


72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,120


73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,120


74
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:59,800
You can find the link to them on subgenius.com

75
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,200
in the radio section,

76
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,220
or just Google Ministry of Slack.

77
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,800
The funny thing about that show

78
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,860
is that most of them live in different cities,

79
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:11,120
and it's all done by phone and then edited.

80
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:13,720
At 14X Day Drill,

81
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,920
the whole gang was together in person

82
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,260
at the same place at the same first time.

83
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,080
And it's not an easy place to get to, as you'll hear,

84
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,120
partly because they are a bunch of untrained potty dogs,

85
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,820
and partly because they were drinking.

86
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,460
What you're about to hear is not uncut.

87
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,100
In fact, Reverend Exister pre-censored it for me,

88
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:37,160
and maybe forgetting that we also do

89
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,920
an uncensored internet version of Hour of Slack,

90
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,680
and he partitioned it

91
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,360
so that I could insert songs and collages

92
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,300
and give it the usual Hour of Slack treatment.

93
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:50,360
But first, let's listen to earlier that same day

94
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,680
when Dr. Howell, Priestess Pisces, and Papa Joe Mama

95
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,060
discussed both the Bulldada auction

96
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,120
and the All-Star Show.

97
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,440
In the upcoming first live Ministry of Slack performance.

98
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:03,800
I see our auctioneer is wandering this way,

99
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,100
and in about 10 minutes or so...

100
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:09,540
We're about ready to have the Bulldada auction.

101
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,480
If you want to purchase some unforgettable keepsake,

102
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,080
this may be the time to cluster around,

103
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,880
that is, in a few minutes,

104
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,020
and begin the frenzied bidding.

105
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,460
And again, if you have not registered,

106
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,420
there will be goons.

107
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,180
They are hired goons, actually.

108
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,480
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

109
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,960
Who will enforce the registration policy.

110
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,020
How unpleasant.

111
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,220
It is a sad day when the subgeniuses have to hire goons

112
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:38,360
instead of having volunteer goons.

113
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,680
Where does this come from?

114
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,240
We want volunteer goons.

115
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,140
All right.

116
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,680
It's a new one on me.

117
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,600
But, you know, one should not be surprised.

118
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:49,400
So we'll have another 10 minutes to register,

119
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,040
another 10 minutes to buy schwag,

120
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,920
and then again we will have the auction in 10 minutes.

121
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,020
And just think, you know,

122
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,240
whatever item it is,

123
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:57,200
you got in that auction,

124
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,820
that means that you survived the ferocious bidding,

125
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,160
the elbow-hitting competition of the person next to you,

126
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,820
those who are doing what they could

127
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:09,040
in order to sabotage your efforts.

128
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:11,260
It's a dog-eat-dog auction.

129
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,300
And I'm sorry, we took all this time to promote, you know...

130
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,060
Well, you've got to do that.

131
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,060
It's radio.

132
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,380
You've got to talk about the next thing that's coming along,

133
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,760
and that's the Bulldada auction.

134
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,900
It's incredible, stupendous, remarkable.

135
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,820
The finest show of its kind ever produced anywhere.

136
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,180
It slices, it dices,

137
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,400
it even makes Julian fries.

138
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,420
And while we're talking about things that are coming after the Bulldada auction,

139
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:35,900
we also will have live ministry of Slack will be joining us,

140
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:40,040
and they will be doing something not unlike what's going on here,

141
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:47,040
but with fresh young faces who are excited and not at all jaded or bitter

142
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:51,240
or not even slightly disappointed yet.

143
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:56,160
Well, there's such a thing as expecting too much, priestess.

144
00:05:56,420 --> 00:06:02,920
But we can hope that there will be those who are constant in their devotion to our cause,

145
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,420
who won't let us down at a crucial moment.

146
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,580
The ministry of Slack will not let us down.

147
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:10,640
Like a bursting safety pin or splitting belt.

148
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,620
While the conspiracy dupes...

149
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,200
They said they will feel us up, not let us down.

150
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:20,560
Adventures in time and space.

151
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:23,740
Transcribed in future tense.

152
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,500
Amanda!

153
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,960
I forgot all that shit was in there.

154
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,960
I thought it was in some stuff.

155
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,140
Yeah, it's the interlaker.

156
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,420
Can you predict what will come in 100 years?

157
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,660
Or in 10?

158
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,440
Or in the next minute?

159
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,100
Some people think they can.

160
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:47,880
Nuclear science, mathematicians, astronomers, biologists.

161
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,880
They'll predict the shape of the future because they make the future.

162
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,920
Because they see beyond the known dimensions of time and space.

163
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,480
Into the unknown.

164
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,440
Dimension X.

165
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,940
We go ahead now in time.

166
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,460
The ministry of Slack.

167
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,700
Bob?

168
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,280
The ministry of Slack.

169
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,440
Bob?

170
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,740
The ministry of Slack.

171
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,160
The ministry of Slack.

172
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:26,400
The ministry of Slack.

173
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:26,400


174
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:34,600
The ministry of Slack.

175
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,520
operates in the last Aphsys time.

176
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:44,860
Is needed to control manpower trans zitten disciples

177
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:45,140
and cause power loss.

178
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,120
What is not of the former was used to empower iron espers to

179
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:47,260
Guard to inverses the carta de sorority on the union of feldit,

180
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,460
Those of West

181
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:49,480
The ministry of Slack.

182
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,220
Montainer 130x categories.

183
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,940

188
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:10,400
Well, hello kids, and welcome.

189
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:17,820
This is the very first time that the Ministry of Slack is broadcasting at X-Day.

190
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,200
Live!

191
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,100
Can you imagine it?

192
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,040
We're here.

193
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,140
This is your brain on old.

194
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:24,680
I don't know.

195
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:24,680


196
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,060
It's your brain on old, your brain on hold.

197
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,780
This is the Ministry of Slack, so hold on to your butts.

198
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,860
It's like looking into a mirror.

199
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:34,100
This is what I do at home.

200
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,760
It's kind of what you guys are doing.

201
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,600
Just sit around and drink.

202
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,560
Yes, well, that's how we start the show.

203
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,700
Usually that is how we start it.

204
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,280
So, where are we starting today?

205
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:46,200
Oh my God.

206
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,380
Well, you know, it's amazing.

207
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,240
You guys just blew in here.

208
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,540
Literally, yeah.

209
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,200
We just arrived.

210
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,320
My God.

211
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,660
Via the walkway.

212
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,080
We just flew in from Jersey.

213
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:02,800
And boy is that joke old.

214
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,860
I said nothing about my arms flapping, sir.

215
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,960
It's bad jokes, though, that have to get us limbered up and ready.

216
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:09,980
Yeah, it's good stuff.

217
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,380
What is the torrent that's going around now?

218
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:14,900
It's like everything that's ever been done by the Ministry of Slack.

219
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:16,800
It's up to what, five gigs now or something?

220
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,440
Yeah, with two whole seaters.

221
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,820
60 gigs.

222
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:20,620
Yeah.

223
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:22,380
I hope I'm still seated.

224
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,860
That's 55 plus five more.

225
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:24,200
Sorry.

226
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:24,540
Yeah.

227
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:24,660
I'm sorry.

228
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


229
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


230
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


231
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


232
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


233
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


234
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


235
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


236
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


237
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


238
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:24,660


239
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,620
I thought that the only torrent that was going around was Bob.

240
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,280
Every episode of the Ministry of Slack is available via this torrent.

241
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,620
Except for the good stuff.

242
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,780
I'm going to tie you up and treat you like a torrent.

243
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,120
Man.

244
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:38,180
See, that's the only torrent that's really worth seating is that Bob torrent.

245
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,320
It's not illegal.

246
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,820
It's just out there, but you can feel free to pay.

247
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:42,960
And it's freshly baked.

248
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:43,640
Every day.

249
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,720
That Bob time torrent comes around.

250
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,080
Yeah.

251
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:50,920
I mean, it's strange because it's like, actually, this is the first time I have met, I mean,

252
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,520
a lot of us have met for the first time.

253
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:52,900
Let's see.

254
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,660
I mean, this is the first time all of us have met.

255
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:54,660


256
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,920
We physically are like here.

257
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,900
This is the first time we've all ever been together.

258
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:02,580
That we can actually talk to each other and look at each other in the eyes.

259
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,620
All right.

260
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:04,240
Let's do it.

261
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:04,920
I'm bottom.

262
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:08,740
No, I mean, y'all met like last year, right?

263
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,960
But y'all didn't do a live thing.

264
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,700
So now we're.

265
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:13,140
Some of us were here.

266
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:13,920
Some of us were here.

267
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,160
Yeah.

268
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,040
Or Kill Me Radio last year.

269
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:20,160
Some of us were here, but the death stars were not in alignment.

270
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,420
So that's why you should all shudder.

271
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,460
Because we're all here in one place.

272
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:25,560
At the same time.

273
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,420
So something's going to blow up.

274
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:28,560
Something will.

275
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,920
I feel it like it's on the cards.

276
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,560
Yeah, you know, I can arrange my shorts.

277
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:33,860
I feel something blow up.

278
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,940
I hope it's the earth.

279
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,280
Oh, no, that's not the wild butt hurt, is it?

280
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,660
Wait, I've been dying to do this all my life.

281
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:40,180
Wait a minute.

282
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:40,500
I just.

283
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,860
Is this thing on?

284
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:44,400
I just wanted to do that forever.

285
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,380
And finally it's appropriate.

286
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:48,240
Well, now it's there for posterity.

287
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,860
Okay, good.

288
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:51,580
Or I should say for posteriority.

289
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,480
Mm-hmm.

290
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,260
You're such a commodian.

291
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:54,660
Yeah.

292
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,020
No.

293
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:56,820
Woo-hoo.

294
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,080
Hey, punk.

295
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,980
When I get out of here, I'm going to tell you a new.

296
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:02,940
Self-genius.

297
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,640
Power of.

298
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:05,440
Surprise.

299
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,180
I'd like a receipt for that.

300
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:10,620
Yeah, me too.

301
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,080
So one of the things we were talking about, like, Aidy and me were like, we've like omens

302
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,860
on the way here.

303
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:17,200
Yes.

304
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:18,740
The road is full of omens, people.

305
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,060
I mean, we knew we were going to make it up here at X Day, regardless of whatever kind

306
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,660
of anti-slut.

307
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:30,180
We were, we were, we were unfortunately victims of, we overcame.

308
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:36,540
And it was nice to see those beautiful signals on the road telling us that, yes, we will

309
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:40,540
truly make it here to Wisteria with time to spare to do the Ministry of Slack.

310
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:43,800
They overcame and they came and they came.

311
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:44,260


312
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,040
We went through like five tiles.

313
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,400
It just doesn't stop.

314
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,740
It's an inevitable flow.

315
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,960
It really is one of the important things that you have to watch for when you're traveling

316
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,380
Mm-hmm.

317
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:55,480
is the signs and portents on the road.

318
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,100
Because some of those signs have been there for a while, but it's a time-delayed release

319
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:06,600
of information and slack from the over-Uber Dobbs head, letting you know that today, now

320
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,540
is the time.

321
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,460
$30 for salvation.

322
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:13,660
And if you're already there, then hey, you're on the right road.

323
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:14,560
You see where it's going.

324
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:18,080
Like driving up here, we saw like an exit for Bobtown.

325
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,620
Yeah, outside of Dallas.

326
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,000
Back in the state of Dallas.

327
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:21,540
That is certainly a sign.

328
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,460
And you saw-

329
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,460
And we were even talking.

330
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,520
No, Bobtown Road, Dallas, formation of the church.

331
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:26,920
Dobbs Motors.

332
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,680
Dobbs Motors in Tennessee.

333
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,460
That is more signs.

334
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,220
Yes.

335
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:33,540
Bobtown, isn't that one of them all-women prisons?

336
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,500
Perhaps.

337
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:34,780
Yeah.

338
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:40,360
And it was a nice family of pinks who had, you know, they had the Dobbs Motor like insignia

339
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,080
from the dealership.

340
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:45,440
And we're just like, that is so wrong, but yet, you know, we're on our way.

341
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:49,560
Well, of course, Bob Dobbs sold those vehicles to those pinks.

342
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,480
Of course he did.

343
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:51,340
Of course.

344
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,900
It was just, you know, one of those you had to be there.

345
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,960
Oh my God, what the fuck?

346
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:55,300
Bob.

347
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,580
In fact, we had to slow down.

348
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,080
We even had to say, hey, is that somebody?

349
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:00,960
We thought maybe it was official church propaganda.

350
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,580
We're like-

351
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,380
So you were rubberneckers for Bob.

352
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:05,420
Just for a second.

353
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:05,680
Okay.

354
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,040
Once we realized that the guy had his cap back on and had about $100 worth of gold around

355
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,060
his neck, we realized, nah.

356
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,460
It's something that people don't always realize.

357
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:16,780
Dobbs is the great galactic salesman of repute.

358
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:21,320
So of course he's going to have his fingers and, you know, other various body parts.

359
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,220
And all sorts of different businesses.

360
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:24,640
Diversification.

361
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,620
Yes, diversification, diversa-mutation-def-ication.

362
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:31,920
That's a portfolio you can believe in.

363
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:33,700
Or extra meditation.

364
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,720
Yeah, or extra meditation.

365
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:43,300
The Ministry of Slack marveling at the portents seen on their difficult cross-country road

366
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:46,360
trips to Wisteria Campground near Athens, Ohio.

367
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:50,820
Funny that Bobtown Road in Dallas they mention...

368
00:13:51,520 --> 00:14:02,280
The second subgenius publication, Stark Fist No. 1, featured a photo of Philo Drummond standing under that very Bob Town Road sign in 1979.

369
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:10,400
Anyway, that gives us an excuse to cut to yet another sub-simp or subgenius-related show, Radio Synesthesia,

370
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:16,660
which follows Hour of Slack on WCSB Cleveland, hosted by our good friend Dr. Sinister.

371
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:28,200
Here we hear his rather candid description of his trip from Cleveland in frigid northern Ohio to Wisteria on the Ohio River way down south,

372
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:33,160
where you can tell it's July and no longer a big city of the Northeast.

373
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:40,600
It's so weird going to, you know, the last time I traveled that far from home was last November for the Detroit revival.

374
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,900
And, you know, that meant I crossed a state line.

375
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:52,040
I went into Michigan and frankly, I felt more at home in Detroit than I do in southern Ohio.

376
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:53,840
I can't believe I'm in the same state.

377
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:57,840
I think that the state lines that we have drawn in this country are completely arbitrary.

378
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,580
And it was it was like another it was like another country almost.

379
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,240
The dirt is red or pink.

380
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:11,900
But yeah, yeah, they've got red clay down in southern Ohio.

381
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:16,240
I knew about that because I've got family in Marietta and I used to go see them when I was young.

382
00:15:16,940 --> 00:15:24,260
And I was familiar with the red clay, but I did not remember how hot it would get and how humid it would get.

383
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,360
It was like over 90 degrees every day.

384
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:33,120
And the humidity was such that like, I don't know.

385
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:36,420
Actually, it might have been like maybe it was so hot.

386
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:42,140
Maybe the temperature outside exceeded my body temperature and it wasn't actually sweat.

387
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,640
Maybe it was just condensation.

388
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,340
You know, you put a cold drink out on a hot day.

389
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,720
And all that moisture appears on the sides of it.

390
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,860
That's just condensation.

391
00:15:53,140 --> 00:15:54,380
And maybe that's what it was.

392
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,400
Maybe I wasn't really sweating.

393
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,720
Maybe it was just that hot out.

394
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,060
Hard to tell.

395
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:58,680
Hard to tell.

396
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:07,700
You know, I mean, the show really like when we do this show, it's like we literally I think we do about maybe like an hour meeting every week.

397
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:11,360
And then between me and Exister and whoever contributes, we just do music.

398
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,520
So it's like we're on the spot now.

399
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,120
We've got to like.

400
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:15,200
Right.

401
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,500
There can't be any lulls now.

402
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:17,460
Oh, how the hell?

403
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,780
There can be lulls.

404
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,300
There just can't be.

405
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,860
Skype won't shut down on us now.

406
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,040
So there is no excuse for.

407
00:16:22,340 --> 00:16:27,260
Well, and you, the audience, are the closest we have to cut ups.

408
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,260
So we don't have any to play.

409
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,560
So be that cut up.

410
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:32,500
Cut ups.

411
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:34,040
Now, they're not that funny.

412
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:34,340
Yeah.

413
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,020
Feel free to come up here and dance if you like.

414
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:38,000
And talk over us.

415
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,380
We don't mind.

416
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:39,280
We could use.

417
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,460
Any demanding jig that you want to dance.

418
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,360
We'll be more than glad to watch.

419
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,560
Official Ministry of Slack Fly Girls since it's 1991.

420
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:49,560
Even solid gold dancers would work at this point.

421
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:50,640
It's not only gold dancers.

422
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:51,760
That's a soft metal, though.

423
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,740
How about solid iridium?

424
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,240
That'd be good.

425
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:55,960
Solid iridium.

426
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,320
Two shows ago.

427
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,220
Yeah.

428
00:16:58,220 --> 00:16:58,440
Yeah.

429
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,860
So we are the hippest trip in America now.

430
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:02,920
Oh, that's right.

431
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,020
We outpace Soul Train.

432
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:09,560
The Dobbs Train is the hippest trip in these benighted states.

433
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,500
Super cool.

434
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,920
And it's fall down for more slack.

435
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:33,920


436
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,620
Oh, this one.

437
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,920
Rock on.

438
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:43,980
We'll have a look at.

439
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,180
That's lovely.

440
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:46,280
Gee.

441
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,840
Thank you.

442
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:26,380
Thank you.

443
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,720
Thank you.

444
00:18:58,780 --> 00:18:59,500
Thank you.

445
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:02,420
Thank you.

446
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,380
Thank you.

447
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:07,220
Thank you.

448
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:07,660
Thank you.

449
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:07,740
Thank you.

450
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:07,740


451
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:08,760
Thank you.

452
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:08,760


453
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:08,760


454
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:08,760


455
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:12,700
On the Boardwalk in Atlanta City

456
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:14,480
by the Rudy Schwartz

457
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,860
Project from the new CD

458
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,480
they switched to cornmeal on

459
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,560
Sealand Records, negativeland.com

460
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,960
negative spelled without the E.

461
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:24,440
negative spelled without the E.

462
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,520
And now to a goodly stretch of the

463
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,680
Ministry of Slack show live at

464
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,400
X Day.

465
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,540
So once again

466
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,400
we are the hippest trip in America now.

467
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,700
And most of our audience

468
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,660
is about to break theirs.

469
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:39,640
Hey you know what's kind of funny too

470
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:42,460
because both announcers have silvery voices.

471
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:44,520
Silvery?

472
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:45,220
Yes.

473
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,680
Well polished.

474
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:49,020
The hippest trip in America.

475
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,360
No, no, where are our manners here?

476
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,840
So we could have some

477
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:56,580
greenhorn listeners, some new

478
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,500
listeners that have no idea

479
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,620
who we are.

480
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,460
So I think we should do

481
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:04,440
Dobbs roll call.

482
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,760
Go down the line and say who we are.

483
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,240
So if you want to punch us later

484
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,360
you can. That's a stupid show.

485
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,320
It's the worst thing I've ever seen or heard.

486
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,500
And I'm deaf.

487
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:15,620
By far the worst part of it.

488
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,940
We talk over each other more than

489
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,660
puzzling evidence. They don't shut up.

490
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,520
Well, I'm Reverend Exister.

491
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,660
One of the original

492
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,220
founders of the Ministry of Slack.

493
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,380
He's the big toe.

494
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,220
His blood,

495
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,080
his sweat, his semen,

496
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,700
his very bones are embedded

497
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:35,800
in this ministry.

498
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,380
We would not be here without him of course

499
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:40,100
because you're a dirty squirrely man.

500
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,780
Yes I am the Reverend Dementio

501
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,780
the 80th otherwise known as

502
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,640
Reverend 80 otherwise known as

503
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,140
Reverend AXDX

504
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:50,000
otherwise known as Reverend Axe

505
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,960
I am Reverend Slender Bob

506
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,860
I guess the newest member

507
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,800
of the Clench.

508
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,280
And who does most of our mixes now.

509
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:00,080
This man does amazing work.

510
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:01,240
If you've heard our show before

511
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,820
and in recent times, a lot of it's been due to him.

512
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,260
One of the most hard working men

513
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:07,000
in show business.

514
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,160
Thank you.

515
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:12,820
Our current show would not be what it is

516
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:13,860
without Slender Bob.

517
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,020
That's nice.

518
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:16,820
I'll say it.

519
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,620
We have to have show.

520
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,700
Not S-H-O-W just S-H-O.

521
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,680
It's like the Ministry of Slack started off with a video show

522
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:25,380
on Ustream.

523
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:27,300
You did all the video.

524
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,040
You did pretty much all of that.

525
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:29,900
Then you had submissions.

526
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,920
And I burned out.

527
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,440
Many many hours a week.

528
00:21:34,460 --> 00:21:38,420
But now it's even better because the visuals are in your mind.

529
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,320
You're whiff reading those visuals

530
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,400
those mental visuals

531
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,240
with your third nostril friends.

532
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,000
So you don't have to worry about

533
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,400
visuals on a computer.

534
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,200
It's a lucid dream in real time.

535
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,260
You either f*** off or you rip the wrinkle.

536
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,260
Whatever you're going to do.

537
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,380
So normally when you listen to the show on the internet

538
00:21:55,380 --> 00:21:57,480
there's a little bit of ranting and talking

539
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,400
and lots of music.

540
00:21:58,560 --> 00:21:59,360
But back down the line.

541
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:03,040
Did we do McGee already?

542
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:05,740
We did myself and Slender.

543
00:22:07,160 --> 00:22:09,000
See this is a peanut gallery.

544
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:09,860
That's what this is.

545
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,940
I see what's going on here.

546
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,060
The pockets.

547
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,980
Somebody's blushing.

548
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,840
I'm Reverend Pockets.

549
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:18,180
Hello.

550
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:19,420
Mob.

551
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,900
Like every morning radio show

552
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,060
we have to have a hole.

553
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,860
Far far more.

554
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,720
The holy stark fist of Connie herself.

555
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:33,640
I'm here to break up the sausage party.

556
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,540
That's my sole purpose.

557
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,080
Pretty much.

558
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,900
She's the on this bull.

559
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,620
But more importantly you know what she does?

560
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,540
She checks us.

561
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:41,300
Go back to our minds.

562
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:43,220
She checks us.

563
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:44,380
I mean remember last week?

564
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:45,720
She said that we were.

565
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,680
Oh she checks herself too.

566
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,360
Before she wrecks herself.

567
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,340
She gives me a horribly bad English portion.

568
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:53,180
Because when we're going to.

569
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:53,920
She corrects us.

570
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,320
We wreck ourselves all together.

571
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:58,380
Well we get wrecked and we get bit.

572
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,040
But I seem to be having to do an introduction for myself.

573
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:04,060
Hello again brothers and sisters.

574
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:05,820
This is the alchemist.

575
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,280
Orpheus Stain.

576
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,100
I heard there's a random tent.

577
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:13,760
Indeed.

578
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,480
I'm going to watch out.

579
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:17,260
I'm on the wisteria.

580
00:23:18,160 --> 00:23:20,760
It's very similar to that classic song.

581
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:21,940
The Phantom Windbreaker.

582
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:23,600
We have the phantom tent.

583
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,000
We don't know who this person is.

584
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,180
There's only blurry photographs.

585
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,640
We can't tell gender from this.

586
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:32,280
They're being analyzed but all we know.

587
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:34,000
Is that they're leaving steamers.

588
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,940
In the tents of.

589
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:37,760
Like a yeti.

590
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,360
Watch out for that spore.

591
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,040
If it's there you run.

592
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,080
You run quicker than you ever have.

593
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:44,160
And you get out of here.

594
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:45,300
Because they're coming for you.

595
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,020
Or you can do the opposite thing.

596
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,280
That I've heard that it does make wonderful jenkum.

597
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,160
If you are a bold enough individual.

598
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,180
To harvest and ferment this.

599
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,240
That takes work.

600
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,900
But we know the true way to make jenkum.

601
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,440
Oh that's right.

602
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,540
It is illustrated.

603
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,200
Is it in the yeti book over there?

604
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:05,720
No.

605
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,280
God that book sucks more and more.

606
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,840
Yeah there's like a.

607
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:10,540
You can think about jenkum in there.

608
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,020
She's right.

609
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:15,340
I believe that is covered actually.

610
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,980
There is an image in this sacred text.

611
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,140
Are you huffing up?

612
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,540
The first step to getting jenkum.

613
00:24:21,740 --> 00:24:22,580
There it is.

614
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:24,720
The harvesting of food.

615
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,300
It's an overman dropping his night soil.

616
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,560
Excremeditation out in the open.

617
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,860
The first step to jenkum friends.

618
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:32,940
It can be yours.

619
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:33,860
You drew that in.

620
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,840
The stars are awesome at night.

621
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:39,120
After you leave that porta potty.

622
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,320
You got that fresh jenkum high.

623
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:41,140
It's true.

624
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,940
What is the blue chemical that they put in the jenkum these days?

625
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:45,680
What is that new.

626
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:46,900
It's the kids all of it.

627
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,360
It's blueberry flavoring.

628
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,700
It's not nickel sulfate?

629
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:52,160
No.

630
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:54,100
I like to call it blue loo.

631
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:54,820
But that's just me.

632
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,320
Blue moon, blue monday.

633
00:24:58,320 --> 00:24:59,400
Blue balls.

634
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,400
It's true.

635
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,720
Those jenkum huffing steam chambers.

636
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:09,220
You look up at the stars.

637
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,200
And you think the exes are bound to see us now.

638
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:14,640
That's the great thing about being able to do this show on the internet.

639
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,060
We can really just like go.

640
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,260
Sometimes we do get really filthy.

641
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:19,460
Filthy than we are now.

642
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,340
It is a filthy show folks.

643
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:22,060
It's really filthy.

644
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,300
Because we are at home and we are comfortable.

645
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,580
And there is nobody watching us.

646
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:29,420
We have no FCC to.

647
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,540
I mean we have seen all of us.

648
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,180
This is one of the major differences between us and other subterranean shows.

649
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:35,700
We have no FCC to.

650
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,180
There is no FCC control over us.

651
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:37,980
I would not put that on the show.

652
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:41,480
I would not want to be in Snake's position to have to edit.

653
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:41,980
I know right.

654
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,580
We wouldn't have a show anymore.

655
00:25:45,060 --> 00:25:46,180
It would be done.

656
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,380
It would be like a five minute show.

657
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,060
It would be like Red Fox in 1973 put on like prime time.

658
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,360
It's why his ears don't listen anymore.

659
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:54,920
Because they don't want to hear that.

660
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:56,200
They are sick of it.

661
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,380
They quit.

662
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,220
They are fed up.

663
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:04,440
I've only been doing it like broadcasting for ten years.

664
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,420
I can imagine like.

665
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,900
I haven't been doing it for as long as Suzie and Ivan.

666
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,920
As long as they've been doing it.

667
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:08,440
It's like you know.

668
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:12,660
Praise those who have come before us.

669
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,620
In this honorable subgenius tradition.

670
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,040
We lift our glasses.

671
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:19,220
To those of you who actually have experience.

672
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,700
And know what you are doing.

673
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,400
Well done.

674
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,600
We are the mere embryos.

675
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,120
Of the giant yeti.

676
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:27,900
Fully grown.

677
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,740
I don't need this.

678
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,500
But I've seen him for a while.

679
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:38,380
I don't know where he's been.

680
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,400
Do you have any idea where he's been?

681
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:42,020
I think he's been on a sabbatical.

682
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:43,640
At the seminary.

683
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,580
What does that mean exactly?

684
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:47,240
It's a guy thing.

685
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:49,820
Well on the sabbath they go on a sabbatical.

686
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,320
And they are in the seminary.

687
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,120
Of the disseminating semen.

688
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:56,420
She likes that word.

689
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,740
They disseminate semen.

690
00:26:57,740 --> 00:27:00,040
We're going to watch TV while you guys talk about that stuff.

691
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,480
With the semen.

692
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,580
In the Navy.

693
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:06,000
No.

694
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:09,560
I cannot even imagine a place with no VCRs.

695
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:12,320
Now, how am I going to watch the pageant on no VCRs?

696
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,580
Well, we're in the past right now.

697
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:14,940
Way long ago.

698
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,800
I'll just have to watch the pageant live on one of the major networks.

699
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:20,120
Oh, my God, Bob, would you do that for me?

700
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,800
Would you come to my baby's pageant?

701
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:23,340
Yeah, I'll watch it live.

702
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:25,260
But it's going to be televised, right?

703
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:26,800
Live, televised, televised?

704
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,440
No, we have to be there live.

705
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,960
I can send one of my minions.

706
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:33,180
I'll send one of my minions.

707
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:38,720
Next week in Dallas, we have a husband and I have a pageant,

708
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,680
and we would just love for you to come.

709
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,540
Okay, I'll be there.

710
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:45,440
Either me or one of my representatives will be there.

711
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,820
Now, Philo, don't you say that,

712
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:50,940
because you sent that last representative, and he was not a nice man.

713
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:54,120
Well, I'm still waiting for that write-up

714
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,400
so that I can give him his performance appraisal

715
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:01,520
and just dismiss him properly through the proper legal channels.

716
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,520
Performance appraisal?

717
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:03,020
I don't.

718
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,060
I don't care, really.

719
00:28:04,180 --> 00:28:06,100
I've just got to be truthful about this.

720
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:12,380
It's not that I am not, you know, supportive of my husband and his job.

721
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:13,240
Hey, Vicki.

722
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,540
All that, but I just don't care about, I mean,

723
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:20,700
he has been performing now for like 40 years on that thing radio.

724
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,820
Yeah, that's true.

725
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,420
And we know he's good now.

726
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:25,560
What is the problem?

727
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:30,020
You'd think it would be like by now, people would know what it was like, right?

728
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:32,900
I'm going to take that into consideration.

729
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:37,040
Dr. Philo Drummond, taking it all into consideration

730
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:41,320
on the puzzling evidence show of January 20th, 2011,

731
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:45,360
with a caller who sure sounds like she's from around Dallas.

732
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:51,320
Anyway, these are the elders that the young ministry of Slack were talking about,

733
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:55,420
even elder than I, for I was merely the first Bobby.

734
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,300
Dr. Drummond turned me on to Bob and knew him personally.

735
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:02,800
I never was allowed to meet Bob until about 30 seconds

736
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,860
before he was assassinated that first time in 1985.

737
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:10,020
That was 1984, not 1985.

738
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,220
Thank you.

739
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,020
And the puzzling evidence show predates the hour of Slack by three years.

740
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:19,760
It started at KPFA in June of 1982.

741
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:23,640
Although I was there at those first two broadcasts,

742
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,960
heard on our old media barrage tapes.

743
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:31,040
The music in the background, by the way, is Boron Nuzzle,

744
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,780
live at 14XX.

745
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,100
And now back to the ministry of Slack,

746
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:40,440
which will be interspersed with a brag of Brother Cleve Donut Duncan,

747
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:44,440
one of the early influential proto-er subgenii,

748
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:48,140
and so cool that he did an album with Esquivel.

749
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,160
Praise Brother Cleve, praise ministry of Slack, praise Connie.

750
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,440
Praise the Connie, praise the Yanni.

751
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,260
Oh yeah, Yanni, what?

752
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,740
Hey, there's nothing wrong with a little panfalutin.

753
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,200
Right?

754
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,960
Praise the Lord, pass the ammunition.

755
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,460
It depends on what they're doing with it.

756
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,480
I can play the panfalutin.

757
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,540
No, I think we're about to have a schism up here.

758
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:06,860
Look out.

759
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:10,180
I usually pan the flute in the right channel.

760
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:11,500
Pan the flute, yeah.

761
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:11,900
There you go.

762
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:13,740
This is the ugly facts of this show.

763
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,540
Five days, two days.

764
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,860
We're pretty much raunchy cheese for your dirty nachos.

765
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,480
It's a lot of jokes for the most part.

766
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:23,040
Yeah, but basically, you know, cater to the lowest crowd.

767
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:26,500
And then the occasional reference to Bob, and then, you know, the occasional, like,

768
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:29,000
drop the $64 words for the higher crowd.

769
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:32,260
Hey, you listening to this who thinks this is funny, go to subgenius.com.

770
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:36,120
And while you're at it, click on the link that says register to be a minister now.

771
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:37,200
That's what we do normally.

772
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:41,480
Going to the obvious, I think it's because, you know, 1998 is now.

773
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:42,860
This is the year.

774
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,180
You guys said it as you came in.

775
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:46,000
There are all the signs.

776
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,880
You know, there are signs of Bob's everywhere.

777
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:48,920
This time it's time.

778
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:50,020
Everywhere you go.

779
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,560
And, you know, they've been getting a lot more.

780
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,960
Because the time is truly the end times.

781
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,260
By hook or by crook or by cheek.

782
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:57,800
Bob.

783
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,100
We all got here.

784
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,340
You guys don't know this because you just arrived.

785
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:02,280
There is.

786
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,080
Someone here.

787
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,260
Like that.

788
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,280
Gee, how can I explain?

789
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:08,760
How would you explain him?

790
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,580
Well, it's as if we've all been doing this for so long.

791
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:15,140
Something finally manifested.

792
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,840
It was a manifestation, yes.

793
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,440
And he's right here.

794
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:24,000
The mental energy put into it for all this time has drawn a certain individual.

795
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,320
His name's Bob.

796
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,480
There's a salesman here.

797
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:27,460
He's from Texas.

798
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,720
He's a salesman.

799
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,460
His name is Robert, but he goes by Bob.

800
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:30,760
Yep.

801
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,720
He's from Texas.

802
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:37,240
And he models on the side like the great Dobbs did, which is how we have the Dobbs head.

803
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,060
And I had doubts.

804
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:44,720
I asked this man to see some proof his name was really Robert or Bob.

805
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,020
And I looked at his ID.

806
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,340
The end of it said J.R.

807
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:48,860
That's right.

808
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:54,800
Well, and everything that happens to him, every good thing happens by accident.

809
00:31:55,360 --> 00:32:01,580
You know, there was a there was a point yesterday where I saw this man that we like to call Bob in his lovely tailored suit yesterday.

810
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:02,140
I know.

811
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,060
He's a snappy dresser.

812
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:05,360
He's a quite dapper gentleman indeed.

813
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:06,080
I knew.

814
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:06,200
Like Bob himself.

815
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,000
Reverend Dapper.

816
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:07,780
That's his name.

817
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:12,780
I think I may have just saw the real J.R. Bob Dobbs walk off into the sunset.

818
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:15,180
Folks, we're getting raptured this year.

819
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,300
The gleam in his eye.

820
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,920
And somehow no one has killed him yet.

821
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:25,400
Annette's saying something because if you're a regular listener to the show, you know that I do a cavalcade of different voices.

822
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:26,900
He's a veritable mill blank.

823
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,440
Well, the fact of the matter is.

824
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:31,560
That's the only way I can get a call.

825
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:31,560


826
00:32:31,580 --> 00:32:35,480
Across to you people how important it is that you get right with Bob?

827
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:37,580
Not that you get right with Bob.

828
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:47,360
But at every second, every, I Ode every nanosecond, before those saucers come is a chance for you to get other people to come to Bob.

829
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,760
So that when you get up to your saucer you can say, I duped this many.

830
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:52,340
Yeah.

831
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,940
And you, yes you, can be saved.

832
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:01,560
But if, if, and only if, you get right with Bob Bob,

833
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:09,240
Tonight or this afternoon or tomorrow morning or sometimes during lunch or if you go off to take a nice healthy extra meditation

834
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:13,080
You can say you know what I'm gonna. I'm gonna give myself over to Bob

835
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:19,120
And by that virtue I am in touch with forces greater than men I dare you to kill me

836
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,360
I am NOT a duplicate conspiracy. I know more than they do I am a subgenius. That's all I need to be

837
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,520
I'm one of the good guys I shall prevail

838
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:33,800
Let out the crazy man inside you he knows what's what smile when you call me a fanatic me primate me over man

839
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:38,840
I said to the pigs give me your money you won't need it the future offers you not for destruction

840
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:44,440
You wake up, and you go I was duped. I was played played like a puppet

841
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:48,660
Yeah, fucker have the rest of my wallet you cheap cheap

842
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:53,180
Okay, I bet you $50 right now. We're not on the roster next year

843
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:59,140
We're not on the roster for next year because it's happening this year

844
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:03,900
Are you talking solar year?

845
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:08,400
Just soda Papa

846
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,580
Actually McGee brings up a good point mentioning time, and I don't mean that one

847
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:20,340
I mean the terrestrial wristwatch, but several people here unfortunately been asking me what time

848
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:23,160
You're not talking about the the quintessential wristwatch

849
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:27,100
That Zappa talks about in his music indeed the same

850
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:33,680
Same dirty rest watch fruits the pinks

851
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:39,660
What time is it am I hungry? I gotta look at a watch you don't even have

852
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,720
Now

853
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:52,600
Alright, I'm gonna wind up that Bob watch are you gonna kill it kill that time kill that Bob watch cuz Bob's here?

854
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,080
He doesn't know me

855
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:53,580
Look at watch

856
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:04,120
Stop me big Bob. Oh, okay. Okay, big Bob do what is the Bob?

857
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:06,620
Oh

858
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:13,600
Something

859
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,420
Oh big Bob

860
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:22,780
You smell like rubber and you're really sketchy

861
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:23,360
your

862
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:28,220
Got punked by Big Bob like weird dream

863
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,600
Come on

864
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:42,260
Gentlemen as it landed here at hysteria

865
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:50,620
14 what one faithful listener asked for the subgenius he said you on the corn report. Well, we do we do have the

866
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,520
agricultural commodities Bear

867
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,060
what were ya?

868
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:53,980
We have frop.

869
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,380
Frop is up to 25.

870
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,520
It's up to 25 from 13 before.

871
00:35:59,880 --> 00:36:05,860
And beef has gone ahead and raised itself from 13 to a good hard 22 and a half.

872
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:11,020
Well, the problem with the beef is that, like any good healthy beef, it smells.

873
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:17,040
So beef is down to a negative 6 because you don't want to be around that beef.

874
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:22,140
Well, the corn and squash is splattered into the spinach loaf, which is now at about 250.

875
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,080
Give me a little more.

876
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,160
252 on the Jenkin-Rector scale.

877
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:32,800
Now, the important thing to know is that here in beautiful Wisteria, we are in an area.

878
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,140
Wisteria?

879
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,420
Because Wisteria!

880
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:36,540
Okay.

881
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:41,840
We are in an area where people play this traditional corn holing game.

882
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:44,840
They throw a corn cob through a hole.

883
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,220
And there's something subgenious about that.

884
00:36:47,340 --> 00:36:50,080
If they're that dedicated to corn holing.

885
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,120
We are in the wrong.

886
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,600
We're in the right place, brothers and sisters.

887
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,600
I want to see some pictures of that.

888
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,800
You probably take the pictures of that.

889
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,040
Yeah, I mean, it's like...

890
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:00,540
You'll be in the pictures of that.

891
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:03,500
When does the actual corn holing begin?

892
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,100
Well, it all depends.

893
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:06,620
I don't know.

894
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,020
I need to check the schedule.

895
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:08,960
Cornelius?

896
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,020
Well, if you want to get that perfect shot, you drink that corn liquor.

897
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,300
And you throw that corn cob.

898
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,720
And you hope to Dobbs that it makes it through the hole.

899
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,800
Otherwise, they're going to cut off your other leg!

900
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:20,720
I just heard this guy, Bob.

901
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:21,840
He fits into everything.

902
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,840
What was Bob saying?

903
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:24,160
I'm a perp.

904
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:26,280
And I arrest cops.

905
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:27,700
And I eat people.

906
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:28,060
Yeah.

907
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,560
I can smell a cop.

908
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,340
Retarded nonsense.

909
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:31,720
Right.

910
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:33,640
He gets all lit up and wired.

911
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:34,480
And you go, right.

912
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:35,180
Exactly.

913
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,240
Exactly.

914
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:37,300
Exactly.

915
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,080
You are right, Bob.

916
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:43,000
That's called being me-tarded.

917
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:44,820
Don't be me-tarded.

918
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,880
Circle Church, you moron.

919
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,560
Is Ego's at some newfangled Linux program?

920
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,320
Circle Church?

921
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:51,840
Yeah.

922
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,120
Circle Church.

923
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,120


924
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,120


925
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,120


926
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:52,120


927
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,640
Circle Church?

928
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,140
There you go.

929
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,400
I noticed that you young folks talk a lot faster than Dr. Howell.

930
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,960
Well, we are able to.

931
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:02,480
You know what it is?

932
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:05,280
It's all the damn answer.

933
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,860
I said, hell, I'll talk fast.

934
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,100
You know I can talk fast.

935
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,080
I mean, hey, if you don't push that button, I mean, hey.

936
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:12,060
I mean, forget about it.

937
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:12,760
Don't blame me.

938
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,220
I mean, you got to point that at me, that hand.

939
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,600
You got to point your hand.

940
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:17,980
I didn't create change.

941
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,300
No, you didn't.

942
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:19,440
No.

943
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,100
He's a monster that made himself.

944
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,860
We can speak.

945
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:23,400
We speak slower at times.

946
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,400
We enunciate.

947
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:25,440
Yes, we can.

948
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,260
We use very bad grammar.

949
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,880
Because I speak English good.

950
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,020
It depends on the material.

951
00:38:30,420 --> 00:38:30,940
Circle Church.

952
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,940
You guys haven't been trained by having to go to radio stations.

953
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:35,280
Hell no.

954
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:35,600
Actually.

955
00:38:35,740 --> 00:38:36,260
Actually?

956
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,260
Oh, no.

957
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:38,920
I had a year of that.

958
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,640
No, we have no FCC.

959
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:43,520
This is a major difference between us and all of our subtenuous shows.

960
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:44,040
We are free.

961
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:45,780
We're all over.

962
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,260
We're a bunch of, like, what?

963
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:48,780
Everywhere.

964
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:49,840
North America?

965
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:50,660
More than.

966
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:51,680
We've got Leach in the room.

967
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:54,600
We will probably carnival barfers in another life.

968
00:38:55,660 --> 00:39:00,560
But now we're just yakking on the radio, filling the air with our foul stanchions.

969
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,540
Those doctors of the air.

970
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,520
Push for a different market.

971
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,780
And that is the modern state of skull farming.

972
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,820
See, that's the thing.

973
00:39:09,860 --> 00:39:14,800
Because we can be doing show, and meanwhile, we can be looking at the finest Yeti porn.

974
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,300
Right?

975
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:17,340
Hey, Sting.

976
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:19,300
One time I left my webcam on.

977
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:40,140
Teddy can party with that.

978
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:42,000
Thank you.

979
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:43,460
All right.

980
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:43,800
Next, we have the most famous artist on the showing, that line justbird of

981
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,880
with kas meine taiwo sei,

982
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:44,880


983
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,000


984
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:45,480
Bunu

985
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:46,980
RuRAV

986
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:46,980


987
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:46,980


988
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:46,980


989
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:13,460
The large did the crunching of water music that was.

990
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:19,800
We heard the Ministry of Slack live at 14X Day, more to come.

991
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:23,560
A collage by Reverend Dr. Royal Decapitator.

992
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:27,560
And the large again, or before, depending on how you look at it.

993
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:32,240
And now back to Ministry of Slack on stage in a moment when I left the video camera

994
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:38,480
and approached them to compliment them on their lack of built-in old-school radio inhibitions.

995
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:45,000
I can tell.

996
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:48,980
Nah, we still have our Dobbs brand diapers on.

997
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,460
Oh, fine, yeah, go ahead.

998
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:59,180
That one's the durable.

999
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:01,920
I bought her a whole bottle of it.

1000
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:04,400
And we need more bottles.

1001
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:08,660
We accept donations, as all doctors do.

1002
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,360
A little image for the people who are listening, who might hear this later.

1003
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:13,220
It's like, we just got here.

1004
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:13,440
People are here.

1005
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:13,440


1006
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,200
People are just now arriving to Wisteria.

1007
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,420
Imagine a bunch of drunks screaming into a microphone.

1008
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:22,040
Imagine, like, a hair metal band going,

1009
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:23,140
Hello, Detroit!

1010
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,540
to two people.

1011
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,520
That's what we're doing right now.

1012
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:31,880
But for those of you ladies at home who all of a sudden got moist,

1013
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:37,040
that was the melodious voice of the good, sacred scribe, Ivan Stang.

1014
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:37,900
Yes.

1015
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:42,900
Not to be confused with or Doug.

1016
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:44,480
I've been staying.

1017
00:41:44,760 --> 00:41:44,960
Doug?

1018
00:41:46,020 --> 00:41:48,060
Okay, now you said you wouldn't do this.

1019
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:48,420
Now, now, Brian.

1020
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:49,780
What, what are you talking about?

1021
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:50,360
I'm in Todd.

1022
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,760
You want to go there?

1023
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:52,440
Todd?

1024
00:41:52,740 --> 00:41:53,600
Let me tell you.

1025
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:53,960
Todd?

1026
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:54,920
Let me tell you.

1027
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,180
I was going to shut up right now.

1028
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,100
Let me tell you, the Church of the Doug Geniuses sold last year.

1029
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,300
We burnt that to the ground.

1030
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,920
Then Bob stopped by.

1031
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:05,920
And Bob read them dirty limericks.

1032
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:07,300
The pressure off.

1033
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,920
And Bob read them dirty limericks.

1034
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,360
The pressure off.

1035
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:11,920
And Bob read them dirty limericks.

1036
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:12,880
The pressure off.

1037
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:13,340
The pressure off.

1038
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:15,020
And Bob read them dirty limericks.

1039
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:15,840
Bobby.

1040
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:18,280
This is clearly a photograph of Bob.

1041
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,180
And what's really sad is it's actual size.

1042
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:27,140
It is a, he is not a large man.

1043
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:28,700
Let's try this.

1044
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,320
This is Bob.

1045
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,120
This is Bob.

1046
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,660
Bob is a simulated man as a punching bag.

1047
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,340
And I'll give you a sense of what it's like to hit somebody.

1048
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:34,840
Okay.

1049
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:37,640
So let's go ahead and try a palm strike on Bob.

1050
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:39,000
Okay, palm strike on Bob.

1051
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:39,240
Right here.

1052
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,540
Go in a straight line, straight in to win and aim for his nose.

1053
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,040
Go right through it.

1054
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:42,140
Way to do his nose.

1055
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:42,580
So what am I?

1056
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:42,780
So.

1057
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:43,620
Just like that.

1058
00:42:44,460 --> 00:42:45,500
That's me, Bob.

1059
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:47,520
Like a big truck driver.

1060
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,580
I'd rather mean Lester.

1061
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,420
That's me, Bob.

1062
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,460
Like a big truck driver.

1063
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:53,560
I'd rather mean Lester.

1064
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:54,500
So just like that.

1065
00:42:54,660 --> 00:42:55,380
That's me, Bob.

1066
00:42:56,060 --> 00:42:57,380
Like a big truck driver.

1067
00:42:57,420 --> 00:42:58,460
I'd rather mean Lester.

1068
00:42:59,320 --> 00:43:00,320
That's me, Bob.

1069
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,320
Like a big truck driver.

1070
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:03,440
I'd rather mean Lester.

1071
00:43:03,660 --> 00:43:04,680
I'd rather me Lester.

1072
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:05,000
Lester.

1073
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,160
Lester.

1074
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:06,400
Lester.

1075
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,020
Lester.

1076
00:43:07,940 --> 00:43:08,240
Lester.

1077
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:08,840
Lester.

1078
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:09,460
Lester.

1079
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:10,060
Lester.

1080
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:10,660
Lester.

1081
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:11,220
Lester.

1082
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:11,300
Lester.

1083
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:11,880
Lester.

1084
00:43:13,780 --> 00:43:17,180
And here he is himself, Bob in the flesh.

1085
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,980
Ah yes, Reverend Dapper.

1086
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:25,400
This is my friend, be true, J. Hart.

1087
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:31,480
Now this is a form of Bob that you can actually look at and not have your head explode like this.

1088
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,320
And yet his whole life has led to this moment.

1089
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:38,940
Yes, being at FSA and being called out on this moment by the Ministry of Slack has led to this holy moment.

1090
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:40,600
You cannot fool us, Bob.

1091
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:43,480
Unfortunately...

1092
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:43,800
He laughs!

1093
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:44,200
No!

1094
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,100
He laughs like the granny Bob's would!

1095
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:47,540
He doesn't say a word!

1096
00:43:47,600 --> 00:43:47,720
No!

1097
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:49,720
Come to the camera and show thy grin.

1098
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,160
Unfortunately, Bob...

1099
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:52,320
You can't kill this, Bob, because this is one of the...

1100
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:53,140
We're gonna have to kill you.

1101
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:55,120
This is one of the rare collectible Bobs.

1102
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:55,440
Exactly.

1103
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,300
There are only so many variants and repaints past the original Dobbs.

1104
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,820
Poke Dobs gotta kill them all.

1105
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,260
Poke Dobs.

1106
00:44:03,460 --> 00:44:05,940
And I wish I could hear him, but yet I can't.

1107
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:07,000
I can't bring my...

1108
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:08,820
Why are we speaking so loud?

1109
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:09,160
What?

1110
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:09,420
Huh?

1111
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,840
This is like the classic...

1112
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:14,440
...creckled ginger Dobbs of ancient Lemuria.

1113
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:20,900
So maybe in some form there is some kind of slackful reincarnation for this young chap...

1114
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:23,440
...who hasn't even read the fucking books yet or anything.

1115
00:44:23,700 --> 00:44:24,740
He just knew that...

1116
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:25,800
I have to go here.

1117
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:27,600
I have to spread the word.

1118
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:28,020
There's a rainbow on his hat, right?

1119
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:33,000
I fed him some chicken last night.

1120
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,020
Rainbow in the Dobbs!

1121
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,580
That would be the internal sunshine of the spotless behind.

1122
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,440
Also known as butt hurt cartoon.

1123
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:44,240
The internal sunshine of the spotless shart.

1124
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:48,480
He's a little bit of a chicken with the little

1125
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:48,580
little

1126
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:48,840
little

1127
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,180
little

1128
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:49,440
little

1129
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:49,680
little

1130
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:49,720
little

1131
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:49,720


1132
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:51,680
little

1133
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:51,680


1134
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:51,740
little

1135
00:45:23,780 --> 00:45:30,820
Abraham Lincoln was enjoying a performance of Our American Cousin at Ford's Theater

1136
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:40,580
with his wife Mary Todd, Army Major Henry R. Rathbone, and Rathbone's fiancée Clara Harris

1137
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:48,680
when John Wilkes Booth approached from the rear and fired a .44 caliber bullet into Lincoln's brain.

1138
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:59,180
The president was then carried across the street to the Peterson House, where he was placed on a bed too short for comfortable repose,

1139
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:03,400
as blood and brain tissue seeped from the base of his skull.

1140
00:46:06,260 --> 00:46:13,480
As he lay dying, Lincoln's subconscious turned to the microhela Nepenthecoa,

1141
00:46:14,260 --> 00:46:18,300
and as of then undiscovered species of miniature frog,

1142
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:22,320
which existed on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia.

1143
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:30,000
The adult microhela Nepenthecoa rarely exceeds 12 millimeters in length

1144
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:34,520
and is thought to be the second smallest frog species in existence.

1145
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:41,720
It is named for the plant on which it thrives, the Nepenthes ampullaria,

1146
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:47,560
a carnivorous pitcher plant with liquid-filled cubs attached to tendrils

1147
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:52,980
in which the tadpoles of the microhela Nepenthecoa grow to maturity,

1148
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:58,500
their eggs having been planted on the exterior surface of the plant's cubs.

1149
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:07,120
The adult frogs produce a dissonant rasping sound from dusk into the early evening,

1150
00:47:07,420 --> 00:47:14,000
and this grating frog chorus echoed through what was left of Lincoln's mind during his final hours.

1151
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:17,120
He began to visualize his head,

1152
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,360
and an upper torso he framed on a shiny copper disc.

1153
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:26,760
Peeking over the edge of the disc was a tiny rasping frog,

1154
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:30,320
which made eye contact with him as if to say,

1155
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:32,060
Come join us.

1156
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,840
Meanwhile, somewhere in a Malaysian rain forest,

1157
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:44,160
a pea-sized frog dreamed of staring over a giant copper wall into the eye of a bearded man,

1158
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,560
and the bearded man realized,

1159
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:48,100
that they were being watched.

1160
00:47:58,960 --> 00:48:00,880
The Rooty Schwartz Project

1161
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:00,980
The Rooty Schwartz Project,

1162
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,740
a track called Abe from the year they switched to cornmeal,

1163
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:05,680
Sealand Records,

1164
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,480
before that Ministry of Slack at 14X Day,

1165
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:12,200
before that a bit of collage by Decapitator or The Large,

1166
00:48:12,320 --> 00:48:14,540
I can't quite keep track at this point.

1167
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:15,980
Once they're cut up,

1168
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,320
they sometimes lose their names, the poor things.

1169
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:22,080
But now we return again to The Return of...

1170
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,900
The Return of the Son of Butthurt.

1171
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:28,080
Yes, The Return of the Son of, of the Clone of, of the Mecha...

1172
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,460
The Dawn of Rising of...

1173
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:31,520
Butthurt Part 9, The Gaming.

1174
00:48:31,940 --> 00:48:32,760
This is true.

1175
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:35,280
Butthurt Number 13, Butthurt vs. Santa.

1176
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:40,340
Number 9, Number 9, Butthurt is dead.

1177
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:41,500
Plan Butthurt?

1178
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,380
Planet Butthurt.

1179
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:44,480
8 is not enough.

1180
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,600
Ah yes, Plan Butthurt.

1181
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,160
Butthurt 13, Butthurt in the Ghetto.

1182
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:50,480
The system by which you make people flame out and hate themselves

1183
00:48:50,480 --> 00:48:52,980
and prolapse from so much butthurt.

1184
00:48:53,140 --> 00:48:53,600
Exactly.

1185
00:48:54,160 --> 00:48:57,560
Using reanimated bodies of dead subgeniuses.

1186
00:48:57,560 --> 00:48:57,700
And that's what we're talking, folks.

1187
00:48:57,960 --> 00:48:59,260
You get prolapsed.

1188
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:00,540
That's all we're asking.

1189
00:49:00,780 --> 00:49:03,580
It's a distance contest of prolapses.

1190
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,060
Exactly.

1191
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,160
Unless that's taking it too far.

1192
00:49:06,280 --> 00:49:09,480
Just make a raspberry of your mind, people.

1193
00:49:10,060 --> 00:49:12,020
What does that even mean, 80s?

1194
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,820
No, make a rosebud of your mind.

1195
00:49:13,820 --> 00:49:17,080
One rose配せ sweet raspberry the rosebud!

1196
00:49:17,180 --> 00:49:25,260
The final episode after marketers she was honest all at it

1197
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:26,060
was a successful yes.

1198
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:26,080
Use following classicalliftback at the end if you like.

1199
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:26,080


1200
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:28,220
Like a Şey Ass.

1201
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,220


1202
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,220


1203
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,220


1204
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,220


1205
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,220


1206
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,220


1207
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,220


1208
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,220


1209
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:28,240
bodysuit voice

1210
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:29,560
Art Busy

1211
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:43,800
We won the fight back at normal were we were?

1212
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:42,820
How was that?

1213
00:50:24,840 --> 00:50:29,420
Yes, something called Outmouth did that track there.

1214
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,160
They, or it, remain mysterious to us.

1215
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:38,880
To come, more live X-Day Ministry of Slack and Dr. Howell and Collarges by the large.

1216
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:50,260
But the important thing you should know is that this is the Hour of Slack, number 1,336 from the Church of the Subgenius, www.subgenius.com.

1217
00:50:50,520 --> 00:51:04,440
To learn more about our books and DVDs and such, or for the prisoners out there, post office box 181-417, Cleveland Heights, Ohio, 44118.

1218
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:08,340
We have a lot of listeners in prisons. I'm not surprised.

1219
00:51:09,480 --> 00:51:14,520
When I hear that whistle blowin', I hang my head and cry.

1220
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:19,880
Now back to the Ministry of Slack as the whiskey really kicks in.

1221
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:23,420
There is no, the end times are flushed away.

1222
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:28,680
We have got exactly 11 and a half, maybe 12 minutes.

1223
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,500
You know how I know I'm a subgenius?

1224
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:36,780
Because I have like 42 eardrums and I can focus on every single thing you guys are saying simultaneously.

1225
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:37,780
It's true.

1226
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:38,480
I am a superior.

1227
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:41,620
You're asking how much change you will have in my pocket right now.

1228
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,360
You are right.

1229
00:51:43,360 --> 00:51:45,820
It's slightly correct, brothers and sisters.

1230
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,600
Can I get a praise Bob?

1231
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:48,900
Praise Bob!

1232
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:49,460
Yeah!

1233
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:53,000
They've bought it hook, line, and sinker.

1234
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,980
I will sell you this empty beer can for 78 cents, my friend.

1235
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:56,900
Oh, really?

1236
00:51:57,220 --> 00:51:58,780
Hey, that's a hell of a deal.

1237
00:51:58,980 --> 00:52:00,840
To an all-you-can-eat buffet in Ethiopia.

1238
00:52:01,840 --> 00:52:02,880
Just $1.

1239
00:52:04,040 --> 00:52:07,920
I'll send you, I'll sell you a scaled model of Ruby Ridge.

1240
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:08,840
Complete with...

1241
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:09,440
A little explosion.

1242
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,060
Oh, man!

1243
00:52:10,060 --> 00:52:10,720
Never again!

1244
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:14,740
I'm gonna talk to you about Bob.

1245
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:15,240
Psh!

1246
00:52:15,460 --> 00:52:17,720
Big Bob will smack you up so hard.

1247
00:52:18,040 --> 00:52:19,340
And I said, Big Bob's the truth.

1248
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:19,740
Okay.

1249
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:21,880
And I said, Big Bob's the truth.

1250
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:22,280
Okay.

1251
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:32,020
Look at me!

1252
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:37,220
Oh, here he is, Big Bob.

1253
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:38,320
He's always in the streets, huh?

1254
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:49,600
Oh, okay, okay.

1255
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:51,560
That guy in the little car, yeah?

1256
00:52:53,060 --> 00:52:53,840
Big Bob!

1257
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:56,940
Welcome to the bigness.

1258
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:57,840
Yeah, yeah.

1259
00:52:58,460 --> 00:52:59,700
Welcome to the bigness.

1260
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:00,600
Yeah, yeah.

1261
00:53:02,540 --> 00:53:03,300
Goin' down, Bob.

1262
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:05,500
I'm gonna butt-hurt you guys, like, sometimes.

1263
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:08,480
Not that we're not hiding in the internet.

1264
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:08,860
Not that we're not hiding in the internet.

1265
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:08,860


1266
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:08,860


1267
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:08,860


1268
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:08,860


1269
00:53:08,860 --> 00:53:08,860


1270
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:10,040
We're all gathered here together.

1271
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:10,340


1272
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,260
We can see each other.

1273
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:11,920
We can see each other.

1274
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,500
I have a secret.

1275
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:13,380
We can slug each other.

1276
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,100
Ooh, Puppets has got a secret?

1277
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:16,860
I'm going to lay out the butthurt.

1278
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:17,460
Come on, baby.

1279
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:18,080
Do it.

1280
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:19,740
Let the butthurt flow.

1281
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:23,460
I just get up and I walk away and I come back 45 minutes later.

1282
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,000
What was that about?

1283
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:26,240
Did you just talk about talking?

1284
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:31,000
She always gives an excuse like, oh, I need to give Legume his cream.

1285
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,780
I need to go make dinner.

1286
00:53:34,180 --> 00:53:38,260
The little monkeys are running around naked, but we know that she just needs a break.

1287
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,260
I need a break from us.

1288
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:41,420
I need a break from all your slag.

1289
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,680
It overwhelms me.

1290
00:53:43,140 --> 00:53:43,700
It's true.

1291
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,440
It's intoxicating.

1292
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,780
It's why we keep doing this.

1293
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:47,240
Exactly.

1294
00:53:47,360 --> 00:53:49,580
We just keep coming back to each other over and over.

1295
00:53:49,660 --> 00:53:56,040
It's like why you go to that XXX adult theater off on Highway 3.

1296
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:57,160
I can't quit you guys.

1297
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,640
I leave and I come back and I come back.

1298
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:03,640
This is all about my sweetheart.

1299
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,060
This is for Lizzie Borda.

1300
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,000
So you can hear the lyrics now.

1301
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:15,940
Crash party at 12.

1302
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:17,960
I'll see you at 12 and raise your 20s.

1303
00:54:18,060 --> 00:54:20,100
I love my beautiful wife.

1304
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:23,320
But she's got no tongue.

1305
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:27,300
And just the other day she said.

1306
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:30,680
Honey, I love you.

1307
00:54:33,640 --> 00:54:34,320
Yeah.

1308
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:35,060
Yeah.

1309
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:37,960
Damn.

1310
00:54:38,260 --> 00:54:39,560
I don't want to take it away.

1311
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:43,120
I don't know why.

1312
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:47,480
Pimples and braces.

1313
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:55,080
And for those who are listening by radio, it is truly brutal.

1314
00:54:58,260 --> 00:55:01,040
I have to make a plug for one of our regular businesses.

1315
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:02,660
Pee Pants Pizza.

1316
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,660
Killing and killing and killing.

1317
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:04,600
Pee Pants Pizza.

1318
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,120
The pizza that keeps you wanting to urinate.

1319
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,180
You can pick it up.

1320
00:55:08,260 --> 00:55:09,120
At your local Hovermart.

1321
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:10,060
Hovermart.

1322
00:55:10,220 --> 00:55:12,520
For all your subgenius and hovering needs.

1323
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,640
Good old Hovermart.

1324
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:17,280
I haven't heard from now.

1325
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:18,920
Now available at Hovermart.

1326
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:19,780
The best stuff.

1327
00:55:19,780 --> 00:55:20,560
The Ministry of Slack.

1328
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,460
When you came to Asteria.

1329
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:23,780
There's no Hovermart there.

1330
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:24,980
Located 1,000 miles.

1331
00:55:24,980 --> 00:55:26,340
Do not play this tape.

1332
00:55:26,380 --> 00:55:28,480
While you are submersed in water.

1333
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,980
Do not play this tape.

1334
00:55:30,180 --> 00:55:32,440
While you are cooking back baking in Canada.

1335
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,780
Do not play this tape.

1336
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:35,640
While you are cooking camel soup.

1337
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,040
Do not play this tape.

1338
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,060
While you are reading.

1339
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:38,780
Religious material.

1340
00:55:39,140 --> 00:55:40,300
Do not play this tape.

1341
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,180
While you are...

1342
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:43,240
After the Ministry of Slack,

1343
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:45,200
there of course also is Grindhouse Movies

1344
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:47,160
every single night this year.

1345
00:55:47,160 --> 00:55:47,900
Every single minute.

1346
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,540
Every single night there will be grind...

1347
00:55:50,540 --> 00:55:53,700
really awesomely bad movies down the hill.

1348
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:56,960
Also, for those of you who prefer a more

1349
00:55:57,720 --> 00:55:59,300
automotive related experience,

1350
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:02,220
there is a drive-in that will be played tonight.

1351
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:03,880
Dr. Dark's Drive-In.

1352
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:06,520
I don't remember exactly what the films are, Dr. Dark.

1353
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,240
The Imaginarium of Dr. Dark.

1354
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,160
Dr. Dark's Drive-In.

1355
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,180
Big Man in Japan?

1356
00:56:14,560 --> 00:56:15,180
Okay.

1357
00:56:15,320 --> 00:56:18,900
Friends, if you've never seen or heard of Big Man Japan,

1358
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:22,560
you don't want to miss it.

1359
00:56:22,660 --> 00:56:23,040
You owe it to yourself.

1360
00:56:23,040 --> 00:56:27,440
It's like a Japanese monster movie as done by David Lynch.

1361
00:56:27,540 --> 00:56:30,500
It's an existential Japanese monster movie.

1362
00:56:30,620 --> 00:56:32,460
And this version, it has subtitles

1363
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:35,740
so you can actually understand what they're saying,

1364
00:56:35,780 --> 00:56:37,780
unlike Philo Drummond's copy.

1365
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:43,400
I believe the other film is the Lost Skeleton of Kadavra.

1366
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,400
Isn't it the sequel to the Lost Skeleton of Kadavra?

1367
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:48,000
Or maybe even the sequel to the sequel?

1368
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,440
The Lost Skeleton Returns Again.

1369
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:53,160
The Lost Skeleton Returns Again.

1370
00:56:53,620 --> 00:56:56,700
Well, I guess that skeleton wasn't that lost then, was it?

1371
00:56:56,800 --> 00:57:00,700
There's only really two movies out there in which the sequel was better than the original.

1372
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:05,520
One being Terminator Judgment Day and the other, of course, being the Lost Skeleton.

1373
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,720
Oh, come on. What about The Godfather?

1374
00:57:07,720 --> 00:57:09,760
What about One Million Years B.C.?

1375
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:11,180
That's not a science fiction film. I'm talking sci-fi.

1376
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:11,920
No, Aliens.

1377
00:57:11,960 --> 00:57:14,720
Oh, see? Aliens was a very creditable sequel, too.

1378
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,800
I thought the first one was better than the sequel. It was a credible sequel.

1379
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:21,500
Yeah, but the sequel expanded the first one instead of starting chopping away at it.

1380
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:25,500
Well, the first one would have been better as well if they had followed the original script.

1381
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:29,380
They did leave a few of the really gross scenes out, if you can imagine.

1382
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,080
It was planned to be worse.

1383
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,460
And now you see us standing naked before you,

1384
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:37,620
revealed as nerds, talking about our favorite scenes in monster movies.

1385
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:39,800
Well, you better get used to it.

1386
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:42,360
Because that's the way it's gonna be from now on.

1387
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,560
And, of course, you don't, at the actual X Day event,

1388
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:52,640
the pink conspiracy dupes, they'll go charging into a trash bin

1389
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:57,880
in order to retrieve the gum in which Arnold Schwarzenegger has spit out and sell it on eBay.

1390
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,720
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1391
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:00,760
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1392
00:58:01,120 --> 00:58:03,640
Big Bob is here! Big Bob is here!

1393
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,400
Big Bob!

1394
00:58:07,720 --> 00:58:08,520
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1395
00:58:09,340 --> 00:58:10,560
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1396
00:58:11,720 --> 00:58:14,120
Dude, you look like a high school sinner!

1397
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,080
Do you think you are?

1398
00:58:15,300 --> 00:58:16,660
This grumpy star!

1399
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:18,020
Big Bob is no joke!

1400
00:58:18,340 --> 00:58:19,100
No joke!

1401
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:20,340
Ha ha ha ha!

1402
00:58:20,840 --> 00:58:22,360
Ha ha ha ha!

1403
00:58:24,300 --> 00:58:26,480
Big Bob! It's a pro-

1404
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,020
Big Bob! It's a pro-

1405
00:58:29,020 --> 00:58:31,380
Big Bob! It's a pro-

1406
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:33,640
Big Bob! It's a pro-

1407
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:37,140
It's Bob Manny!

1408
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:51,000
Give church money.

1409
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,760
Bring him here! Come here!

1410
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,560
I want to talk to you!

1411
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:05,380
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, show's breaking down!

1412
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,720
And yet we will still continue talking and blabbing on endlessly.

1413
00:59:11,940 --> 00:59:17,080
I just got raped in prison, cause that's the way I'm living.

1414
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:25,000
Yes, the home ministry of SLAT could die right now from a matriculation, brothers and sisters, but we continue on!

1415
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:29,380
We have gone to the toilet, ladies and gentlemen, and it is all ending now.
