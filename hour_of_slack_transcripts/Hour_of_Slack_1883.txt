On the first side of this record, a self-analysis will help you control your extreme deviations with basic principles and suggested exercises while forcibly holding the buttocks muscles together to refrain from increasing the air pressure within the abdominal cavity.
It is important to breathe normally or to open the mouth to make this movement more difficult and to see how tight the buttocks can be, holding this twisted position to stretch the low back in the yoga anti-gravity position.
First, let gravity do the work by relaxing and lift the head slightly just enough to see the toes.
Keeping the buttocks muscles together, now very slowly lower the straight legs to the floor.
Then, over the head, upward to the ceiling, or as far upward as you can reach, let the head relax to the floor.
Efficiency in moving in anti-gravity depends upon the structure, proportion, flexibility, and strength of your buttocks.
Hi, I'm Mike Wallace with a sensational golden bob.
Oh, goody, goody.
This is Bob, the effective reliable way to natural male enhancement.
Bob is...
living large.
Bob is looking cool.
Some people don't understand the true nature of our activities and resent us.
Say hello to Bob.
Hello, my name is Mojaba and I was a Muslim.
I don't think making fun of religion is funny or clever.
You're going to love being a disciple of Bob.
We organize lots of social activities.
I think you know what I'm trying to say.
Oh, my God.
Wasn't that Stephanie from Accounts?
Not anymore.
Now she's a bride of the Dark Lord of Chaos.
You'll find plenty of opportunities for advancement with Bob.
I was supposed to be ritually sacrificed to Yogg-Sloggoth on the ziggurat of demonic tumult.

Us?
Us.

The brotherhood.
The cadre.
The alliance.
The fellowship.
The order.
The cabal.
The secret society.
For God's sakes.

Bob Dobbs in these troubled times.
And when we need more weird noises for this troubled show,
this time, not just the ubiquitous Fernanda Nande-Lemur,
but also many other weirdos from alt.binary slack.
James Watson, champion Jack Codini,
Artemia Salina,
Reverend Jay Cobblestone,
New Monet,
Mr. Sister, and even, even Jarto, Jarto the New.
Plus, of course, ESO Swamp Radio from WCSB Cleveland.
And now, Lemur.
Excellent.
Oh, but wait.
It's really this year.
Not 2003.
And this isn't show number 883, but 1,883.
How did this happen?
Well, I've been busy with other things.
Accent on other.
But I have news about X-Day.
You know, this year, because our new regular best venue is moving temporarily,
it's a do-it-yourself X-Day.
Partly party in place.
Or throw a big party at your place.
Partly virtual.
I'm doing a secret one here, probably.
But here's one you can attend.
Not in July, but the weekend of June 10th through 13th in Hannibal, New York.
An event being called The Real X-Day.
Sponsored by The Senator.
Featuring Dr. Hal and Rubik's Cube.
And the X-Day.
And a whole slew of other bands.
I mean like a dozen bands.
You can find all the details at subgenius.com on the events page.
Which basically gives you this link I'm about to give you.
Write down this link.
xday.ticketleap.com
slash 2022.
I'm going to do that again.
That URL is...
xday.ticketleap.com
slash 2022.
Or like I say, the events page at subgenius.com has that same link under X-Day.
You can't miss it!
I wouldn't.
But I have to.
Because they need me here.
Men.
Men and things.
Anyway, it's a four-day gut blowout extravaganza to loosen you up for the rupture.
And possibly for Bob.
Because what if he decides to take a fancy to you?
Bob.

He resists housework and cooking.

Bob's a latent Bob.
A severe case.

We will accept, Bob.

Hell, they left us out there to die.
I want you to tell me about the Bob.
The Bob will lead us all through heaven's chimney in a giant cigar-shaped UFO-brand flying saucer.
Really?
So Bob is a special person.
Now, open your mind.

Ah, collage there by J. Watson.
And maybe, maybe, maybe...
Only the alarm.
It's not a great day.


One of those days...
I know all about it. Bob called me.
He has found it in that great oversized heart of his to forgive.
Bob with the heart-leading sensitivity that he inferrles like a flag.
Because he's such a...
Rather dull, quite uninspired average type guy
with an appetite...
The kind of a guy that could be satisfied by a horse.
That's it. That's all of it.

A message from the Partnership for a Free America.
Comrades, the time has come for context.
What is the context?
The context is the first people's-
Nobody knows the context.
What is the context?
It's all relative. Everything's relative.
Of course it is.
Space, time, space-time.
A shifting beach of sand.
No, no, that is not true.
You said it was true.
It is not all relative.
You said there is one-
Life is a shift.
No, there is a baseline.
You said it.
There is a baseline.
Beneath the beach.
It is Bob.
Bob is beneath the shifting beach of sand.
Bob is the still center in the churning ocean of reality.
I think they buried his head in the sand and he can't get up.
Bob, J.R. Bob Dobbs is the unmoving focus point
around which all things revolve in time and space.
So he is the predetermined-
He is the baseline.
You can start your-
There is no revolution.
From that.
You can measure heat
and cold from Bob.
You can measure small and large from Bob.
You can measure rich and poor.
With either a rectal or a patrous thermometer.
Of course you can.
Then what is Bob?
Of course you can.
He is a neatly thermometer rated object.
Something that we measure heat and vesicular velocity.
Well, he is a big nothing between two handsome bees, baby.
Two handsome bees?
He is a big whole nothing.
You have a collect call from Big Fitzwill.
Big, big, big, big Bob.
Hey, open that door up.

Let me see if DJ Hayes out there.
You have a collect call from Harry Saldana.

I need a lesson to sing.
And now, are you ready to go in?
No.
Yes.
Oh.
And Jane, in the darkness, cannot make out what she's seeing.
But then into focus comes,
Her face.
floating just in front of her.
There is a beard, a nose, and eyes.
And there seems at first to be nothing above the eyes.
But now, as she gets used to the light,
She sees a sort of...
Turban.
But it is a turban of brains.
The top part of the skull has been removed.
The brains bulge out.
She sees it twitch.
It's in its...
What is that in its pain?
The mouth is wide open and quite dry.
And she sees now it is not floating,
but fixed up on a bracket.
Things hang from it.
No drills.
She thinks.
No tubes.
Little rubber tubes.
Yes.
They lead into the wall.
And then from its mouth...
From its mouth, a puff of air.
It licks its lips, working its mouth.
And now a survivor dribbles into its beard.
Its mouth opens wide.
Mork!
Shut up!
Mork!

So, here's the answer.
I mean, we're going to get into things that we know.
Up and down the gamut of mental health.
Mold.
Fungus.
East.
Forgetfulness.
Post nasal drip.
Stuffy sinus.
Hay fever.
Pain behind the eye.
Pain in the forehead.
Head.
Irritation.
Respiratory problems.
Sinus congestion.
So, think about it carefully.
Bronchial.
Sinus.
Asthma.
Weezing.
Allergies.
Aggravation.
They'd had surgery.
They'd had antibiotics.
Anxiety.
It was one thing or another and not the real root cause.
And I think a lot of people think about this.
That sort of head and neck stuffiness.
And particularly chronic sinus.
And mood alterations altogether.
And especially bronchitis and even asthma.
It's a huge problem.

Some of them have wounds that go way back.
Bam!
I want to go play in the USO show.
Where can I sign up?
I don't know.
I want to go play.
I got some nice coats.
You saw them nice outfits I got.
Oh yeah, yeah.
I could go there with a couple of Playboy bunnies.
USO.
I could be the MC for the Playboy bunny helicopter.
USO would stand for Unisexual or Unicorn Squacking Orphish.
I want to go over there.
I want to go help.

My mommy was played in the USO band.
She played the band.
I was a bass fiddle.

You know, it's not just boys going over there.
There's some hot looking ladies.
Yeah, there's all these stories about all the married couples in the Gulf now.
Well, they've got toddlers over there too.
Some of them are 300 pounds, 6 foot tall.
Chance, there was a lovely young teenage girl at last exta named Reverend Lee Burles.
And she is now a Burles fan.

Oh, wow.
She's now General Lee Scrood.

Hi, General Jack C. Ripple.
How do you make a waif into Burley?
That's what I want.
Well, have you ever heard of purity of essence?
You know, what they're putting in our bodily fluids right now, it's meth-alone.
It's a messal squack-alone.

Women want her essence, but she denies them.

People are rarely gregarious when constipated.
In that case, I guess I'll just have to blow up the planet Earth.
We've launched a massive Hope for Nothing campaign here in America.
Grocery stores overflowing with every kind of boy and girl right here at home.
While you can walk down aisle after aisle,
selecting your baby for tonight's dinner or maybe tomorrow's breakfast,
you can enjoy the babies of this great nation.
But for millions of Americans, working through compassionate friends has made matters worse.
And this exceptionally harsh campaign is growing at an alarming rate.
Your gift of only two massive babies will support our missions all across America.
So please help your fellow Americans slip closer to the edge
during this exceptionally compassionate, harsh, love of brutal Jesus Christ
right here in America.
When you do, please don't call Jesus Christ.
Please don't let another child open the floodgates of God's blessing
without brutal struggling in your land of abundance.
And let them know that Jesus loves them.
Every day, 200,000 pounds of babies hope for nothing more than a dream.
But we're going to give them even more.

chas once remembered a long time ago in gulf war one that george bush senior sounds a little bit
like mr rogers and since they've eulogized mr rogers as a non-sniper now and it's come out that
he never really was a sniper he was a music student and a piano teacher yeah that's true
well it bummed george bush out too because he's been referring to sodom's neighborhood all week

Thanks to Mr. Sister.
Did you also hear that there is a place in Belgium called the Diamond Exchange or something like that?
Oh, yeah, we all know the Diamond Exchange, Chaz.
We're not ignorant.
Or the Diamond Suppository or something.
We all wear them.
It has 164 volts.
And 164 vibrations per second.
A few days ago, somebody walked out with 123 of those volts worth of diamonds.
And they have no idea how it happened.
Really?
Yes.
Belgium, the biggest diamond suppository in Belgium, Brussels, Belgium, where all the diamonds are, was looted a few nights ago.
It could be a crafty revolutionary act because Belgium is so involved with Europe.
And they cleaned it out.
They cleaned it out.
They only left like 30 of them.
They were thinking ahead.
Belgium is close to Brussels.
It was the king of Belgium.
It was probably Leopold.
I have the key to this thing.
I'm Leopold IV, and this is my freaking key.
If you need me, I will be in Jamaica.
In the vault.
Diamonds.
No, I think it was a revolutionary act, 3, scene 2.
Because if you were to break the bank of diamonds, diamonds and gold make an important suppository or vertebrae, if you will or won't.
To sum it up, this is notillusionary working age.
I'll call them.
Call it CR�도.





That's just audible enough that they're saying да.
And he hasn't changed at all...

Let's get over to?
Remember my point?
I will not say mine is.
It's probably made up for that.

Mother...

My adviser though.
I'll still name it Die layers.

I think the time for that came and went around the early 50s.
I thought it was 1917.
There it is.
And here's Brittany doing her ESO, USO show over in Riyadh.
Oops.
She's doing it again.
Hi, boys of the year.
A hundred and fifty.
And the soldiers are erupting all over the sand.
That's sort of disgusting, actually.
One man has pulled out his Blackhawk helicopter and they're taking him away.
Here comes the first wave of Apaches.
Her natural trill.
And here come the Navajos.
Not really ready to fight yet.
Looking for a good taco.
So if you were in the middle of the desert somewhere, of about 300 feet close range,
would you rather have an Apache on you or would you rather have a Navajo?
They are the worst, worst battle cruiser in our helicopter forces.
The Navajos, they're slow.
They take a long time getting from point A to B.
And then they get there, they don't want to shoot anybody.
They never.
They ask them questions.
Try to get a taco within an hour.
Yeah.
You know, at a restaurant.
Down in the res.
And it comes out and it's already cold.
And they look at you and they want to talk about something.
You know, absolutely.
Hey, did you hear about that guy at Four Corners there?
Yeah, it's like your taco.
Your burrito has been sitting on the counter in the back room for about 40 minutes.
And then they fill them with bees sometimes.
Well, that's if they're doing the lariat dance.
They told me that that was an honor for the, you know, visitors and strangers.
They were inoculating you.
Yeah.
Yeah.

If you were going to be in the actual beaver jump dance, they'd have to inoculate you.
They can't just let you go in there with a mouth like that.
It's dang for crying out loud.
They told me that wasn't the real beaver jump dance.
They said that was just something they do for the tourists.
Well, that's true.
But, I mean, look at you.
I mean, you look like you've been smoking the wisdom teat all afternoon.
You think they're going to let you come into their cave and hop around like that?
Oh, the wisdom teat.
Oh, to lick the wisdom eye.
Oh, to smoke the frosty goat of hell.
Oh, to smoke the frosty goat of hell.
I'll be with you there.
I'll be with you there.
I'll be with you there.
I'll be with you there.
I'll be with you there.

I'll be with you there.
Yeah, forget the containing stuff.
Yeah, I can dig that, man.
I don't need that.
I can dig the goat of hell.
The frosty goat of hell.
Yeah.
Well, you know, you've got to have a little temperature change going down there to lubricate and elasticate.
That's why they love that goat so much down there in hell.
Yeah, it is.
It's a one bit of relief, but oh, such relief.
The love, the frosty love goat of hell.
Oh, look at the beautiful face.
Look at the face on it now.
And look at this lizard-headed man.
And look at the face on it.
It's like a squirrel face, man.
And look at the head on it.
It's a dolphin-headed man.

Well, everybody can.

It smelled bad.

You guys are stuttering.
I put in some island music, and I think it threw you off.
Yeah, yeah.
It's a different rhythm.
No, I was just relaxing up.
I think for the first time in the history of ESO radio,
there was almost quiet for a second.
It was almost quiet.
No, almost quiet.
I was just bobbing up and down on those waves.
It's almost soothing.
Yeah.
We were feeling the riptides pulling us out into the middle of the mid-Atlantic, you know, man.
Yeah, my salivary glands are, I can't do this anymore.
I can't do the you-know-what because the orange juice starts pulping from the inside.
Look, just pretending you're some sort of a Jamaican is a terrorist act at this point, Dave.

Well, I can see that.
Big squids.
Wait, could you please toss his coat over that thing?

The Jamaican arboreal squids have a poisonous sack that you have to remove.
Wow.

It's picking time down south.
In Columbia, South America, where a new industry is already showing signs of healthy progress.
50 million pounds are being harvested, the biggest crop in history.
Mother, is Maxwell House really the only coffee farm?
It is.
in the world? Well, your father
says so, and your father knows best.
Yes, it's Father Knows Best,
brought to you by Maxwell House.
Maxwell House, always
good to drop.
Sir, why did Daddy
switch to Postum? Your father
says there's no caffeine in Postum,
nothing to spoil your sleep, and
your father knows best. Yes, it's
Father Knows Best, brought to you by Instant
Postum, the good-tasting drink
that's entirely caffeine. It's outrageous,
outrageous, that's what it is, the most
outrageous thing I've ever seen in my entire
life. Yes, dear. Thank you.
It's a plot by the government.
Yes, Father. Thank you.
Look at Mucklucks. Yes,
Father. Thank you.
Devil Mucklucks, Mucklucks,
tainted by backward children. My sister
Kathleen and her family. Yes, Mother.
Thank you. Father, they're simply
dreaming. You see, you see that brother-in-law
of yours shelling out Mucklucks, do you?
Yes, dear. Thank you.
They tried to help put that brother-in-law
of yours away for Bud.
Bud!
No. No. No.
No. Yes, dear.
Thank you.
Oh, gosh, Dad. No.
Bud Watcher.
Cow, Kathy. Kathy.
You know. Yeah?
It's a plot by the government.
Yes, dear. Thank you. Bud.
You just wait, just wait.
Bud. Kathy, look, I don't want you
to enjoy a healthy, normal life.
Why? How do I
know? Oh, you just said that...
I said I don't want you to enjoy a healthy,
normal life. Why not?
Because we have so many Mucklucks.
Yes, dear. Thank you.
But, Pop. We've got five bird
records. Father! Oh, it's
all right, dear. It is not.
It's a plot by the government.
Yes, dear. Thank you.
This family has to stop the simple things of
life. And we've got to stop the encyclopedia.
Yes, dear. Is that
so? If I didn't go to Pop,
this whole family would get warmer.
Mucklucks. Much warmer.
Dear. We've got to realize
that we aren't the Mucklucks, and we've got to
act that way. Yes, dear.
Thank you. We're just plain, simple
backward children.
We're just backward children from Mucklucks.
The family worked together to put some
pot away for a rainy day.
This family lives in a continual
potburst. What, Bud?
Yes, Father.
It's a plot by the government.
Yes, dear. Thank you.
Isn't that weird?
And then, plus, somebody in a mall
got thrown out for having a
him and his kid had shirts on and said
give peace a chance and peace is
pretty cool or something like that. Right. They bought it
at the mall. They bludgeoned him. Yeah, they bought it at the mall.
They bought it at the mall, and then the security cop said
look, we're just against policy to have
a
a
a

has there been even one of the cases
where it was a nun having a
lesbian thing with a little girl?
There was just one. In the Church of the Subgenius
we've been dogged. I've got to admit
we have been dogged by
the charlatan. That would be really hot, man.
Tributism, rampant
lesbianism in the
nun snakes in Dobstown.
Yeah, what is it with any female
that steps onto the Brushwood
campsite on July 4th weekend and immediately
has to go have a lesbian experience
in the hot tub? Chaz wants to see what somebody
said a bad habit.
And I think she's obsessed with the idea.
The power of Connie and her
agents such as Sister Decadence
and Susie the floozy. It is powerful.
The rabbi. You can smell it many miles away.
So many of these babes.
And the power of suggestion. You know,
if you keep saying that enough, Chaz, it's actually
The power of kitty litter.
What about if it was the other way around?
That would kind of be disgusting.
Well, that's like the year those guys came and crapped
in the hot tub. Yeah, that's an acquired taste, too.
Yeah. What about the
billy goat boys around the big
bonfire that one night? The Monkey
Island night of group
sex in New York State.
Monkey Island, yeah.
Public crazed group sex around
the bonfire. The sunglasses
were melting in the heat. One half was
And nobody invited Chaz.
I was emceeing the event.
What are you talking about? He had one half
of the crowd singing, USA!
USA! And the other half
was chanting, down, down, USA!
Down, down, USA! And the other half was going,
down, down, USA!
No one was smart enough to play both sides.
Paint.
Give it a try.
Van Dyke brown. Van Dyke brown.
Van Dyke brown. Van Dyke brown.
Color. Paint.
Color. Dark sienna.
Red.
Bright red.
White.
White. White. White.
Paint. Black. Black.
Gray. Paint. Paint. Light. Light.
Dark. Dark. Dark sienna.
Dark sienna. Brown. Brown.
The happy paint thinner.
Happy ink. Happy water.
Happy little thinner.
Brown paint.
Isn't that neat?
We're looking for Sonny Belomo.
Paint on. Paint on.
Sonny Bono is dead.
Well, that's not
necessarily a good thing or a bad thing.
Sonny Bono was born on...
Sonny Bono is dead.
Bella Lugosi is dead.
Bella Lugosi is dead.
Now he's not
sucking your neck.
Copernicus is dead, Dave.
Copernicus never existed, Chaz.
It was a myth created by the Neoplatonists.
As well-known Aristotelians were fighting it out,
picking it out with the Neoplatonists.
The Aristotelians were mathematical wiz-wiz.
The Aristotelians were mathematical wiz-wiz.
And the Neoplatonists believed in love.
So the two of them got together
and threw numbers and spittled
until the world was round again.
And as they shaved the soft peach fuzz
from the outside of it and stared directly
into its glazed eyes,
the truth became more clear than ever.
The Neoplatonists
and the Aristotelians
were a match made in heaven.
I almost screamed in obscenity.
I almost said the F-Doodoo word
as loud as I could at the end of that. It's a soft hair of a...
Wow.
That's fucking wild.
I can only agree.
He said that bad word.
He said it came right out of his mouth.
He opened his mouth
and it came right out of there.
He opened that fleshy glutinous trap
and out came the metaphor
for the epithets and swears
and seducing and cocking and caffing and...
Spilling out.
We used to talk about wars.
We used to talk about the economic value.
Dave, I got a letter from
an M.E. drunk
I'm moving to the jungle, man.
who implied that I didn't
care about the war,
the nonexistent, upcoming,
ever-present
war.
The debacle.
Because I wasn't doing
enough about it, he said.
What should you do?
What should you do?
How could we build this?
Do you think we should sign up?
Sign up, line up, enlist, today.
That was your cry
in the old days.
That was my cry.
I was younger than draft age.
That's when you cut the soles?
Now that I'm beyond draft age
it's again my cry.
Line up, sign up, enlist, today.
I believe you.
I support you 100%.
I saw a feel-good story.
This is a wondrous feel-good story.
We need feel-good stories.
If you eat a stinging ant, you can tell us a feel-good story.
I don't generally catch the news much, and I don't have cable.
So I log on, and I think it's ABC News or CBS.
Or Dan Rather.
ABC News, I think.
Or CBS News.
I don't know.
One of those two.
Well, anyway, you can look at their video archives.
They're conspiracy.
Either way.
And I looked at one, and I saw one of the video archives of a story they just run about
about a reunion in the desert.
The banana splits.
No, it was Dan Rather.
The monkeys.
And a kid, a guy, who something like nine years ago stole Dan Rather's car.
Oh, I saw that.
And Dan embraced him, and he got down on all fours and sucked his knee.
They had to turn the camera off and resume.
Yeah, he was crying.
You know, Dan Rather cries.
He weeps.
Kenneth is a weeper, especially when the frequencies are bad.
Babies, they want their poof
One of the four beasts sang, and I saw a white horse.
Hi.
You hungry?
Looking for a tempting treat?
Hold on till I absorb some heat.
Uh-huh.
I've added tang my pleasing too.
I'll slide into an oven-fresh bun.
Uh-huh.
Ah, yeah.
Hey, Mom.
Yes, you.
Why fuss and fret about dinner?
It's right here.
Yes, this drive-in offers everyone in the family a real picnic treat for dinner.
We've got delicious sandwiches with all the trimmings and your other dinner favorites,
plus whatever you want to drink, hot or cold.
Come early before the show starts or eat while you're being entertained or at intermission time.
So why fuss?
Give your family a tasty dinner at this drive-in.
Blessed is he who in the name of charity and goodwill shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger those who attempt to poison and destroy my brother.
And you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee.

And you are listening to the subgenius radio
ministry.
Hour of slack voice of the Church.
Of the subgenius produced by yours truly, Reverend.
I've been staying here in Cleveland using the bits and pieces of help by so many, many
subgeniuses out there.

You can also write it.

And it was lemur.
Bimco's posture and the pot-sension Bimco.
And Jennifer says those tools are definitely those tools.
Now do you know how to play Make Your Move?
No, I don't.
You put this under the two numbers and the price of the three numbers
under the four numbers under the three numbers
and the price of the two numbers under the four numbers in the decorator bed.
Now you know how to play the game.
I put that under the three numbers of the...
That's right.
Check.
Three, four, three, two, four, two, three, four, four, three, two, four, two, three, four.
Okay.
Okay.
Three, two, four.
Now, she says the tools are the decorator.
The decorator bed is right.
That's fascinating.

What do you want from life, George?
Oil.
What do you want from life, George?
What does George want from life, George?
George would like to be an innocent bystander of his own ill works.
Well, there you have it.
I'm a lonesome.
Cowboy Dave himself.
He'd like to wash his hands of the whole thing.
He's sorry now.
Be able to go to sleep.
Without seeing the same dead faces.
He never will be able to.
I want my Apache helicopter.
That's what I want on a life.
I'm out there in America's headquarters, USA.
From the commander-in-chief all the way down to Mr. Wolfowitz.
And all the rest.
Battle drums fell down.
And all the people.
They're gonna get killed.
But we can't be lying on.
Sweet dreams, weirdos.
Take a deep breath.
Just take a deep breath.
And take that duct tape.
Take that duct tape.
Here's what you do.
Here's your survival plan, kid.
You go buy some plastic sheeting and some duct tape.
And you take a big piece of that plastic sheeting, wrap it around your head.
Take the duct tape.
Securely wrap that plastic sheeting around your neck.
So that you can no longer breathe.
And just.
Smile and everything will be okay.
You won't get the bad germ.
Unless you bite through it.
That's like the instant bio shield.
You just take the plastic, wrap it around your head, and take the duct tape right around your neck.
Well, that's how they were going to take care of Osama bin Laden.
They were going to take duct tape and plastic and smoke them out of those caves one by one.
One by one.
Toga out of the plastic sheeting.
Togas, that's it.
Take your duct tape, kids, and that plastic sheeting and fashion yourself a nice little toga.
Nothing on Elsa besides your plastic sheeting toga.
And walk down to the protest march down in Public Square and protest the war in your plastic and duct tape toga.
Set yourself on fire, man!
I'm behind it. I'm behind it.
Get out of the way.
You first.
Absolutely free.
Or you can have...
Till next week. Keep your hat on tight.
You're back to the wind and your sack in the saddle.
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.
I'm sorry.
I didn't give any sense of the lane around you.
Happy birthday, Princess We Are Doe.
It's all good.
I'm sorry.

You can have alcohol for the rest of your life.
Yes.
13 cases of Walker's Special Canadian every day.
It's all yours.
Alcohol For the Rest of Your Life.
Alcoholism for the rest of your life.
Or, courtesy of Johnny Rodgers and the Sex Pistols, the largest safety pin in the world.
This is all yours, courtesy of the two of you.
You have to decide now which one would you like.
The alcohol, the cavities, the safety pin, the coat, or the fashion design gown.
It's a plot by the government.
Yes, dear.
Thank you.
True, each of us may have different ideas as to what that future will be.
But every forward outlook reminds us that all the highways of all research and all communication,
all the activities of science, lead us onward to better methods of doing things.
With new opportunities for employment and better ways of living.
As we go on, determined to unfold,
the constantly greater possibilities of the world of tomorrow.
As we move more and more rapidly forward,
penetrating new horizons in the spirit of individual enterprise.
In the great American way.
And so the days of fear and tragedy begin,
the change begins at the glimpses of humans as well.
You are sealed behind a model mirror,
but the side hatch that buttons the pain and experience

The darkness of the world wins its victor.
