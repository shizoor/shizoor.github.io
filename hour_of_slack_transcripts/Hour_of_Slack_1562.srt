1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:11,640
The Soul Genius Power of Slack

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,640
What foolishness.

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,200
True.

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:15,640
No.

5
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,160
Yes.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:16,580
No.

7
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:17,920
Yes.

8
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:18,200
No.

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,900
Without question.

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,140
No.

11
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:22,460
Not to the soul.

12
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:29,800
Ah, yes, dear friends, this is Hour of Slack number 1080.

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,340
And I am your host and prayer partner, Reverend Ivan Stang.

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:41,500
This week, I got a couple of emails saying, when are you going to start broadcasting Hour of Slack again?

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:50,280
I guess the ancient reruns that I've been using to save time while working on the subgenius history course with MaybeLogic.org

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:58,020
were so ancient that people didn't recognize any of the voices and really didn't understand that those were hours of Slack they were hearing.

17
00:00:58,080 --> 00:00:59,780
It's just that they were hours.

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,820
It's just that they were hours of Slack from, like, 1982, before there was an hour of Slack.

19
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:11,180
Friends, it was me and Philo and Dr. Howell and Puzzlin and so forth.

20
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,960
It's just that we were babies, like most of you are now, in our early 20s.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,340
And I don't really believe that we were ever so young either.

22
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,580
But tonight, we go back to being old.

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,100
That is, new.

24
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:29,720
This is part of a five-hour epic.

25
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,460
Live show we recorded on January 10th at KPFA Studios in Berkeley.

26
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:41,080
With over-the-edge host Izzy Isn't, heard in the background here, of Negative Land.

27
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:45,880
And Puzzling Evidence host Doug Wellman of Wellman Headland.

28
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:51,700
These sound more like the Hour of Slack you're used to, although they are not actually that.

29
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:59,780
Subgenius doctors participating included Dr. Howell, Puzzling Evidence, Philo Drummond, yours truly, Reverend John Shirley.

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:08,360
Gary Gabrofan, Michael Pepe, Princess We Are Go, Chaos McBobcat Drummond, Phineas Narco, K-Rob, somebody named Walter,

31
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:15,020
the uber-goober-boobie-baby, and Bishop Joey from the First Church of the Last Laugh.

32
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,240
Some of us got their light, friends.

33
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:28,600
So, when this annual subgenius business meeting begins, the only stockholders present are Izzy Isn't, Puzzling Evidence,

34
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,600
Cyberpunk,

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:35,980
author, Reverend John Shirley, Dr. Gary Gabrofan, Phineas Narco, and Bishop Joey.

36
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:40,500
Also known as Ed Holmes of the San Francisco Mime Troupe.

37
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,580
The music in the background right now is from the new Amino Acids album due out June 2007.

38
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:53,940
The Amino Acids album called Humanity Will Fall Like Pins.

39
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:59,360
You can look at theaminoacids.com or their MySpace page.

40
00:02:59,500 --> 00:02:59,980
I'm Ed Holmes.

41
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,820
You may not play all five hours of the five-hour show in order over the next five weeks,

42
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:12,920
but until my subgenius history course is over on the 25th, I'm still ball to the wall.

43
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,220
And so, onward, subgenius soldiers marching as to Walmart.

44
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,960
The Amino Acids album called Humanity Will Fall Like Pins.

45
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,820
It has taken them the full two months to get ready.

46
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,160
Today is X-Day.

47
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,480
It is now HR minus 59 minutes.

48
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:09,680
There is less than an hour left.

49
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,140
There can be no margin for error.

50
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:15,300
There can be no second chance.

51
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:24,380
Well, good hello, everyone.

52
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,600
Everyone.

53
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,160
This, uh...

54
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,800
This is not...

55
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:34,960
This is not the first Thursday of every month at midnight.

56
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,040
Ouch.

57
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,240
And, uh...

58
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:40,780
It is I.

59
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,720
It is I, the over-the-edge guy.

60
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,840
Izzy isn't.

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:44,900
But, um...

62
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,100
It's not quite over the edge, either.

63
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,680
It's, uh...

64
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:54,520
A special, unscheduled broadcast of over-the-edge and the subgenius.

65
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,320
The Church of the Subgenius Foundation Incorporated are all here.

66
00:04:59,420 --> 00:04:59,940
And we're all here.

67
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:01,500
We're all going to do five hours together.

68
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,220
All together.

69
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:02,980
Right here.

70
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,060
And that's what we're doing.

71
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,820
So it's not this and it's not that.

72
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,240
It's both.

73
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:16,200
To a place where men satisfy their bloodlust by hunting human quarry.

74
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:23,400
All right, gentlemen.

75
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,300
Ready for testing.

76
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,600
Put on your headphones.

77
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,920
And, uh...

78
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,920
Pick up a microphone.

79
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,680
Pick up a microphone.

80
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,260
Bob.

81
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,120
I hate Bob.

82
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,860
I love Bob.

83
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,580
I love Bob.

84
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,700
You want to sit in here with us?

85
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:43,720
I love Bob.

86
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:45,720
But that's not Bob.

87
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,960
That's Ed Horne from the Church of the Subgenius.

88
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:49,380
No.

89
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:49,920
No.

90
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:51,380
It's...

91
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:53,740
You know who?

92
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,060
Now, I have decided unilaterally...

93
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:56,640
Yeah, go ahead.

94
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,960
...to name this show...

95
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,900
Unibilaterally?

96
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,040
Unilaterally?

97
00:05:59,300 --> 00:05:59,780
Unilaterally?

98
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,360
...the New Year's Revolution Show.

99
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:03,700
Now, what does that mean?

100
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:08,540
Uh, that means we have to spin around in a Gregorian manner.

101
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:15,840
Well, according to my script, it will be explained later on.

102
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:16,940
Okay.

103
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,220
I don't know what...

104
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,540
Where...

105
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,340
Where...

106
00:06:28,340 --> 00:06:28,640
Where...

107
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:28,800
Where...

108
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,760


109
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,760


110
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,760


111
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,760


112
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,760


113
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,760


114
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,760


115
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,760


116
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,760


117
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,760


118
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,760


119
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,760


120
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:29,760


121
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,500
Where is Dr. Hal?

122
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,280
Dr. Hal?

123
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,340
Uh, we buried him, I think, last week.

124
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,520
Ladies and gentlemen, we'd like...

125
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:48,900
We regret to inform you that Dr. Hal has passed away almost a week ago today.

126
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:53,000
And he will no longer grace this...

127
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,440
The big fat chairs of the subgenius.

128
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,380
Well, actually, we did bring him in because he wasn't smelling that bad...

129
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,640
...since it's been very cold.

130
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,680
...since it's been very cold outside lately.

131
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,080
So we got that cold snap, so...

132
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,580
Oh, I see him, yes.

133
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,360
So, yeah, so we just propped him in the thing.

134
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,320
And because he's such a motor mouth...

135
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:06,980
I like that.

136
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:07,740
He's still talking.

137
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,500
He's still talking.

138
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:08,940
I mean...

139
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:09,380
I like it.

140
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:09,480
I like it.

141
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:11,640
We just have to push the microphone real close.

142
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,560
We're trying to get a microphone jacked just right into his jaw.

143
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:16,020
I like the glazed look.

144
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,480
Yeah.

145
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:16,860
Uh-huh.

146
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,400
So, yeah, we can squeeze another show out of Dr. Hal.

147
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:21,740
His...

148
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,900
His cooling carcass.

149
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,520
Yeah, just a few electrical shocks.

150
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:27,300
You put it...

151
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,400
Apply a few electrical shocks.

152
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:29,760
Yeah.

153
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:29,760


154
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:29,760


155
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:29,760


156
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:29,760


157
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,680
...and there'll be an automatic reaction, in his case, talking.

158
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,320
That's right.

159
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,000
And Gaborofram is here with his jumper cables of love.

160
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,000
Meh!

161
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,360
Meh.

162
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,540
What happened to...

163
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,040
Where's...

164
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:45,960
Where's Bug Girl?

165
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:47,500
Where's Bug Girl?

166
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,840
Is that Bug Girl?

167
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:54,220
Oh, no, Bug Girl is not coming, is she?

168
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:58,220
Not till she sees you, Don.

169
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,180
Oh, no.

170
00:07:59,260 --> 00:07:59,740
Oh, no.

171
00:07:59,740 --> 00:07:59,740


172
00:07:59,740 --> 00:07:59,740


173
00:07:59,740 --> 00:07:59,740


174
00:07:59,740 --> 00:07:59,740


175
00:07:59,740 --> 00:07:59,740


176
00:07:59,740 --> 00:07:59,740


177
00:07:59,740 --> 00:07:59,740


178
00:07:59,740 --> 00:07:59,740


179
00:07:59,740 --> 00:07:59,740


180
00:07:59,740 --> 00:07:59,740


181
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,500
I'm going to come here next month.

182
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,160
I'm going to pick her up, because otherwise...

183
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:11,320
This is for you, Cady, you're gonna make a success Spotify.

184
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:11,860
Stop right there, cue.

185
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:18,380
...and then it's history's call just be that...

186
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,620
Oh.

187
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:19,920
Oh, no.

188
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:25,280
No, translate.

189
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:26,260
Please translate.

190
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,360
Is this advisor wheels?

191
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,800
Would that be okay?

192
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:27,880


193
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:29,720
Just a little.

194
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:29,740
...t官.

195
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,200
he has so much slack.

196
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,300
He has three pairs

197
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,160
at the cleaner.

198
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,600
He has so much,

199
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,020
so many slacks

200
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,160
and so much slack

201
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:41,920
in Cleveland.

202
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,600
Is he still in Cleveland?

203
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,180
Yes.

204
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:46,620
Oh.

205
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,840
Why?

206
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:48,880
Why is anybody

207
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,700
still in Cleveland?

208
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,400
I understand

209
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,720
it's the most

210
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,540
violent city

211
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,220
in America.

212
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:54,920
Really?

213
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:55,700
Yeah.

214
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,100
But see,

215
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,800
the reason is

216
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,420
that the Reverend

217
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,360
Stang

218
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,100
is there

219
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:00,280
he sucks

220
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,520
all the slack

221
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,640
from everybody else

222
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,740
and there's

223
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:05,680
an umbrella

224
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:06,240
of peace

225
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:06,920
around him.

226
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,100
But everybody else

227
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,140
in consequence

228
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,040
you know

229
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,260
stresses up

230
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,440
and they begin

231
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,120
to throttle

232
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,660
one another.

233
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,380
Well there it is.

234
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,560
He's a slack sucker.

235
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,180
Uh-huh.

236
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,580
Uh-huh.

237
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:26,560
Okay, well so

238
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,940
okay so

239
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:28,960
So we're really

240
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:29,080
fine.

241
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,500
It's funny now.

242
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:29,860
All right.

243
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,500
Okay, Bishop Joey's here

244
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,220
and he's answering

245
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:33,980
any of your

246
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,680
religious and or

247
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,380
sexual questions.

248
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,120
So you can call in

249
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:39,520
at 848.

250
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,200
That's all.

251
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:40,620
That's all the

252
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:41,060
numbers we've got.

253
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:41,880
We had a big budget

254
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:42,840
cut here at KPFA

255
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:43,580
so we had to lose

256
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,960
four of our phone numbers

257
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,540
so we're just down

258
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,080
to 848.

259
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,200
Just dial 848

260
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,140
and wait.

261
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,440
And John Shirley

262
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,160
is here to answer

263
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:50,500
any of your

264
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:51,900
science fiction questions.

265
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:52,780
All right.

266
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,480
The sexual and religious

267
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:54,960
questions have

268
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:55,720
How big was

269
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,020
Paul Anderson's poll?

270
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,220
Paul Anderson's poll.

271
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,720
It was Philip

272
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,360
really a dick.

273
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,980
It's one of the

274
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:03,440
mysteries.

275
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,920
Religion and sexuality

276
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,120
have converged

277
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:09,560
or have

278
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,300
you know

279
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,440
it has shown

280
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,100
it has

281
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:12,900
dropped its pants

282
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:13,480
this year

283
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,400
because of Haggard

284
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:14,700
right?

285
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,840
And people like that.

286
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,540
So my question

287
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,220
to you is

288
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:18,620
Yes.

289
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,060
You know

290
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:20,460
where

291
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,360
is

292
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,260
your particular

293
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,980
theological

294
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,320
domain

295
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,180
with respect

296
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,620
to this

297
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,140
emerging

298
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:28,520
experience

299
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:29,540
explosion

300
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,000
of self-exposure

301
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:31,420
sexually

302
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,280
amongst the

303
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,380
religious leaders

304
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:33,900
of our country?

305
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,040
It's under my bed.

306
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:35,840
The domain

307
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,540
is under my bed.

308
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:38,500
I feel

309
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,400
there is no God.

310
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,060
You feel

311
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:41,600
but how

312
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,060
exactly?

313
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,100
Feel

314
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,440
but to feel

315
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,240
is not enough

316
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,160
to be

317
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:48,360
expressively

318
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,140
intellectually

319
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,360
and convincingly

320
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,400
appropriate.

321
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:53,540
Feeling?

322
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:54,520
Feeling

323
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:54,660
is

324
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,240
feelings are

325
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,260
no longer

326
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:56,760
uh

327
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,660
uh

328
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,280
uh

329
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:58,500
uh

330
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:58,500


331
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,100
shorthand

332
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,460
for

333
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,980
your expression

334
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:02,000
of a religious

335
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,740
and or

336
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:03,320
uh

337
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,920
sexual

338
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,480
congress

339
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,440
which is

340
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,180
a hundred and tenth

341
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:06,740
time I think

342
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,080
going around.

343
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:07,980
Well one of my

344
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:08,940
samples says

345
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,980
feeling is

346
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:10,420
believing.

347
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,380
Feeling is

348
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:12,720
believing.

349
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,240
Dr. Johnson

350
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,220
said I refuted

351
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:16,860
thus and he

352
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:17,280
kicked the

353
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,040
he kicked the

354
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:18,340
stone

355
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:19,600
thus

356
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,420
and it hurt

357
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:20,880
his foot

358
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:21,800
and then he said

359
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,740
I believe

360
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:23,440
because that

361
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:23,780
hurts.

362
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:25,360
That's too much

363
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:25,960
of a coincidence

364
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,620
for comfort.

365
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:27,500
I know

366
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,440
but you can't

367
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,120
expect anything

368
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,820
less here

369
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:31,280
on KPFA

370
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,560
in your ear.

371
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,380
You're trying to

372
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:33,740
go to bed

373
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,460
you're trying to

374
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:34,860
go to sleep

375
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,460
and somebody's

376
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:35,900
left the radio

377
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,340
on and you

378
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:36,980
reach for the

379
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:37,720
dial and it

380
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,320
won't turn off

381
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:38,900
and your radio

382
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,320
is stuck

383
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:40,560
and the clock

384
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,020
is ticking

385
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:42,460
and you're

386
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:42,960
trying to

387
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
get some sleep

388
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,460
because tomorrow

389
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:44,860
you've got to

390
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:45,220
get up and

391
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:45,980
face another

392
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:47,200
day at your

393
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:47,780
grueling

394
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,260
grim

395
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,560
boring job

396
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,560
but here you

397
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:51,300
are stuck

398
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:51,900
listening to the

399
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:52,180
radio

400
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,320
listening to us

401
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,540
so join us

402
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:56,140
and if it

403
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,500
hurts

404
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,220
you believe.

405
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,660
Yes, if it

406
00:11:59,660 --> 00:11:59,900
hurts

407
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,420
you believe.

408
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,300
Believe?

409
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:04,780
Yes.

410
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,700
I have a

411
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,880
sexual question.

412
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:10,380
I have a

413
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,320
cat

414
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,680
a female

415
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,060
cat

416
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:13,580
and

417
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,260
she eats

418
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:15,880
too much

419
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,400
and the reason

420
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,880
she eats

421
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,340
too much

422
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:17,940
is because

423
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,440
she likes

424
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:19,860
to fight

425
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,460
all the other

426
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,220
cats in the

427
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:21,620
neighborhood.

428
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:23,880
Uh-huh.

429
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,200
Uh-huh.

430
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,040
Uh-huh.

431
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:25,700
And

432
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,240
that's what

433
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:27,840
worry is made.

434
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:30,020
And?

435
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:31,960
And?

436
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,160
And?

437
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,880
And?

438
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,020
And?

439
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:34,120
And?

440
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,120


441
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,120


442
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,120


443
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,120


444
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:34,620
He's listening

445
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:35,340
to his delayed

446
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:35,920
broadcast.

447
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:37,820
He wants to

448
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:38,480
hear himself.

449
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,700
Oh, I see.

450
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,040
Okay.

451
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:40,680
Yeah, the whole

452
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,500
station now, you

453
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:42,080
know, is on a

454
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:42,360
delay.

455
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,540
Didn't used to

456
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:44,100
be, but it is

457
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:44,320
now.

458
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,320
So we can't

459
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,860
say beep

460
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,640
or beep

461
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,700
or beep

462
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:49,400
or beep.

463
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,320
We have a

464
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:51,820
dump button,

465
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,440
but I promise

466
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,280
not to use it.

467
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,920
Oh, we did.

468
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,300
Yeah.

469
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,900
So when you

470
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,260
call,

471
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,060
yeah,

472
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:58,880
listen to me,

473
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,200
people.

474
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,440
When you call,

475
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,860
don't, don't

476
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:02,540
listen to your

477
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:03,040
radio.

478
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,120
Don't listen to

479
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:05,880
your computer.

480
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,860
Don't listen to

481
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,300
your, listen to

482
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:08,840
your telephone.

483
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,840
Because in your

484
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,080
telephone's earpiece

485
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,800
is the only

486
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:13,840
real time

487
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:15,700
that exists

488
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,260
now.

489
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,120
Listen to

490
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,200
me only.

491
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:20,720
Turn down

492
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,580
your radio.

493
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,300
Turn down

494
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:22,940
your computer.

495
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,180
If you try

496
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:24,920
to converse

497
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,400
with us,

498
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:25,800
with those

499
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:26,720
up, you

500
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,700
will sound

501
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,220
drunk.

502
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,080
Throw away

503
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,900
your computer.

504
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,160
You will

505
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,340
sound drunk

506
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,580
if you attempt

507
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,560
to follow

508
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:36,020
the delayed

509
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:36,600
broadcast

510
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,040
while calling.

511
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:37,800
Drink heavily.

512
00:13:38,120 --> 00:13:38,900
Thank you.

513
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,480
Please don't

514
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:40,900
speak into

515
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,400
the microphones.

516
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,280
That's too

517
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:44,660
much of a

518
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,060
question.

519
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,700
Think into

520
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,360
the microphones.

521
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,360
Only think

522
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:47,860
into them.

523
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:49,360
We're going

524
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:49,840
to stink

525
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,360
into the

526
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:50,520
microphones.

527
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:51,060
These microphones

528
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:52,280
are so sensitive

529
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:53,740
that they feel

530
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:54,560
insulted if you

531
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,160
talk into them.

532
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:55,740
We're still

533
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:56,700
stinking into

534
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:57,100
the microphone

535
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:57,720
right now as

536
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,360
Dr. Halloway.

537
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:58,580
We're trying

538
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,040
to get Dr.

539
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,560
Hall jacked

540
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:00,820
into the

541
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:01,140
microphone.

542
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:01,600
I just want

543
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:01,920
to get this

544
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,440
over early.

545
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:02,980
You know,

546
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,980
the stang

547
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:04,220
and the

548
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,300
howl.

549
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:04,600
Let's try

550
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:04,940
to get the

551
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,500
show out

552
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:05,740
of the

553
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:06,900
door by

554
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:07,940
1230.

555
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,740
And Phineas

556
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,300
Narco's a

557
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:09,540
tape.

558
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,040
He's loopy.

559
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:12,760
He's loopy.

560
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,440
Phineas is

561
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:13,860
looped.

562
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:17,860
I thought

563
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,520
Phineas Narco

564
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:18,960
was changing.

565
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,160
Nothing.

566
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,260
There's no

567
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:21,700
doubt that

568
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,160
someone's

569
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:22,640
passing out

570
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:22,900
information.

571
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:24,380
And that

572
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,240
information is

573
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,360
the number

574
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,000
you can call

575
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,280
to find out

576
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:28,780
about this

577
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,120
coming

578
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:29,980

582
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,180
It's coming

583
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,600
right up.

584
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,000
That's right.

585
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,780
April 1st

586
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,060

589

00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,360
Columbus Avenue

598
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:40,020
to either

599
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:40,600
Washington Square

600
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,060
Park or

601
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,960
Joe DiMaggio's

602
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:42,220
bathroom.

603
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,600
So get

604
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:43,860
ready,

605
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:44,300
put it in

606
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:44,820
your calendar,

607
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,420
and be

608
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,220
prepared to

609
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,320
march once

610
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:47,880
again in

611
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,340
honor of

612
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,480
St.

613
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:48,760
Stupid,

614
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:48,960
a little

615
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:49,160
known,

616
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:49,320
St.

617
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:49,680
442,

618
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,120
443,

619
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:50,540
513,

620
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,000
and 716

621
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:51,320
in the

622
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:51,480
parking

623
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:51,680
meters.

624
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,100
I bet

625
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:52,360
you didn't

626
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,580
know that.

627
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:52,780
You're not

628
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,300
Catholic,

629
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:53,640
are you?

630
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:53,960
I didn't

631
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,440
think so.

632
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,340
It's April

633
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,940
1st.

634
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:56,980
Is that

635
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,540
April 1st?

636
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,100
I mean,

637
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:58,420
is that

638
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,660
when the

639
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,220
parade is?

640
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:00,640
I thought

641
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:00,860
it was

642
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:01,540
April 1st.

643
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,320
It could

644
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:02,700
be April

645
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,100
1st,

646
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:03,300
I'm not

647
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:03,520
sure.

648
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,300
Noon at

649
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:04,760
the Pointy

650
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:04,940
Building,

651
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:05,760
so if you

652
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:06,000
want more

653
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:06,660
information about

654
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:06,860
that,

655
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,080
go to

656
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:08,180
ststupid.com.

657
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:08,460
It's

658
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:10,500
S-A-I-N-T-S-T-U-P-I

659
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,720
S-T-U-P-I

660
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:14,780
Whatever,

661
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,120
you know,

662
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,680
figure it

663
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:16,880
out.

664
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,060
Google it.

665
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,000
Google it

666
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:19,300
yourself.

667
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:20,440
Oh yeah?

668
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:20,740
Well,

669
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,440
Google this.

670
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,520
What?

671
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:26,660
What?

672
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:27,300
Google this.

673
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,140
Google this.

674
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,740
Google this.

675
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:35,960
Google this.

676
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:36,260


677
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,200
Where even

678
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:37,580
an innocent

679
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,700
corpse can

680
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,460
find no

681
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:39,920
peace.

682
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:40,740
Google this.

683
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,020
Google this.

684
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,260
Google this.

685
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:45,380
Google this.

686
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:45,780
Of course,

687
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,240
we'll keep

688
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:46,760
our safety.

689
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:47,320
Whoever's

690
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:47,900
responsible,

691
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:48,740
Dr. Bronson,

692
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,740
radar control

693
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,620
to Dr. Bronson,

694
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:00,560
And now the pretty part of the show.

695
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,160
That's so much better.

696
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,440
Now maybe you can get to sleep,

697
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:07,540
because we'll be playing some easy listening trance music

698
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,580
for you to get into your theta state.

699
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:12,280
That's right.

700
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:17,660
That's right.

701
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:18,560
That's right.

702
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:18,860
That's right.

703
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,400
That's right.

704
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:21,880
That's right.

705
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:25,760
It's the face of the new fascism.

706
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,580
It's the face of the new fascism.

707
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,680
It's soothing fascism.

708
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:34,400
The soothing sounds of fascism tonight.

709
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,860
...a mad, deadly, worldwide, conspiratorial,

710
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:40,340
gangster, computer god, communism...

711
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:40,940
Try that number.

712
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:41,660
Call that number.

713
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:42,420
Theta follows.

714
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,160
Distance, 486 miles.

715
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:48,940
Height, 50.2 miles.

716
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:50,340
Speed...

717
00:16:50,740 --> 00:16:52,160
Five miles per second.

718
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,420
Something bad has happened.

719
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,100
The show you need.

720
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:01,900
So you can't use all those recorded instructions

721
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,720
on phone fidelity.

722
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,940
Those are all gone now, right?

723
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:06,400
Say a good day.

724
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:08,180
Go.

725
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:09,100
That is correct.

726
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,980
You could technically still have phone fidelity.

727
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,580
The delay doesn't really affect that.

728
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,560
It's just that...

729
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,300
If you don't listen to your telephone, you won't hear yourself.

730
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,880
Okay, take a six-pack and scan.

731
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:30,980
Estimated time of arrival at contact point, one minute, 58 seconds.

732
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:31,460
Go.

733
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,280
Okay, now that's well...

734
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:45,660
Okay, now...

735
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:46,960
Don't look.

736
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:50,140
Yes, dear friend.

737
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:54,420
Now, that usually brings Stang, if you say,

738
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,840
Yes, dear friend.

739
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:00,560
And he pokes him, but he pokes him.

740
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,480
It summons him.

741
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,220
The Reverend Stang will be here.

742
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,220
He will be here later.

743
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:11,140
The Reverend Stang of the Church of the Subgenus.

744
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,580
Stop it, Gary!

745
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,440
I'm hearing his...

746
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,780
And co-creator of the Church of the Subgenus.

747
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,320
Check, check.

748
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,120
By-loading.

749
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,080
drummond.

750
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,200
All right, let's fire control.

751
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,560
Fire control alerted, sir.

752
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,780
Two grains of sand fall out now and then.

753
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:02,540
Young Martin also says that he saw something on the borders.

754
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,780
On a quiet summer day in Houston, Texas,

755
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,840
unbeknownst to the rest of the world,

756
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:23,060
a great scientific operation was performed.

757
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,940
A squid was eating dough in a polyethylene bag.

758
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:31,500
On that day, a human being was given a shape that would last forever.

759
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,620
A very repellent shape.

760
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,400
When may we expect you?

761
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:40,100
In 30 seconds.

762
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,120
A shape that would never age or decay.

763
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:48,600
Over and off.

764
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,440
And an event had taken place that is soon to affect all of humanity.

765
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,120
Something that he insists was his brother.

766
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,400
But we know that his brother is dead.

767
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:07,380
We also know that he is not lying in his coffin.

768
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:10,060
Someone in this village is practicing witchcraft.

769
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:14,000
The Reverend Stang will be here.

770
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,360
Have faith.

771
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,720
Yeah, this is not your usual camp.

772
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,520
We have a lot of followers meeting here.

773
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:23,420
Ed's going to try to play it now.

774
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:26,600
We've got the big wig himself here coming tonight.

775
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,720
Oh, he's doing really good.

776
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:32,740
Mr. Ivan Stang, owner and operator of the Subgenius Church Foundation of America.

777
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,140
But Ed and I will be gone by the time Stang gets here.

778
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:41,540
You guys were gone, gone, gone years ago.

779
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,480
So why are we here?

780
00:20:45,580 --> 00:20:50,000
Why did we drive all the way from our far off homes and nice warm homes?

781
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,100
They probably were just waiting for us to come back.

782
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:50,100


783
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,600
We're probably dating from the acid test.

784
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,120
For the New Year's Revolution show.

785
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:55,780
Oh, that's right.

786
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:56,900
Come on, get into it.

787
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,800
What if I refuse to even participate in the New Year?

788
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,260
We have a whole new chance here.

789
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:05,380
I'm...

790
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,800
We have a...

791
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,920
You know, this is the last year.

792
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,660
You have to understand that it has been announced.

793
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:18,040
The Church of the Subgenius has announced that the end of the world will take place

794
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,900
on Thursday, July 5th, 2020.

795
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:24,000
And in preparation for the fulfillment of this doomsday prophecy,

796
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:27,680
the Church is requesting that all of its members participate in a festival

797
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:32,240
with rock concerts and blasphemous rituals taking place in upstate New York

798
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:35,140
during the final weekend before the arrival of the apocalypse.

799
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,740
Oh, they're always doing that.

800
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:37,840
They do that every year.

801
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,220
But see, there are many other people who make predictions about the end of the world.

802
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,580
They give up too easily.

803
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,200
They say the end of the world...

804
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:49,300
There was a guy in 1986 or so

805
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:53,240
who wrote a book explaining that the end of the world would come in 1988.

806
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,500
And he sold 5 million of them.

807
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,400
And it didn't come.

808
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:02,660
And so he wrote another book saying it would come in 1989.

809
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,320
He sold a lot of those too.

810
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,560
He was that much persistent.

811
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:07,500
And then he gave up.

812
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:11,100
The Church of the Subgenius never gives up predicting the end of the world.

813
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,580
Even after the end of the world, the Subgenius will predict it.

814
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,280
Well, if you go to the edge of the earth,

815
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,740
and throw a rock, what do you hit?

816
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,680
So after the end of the world,

817
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,660
there's got to be another end, another end, another end.

818
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:27,240
Well, there's the Gardall Shield.

819
00:22:27,500 --> 00:22:30,840
First of all, no one ever accounts for the Gardall Shield.

820
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:34,600
And there's a novel by John Shirley called The Other End.

821
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,360
But I won't promote it this segment.

822
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,060
The Other End?

823
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,020
The Other End.

824
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,040
What's that, the check?

825
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,280
It's an alternative apocalypse.

826
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:45,480
A novel of alternative apocalypse.

827
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,820
Oh, yeah.

828
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,260
You know, every time I look for a new book,

829
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,520
I find a John Shirley book at my local bookstore.

830
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:52,520
I don't see one.

831
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,120
Well, you've got to look in the cheesy section,

832
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,920
in the cheesy paperback section.

833
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,320
Or go to a better bookstore.

834
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,660
A better class of bookstore might help also.

835
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,420
I look for those books by Lloyd St. Alcorn.

836
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,260
I don't know if you remember those.

837
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:12,540
Oh, that's a name that resonates with the cobwebs.

838
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:17,700
Dr. David Meyer, I believe, wrote several terrible books.

839
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:20,640
Under the pen name of Lloyd St. Alcorn.

840
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:23,820
But it was slack because he got paid to write terrible books.

841
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:24,600
That's right.

842
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:26,580
But he got paid lousy money.

843
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:30,160
I get paid lousy money to write good books.

844
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:34,000
So he had more slack than me because he got paid the same money to write bad books,

845
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,000
which is easier.

846
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:42,260
Edgar Wisenant made himself a nice packet of money with a book assuring everyone that 1988 was the end of the world.

847
00:23:42,820 --> 00:23:45,180
He had 88 reasons for his assurance.

848
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:49,940
And he sold 4 million copies to a gullible public.

849
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:55,700
And in 1989 came out with a book in which he said he had made some mistakes,

850
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,320
but it was going to end in 1989.

851
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,460
You know, that kind of persistence is admirable.

852
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:07,280
Elizabeth Clare Prophet said that 1990 was going to be the end of the year.

853
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:15,060
The Gulf War broke out and religious enthusiasts got on their phones to the radio stations saying that Armageddon

854
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,760
would be in 1991.

855
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,400
Well, everybody I know died in 2007.

856
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:27,860
You're mixing up the past and the future again.

857
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:34,980
You know, Gary's problem is that he thinks that the future is the past because he lives outside of time.

858
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:37,240
Gary lives in eternity.

859
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:42,680
He's got one foot in eternity and he keeps wobbling back and forth and he kind of gets them mixed up.

860
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,860
And he can see the future.

861
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,200
He thinks it's the past.

862
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:45,980
He spins around.

863
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:46,940
He doesn't know the difference.

864
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:52,340
But spending all this time in my own tent made out of my own skin,

865
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:55,400
wouldn't you think that I would be in my own reality?

866
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,540
Too soon for what?

867
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:57,940
Absolutely.

868
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,820
You're spinning.

869
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:06,120
You're like an object being spun on a lathe and gradually ground down into a shape that can only be imagined.

870
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,840
Well, here I have a question for you, John.

871
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:10,580
This is more KPFA-like.

872
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:11,520
More time for what?

873
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,520
I found this here on the floor, KPFA.

874
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:14,480
I can't believe it.

875
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,000
That's where all my questions come from.

876
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:24,920
It says, what are the ties between immigrants from a Middle Eastern country and an African American born in South Carolina?

877
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:29,380
Is that a reference to Obama or something?

878
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:30,420
I have no idea.

879
00:25:30,520 --> 00:25:33,340
The end of the world's coming and you're just talking about this stuff.

880
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:38,640
Now you're supposed to play side one, cut two, Don, to answer my question.

881
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,780
I'm bound on the floor here.

882
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:42,680
That's how desperate we are for questions from the great world.

883
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,580
We're scrabbling around on the floor like a crack addict.

884
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:46,160
Good.

885
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:47,580
You want questions?

886
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:48,280
You got questions.

887
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,920
Why can't you amend your revelation and move it up to early September?

888
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:59,440
Followers of Nostradamus claim that according to the French seer, the end of the world came in July 1999.

889
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:04,360
We're perfectly willing to adjust to circumstances.

890
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:07,120
Hey, can we have September 11th early this year?

891
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,880
The supreme moment of the universe has already happened.

892
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:11,940
That is a grim joke.

893
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:21,280
Jesus said this generation should not pass away until the fulfillment of his prediction of the end times was fulfilled.

894
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:29,040
And I don't know if anybody noticed 1,998 or so years ago that it didn't come about.

895
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,920
So all these people predict the end of the world.

896
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:33,760
It doesn't happen.

897
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:39,040
The Church of the Subgenius predicts it much more diligently than everybody else.

898
00:26:39,040 --> 00:26:45,860
June 789 is when it really happened on the 1,2345 AM Universal Time.

899
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,840
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

900
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,180
We lived through it.

901
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,280
I have it on tape.

902
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,080
It really happened.

903
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:56,940
Gary, your output in the amp is a bit high.

904
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:58,440
Okay.

905
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,400
That's because Ed's playing it now.

906
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:03,140
See, no hands and it's still loud.

907
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,340
I've got a list of the end of the world.

908
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:07,040
Play something really loud.

909
00:27:07,180 --> 00:27:08,480
Play something really loud.

910
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,980
St. Augustine said it was coming in the year 1000.

911
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:13,160
That's it?

912
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:14,400
That's as loud as you'll ever get?

913
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,060
No, we can play as loud as you want.

914
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:19,200
That's pretty good there, I think.

915
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:21,140
Pretty good right there?

916
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:21,540
Yeah.

917
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:22,580
Yeah.

918
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:23,440
Okay.

919
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,020
Go to it, Ed.

920
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:25,700
It's your turn.

921
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:29,880
History of the universe.

922
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:31,560
Wow.

923
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,080
Isaac.

924
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,460
Isaac.

925
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,620
Isaac Newton predicted the end of the world.

926
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,680
1733 for the end of the world.

927
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:48,680
Isaac Newton predicted the end of the show.

928
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:56,040
Isaac Newton said someday the puzzling show would end and everyone would rejoice in the end.

929
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:03,460
And the wellman had fell from the tree and hit Isaac square in the capooter.

930
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,720
Oh, yeah.

931
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:07,860
He did.

932
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:11,120
And Isaac Newton predicted the end of the world for 1733.

933
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:18,300
If you would like to attempt to speak to the subgenius foundation church of America,

934
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,560
please call us at

935
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:27,700
Don't say hello when your phone stops ringing.

936
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:28,420
You're on the air.

937
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:30,080
And don't listen to your radio.

938
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:30,600
Please.

939
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,700
In 1736, William Winston of Cambridge announced the birth of the great American philosopher

940
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:34,700


941
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:34,700


942
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:34,700


943
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:34,700


944
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:34,700


945
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:34,700


946
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:34,700


947
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:34,700


948
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:34,700


949
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,260
that the end of the world was about to commence.

950
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,740
Panic-stricken Londoners headed for high places

951
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,620
to escape the floods, he predicted.

952
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,560
None of them came.

953
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,780
Didn't anybody ask, how does he know?

954
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,820
Immanuel Swedenborg, who conversed frequently with angels,

955
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:54,240
was certain that 1757 was the date.

956
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:56,320
Oh, hey, that reminds me,

957
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,980
we're supposed to have Swedenborg breads for dinner tonight.

958
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,360
Is that like Swedenborg?

959
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,540
We cut the pancreas out of philosophers

960
00:29:04,540 --> 00:29:06,200
and dip them in cornmeal.

961
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,500
They're delicious.

962
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:13,720
The thyroid is supposed to be especially delectable

963
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,740
if you get a mathematician.

964
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:16,720
Nietzsche's is real bitter, though.

965
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,400
You don't like bitter, you like Nietzsche.

966
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:20,720
Oh, everyone has their own little Nietzsche these days.

967
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,060
Yeah.

968
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,260
So if you want to join in on a frivoli

969
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:28,600
and a clever wordplay, just dial...

970
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:31,780
When you're on the air, come on, come on.

971
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,340
You can do it.

972
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,080
I think they were trying to say

973
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,380
a Freud to live and too young to die.

974
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:39,400
There are people around the world

975
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,520
who really still believe

976
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:42,060
that if you eat somebody's heart

977
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,800
who is courageous, you will be courageous.

978
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,980
So if you eat their brains...

979
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,800
Eat somebody prettier than you are.

980
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:50,420
Eat somebody smarter than you are.

981
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:52,440
Eat somebody stronger than you are.

982
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,780
Well, I've been nibbling a lot.

983
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,740
But eat somebody.

984
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:57,820
Whatever you do.

985
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,640
Are we allowed to say that on the air?

986
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:01,300
Eat somebody?

987
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:03,140
Yeah, if it's a song.

988
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:06,720
You gotta eat somebody on your bond.

989
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:11,580
You gotta eat somebody on your bond.

990
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:12,960
But not their lungs.

991
00:30:14,760 --> 00:30:15,680
Got any recipes?

992
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,180
So cannibalism's coming back, we hear.

993
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,800
So if you got some recipes...

994
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:20,620
It will come back.

995
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:22,820
When the world famine comes, my friend,

996
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,040
which I have been predicting,

997
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:25,300
the American famine...

998
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,580
The great pulling began.

999
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:29,680
Imagine a famine in the United States.

1000
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,760
What would that be like?

1001
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:31,300
Yum.

1002
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:32,320
Who would we eat?

1003
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:32,680
We'd eat first.

1004
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,540
Well, we'd eat the Welsh rabbits made from Volkswagens.

1005
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:37,680
Okay.

1006
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:39,660
If you have a famine, and you have bird flu...

1007
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,540
There are people who've eaten cars.

1008
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,000
Yeah.

1009
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,420
There are, bit by bit, like chunk by chunk.

1010
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:47,720
There was a guy who cut up a car and ate it.

1011
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,680
It took him several years.

1012
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,620
Did you ever see The Metal-Eating Bird?

1013
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,740
The cartoon, The Metal-Eating Bird?

1014
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,960
You've seen it, haven't you?

1015
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:54,540
No.

1016
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:56,300
No.

1017
00:30:57,080 --> 00:30:59,260
I don't watch television.

1018
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,320
Well, Doug Wellman has seen The Metal-Eating Bird.

1019
00:31:02,340 --> 00:31:02,520
Oh, I've heard.

1020
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:03,760
Oh, whip it out.

1021
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,620
You got it on tape?

1022
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:05,080
Whip it out.

1023
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:06,940
But...

1024
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:07,320
Ah!

1025
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:07,900
Charles Russell.

1026
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:12,600
Charles Russell, founder of a group later known as the Witnesses of Jehovah,

1027
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,720
does that sound familiar, said that Christ...

1028
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,460
Yeah, they had a big hit.

1029
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:20,420
He said that Christ had returned invisibly in the year 1874.

1030
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:23,000
There was no way of proving he was wrong.

1031
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:28,220
Oh, well, but the girls all knew that somebody were staring at them in their gym locker room.

1032
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:29,220
Yeah, when they went wee-wee...

1033
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:29,640
That was Jesus.

1034
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:30,760
There was a guy with a beard.

1035
00:31:30,940 --> 00:31:31,860
But, you know...

1036
00:31:31,860 --> 00:31:36,300
In fact, somebody pointed out to me today that if Jesus is always watching you, we are

1037
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,160
Jesus's porn.

1038
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:38,320
Oh, man.

1039
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,760
Oh, that's right.

1040
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:40,580
That's what you're...

1041
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:40,720
That's what you're...

1042
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,220
Derming!

1043
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,640
We're gonna porn with Jesus Watchers.

1044
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,520
Yes, and we're Bob's commercials.

1045
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,960
Well, Russell, what is your definition of an actress?

1046
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:49,180
That's what your relatives do, and you have to use...

1047
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:52,020
So, where are all the rest of all the important guests on this show?

1048
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:52,360
Those relatives are right, yes.

1049
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:52,520
Oh, the...

1050
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:53,600
There...

1051
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,120
I think it is something...

1052
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,440
Look behind the...

1053
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,060
The...

1054
00:31:57,060 --> 00:31:57,140
The...

1055
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:57,240
The...

1056
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:57,320
The...

1057
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:57,340
The...

1058
00:31:57,340 --> 00:31:57,500
The...

1059
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:57,500


1060
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:57,980
The...

1061
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,660
The...

1062
00:31:58,660 --> 00:31:59,000
Man, yeah.

1063
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:07,560
That was a lot of people and I'm watersuuuuutting it pretty fits me...

1064
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:07,780
That's right.

1065
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:07,780


1066
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:07,780


1067
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:08,080
That's it for now!

1068
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,180
... who are now you sticking with?

1069
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,700
I don't think you can get the title of Best Actress...

1070
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:11,700


1071
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,980
I heard a lot of other actors.

1072
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:12,980


1073
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:20,120
I'melu Iguっていう...

1074
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:20,340
When a young lad growing up in the lab derived this dog, or something like that.

1075
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:20,340


1076
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:21,140
You can say that again.

1077
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:21,400
When...

1078
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,780
I do think I'melu Dam in Iguaghetti!

1079
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:23,800
Yeah!

1080
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:23,800


1081
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:27,360
Yeah, I do with Forbidden okay.

1082
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:27,360


1083
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,640
All right.

1084
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,760
I'm just going to rent Bishop Joey and ride him on the beach out at San Gregorio myself.

1085
00:32:33,540 --> 00:32:36,180
Rent to Bishop Joey.

1086
00:32:36,340 --> 00:32:36,780
Yeah.

1087
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:40,640
The Jehovah's Witnesses predicted the end of the world for 1975.

1088
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,500
When they come to your door and they're trying to convince you they've got some information.

1089
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:46,300
1975.

1090
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:48,020
Then again, 1984.

1091
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,420
They said that was going to be the end of the world.

1092
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,440
When they come to your house, ask them if they remember that.

1093
00:32:56,520 --> 00:33:03,520
And if you want an alternative apocalypse, go to www.signsofwitness.com.

1094
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:07,920
Where is my website of alternative apocalypse?

1095
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,180
Apocalypse?

1096
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:12,640
Apocalypse is related to apocalypse.

1097
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,260
It's when you can't say apocalypse, and so you say apocalypse.

1098
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:19,400
I've had a little experience with apuckerlips.

1099
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,900
Apocalypse only happens back east.

1100
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,500
Apocalypse now.

1101
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,380
They have sodas.

1102
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,020
They have sodas here, and they have pop back there.

1103
00:33:27,340 --> 00:33:28,680
I pop my lips now.

1104
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,800
Uh, yeah.

1105
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,860
Apuckerlips now.

1106
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:34,980
Earphone radio.

1107
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,340
Earphone radio.

1108
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,080
Apuckerlips now.

1109
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,760
The problem I have is being in that tree.

1110
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,540
Hello, caller.

1111
00:33:45,620 --> 00:33:46,680
Now, this is a true thing.

1112
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:50,460
Hello?

1113
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:53,740
In 1983, as the residents of Calcutta,

1114
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:55,420
a small town 30 miles away,

1115
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,800
north of Rome, prepared for their annual procession,

1116
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,020
honoring a holy relic,

1117
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,800
a shocking announcement from the parish priest

1118
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,040
put a damper on festivities.

1119
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,200
The relic has vanished.

1120
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,460
What was that relic?

1121
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:11,100
The lopped off body parts of a certain Messiah.

1122
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:13,200
That is, it was the foreskin of Jesus.

1123
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:16,420
It was alleged to be, I'm not making this up,

1124
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:20,280
the foreskin of Jesus supposedly found in India,

1125
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:24,720
in, uh, no, in Calcutta, not Calcutta,

1126
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:25,420
in Philly.

1127
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:31,120
In 1557, and a series of miracles soon followed finding the holy foreskin.

1128
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:33,900
Uh, a big storm, it's perfumed, missed.

1129
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:40,900
Well, in fact, it has not turned up, uh, and they, and the people of Calcutta

1130
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,680
claim that it was stolen by the Vatican,

1131
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:46,140
who didn't like the holy foreskin being out there in their church,

1132
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,300
and they were embarrassed by it.

1133
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:49,120
Oh, they were afraid someone was going to clone it.

1134
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:52,600
Oh, that, that, there has been discussion of cloning the holy foreskin.

1135
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:54,920
Holy foreskin, holy foreskin, holy foreskin.

1136
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:57,580
Uh, sounds like a Phil Henry.

1137
00:34:57,580 --> 00:34:57,760
Okay.

1138
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:00,320
Here, I've got mine here in my wallet.

1139
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,560
Let's try to clone it and see if it works for me.

1140
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:03,460
I'm Jewish.

1141
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:11,280
Lines of pilgrims stretch from the church doors to beyond the walls of the fortress town

1142
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,260
to see the holy foreskin.

1143
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:17,760
I think we should stretch Bishop Joey's over this African drum head.

1144
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:18,420
Oh.

1145
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,980
But can you use it as a shower cap?

1146
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:20,380
Oh.

1147
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,180
The Pope is using it as a cap.

1148
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,420
It is to, it makes it.

1149
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:27,260
It makes that weird hat more snuggly on it.

1150
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:30,060
Uh, the skateboarder's one.

1151
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:32,920
There's an image to conjure for you, ladies and gentlemen.

1152
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,040
Yes, if you can join in here in the blasphemy.

1153
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,460
We've got blasphemy, 49 cents a pound.

1154
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:39,280
It's available right now here on your radio.

1155
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:39,780
So call it.

1156
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,420
And contribute your blasphemy right here.

1157
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,800
Two famous religious figures in America who were anti-gay

1158
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,420
turned out to be gay this year.

1159
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,580
Haggard and another guy.

1160
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:50,340
His name I forgot.

1161
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:51,240
Merle?

1162
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:52,740
No, not Merle.

1163
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:53,420
Merle did not.

1164
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,320
Merle is the last guy to turn out.

1165
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:55,580
He's not gay.

1166
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,120
Oh, I hope.

1167
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,700
You're going to ruin my, you know, my reverence.

1168
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,000
Sorry.

1169
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:04,320
I'm down with gays, but I don't want Merle to be gay.

1170
00:36:04,420 --> 00:36:05,780
Merle Haggard may not be gay.

1171
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,300
Merle's into truckers, I hear.

1172
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:09,820
Mother truckers.

1173
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:14,480
But what I want to know is, when is the Bishop Joey going to come out?

1174
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:17,900
Bishop Joey did come out.

1175
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:21,080
He came out last year and got all wet, so he went back in.

1176
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,040
It's going to be winter for another six years.

1177
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,460
Ladies and gentlemen, he has arrived.

1178
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:30,320
There's no point in putting it off anymore.

1179
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,900
He is in the building.

1180
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:34,500
The Reverend Stang?

1181
00:36:34,620 --> 00:36:38,660
Yes, and he is about to join us here on the radio.

1182
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:43,200
The sacred scribe of the Church of the Subgenius has arrived.

1183
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,320
He is in the building.

1184
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,900
Exclusive New Year's Revolution show.

1185
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:52,300
The alternative apocalypse won't be long now.

1186
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:53,220
The Reverend Stang.

1187
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:55,160
Wait for those dulcet tones.

1188
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,020
Stang.

1189
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,020
Listen to the concepts carefully.

1190
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,400
Yes, dear friends.

1191
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:01,740
Try to absorb from the master.

1192
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,960
He will appear.

1193
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,440
Yes, dear friends.

1194
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,220
Yes, dear friends.

1195
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,440
www.subgenius.com

1196
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,060
Stang.

1197
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,960
Stang in the butt by a wasp.

1198
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:23,180
And he drug a phylo in on the bottom of his heel.

1199
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:24,520
All right.

1200
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:24,860
All right.

1201
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:25,400
All right.

1202
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:25,400


1203
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:28,980
I wash the bottom of my shoes every time I kick phylos.

1204
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,400
But.

1205
00:37:31,380 --> 00:37:32,320
Don't say hello.

1206
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,640
When your phone stops ringing, you're on the air.

1207
00:37:35,740 --> 00:37:36,520
Just go ahead.

1208
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,860
That's our policy.

1209
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,680
And we're not changing it now.

1210
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,000
I'm hoping that Vice President Cheney will show up tonight.

1211
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:45,800
Yeah.

1212
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,600
Right now he's in the bunker changing into his thong.

1213
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,120
A lot of people saw that thong.

1214
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,840
It was a couple of years ago.

1215
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,060
Burning Man, Chick Cheney.

1216
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,400
He showed up at the bunker.

1217
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:58,080
The fashion show at Burning Man a couple of years ago.

1218
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:04,380
And he was conduced by Dr. Hal, who was emceeing the fashion show,

1219
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,600
to get loose and party down.

1220
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:11,500
And it wound up that Dick Cheney was wearing a thong.

1221
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:16,100
And there were 40,000 people at the time at Burning Man.

1222
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,320
Immediately, 20,000 people left.

1223
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,960
And they took their foreskins with them.

1224
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,420
And they took all their foreskins with them.

1225
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:24,340
The sacred foreskin.

1226
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,220
Calcated.

1227
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,920
It isn't the one.

1228
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,040
You're still going to get wet.

1229
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:29,180
Kitty.

1230
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,020
And baby.

1231
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,760
I'm hoping this is it.

1232
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,280
The sacred lily.

1233
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:40,560
Okay, that one didn't take the foreskin.

1234
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,400
You have to drink it.

1235
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:41,800
It's here.

1236
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,420
Infant Philo's here now.

1237
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:49,240
Maybe we could trade Infant Philo to the Flying Saucers for a burrito.

1238
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:49,680
Yeah.

1239
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,600
A big burrito.

1240
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:55,000
One for all of us.

1241
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:56,060
Clear the field.

1242
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,080
We're monitoring Philo's child.

1243
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:02,240
They're in constant contact with Philo's child.

1244
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:02,860
Dang.

1245
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,240
She's as good as on the planet of the earth.

1246
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:07,560


1247
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:07,560


1248
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:10,420
Very well.

1249
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,880
I'm coming down right now.

1250
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:13,900
Dang.

1251
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:14,320
Over and out.

1252
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:16,960
See.

1253
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,940
Way double zombies.

1254
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,600
Pretty soft.

1255
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,160
Well, I think it's time to frown.

1256
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,320
Frowning.

1257
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:25,540
Fropping?

1258
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,700
I don't know who has the fropping.

1259
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,760
We'd better have it over fast.

1260
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,880
I'm fropless.

1261
00:39:31,080 --> 00:39:31,120
You see?

1262
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,020
The energy.

1263
00:39:33,620 --> 00:39:36,500
The force packed in the rock itself is being released.

1264
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:36,560
Oh yeah.

1265
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,700
We should run home and get it.

1266
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,560
Alright, we almost turned around and stopped.

1267
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:48,480
So, 8484425.

1268
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,400
Talk to a totally naked Bishop Joey.

1269
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:50,800
That's right.

1270
00:39:50,840 --> 00:39:51,340
Bishop Joey.

1271
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,300
Oh my god, he is naked.

1272
00:39:53,420 --> 00:39:54,140
Seminal and second.

1273
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,180
He's the secular head of the First Church, the Last Laugh, World's Fast-Growing, Snack of Religion,

1274
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:58,560
100% of the Dogma, Religion of Light, Religion of One Holy Day, Year and Today,

1275
00:39:58,640 --> 00:39:58,940
isn't it?

1276
00:39:59,020 --> 00:39:59,620
But April 1st is.

1277
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:01,060
He's here and he's naked.

1278
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:03,460
And he's sitting right here and he can talk to you.

1279
00:40:03,700 --> 00:40:05,740
Somebody get a sanitary wipe for that chair.

1280
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,560
No, it's okay.

1281
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:12,320
It'll clean up really nice with a hose down the studio at the end of the show at 5 in the morning.

1282
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:17,080
So talk to Bishop Joey now before he is not talkable.

1283
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,540
Any questions you have.

1284
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,020
What's he doing to the microphone?

1285
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,520
Oh, let me rub it.

1286
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:24,380
I got a little itch.

1287
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,080
Oh, I got an itch.

1288
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,460
Let me scratch it right.

1289
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,960
Oh, does that feel good.

1290
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,420
So talk to a totally naked Bishop Joey.

1291
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:30,620
That's right.

1292
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:34,040
And any question, anything, any subject.

1293
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,620
I don't know.

1294
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,180
I got an answer for you.

1295
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:45,000
After careful study of the Bible, Reverend William Miller thought that the end was 1834.

1296
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:46,540
Tuesday.

1297
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:48,740
He changed his mind and decided it was 1836.

1298
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:52,900
Then he recalculated it and found that it was 1843 in the month of Israel.

1299
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,240
Wednesday.

1300
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:53,720
He said it was 1844.

1301
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,000
There used to be six to choose from.

1302
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:57,580
That was to prove one of the biggest events of the end time calendar.

1303
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,480
When April came and Miller set to work on a new date.

1304
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:07,320
Miller's brave new choice, March 21st, 1844, for the end of the world.

1305
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:13,600
The Millerites waited in droves and high vantage points in special ascension robed for the expected end.

1306
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,160
Hysteria reigned.

1307
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,000
People sold up farms and homes.

1308
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,420
But still, frustratingly, the end did not come.

1309
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,520
They were not persistent.

1310
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,500
The Church of the Subgenius will not.

1311
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:24,860
They will not give up on the end of the world.

1312
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,420
Order your end of the world now.

1313
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,140
We will specially deliver it to you.

1314
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,660
That can be done.

1315
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,100
Personalized.

1316
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,780
Everybody's subjective end of the world is when they're gone.

1317
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:36,660
Personalized.

1318
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:37,480
I can take care of it.

1319
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,820
When would you like the end of the world?

1320
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:39,460
We'll deliver.

1321
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:40,480
Closed society.

1322
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,560
It is closed society.

1323
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,440
45 caliber end of the world.

1324
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,520
Oh, it's magic.

1325
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:49,180
Everything we don't understand is magic.

1326
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:49,760
Hold on.

1327
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,140
Hold it.

1328
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,480
I shall pitch an eave out down to 12.

1329
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:53,560
12.

1330
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,180
5 Zulu.

1331
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:57,280
Providence control wants to know where is he.

1332
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,560
Antony 262.

1333
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,240
Who's got him?

1334
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,260
Antony?

1335
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,340
Stalling cleared from Zulu.

1336
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:04,020
One.

1337
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,600
One.

1338
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,220
One.

1339
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:05,860
One.

1340
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:06,080
One.

1341
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:06,660
One.

1342
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:07,400
One.

1343
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:07,540


1344
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:07,600


1345
00:42:07,620 --> 00:42:07,620


1346
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:07,780


1347
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:07,880


1348
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:07,900


1349
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:07,920


1350
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:07,920


1351
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,280
One.

1352
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:08,480
One.

1353
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:08,480


1354
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:08,580
One.

1355
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,280
One.

1356
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:11,060
One.

1357
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:11,380
One.

1358
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:19,740
Wait, no.

1359
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:24,640
club bit random.

1360
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:40,920
מטן

1361
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:39,060
f Chung

1362
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,060
ruledmon

1363
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:46,080
know and I don't know if this is one of the signs of the apocalypse or not but Grace Jones

1364
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:54,220
has been my lover for at least about three and a half years now. Who has? Grace Jones.

1365
00:42:54,300 --> 00:43:02,560
Grace Jones the disco singer. Oh in your mind she has and in my mind she was mine too.

1366
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:05,620
No she's I've read all those long legs.

1367
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:20,760
My alien lover. Grace Jones. Grace Jones. Is your your sweetheart's sweetheart then

1368
00:43:20,760 --> 00:43:26,220
the end of the world is nigh. Because there's no justice my friend. I don't know about any of that

1369
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:31,880
but I know who my lover is and she she's a wonderful priestess.

1370
00:43:31,880 --> 00:43:32,480
She's a.

1371
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:36,060
She's a goddess. She's a teacher. She is magical.

1372
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:45,600
You know if you make of her a magical object and put her picture on the wall and

1373
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:50,220
prostrate yourself before it she becomes magical for you.

1374
00:43:50,440 --> 00:43:54,640
She is actually on the wall not a not a picture. She is actually hanging on the wall right now.

1375
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,080
Just like in.

1376
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:59,160
Do the police know?

1377
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:00,520
Oops sorry.

1378
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,200
It sounds uncomfortable.

1379
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:03,220
Anyway you aren't.

1380
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:05,100
You didn't come tack her to the wall did you?

1381
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:07,840
She's skinny enough you could use thumbtacks.

1382
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,040
Oh she's still alive.

1383
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,220
Yeah but don't forget she might actually be magic.

1384
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:18,360
Grace Jones you know there is a kind of Aoife sort of vibe coming out of her.

1385
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,200
No it's easy to say.

1386
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,640
I know why you're saying it but she actually could be magic.

1387
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:23,360
You understand me?

1388
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,840
Well she is.

1389
00:44:25,580 --> 00:44:27,200
No I know it's easy to say that.

1390
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:28,140
Right I know.

1391
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:28,440
Yeah.

1392
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:30,360
I had macaroni and cheese for dinner too.

1393
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:30,920
Yeah.

1394
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:31,760
There were.

1395
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:38,600
You know many of the great performers you know in the in were in fact shamanistic.

1396
00:44:38,860 --> 00:44:45,040
Jim Morrison and there and Grace Jones sometimes there were she had her shamanistic moments.

1397
00:44:45,620 --> 00:44:47,820
She is a shamanistic moment.

1398
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:49,920
Just like my macaroni and cheese.

1399
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:55,100
You've got sacred macaroni and cheese.

1400
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:56,860
You're spending an evening at home with your family.

1401
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,860
Macaroni and cheese is like my peyote.

1402
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:04,100
My personal peyote but it's macaroni and cheese.

1403
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:05,280
Suddenly without warning.

1404
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:06,480
Great product.

1405
00:45:07,180 --> 00:45:07,940
Excuse me.

1406
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,300
Macaroni and cheese could be mind altering.

1407
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:11,860
Probably treated.

1408
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,920
Well I believe it is mind altering.

1409
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:23,060
And if you look close enough at anything I don't think acid anymore.

1410
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:26,880
But when I was a teenager about 19 years old I occasionally did.

1411
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:29,600
And I remember looking at a pile of noodles.

1412
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,220
What are you saying?

1413
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:30,840
I don't think acid.

1414
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:31,520
No it was rice.

1415
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:32,420
A pile of rice.

1416
00:45:32,460 --> 00:45:33,380
No no not you him.

1417
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:34,880
A pile of rice.

1418
00:45:35,080 --> 00:45:37,020
And it was good lord.

1419
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:40,040
A manifestation from the other side.

1420
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:40,880
The Reverend Stang.

1421
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:41,920
So good to see you.

1422
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,400
Did you say if you could explain one thing at a time you'd get more out of it?

1423
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:48,260
Is that what you said?

1424
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:49,120
Are you sure?

1425
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,340
It's Don Hagenbrenner.

1426
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:54,640
John Sherlinbrenner.

1427
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:58,420
I think it's about time for another ginger ale.

1428
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:00,660
So I will meet you on the flip side.

1429
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:01,940
Okay.

1430
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:02,560
Okay.

1431
00:46:02,700 --> 00:46:04,640
You want to drink that crap go right ahead.

1432
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:06,460
I drink club soda.

1433
00:46:07,840 --> 00:46:10,580
I hallucinated that it was an eternal plate of rice.

1434
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:11,560
That's what happened.

1435
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:13,800
Oh.

1436
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:14,560
Oh.

1437
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:15,320
Oh.

1438
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:16,060
Oh.

1439
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:16,680
Oh.

1440
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,060
Oh.

1441
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:17,240
Oh.

1442
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:17,520
Oh.

1443
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:17,940
Oh.

1444
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:18,240


1445
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:18,420


1446
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:18,920
Oh.

1447
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:18,980


1448
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:19,280


1449
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:19,380


1450
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:19,380


1451
00:46:19,460 --> 00:46:19,460


1452
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:23,120
Oh.

1453
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,640
Oh.

1454
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:28,120
Oh.

1455
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:30,340


1456
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:30,520


1457
00:46:31,020 --> 00:46:31,240
Oh.

1458
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:33,000
Oh.

1459
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,000


1460
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,000


1461
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,240
Oh.

1462
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:35,900
Oh.

1463
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,740
Oh.

1464
00:46:39,960 --> 00:46:41,360
Oh.

1465
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:43,240
out and begin to kill each other. No, actually

1466
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,280
the new subgenius

1467
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,180
headquarters is not in Cleveland

1468
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,260
at all, but in Cleveland Heights.

1469
00:46:49,740 --> 00:46:50,300
Which

1470
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,200
sacrifices the

1471
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:55,140
slack of the rest of Cleveland

1472
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,240
for its own extremely low crime

1473
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,180
rate. I live in a

1474
00:46:59,180 --> 00:47:00,820
kind of a little enclosed

1475
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,560
fortress.

1476
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:04,840
The slacker mansion,

1477
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,160
we call it. So what, Texas is just

1478
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,360
on its own now, right?

1479
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:09,040
Sorry!

1480
00:47:09,040 --> 00:47:09,640
Sorry!

1481
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:11,660
Actually,

1482
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:14,760
when I

1483
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:17,040
go to Texas, and I just came

1484
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,160
from there. The desolate

1485
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:21,220
flats of Texas. It rains.

1486
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:23,000
It rains if I visit

1487
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,080
Texas. When I leave,

1488
00:47:25,100 --> 00:47:26,940
it stops raining. It didn't rain for

1489
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:27,660
a year.

1490
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,780
At least not in Stang

1491
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,320
County, unfortunately.

1492
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,500
Until we understand it,

1493
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,620
some parts of Texas got their Katrina.

1494
00:47:36,840 --> 00:47:37,280
That's right!

1495
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,240
Time check, everyone.

1496
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:44,360
So there was like

1497
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,260
a locus of global warming,

1498
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:49,140
a cell of global warming

1499
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,540
settled over the state after you left.

1500
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,080
Well, when we had to flee

1501
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:53,620
Texas,

1502
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,540
we placed a curse

1503
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,460
upon the benighted

1504
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,320
state of Texas that there

1505
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:02,260
would be no rain

1506
00:48:02,260 --> 00:48:05,120
until such time as we returned.

1507
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,560
What kind of

1508
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,920
vehicle did you flee Texas?

1509
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,240
I'm curious.

1510
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:12,540
United Airlines, in this case.

1511
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:14,840
But he drove it on the freeway.

1512
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,300
That was the curious thing.

1513
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,200
You got to Cleveland without a car?

1514
00:48:18,380 --> 00:48:20,720
People had to drive off the road to let the

1515
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,060
747 drive by.

1516
00:48:22,060 --> 00:48:24,840
When we fled Texas

1517
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,120
to Cleveland, we went in a series

1518
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:28,400
of covered wagons

1519
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:30,860
across the prairie. We faced many

1520
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:32,820
hardships, droughts,

1521
00:48:32,820 --> 00:48:34,360
locusts, plagues.

1522
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,460
Those were the old steam wagons, right?

1523
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:36,840
Rednecks.

1524
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:37,900
Yeah.

1525
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,740
Well, no, we were the rednecks.

1526
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:41,420
All right.

1527
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,640
It's all relative.

1528
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,240
Oh, it's a tale

1529
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,640
to make the Mormons

1530
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:50,060
cringe.

1531
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:53,540
The exodus from Texas.

1532
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:55,060
It kind of has

1533
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,740
rhymes, kind of a ring to it.

1534
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,660
Exodus from Texas.

1535
00:48:57,800 --> 00:48:58,940
Exodus from Texas.

1536
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:03,280
River and Stang, I have a press

1537
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:05,160
release from the Church of the Subgenus.

1538
00:49:05,180 --> 00:49:06,220
Can I ask you about this?

1539
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:08,240
I heard you reading that on the

1540
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:10,380
limo on the way here.

1541
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:12,860
And I thought to myself, that sounds

1542
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:15,360
like a Reverend Motormat press release.

1543
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:18,000
The Church is inviting all of its members

1544
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:20,060
worldwide to gather together for the final

1545
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:21,960
hours in Sherman, New York

1546
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,040
from Thursday, 28th to July

1547
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:26,160
Thursday, July 5th at a clothing

1548
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,100
optional outdoor campground.

1549
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,360
I'm very interested to read

1550
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,320
the Church has been engaged in a massive

1551
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,380
recruitment campaign to increase the numbers

1552
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,500
of its membership for the arrival of the

1553
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:37,940
exodus.

1554
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:40,940
And it's seeking performers and producers

1555
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:42,900
from the adult entertainment industry.

1556
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:43,560
Yeah, that's right.

1557
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:46,340
We have a new adult film festival

1558
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:50,860
award ceremony that just started last year.

1559
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:56,540
It's and you know, it's just it's a way to

1560
00:49:56,540 --> 00:50:00,840
broaden the artistic reach of the church and

1561
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,680
also to get a certain amount of attention.

1562
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:06,920
If you think about it, you know, and a lot of

1563
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,020
the saints of.

1564
00:50:08,240 --> 00:50:12,780
The Church have been workers in the shall we say sex

1565
00:50:12,780 --> 00:50:16,700
industry, Kitten, a TV dog, the great saints,

1566
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:20,420
Chris Kitten, a TV dog, John Holmes and some of the

1567
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:24,580
other great saint, Wad, the giants, you might say,

1568
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:25,700
especially the plumbers.

1569
00:50:26,740 --> 00:50:29,620
Yeah, I have a special place in my heart, a very

1570
00:50:29,620 --> 00:50:33,460
large hole in my heart where the plumbers.

1571
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:35,120
Yeah, and it's still dripping through that hole.

1572
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:35,500
Isn't it?

1573
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:35,700
No.

1574
00:50:35,820 --> 00:50:36,860
Oh, yes.

1575
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:38,120
I got some.

1576
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:38,440
I'm discharged.

1577
00:50:38,780 --> 00:50:39,460
I'm off of it.

1578
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:46,940
So July 5th, it's all coming to an end and it does

1579
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:47,920
every year, basically.

1580
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:50,360
Well, we have a new apocalypse every year.

1581
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,620
And my opinion, my theory is that is that other

1582
00:50:53,620 --> 00:50:55,500
people who predict the end of the world, I read a

1583
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:56,040
list of them.

1584
00:50:56,080 --> 00:50:56,740
You might have heard some.

1585
00:50:56,780 --> 00:50:57,340
Yeah, we did.

1586
00:50:57,500 --> 00:51:00,080
I heard that other people are not diligent enough

1587
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:02,740
about bringing about the end of the world and

1588
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:03,780
predicting the end of the world.

1589
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:06,260
And the Church of the subgenius has to be praised

1590
00:51:06,260 --> 00:51:07,120
for its persistence.

1591
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:07,940
It will not.

1592
00:51:08,120 --> 00:51:08,420
Give up.

1593
00:51:08,420 --> 00:51:10,760
Our faith is absolute.

1594
00:51:11,540 --> 00:51:16,880
The aliens, the exes will arrive on July 5th, 1998,

1595
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:19,240
which obviously has not arrived yet.

1596
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:21,840
Bob said that date.

1597
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:26,220
Therefore, that date has not yet arrived.

1598
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:27,200
It was upside down.

1599
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:27,920
It's a typo.

1600
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:32,060
There's been this whole tampering with calendars,

1601
00:51:32,100 --> 00:51:33,520
which is pretty obvious.

1602
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,860
I mean, come on.

1603
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:37,580
Does anybody know what time it is?

1604
00:51:37,580 --> 00:51:38,020
I noticed.

1605
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,620
We don't know what year this is.

1606
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:40,500
We don't even know what planet.

1607
00:51:40,500 --> 00:51:42,620
The numbers seem to swim around when I look at them.

1608
00:51:42,700 --> 00:51:45,280
When I look at my calendar, the numbers seem to wobble

1609
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:47,340
and swim, but then everything else is.

1610
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:52,420
Oh, everybody's so sure that this is the year 2007.

1611
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:56,780
Oh, everybody's so sure this is planet Earth.

1612
00:51:56,960 --> 00:51:58,160
Oh, yeah, it's planet Earth.

1613
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,060
No, it's not.

1614
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:00,240
It's not.

1615
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,080
You're right, Ivan.

1616
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,240
This is not planet Earth.

1617
00:52:02,260 --> 00:52:04,200
It's just what we named it.

1618
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,460
That doesn't mean it is planet Earth.

1619
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:06,660
We don't know what the name of this planet is.

1620
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,000
Somebody's got to be kidding me.

1621
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,000


1622
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,000


1623
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,000


1624
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,000


1625
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,000


1626
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:08,000


1627
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,400
Somebody's going to come and tell us the name one day.

1628
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,420
Oh, you mean Sputnik?

1629
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:12,920
We named everything.

1630
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:16,460
Our reality is based on a house of cards,

1631
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:20,580
a teetering edifice that could fall any time

1632
00:52:20,580 --> 00:52:22,900
because it's built on a bunch of hooey.

1633
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:24,740
Yes, I'll say it.

1634
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:26,620
Hooey is what it's built.

1635
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:28,000
Foundation of hooey.

1636
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:30,540
A bunch of hoo-ha.

1637
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:32,240
Who's playing?

1638
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:33,580
2007.

1639
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,380
Two and seven means it's acting together.

1640
00:52:35,380 --> 00:52:36,920
Who's playing that song way down low?

1641
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:37,900
Maybe it's the year nine.

1642
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:38,140
Year nine.

1643
00:52:38,340 --> 00:52:39,640
Everybody be quiet a minute.

1644
00:52:39,720 --> 00:52:40,040
Hang on.

1645
00:52:40,080 --> 00:52:40,840
1998 is.

1646
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,400
This is a test.

1647
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,060
Hang on.

1648
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,160
Who is playing that song way down low?

1649
00:52:45,180 --> 00:52:46,020
Who's playing that?

1650
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:46,620
Anybody here?

1651
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:47,060
No.

1652
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:48,180
Really?

1653
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:48,460
No.

1654
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:49,620
What the hell is that?

1655
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:50,540
I don't know.

1656
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:52,000
It's like some 70s power band.

1657
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:54,860
Wait, who would expect some kind of random weird noise

1658
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,040
in the background on this show?

1659
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,760
There's some kind of radio show going on under ours.

1660
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:00,820
It's a radio show.

1661
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:01,960
It appears it sounds like.

1662
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,000
I heard some Phineas.

1663
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:04,560
It's country music.

1664
00:53:04,560 --> 00:53:05,900
Just download Phineas and I.

1665
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,540
Who is it?

1666
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,620
I heard it.

1667
00:53:07,620 --> 00:53:08,480
I heard that for a second.

1668
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,880
It was a reference to Phineas Narco.

1669
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,780
He may assert himself in some.

1670
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:15,520
Ha ha hooey.

1671
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:20,420
You know, radio waves can impinge themselves mysteriously.

1672
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:24,080
The silent radio.

1673
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:29,240
Until we understand it and master it.

1674
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:34,060
They will have to continue spending that $30.

1675
00:53:34,540 --> 00:53:35,280
Listen to that.

1676
00:53:35,320 --> 00:53:35,880
What is that?

1677
00:53:35,940 --> 00:53:36,360
Who is that?

1678
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:38,320
It's in your right ear, isn't it?

1679
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:38,580
I know.

1680
00:53:38,620 --> 00:53:39,700
It's only in the left ear.

1681
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,860
Your headphones are backwards.

1682
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:41,860
Your ears are on backwards.

1683
00:53:42,680 --> 00:53:44,180
I'd like to find out what that is.

1684
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:45,280
Hmm.

1685
00:53:46,020 --> 00:53:46,860
Oh, God.

1686
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:48,980
It sounds like Judy Collins or.

1687
00:53:50,080 --> 00:53:51,420
How could that be happening?

1688
00:53:51,660 --> 00:53:57,560
I think it's a ghost of a folk song show that was in this KPFA studio.

1689
00:53:58,760 --> 00:53:59,240
Oh.

1690
00:54:01,060 --> 00:54:01,720
What was that?

1691
00:54:01,720 --> 00:54:05,280
It's puzzling evidence who just isn't even here.

1692
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,600
He just turned something on and left.

1693
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:07,600


1694
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:07,600


1695
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:07,600


1696
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:07,600


1697
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:07,600


1698
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:09,260
Left the room with this.

1699
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,320
I can't imagine something like that.

1700
00:54:11,360 --> 00:54:12,380
Let him listen to this.

1701
00:54:12,380 --> 00:54:13,960
What is in the background, he said.

1702
00:54:14,020 --> 00:54:15,840
What is he even playing this for?

1703
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:16,260
What a surprise.

1704
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:19,840
He's out fropinating and subjecting us to folk music.

1705
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:19,840


1706
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:21,080
There's something wrong with him.

1707
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:22,160
Folk music.

1708
00:54:22,440 --> 00:54:23,120
All right.

1709
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,100
Listen to that.

1710
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,200
Blessed silence.

1711
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:26,000
They're in folk music.

1712
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,300
It always feels better when you turn it off.

1713
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:28,620
All right.

1714
00:54:28,660 --> 00:54:30,020
Take my new how to use.

1715
00:54:30,020 --> 00:54:30,660
Trust your radio.

1716
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:30,980
Okay.

1717
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:31,380
Okay.

1718
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:32,200
Trust you.

1719
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:32,900
Ow.

1720
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:34,200
I win.

1721
00:54:34,360 --> 00:54:35,580
I win every time.

1722
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:35,900
Take off.

1723
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:36,320
Wet head.

1724
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:37,220
Towel off.

1725
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:37,700
Go away.

1726
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:45,940
1, 0, 8, 4, 8, 4, 4, 2, 5.

1727
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:46,940
Is that what year this is?

1728
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:49,480
Maybe that's what year this is.

1729
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:50,420
What year is it?

1730
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,560
If it's not 2007, what year is it?

1731
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,460
If you missed that first number, this is it.

1732
00:54:56,080 --> 00:54:56,520
5.

1733
00:54:57,260 --> 00:54:57,760
That's it.

1734
00:54:58,040 --> 00:54:59,220
It's the year 5.

1735
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:00,180
1, 0.

1736
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,840
We've got 1,993 years until the end.

1737
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,200
8, 4, 8, 4, 5.

1738
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,200


1739
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,200


1740
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,200


1741
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,200


1742
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,200


1743
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,200


1744
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,200


1745
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,200


1746
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,200


1747
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,200


1748
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,200


1749
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,200


1750
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,200


1751
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:07,200


1752
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,740
And tell us what time it is where you're at.

1753
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:14,280
And tell us where you're at.

1754
00:55:14,280 --> 00:55:16,260
And tell us what day call where you're at.

1755
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:19,300
And if you're Chinese, it's a different year.

1756
00:55:21,380 --> 00:55:23,560
That's not the real Francis Deck.

1757
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,600
That is an imposter deck.

1758
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:25,860
Oh, it's not?

1759
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:27,620
No, that's not the real Deck.

1760
00:55:27,620 --> 00:55:27,680
That's right.

1761
00:55:27,780 --> 00:55:28,800
I read about this.

1762
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,800
Someone, a guy at a radio station remade his text.

1763
00:55:31,980 --> 00:55:32,220
Right.

1764
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:32,600
Yeah.

1765
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:33,700
Yeah.

1766
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:34,980
The true Francis Deck.

1767
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:36,680
It's a lot better than him, though.

1768
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:39,800
Would never have been able to enunciate those words so well.

1769
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:39,940
No.

1770
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:40,520
That's what I figured.

1771
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,460
It's probably better that it isn't.

1772
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,140
What about...

1773
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:50,900
Students in the, maybe, Logic University course in the subgenius history, the first

1774
00:55:50,900 --> 00:55:52,020
100 years...

1775
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:53,220
Yes, I have it right here.

1776
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:56,640
...are able to download the original Francis Deck texts.

1777
00:55:57,240 --> 00:55:58,500
Did he ever read his own text?

1778
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,820
I don't know.

1779
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,960
But I did get a copy of the original things that he wrote.

1780
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:05,160
That maybe it was.

1781
00:56:07,480 --> 00:56:11,660
He would use it for in- неё.

1782
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:14,680
When we got your little textbook...

1783
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,160
He was killed in the first of the stamps.

1784
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:16,420
There you go.

1785
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:21,900
He was killed in the first four and he was accused of of offending a pasadena...

1786
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,260
Well, it carbooling Junkhead...

1787
00:56:23,260 --> 00:56:25,840
I 이거 we thought, I kind of got it, I don't know, if that...

1788
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:28,080
Let me check, let me check.

1789
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:28,440
It's.

1790
00:56:29,240 --> 00:56:30,280
You know what, but this thing when he tinkered with hearts.

1791
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:31,540
You say it should've been a stick in the book.

1792
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:33,440
What are the three slacks of abenefit as I picture it?

1793
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:33,460
A tape, because of the dusty кажд.

1794
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:34,120
onnen.

1795
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:34,120


1796
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:34,120


1797
00:56:34,120 --> 00:56:34,960
9 bucks.

1798
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:34,960


1799
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,840
Yeah, sure. Now, yeah, sure.

1800
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:39,180
This was in the day, man.

1801
00:56:39,380 --> 00:56:40,540
Back in the past.

1802
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:41,040
What day?

1803
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:43,160
A thousand years ago.

1804
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:47,480
When the Church of the Subgenius was first inspired into existence.

1805
00:56:47,480 --> 00:56:49,460
When was he doing this? Early 80s?

1806
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:50,320
Is that right?

1807
00:56:50,700 --> 00:56:51,660
Francis Deck?

1808
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:52,000
Yeah.

1809
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:56,940
I got my Xerox in the early 80s, yes.

1810
00:56:57,740 --> 00:56:58,320
1982.

1811
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,160
Four billion eyesight television cameras.

1812
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,020
That's him.

1813
00:57:04,020 --> 00:57:07,360
Communist, gangster, computer god, master race.

1814
00:57:07,420 --> 00:57:08,320
Testing, testing.

1815
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:11,780
You are living, thinking, mad, deadly, worldwide communist.

1816
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:17,480
Now, the person reading the Deck text is J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1817
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:18,460
Of course, I knew that.

1818
00:57:18,620 --> 00:57:19,480
Is this thing on?

1819
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:25,860
But listen, that guy in San Francisco, do you know the guy who's putting out the, what is it,

1820
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:30,600
the set of CDs called from Monster God Computer, Communist Monster God Computer,

1821
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:31,800
something that's his label?

1822
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:34,000
And he's putting out all these outtakes.

1823
00:57:34,020 --> 00:57:36,900
Outtakes and bloopers and people freaking out.

1824
00:57:37,040 --> 00:57:38,200
Gosh, what an idea.

1825
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:39,420
Celebrity bloopers.

1826
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:44,260
But his label is named the Mad Conspiracy Computer, whatever, Communist God thing.

1827
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:45,260
That's his label.

1828
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,500
So I wondered if it was the same guy by any chance.

1829
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:48,280
Is Deck dead?

1830
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:49,240
Yes.

1831
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:49,920
Oh, good.

1832
00:57:49,980 --> 00:58:00,060
Yes, and in fact, some lads from Dallas went and videotaped him on his deathbed in a cruel mockery of his condition.

1833
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,720
Wow, I'm glad somebody did.

1834
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:03,960
I'm not really aware.

1835
00:58:04,020 --> 00:58:04,520
That's a boring video.

1836
00:58:04,680 --> 00:58:06,440
Do you have any tapes of him or something?

1837
00:58:06,480 --> 00:58:07,000
That was him.

1838
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:07,680
That was him.

1839
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,080
That was him ranting.

1840
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,680
That was someone reading the rants of Francis Deck.

1841
00:58:12,580 --> 00:58:13,620
This is his writing.

1842
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:15,000
Living dead Frankenstein slavery.

1843
00:58:15,320 --> 00:58:17,460
This is his writing with someone pretending to be him.

1844
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:18,440
Listen to it.

1845
00:58:18,480 --> 00:58:20,560
It applies today.

1846
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:22,140
Actually, he's right about that.

1847
00:58:22,380 --> 00:58:23,860
He was like a Nostradamus.

1848
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,720
It's quite amazing.

1849
00:58:25,140 --> 00:58:25,740
Only a lot more specific.

1850
00:58:25,740 --> 00:58:31,700
I mean, this is from the early 80s, and I'm still playing it, which shows you how relevant it still is after all this time.

1851
00:58:32,100 --> 00:58:33,600
What if it had been 20 years later?

1852
00:58:35,160 --> 00:58:37,380
Oh, not you, Gary.

1853
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:43,380
The man made inside out planets with nucleonic powered speed much faster than the speed of light.

1854
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:48,440
Look up and see the gangster computer god concocted new fake starry sky.

1855
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:52,300
The worldwide completely controlled deadly degenerative climate.

1856
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:56,020
It's like an anticipation of the Matrix concept.

1857
00:58:56,820 --> 00:59:01,180
Well, Alex Jones certainly has some explaining to give.

1858
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:02,320
That's Alex Jones?

1859
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:02,740
Yeah.

1860
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,840
Yeah, ask me, Alex Jones.

1861
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,860
Phony stars.

1862
00:59:09,780 --> 00:59:10,640
Phony stars.

1863
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,680
I can say lots of things.

1864
00:59:13,900 --> 00:59:14,760
Don't a bitch.

1865
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,600
Or in the scenes.

1866
00:59:15,840 --> 00:59:17,260
Coochie coochie girl taro.

1867
00:59:17,300 --> 00:59:18,340
Sing not branch.

1868
00:59:19,020 --> 00:59:22,500
You have been listening to the subgenius radio ministry hour of Slack.

1869
