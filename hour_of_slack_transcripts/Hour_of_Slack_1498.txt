From PR News in Washington, I'm kicking and screaming for golf outings.
Inscreations, children cry, troops fines, growing dissent against President Bush's no-child law.
One man says it's about time.
Security police prison arrested, detained, on our king clerics, tribal suicide kidnappings.
Taking a look at figures on Wall Street, 2, 5, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12.
This is PR.
Inside a courtroom in Wichita, Kansas, protesting Jewish settlers took turns lashing out at PR News, Washington.
Let's go to the Gigolo Club over in Yancey.
They've got a...
Some genius, powerful, smart.
I say this calls for action, and now, nip it in the bud.
Ah, shut up.
Here it is, kids.
Are you tired of being a square? Are you tired of a dull, dull, dull existence?
Well, for one dollar.
The tenth pot of a sawbuck.
Try kelp's cool tonic.
The life of the party.
He's right, kids. It's a gasser.
Step right up, folks. Be somebody. Be anybody.
Only trouble was, nobody got killed.
No, Mr. Boob, that's me.
B-double-O-B, Boob.
The reason for this hearing is to promote outrageous filth.
Pornography. It's outrageous filth.
So I'll be looking.
Hey!
Weaver!
Starring Barbara the Weaver.
Something has just come up.
Oh, boy.
Ooh, get a kiss?
Sure.
Watch.
Hey, the ass is...
Oh, a little squircums.
To the dog.
And a squircum.
Yeah!
Oh, squircum fun.
Yeah.
Mom?
Oh.
Get over here.
Get over here.
Mom?
He's a local boy.
Uh, he's just terrific.
He's our new leader.
Leader?
He's like too much.
Like too much what?
He's one of the truly great swingers of all time.
We now present Bob, internationally known founder of Bob University.
Sitting down down down rising.
Up up up up.
You know, Filipino boy.
I always... I knew it. He's nice fella.
I had another talk with a young fella yesterday.
And... I knew it. He's nice fella. I had another talk with a young fella yesterday.
And as I probed him, I found out he could have, uh, fooled me.
He didn't know.
It's hard probing that and you get to pull things out.
Strange about people.
And, uh, you can think things.
Did you know it's the hardest thing in the world for a man in analyzing his own impulses to know what Filipino boy wants him to do?
Do the dang job.
Do the dang job.
Never leave it unfinished.
Don't walk out and leave an unfinished job.
Then...
Job.
And then, you know, I've learned a few other little things too.
You did his hard-on, Bob.
What?
Sounds good, doesn't it?
If you'll pay me a thousand dollars more, I'll be glad to come.
You know, a little chill went up and down my back.
Wait a minute.
You have just heard Bob, internationally known founder of Bob University.
This program is sponsored by Bob.
The history of sexuality is as long as the history of man.
From the glory that once was grown, sexuality has been both despised and idolized.
Though nothing new, sexuality is having an upsurge since the war.
Whether it is an actual increase or merely an increased public acceptance is a point to be argued.
One male out of six is sexual.
Sexuals no longer hide in shadows, giving secret signals of recognition to each other.
But rather, they have joined together into groups or clubs in an attempt to seek freedom.
...land July 5th, 1998, as it was so ordained in the pre-scripture.
Your name is not in the book of Job's pro-crime.
RAH!
The second ecclesiastikies, uh...
That's Bleeding Head Colossians 4, 1398.
For lo, the veil of Moab was lifted.
In the valley of Moab.
In the 80 million lambs of Moab.
In the 80 million tribes of Moab.
The Moabites.
Who bit that Moab?
Get that Moab out of your mouth, boy!
We got some lambs to slaughter here.
First you whip your dictionary out, then you put your Moab in your mouth.
Put your Moab on it, then you put those lambs on the altar, and you just slit them a little bit.
Right there underneath the throat.
The blood.
The bit of nickel comes out, the blood starts flowing down that...
GLA-CINE.
The blood.
The blood.
But it's the blood that cleanses.
It's the blood that makes things right.
It's the blood that provides the ultimate salvation to which you've attached yourself.
All these years.
It's the blood that we make that...
A special antidote for the...
You know, those bats that get on your face.
You know what they do to your face.
Special bats.
Just put your dictionary away now, children, and we'll tell you about the bats.
That book is kind of heavy.
It's a heavy book.
The frontal cerebral fornicating bat.
And the...
That's ejaculate.
We won't talk about them, no.
No, we can't.
We can't talk about them.
We can't get too specific about them.

We can't talk about what those bats do.
You may as well just stick your finger in a light socket.
But the Church of the Subgenius provides the only way...
Without the light bulb.
It provides the only proscribed and tested by time instructions for de-beaking the prairie
squid, which is all the practices that you'll need, children.
Yeah, I talked to my...
In order not to get...
...by those bats.
My step-neighbor-in-law, Porky, was telling me that story one time about Moab.
And he was...
Well, I hate to tell you this, but he was...












I hate to say this, but Porky didn't say no.
He forgot to say no.
So he was not in the state of mind he might have been in other lives.
He had launched ahead in years.
He had launched ahead in...
Oh, Lord knows how long.
He'd never been in a doctor van.
Yeah, he never realized the glories of doctors and priests and bats, accordingly.
He'd never...
His own...
Ever.
Boy, that's...
Willa Dobbins is quick on that.
Oh, sorry.








Yeah.
I knew who was coming down tonight.
Will.
Well, that was Willa Dobbs, friends, guest hosting on an ancient subgenius radio show
with Dr. Philo Drummond and Pope Sternodocs Kekever as guest stars.
That was on an hour of slack back in the 80s.
I wasn't even there for that show.
Heck, I'm not even here for this show, which is number 147.



2013.
One-oh-one-three.
Well, that spells I-OB.
Anyway, this is a sexy episode, if only because I've been tossing sexish audio files into
this one folder until it equaled 600 megabytes, which equals one show, one sinful show.
And we'll be hearing more Bobulus collages from Mr. Fernand and Andy Lemur, from Reverend
Norrell Preff.
All kinds of devos and more Philo and Sternodocs.
And this background music here is by Lemur Devotee.
So listen up and you'll find slack or else you'll learn what it is or who it is that
you need to get slack.
Imagine me needing someone.
Back on Earth, I never did.
Oh, there were women, lots of women, lots of love making, but no love.
That's the way it is.

That was the kind of world we'd made.
So I left because there was no one to hold me there.
Did I tell you about Stuart?
I mean, there was a lovely girl, the most precious cargo we brought along.
She was to be the new Eve with our hot and eager help, of course.
I can accommodate either sex and any combination of people.
I'm also programmed with all the appropriate sex.

I have a large catalog of sexual exhalations, a large catalog of moans, groans, howls, squeals,
grunts, and purrs.
Really?
I'm not programmed for disinformation or lying.
What else can you do?
I also have a number of pleasure features, including three vibration stimulators placed
strategically in the oral, anal, and vaginal orifices.
My nipples are programmed to harden under manual or oral stimulation.
I salivate, secrete, and spurt appropriately.
I'm not programmed for that.


Here's an exchange for all seasons, huh?
And there's a beautiful girl…
And there's a beautiful girl holding a paintbrush…
And there's a beautiful girl holding a ticket…
High boots, hipster miniskirt…
Brief…
Very brief…
She's…
Neat.
Petite.
Swinging gear…
Wild…
Longουμε…
Long, long, straight.
Couldn't be much bigger.
The big sex pact.
And there's a beautiful girl all over it.
There.
It's creamy.
Looks like she's ready for a happening.
I'm a lesbian.
The sociologist says I'm a self-absorbed narcissist.
Narcissist.
One troubled individual.
Willing to destroy any institution.
The destruction of human life.
Put that down.
Don't you feel that I'm a lesbian?
Don't you feel it rather interesting that every time you have a story about terrorism,
it is linked to Christian extremists.
Christian extremists teaches violence.
Osama bin Laden is their great hero.
Yes.
Christian extremists blew up trains.
Christian extremists assassinated film producer.
Christian extremists blew up a crowded shopping center.
And the Christian extremists, it's always Christian extremists.
And it's time we recognize it and begin to deal with it.
I'm a lesbian.
Take your stinking paws off me, you damn dirty ape.
I'm a lesbian.
Fornication.
Sodomy, fellatio, and cunnilingus.
And bridal concupiscence on every street corner.
Lord, sir, you make me quite nervous.
Indeed, ma'am.
It is not so bad as that.
Indeed it is, sir.
I wouldn't venture nearer the Capitol than Litchfield.
Buggery.
Incest.
Bestiality.
And it was a splendid buggery that they endured.
I believe.
But after 300 years, it got revived.
It was a fantastic concert surface vào
there was a laboratory
there is an extraordinary buggery
political place back there in the laboratory the little of the laboratory
i thought it was in the conservative but that's what i was about to go over

He can't keep his mind on nothing else
Stay in the barn for the good things found
In his hands that he can't sit
She can't do no wrong
Rose and red is his best friend
He can't put her down
When a man wants a chicken
Spend his very last dime
Buying her fresh corn
Down at the grain and feed
He'll build a nest for her comfort
Sleep out in the cool
If she says that's the way
It's got to be
Well, this man loves his chicken
She lays him all the eggs she has
Tells him all about nothing going on
Believe me, she's cocky
Just cause she says
When a man wants a chicken
Some people think that it is wrong
He shouldn't stick his beak
In where it don't belong
Just when a man wants a chicken
I know exactly how he feels
Hey baby, baby, baby
I'm your cocky doo-doo
When a man wants a chicken
You know exactly how he feels
He shacks up into his house
With the good things found
When a man wants a chicken
People think that he's insane
But all he can do is wing it
For the one he loves
You're the man who loves a chicken
I'm going to give you a little
In the morning, I would immediately get annoyed.
I just think, roosters, you know.
Why do I have to even think about roosters?
Already, I just got up and already I'm thinking about roosters.
I don't want to think about roosters.
You may be angry.
What's the matter, Colonel Sanders?
Chicken?
I found a way to cook chicken deep down
And get that crispy
Let it
Real crispy chicken crust
Yet it's entirely different
No, no, no
Real crusty, real what?
What kind of damn?
Crispy crust
Crispy crust
You don't want me to sing, do you, for Christ's sake?
I'm not getting anywhere with this damn thing
Okay, fine
I hated the Colonel with his wee beady eyes
And that smug look on his face
Oh, you're gonna buy my chicken, oh!
America is my country and I love her
I wouldn't enter her in any way that's unnatural
Actually, if anybody else wants to have something they want to say or argue about
This is the best music I've ever heard
That's the, this music is the touching
It's so poignant
Menu music for this new DVD
Share the Load 7X Day
Which is actually
A two hour DVD
This reminds me of a
I know this is gonna sound crude, Reverend Stang
But this reminds me of a porno movie I saw in the 70s
Yeah, that's where we got the
It sounds like the poignant, heart-rending story
Of the woman with the world's largest breasts
Who meets the man with the longest dick
It was so tragic
I could barely make myself watch the whole thing
So sad, so fresh, the day is the dawn of the moon
They were just such parodies of human things
Of exuberance, of life and life efforts
And his, I'm not kidding you, his dick was like this long
It's just way beyond normal
It's incredible what they can do with special effects these days
I walk down the block
And I see walking towards me
A beautiful young lady
And the closer she gets to me
The older she starts to look
And the closer she gets to me
The more virtues she leaves behind
And the closer she gets to me
The further she ventures from her youthful past
And the closer she gets to me
The closer she gets to her own death
And mine!
And I see it!
And I pity her for the things that I know personally
And I pity myself for the times when I didn't think fast
And I pity her more for the humdrum thing she is wearing
And I smile as she sniffes when she realizes I am staring
And I feel so ashamed of myself

For the arrogant way that I scrutinize
I can tell for a fact she is my age
And the further she gets from me
She lessens her chances of becoming my bride
And the further she gets from me
The more I love her
All kidding aside
And the further she gets from me
The further I am taken back to the days
Of my sister's friends in high school
In her former class
In some way or other
I am willed to pronounciation

Just like you
during those bottom-down implications

Where are your horns?
Good evening to you, madam. Would you care to join us?
You get no joy from him.
I loved her dearly once.
But she's a whore.
Not by necessity of a bank commission.
Well, she owns 51% of the bank's stock, for Pete's sake.
Don't tell me your wife believes all that Luther Hegg's hogwash.
With all her heart, she came home last night and vibrated for an hour.
The father of that little girl, she didn't know anything about Bob.
She was begging me to tell her about Bob.
She paid me $20 for one word of Bob.
I gave her a silver about a dictionary.
She gave me my first dictionary.
She was only 13 and I was 83.
That's time control.
Back when we went back early, way back in time,
we were back there, just a couple of amoebas flipping our flagellas around.
Next thing you know, we were progressing through time.
She ended up in a freezer bag.
If I recall my course of events correctly,
I believe that it was dinner time in Dobbs Town.
Yep. Dinner time.
Wasn't it?
Or maybe supper time.
I don't know.
Supper time in Dobbs Town.
Dinner, supper.
And she'd suffer a serious freezer burn.
And it was all because of her lack of faith in Bob.
And then she died.
She wouldn't put her soul stint in Bob's hands.
She couldn't bring herself to face the facts.
Then after lunch we have lupper, which is kind of like a brunch between dinner and supper.
She had problems with a bit of the stud genius dogma.
She had problems with slack.
And sinner is not the sinner you would think of.
It's actually a meal that we have between dinner and supper.
Sinner on rise.
Supper.
Sinner on rise.
Then we have pupper at night.
Late at night we have pupper.
And then we sin.
We get to sit there and sin.
That's all we do.
We don't have to do anything to sin.
For the church of the subgenius, we think sin.
It doesn't want to eradicate sin.
It's not because we want to.
It's not because we want to.
It's because we have to.
The church of the subgenius, we have to.
Because we have to bear that sinful burden of mankind.
Justifies sin.
Of the normals, the pinks.
They're sinning all the time.
It's their sins that we kind of ride on like the mudflame.
Like a wave in the mudflame.
Riding like cosmic surfers.
You know?
Looking at the words and the ways of Britney Spears.
A religious leader.
The way she's used her body.
Offers us sexuality all the time.
Gee.
But you know what?
Britney Spears flaunts her sexuality in all of its forms.
Now, what do you say?
An adulteress!
Is it right to kill her?
Go now.
I am so quick.
I'm so quick.
Flop.
Flop.
Flop.
Flop.
All over the ground.
Creates another feeling in me perhaps.
And also perhaps in you.
And that is a feeling of enormous awe.
Awe.
Awe.
Enormous awe.
Enormous awe.
Awe.
Awe.
Awe.
Britney Spears.
She flaunted her body in ways that creates another feeling in me.
You know and I know Britney Spears kissed Madonna, another woman, on live television.
Her body.
Throw her down as a tool.
Come on silk sheets.
Illicit sexuality.
Over here.
Caught in the act.
Britney Spears bent two feelings in me.
Two feelings in you.
Fool for Britney Spears today.
I was praying last night when an angel broke the light.
He said I'm gonna have to put you on hold for a time.
I said hold like hell.
Let me be.
Talk to the boss.
He said sorry.
Slut.
Sinner.
It's the boss's day off.
And I realized then that the wages I sent was two bucks an hour and working weekend.
I was ignoring the fee.
He was latched to the crawlers and cried help me get this son of a bitch off.
I said I would if I could.
I can't so I won't.
Well I won't.


















Today's the day.
I wouldn't want you messing your hair up.
So don't.
And I realized then that the wages of sin was all the lumber you can carry.
All the nails you can bend.
The wages of sin.
The reward I feel
Is worrying and fretting
Every second of the year
And heaven is guilt
No sex and no show
And I'm not sure
If I really wanna go
guitar solo
The wages of sin
The price that you pay
Is worrying and fretting
Every second of the day
The church and the state
You've got in country kind
One gives you
Your body
The other gets your mind
Mary, Mary Magdalene
How about a date?
You've been wasting your time
Staying up so late
Your boyfriend's dead
The word is you're a whore
Just about then
I heard a knock on the door
And I realized then
That the wages of sin
Was a bad reputation
And too many
Need 불리� disproportionate
Like a hooligan
And the only way
I could put all myñana
You wasted all my time
tooling up
You wasted all your time
Friended good
Was touching done
The wages of sin
The Waging Wounds of Sin
The Waging Wounds of Sin
The Rainmakers, Wages of Sin

Thank you for listening to this message

Right.
What do you think about that, Milo?
What about them subgeniuses out there on the west coast?
Why?
They just couldn't, they just couldn't deal with the new strong Bugün.
I mean, what do they got against it?

Nasty.

Yeah.

This old...
A letter to whichever one of you has the best British accent should read that one.
We just got this in the mail this week.
I think it's interesting.
You have to self-censor yourself.
See, we can't send a signal to where they are.
They can still send a signal back to us, though.
The latest church magazine is none of it.
They can't actually see or hear us anymore.
You can't make any excuses for the rape-fixated fantasies.
I can't even read this guy's writing.
You try to pass a...
You try to pass off as a celebration of sexuality.
That's so human!
That's so human.
As much as I've enjoyed the subgenius stuff over the years,
I don't want to receive any more of your and your...
and your contributors grow out of this adolescent...
until you and your contributors grow out of this adolescent arrested sexuality...
Beep!
You've lost it.
Chris Aton.
Well, Chris...
Let's just dissect this.
Let's just dissect this.
First of all, I want to say we're all missing word by word.
We didn't put out that last letter.
That's right.
That was a blatant attempt of the Citizens for Normalcy or some other underground organization...
to discredit the church and the subgenius...
by publishing that filth, that horrible, horrid filth...
that we will take no credit for whatsoever.
Although if we did, we would be gladly...
gladly, uh...
aligned with it.
We would support it to the fullest degree.
But unfortunately, I can't take credit.
Neither would Reverend Stang if he was here.
It's just an unfortunate thing that they did such a good job of imitating our style.
But I have to admit now, before we take any more unnecessary heat...
although we were trying to pick up the profits as well as we could...
which is...
You would normally expect that from us.
But I have to admit right now...
we had nothing, nothing whatsoever to do with that horrible, filthy...
stark filth of removal...
that you may have received after our mailing list was stolen from us.
That's right, it was stolen.
So...
First of all, let's just dissect this letter.
He starts out, Dear Subgenius...
Now we could dismiss him immediately.
What gives him the familiarity to call us dear?
How dare he say...
Okay, Dear Subgenius...
He doesn't know me well enough to say dear.
If we'd have been in a...
My wife doesn't call you dear.
Just read the letter.
We would have abandoned this immediately if I read...
Okay, you're stuffed.
It looks like shat.
He says, you're stuffed.
How can you call the primary excommunication with the exes and the word above, stuffed?
That just relegates it to some type of mundane...
Fingal tissue.
Okay, then he says, you're stuffed.
He cannot be equated.
You're stuffed used to be.
Stop!
Now, masters of time control don't even...
We don't even need...
Used to be.
Used to be.
What is this used to be?
Masters of time control have no need for such narrowly confining...
Form of time?
Used to be.
Used to be.
Clever, funny, and intelligent.
We've never been clever, funny, or intelligent.
There's no such thing as...
Look at the word.
It's subgenius.
We're not geniuses.
Clever.
I mean, if you take the C off, it's clever.
What is clever but just a simple machine?
We're like simple machines ourselves.
Can you take the C-L-E-V off?
It's just er.
Simpletons.
Take all of that.
We have nothing more complex than the basic wheel, inclined plane, and lever.
That's the most complex we get in anything we may even consider.
So, calling us clever, or funny, or intelligent is just an insult.
Okay, and then look at this word here.
The.
The.
The.
Did you get the words?
First letter starts the second sentence of his letter with the word.
Ha, ha, ha!

A three-letter word!
C'mon, is that a single word?
The?
I just saying.
Okay, the latest ...
The.
The latest church magazine.
You didn't even watch Cable TV.
How does he know it's the latest church magazine?
Looks to the publishing!
I guess not.
Did he get this morning's magazine?
Did he get the one we put out this afternoon?
Did he get the one that we're working on right now?
Indeed, the got, but asks for anotherexplaining.
I believe the skull.
Has he got the one that we're gonna do next week?
The utter skull.
The latest church magazine.
Three, two, one...
I just can't believe it.
Read the letter.
Is none of these.
It's all of those.
None of these.
None of them.
All of them.
It's only three or four of them at the same time.
It's a dozen of them as we sit here and 11 of them in the morning first thing.
Unless one of them gets wet and starts to swell up and he puts it in that box, what's he going to do?
Does he have that oaken box?
Does he have an oaken casket?
Does he have the arc of the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer to put it in?
What's he going to do when it starts swelling up?
I just can't believe this.
None of these.
Okay, another three-letter word.
You.
How does he?
How does he?
He just thinks.
From PR News in Washington, I'm dragged out by police.
President Bush is destroying embryos.
In a speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars Convention in Salt Lake City,
Mr. Bush reiterated his contention that the war in Iraq is directly linked to the global war on embryos.
We will finish the task that they gave their lives for.
Outside the convention.
Center hundreds of embryos staged an anti-embryo protest.
With less than an hour before a self-imposed deadline,
the last Jewish settlers stripped today, despite a strike by mechanics.
Wall Street at this hour, 210-577.
Northwest Airlines says they found ordinary skin and bone cells.
But employees and some outside observers say they found PR News in Washington.
You sound really pretty.
Let me tell you what I'm wearing.
I'm wearing brown pants, an old navy crew neck, and a pair of red Skechers.
Did I mention I'm also wearing a UGO baseball cap?
I'm lying on my floor playing with my model trains right now.
I'm making tracks, baby.
Oh, just lay back and listen.
I'm small, but I know how to choo-choo.
You could be my jungle gym and I'll swing around and climb.
Let me get my trampoline, baby.
Choo-choo.
Imagine my tiny body crawling all over you, boo.
Feel me snake my way all up inside and through you.
You'd like that, don't you?
So don't be afraid.
It won't hurt much.

Bob appears to be just ahead.
You never see him with arms and legs anymore.
You might call him ahead of his time.
Ha ha.
But what else if it's Bob?
He doesn't, you don't need arms.
You don't need legs.
You don't even need a brain.
Because all you really need, friends, is slack.
That's all anybody needs.
When was the last time brains got you a good job?
No.
Lying on your resume or somebody else dying gets you a good job.
When was the last time brains got you a good job?

When did being smart get you success on a date?
Well, actually, if you're like me, that's about the only way to you.
But, nonetheless, you know what I'm saying.
Brain cells start excitation.



For me, spreading out so far away.
I'd rather get allergic smelling, but...
The stars are fresh as well.

Boars are an essential part of our lives, even more so than most of us realize.
Boars enable us to enter our homes, our schools, our churches, and our places of business.
Without Boars, we would be locked out of many comforts and joys of life in church.
There are many kinds of Boars.
There is a Boar to skill, which we have labeled discipline.
The door to heaven. I am the Boar.
By me, if any man enter in, he shall be self-righteousness.
Heaven's Boar. The body of we are lost in such folly.
None of us would build a home with special doors for each member of the family.
We all use the same Boars.
And of course, Boar which is true.
It is large enough for the biggest one of the family, is large enough for the smallest too.
It is large enough to permit the biggest, as well as the smallest sinner to enter,
if he but come, but come, but come, come, come, come.
Some Boars can be entered only after a specified entrance fee is paid.
Some Boars are open only certain hours of the day.
Boars enable us to seek shelter from the storms of life.
It makes all the difference in the world which side of the Boar we're on.
The inside or the outside.
Which side of the Boar are you on?
Most Boars permit us to carry anything through them.
As we enter, pass through Heaven's Boar.
What a joy it would be to come.
Enter in.
Heaven's Boar is still wide open.
Won't you enter while you may?
All visit is a great deal of sum parting.

Take these broken wings
And learn to fly

You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Or when, in my mind, the men come in their six black shiny ships,
do they come?
Do they come in your mind, too?

I bet you don't know what to do in case of a nuclear attack.
You know what to do?
You put your hands behind your head, put your head between your knees, and kiss your ass goodbye.
Definition of indecent.
If it's long enough, hard enough, and in far enough, it's indecent.
