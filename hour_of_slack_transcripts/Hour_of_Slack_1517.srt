1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,700
At the moment I'm thinking about my reputation.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,560
You're going to marry me, Bob.

3
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:10,940
Listen, I've told you how it's going to be and you might as well get used to the idea.

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,300
Because if I have to, I'll smear you, Bob.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,560
I'll ruin you for...

6
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,440
The Hour of Swag.

7
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:57,320
THE HOUR OF SWAGGER

8
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:25,740
THE HOUR OF SWAGGER

9
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,780
THE HOUR OF SWAGGER

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:29,880
THE HOUR OF SWAGGER

11
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:59,460
THE HOUR OF SWAGGER

12
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,900
THE HOUR OF SWAGGER

13
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:59,980
THE HOUR OF SWAGGER

14
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,600
THE HOUR OF SWAGGER

15
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,980
Yeah, let's start from the top.

16
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,080
Turkeys and hams.

17
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:56,340
You'll also need to be aware of moving things, electrical critters and contaminant things,

18
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,440
radioactive sources, and even loud objects, loud sounds.

19
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:19,880
Turkeys.

20
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:23,240
For more information, visit subgenius.com.

21
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,960
What a good idea.

22
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:34,860
And thank you, Reverend DU8, for another steaming sack of slack.

23
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:41,120
And before that, we heard a song from somebody new to Hour of Slack.

24
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:49,040
I got a letter and a link from a band called Hombres del Mar.

25
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,240
Hombres del Mar.

26
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,180
With a song called Uberman.

27
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,280
And that was the clean version.

28
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:06,080
The internet version will be very different from the one heard on our beloved broadcast stations.

29
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:08,200
Yeah, Uberman.

30
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:12,820
The lyrics of Uberman are borrowed from the brag of the subgenius,

31
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:24,160
which I will admit to having written myself when I was 22, I think, and I'm 61 now.

32
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:25,660
And that's like the...

33
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:26,920
Fourth?

34
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:33,300
No, more like the sixth or seventh musical version of that old rant of mine.

35
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,800
It just resonates all over the place, dude.

36
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,680
It's a resonating food.

37
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:42,300
But I have a little rant here, but not by me.

38
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,940
Written by Reverend Fid Chooley.

39
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,640
And it was posted on the Scrub Genius Forum.

40
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,400
I'm going to read it.

41
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,760
People had been asking,

42
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,880
What's going to happen to the church in the future?

43
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,760
Meaning the church of the subgenius.

44
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,880
What's going to happen to the church in the future?

45
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:05,740
And Fid Chooley says,

46
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:07,380
Humbug.

47
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,220
The question at hand should be one that we all answer for ourselves.

48
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:17,220
What am I going to do with the influence I have drawn from the church of the subgenius?

49
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,780
This is a better question because it's one we can answer now,

50
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,340
as opposed to the previously quoted question,

51
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:25,580
which is a wait and see type deal.

52
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:32,260
Buddha said something to the effect that a man shot by a stranger with an arrow

53
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:36,400
should first ask how to take the arrow out

54
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,480
instead of doing what most people do,

55
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:40,540
which is bleed to death with the arrow still in them

56
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:44,280
while they frantically try to figure out who shot him and why.

57
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:51,700
To that end, if every one of us put all our energy into figuring out the fate of the church down the road,

58
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,500
then the church would, in fact,

59
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,060
already be over at that moment.

60
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,220
Similarly, if there were to be some kind of power struggle,

61
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:07,800
a tug of war as to which schism was the rightful inheritors of Bob,

62
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,680
then both sides would have missed the point, no?

63
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,920
We who are here are all here right now.

64
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:21,040
Are you going to wait until the flood starts before you build your ark?

65
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,220
Are you going to wait?

66
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,540
Till X-Day, the real X-Day,

67
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,900
before you build your saucer?

68
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:32,540
If you're hearing these words here on Hour of Slack,

69
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,280
then you've probably been exposed to the church of the subgenius

70
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,440
long enough to have the manual for building your own saucer.

71
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:41,680
But there are still a lot of others out there

72
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,400
who will mistake the manual itself for the building materials.

73
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,640
A saucer cannot be built using the building instruction manual itself

74
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,320
as the only building materials.

75
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,800
Toilet paper, however, can.

76
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:58,160
And once you've memorized the manual,

77
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,340
toilet paper is all the manual's good for.

78
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,520
And after getting it,

79
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:05,780
toilet paper is really the only thing it's good for

80
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,280
other than helping others to get out of the bathroom.

81
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,260
Getting it is not the goal, but the first step.

82
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,380
Toilet paper does get you out of the bathroom,

83
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:23,660
but if you don't leave the bathroom to engage in something more than pooping,

84
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,460
then what difference does it really make in the end?

85
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,680
Pun intended, as you're still a poopy butt either way.

86
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,440
Look, I know I'm pretty much preaching to the choir

87
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,980
by saying this on the show,

88
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,780
but the point had to be made.

89
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,740
It's been said that

90
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:45,120
beep them if they can't take a joke

91
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,220
is the greatest or only truth told by the church,

92
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,240
but I'll take build your own saucer

93
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,740
over beep them if they can't take a joke.

94
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,760
I'll take a joke any day,

95
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:59,100
because building your own saucer isn't just saying beep them,

96
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:01,200
it's actually doing it.

97
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,820
And I'd rather be counted among those who are doing the beeping

98
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:07,720
than those who are talking about it, right?

99
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,940
Bottom line, the topic of what happens to the church

100
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,300
after its founders are no longer with us is a red herring.

101
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,600
When it comes to the church and the subgenius right now and always,

102
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,140
we should be infinitely more concerned with inspiration

103
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,360
rather than expiration.

104
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,440
Otherwise, we are truly doing a great disservice

105
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,960
to said founders and ourselves

106
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:34,520
and most importantly, Bob.

107
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:40,260
May Bob awaken your latent emergentilianism

108
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:42,460
and if it is awakened,

109
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:45,280
may you draw slack in sustaining it.

110
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,280
Yours truly, Fid.

111
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,680
Reverend Fid Chooley,

112
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,640
who last week,

113
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:55,920
we quoted with his shorter rant,

114
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,280
less terrorism, more care-or-ism.

115
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,480
And, uh...

116
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,740
And...

117
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,020
Yes, yes, yes.

118
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:05,880
Yes, yes, yes.

119
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,860
I do have some, um...

120
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:11,440
a great old recording of Einstein's Secret Orchestra.

121
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:15,580
I think it's a rehearsal

122
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:19,560
recorded in the late Chesmith's basement

123
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,880
with you and me and Dave

124
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,740
and...

125
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:24,920
And it was before a show.

126
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,340
The rehearsal was probably better than the show.

127
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,720
But I'm gonna play that in a minute.

128
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,280
I do have yet another rant

129
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:35,820
I'd like to whip out here.

130
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:37,600
It's not...

131
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
Again, this one's not by me.

132
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,480
I wonder if I should put different music on for this.

133
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,080
Sure, why not?

134
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,920
They're all from the same basic source.

135
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:52,780
Uh...

136
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,880
Well, this is one...

137
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,120
Believe it or not, I got this off the CNN website.

138
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:57,340
It was an editorial.

139
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,880
But it's about Texas, and it's by a Texan.

140
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:04,900
And I used to be almost a Texan.

141
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:05,880
So...

142
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,520
And I thought it was really funny.

143
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,220
And I'm gonna go ahead and read it

144
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:14,280
because it's gonna tick off a bunch more Texans.

145
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:15,620
Praise Bob.

146
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,740
And it's titled,

147
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,220
We Texans Are Brave Enough to Resist the Pentagon.

148
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,440
By James C. Moore.

149
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,660
And it's a letter.

150
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,280
Dear America,

151
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,620
I write to you from behind the lines

152
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,860
in the last free state of Texas

153
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:38,980
as we prepare to resist the invasion of Jade Helm 15.

154
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:44,900
While General Travis laid in a supply of extra beeves

155
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,960
in advance of the Mexican assault at the Alamo,

156
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,520
we are fearful of running low on Slim Jims and Moon Pies

157
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:55,780
as the Walmarts are turned into detention centers

158
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:58,920
for citizens robbed of their constitutional rights.

159
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,880
As POWs, or prisoners of Walmart,

160
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,240
we expect to be put to work in the sporting goods department

161
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,740
against our will while earning below minimum wage.

162
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,680
We've had one encounter with the commander of the invading force

163
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:17,080
during a hearing in Bastrop, Texas.

164
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:22,080
Lieutenant Colonel Mark Lastoria was deceptively polite and informative,

165
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:25,440
but Texans don't fall for those characteristics.

166
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,880
We don't need facts.

167
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,540
In Chuck Norris, we trust,

168
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,760
and he has informed us that this is an attempt

169
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:35,140
by the Kenyan socialist in the White House

170
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:37,600
to surrender our country to the United Nations.

171
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:40,920
We've heard the talk that this is a training exercise

172
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,620
in seven southwestern states to prepare U.S. troops

173
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,160
for new types of war fighting,

174
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,280
but Chuck Norris said,

175
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:50,240
quote,

176
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,760
it's not crazy to think that we're going to be able to do this.

177
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,580
It's not crazy to think Obama would invade Texas.

178
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:58,340
So that's what we believe.

179
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:00,900
Our brave governor, Greg Abbott,

180
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,720
has ordered the Texas State Guard

181
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,700
to establish listening posts

182
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:07,220
to monitor Jade Helm exercises

183
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:12,420
in case America's soldiers come to take our guns,

184
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,020
Duck Dynasty paraphernalia,

185
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,280
Lone Star beer pickup trucks, and bass boats.

186
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,820
His command has left only a few of us confused.

187
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,680
The governor says,

188
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:25,320
he honors the military at the same time he sends a message

189
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,120
that he distrusts their activities.

190
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,460
We're concerned that our previous governor, Rick Perry,

191
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,460
has transcended Abbott's intellect.

192
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:35,380
Perry can't remember three things at once,

193
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,980
but he thinks paranoia over Jade Helm is not warranted.

194
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:41,660
We expect the Jade Helm troops

195
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,320
to seduce our population with the profits

196
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,520
from selling gas, food, and lodging,

197
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,960
but we will be vigilant.

198
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,120
We have our radios tuned

199
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:52,760
to technology,

200
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:55,380
such as wheat,

201
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:55,380


202
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:55,380


203
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:55,380


204
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,200
and we watch the

205
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:57,940
utos'

206
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:58,740
frantic

207
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,500
glasses

208
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:03,300
twinkle

209
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:03,940
when

210
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,140
our

211
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,840
waters

212
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,760
tell

213
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,180
around

214
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,340
that

215
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:22,220
the

216
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:30,900
Todd Smith, a Republican, wrote the governor to tell him that his, quote, pandering to idiots, unquote, had made him livid.

217
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:39,040
Although Smith served 16 years in the Texas House, he seems to have salvaged a troubling intelligence.

218
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:53,660
He told Governor Abbott, quote, I'm horrified that I have to choose between the possibility that my governor actually believes this stuff and the possibility that my governor doesn't have the backbone to stand up to those who do.

219
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,020
I'm not sure which is worse.

220
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,680
But be not afraid, America.

221
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:59,160
We are Texans.

222
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:04,780
We will resist logic and intelligence to the very bitter end.

223
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:09,020
And we will keep up our traditions from the Alamo to the Buckeye.

224
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,080
The Battle of Goliad.

225
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,400
The Confederacy.

226
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:12,880
LBJ's Vietnam.

227
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,480
George W. Bush's Iraq War.

228
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:18,140
And even Jerry Jones' Dallas Cowboys.

229
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:21,080
We have a long legacy of losing.

230
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,980
And the odds are also against us in the coming battle of Jade Helm.

231
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:29,640
But we expect to prevail against the invaders.

232
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,580
And we will not give up our rights.

233
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,880
Or our air conditioning, cold beer, and Slim Jims.

234
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,640
Signed,

235
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,420
a patriotic Texan.

236
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,880
James C. Moore.

237
00:16:44,180 --> 00:16:47,460
Not to be confused with James Seymour.

238
00:16:49,040 --> 00:17:01,940
And now, back in time to something recorded by us and Chaz and Dave and Einstein's secret orchestra.

239
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:08,080
These phobias can be countered.

240
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:08,460
.

241
00:17:09,040 --> 00:17:15,080
No, but those insects were there the night Harry went over the edge.

242
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:17,260
.

243
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:17,420
.

244
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:20,280
.

245
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:22,560
.

246
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:22,580
.

247
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:22,580


248
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,580


249
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:36,380
And how can we surmise that from this incident,

250
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,940
the head of J.R. Bob Dobbs did emerge into the illustrious as a numinous being?

251
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,500
I don't know, but you can find out by coming to the X-Day Drill

252
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,900
on July 5th through 7th this year

253
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:52,480
and every year from now to X-Day!

254
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,460
That's right, Ivan, that's right!

255
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:59,420
Remember to call for free information about the amazing X-Day Drill.

256
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,600
Yes, it's like the legendary Dockstock Gathering.

257
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,100
That's right, Ivan, that's right, Ivan!

258
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,420
Oh, you'll see the most hated preachers of the subgenius church.

259
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,740
You'll camp out on a lovely, fully developed campground

260
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:17,900
surrounded by geeks you'd rather not ever spend much time with.

261
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:21,320
But by God, you'll know more about the church of the subgenius

262
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,140
because, friends, you will have...

263
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,980
practiced for that fatal day,

264
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,620
that glorious day, X-Day!

265
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,020
Yes, only two years from now, in 1998,

266
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,800
the sex goddesses from Planet X shall come

267
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,280
in their space vessels

268
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,360
and rupture up the news playing

269
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:42,380
fully Dobbs-approved subgenius ministers.

270
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,040
That's right, Ivan!

271
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,340
All 4,000 of us,

272
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,200
and destroy the rest of the planet.

273
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:47,820
That's right, Ivan!

274
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,120
Well, not destroy it,

275
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,340
but turn it back into the stinking swamp

276
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,100
that it was before the filthy,

277
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,360
the humans came along and muddied everything up.

278
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:58,340
But, friends, you can come along and muddy everything up.

279
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,840
You can wallow in the filth.

280
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,680
You can dance all night.

281
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:04,260
You can pull your clothes off

282
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:05,860
and county law doesn't care

283
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:09,180
because we are having the first X-Day drill

284
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:11,540
this July 5th through 7th.

285
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:12,860
Sunday, Sunday!

286
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:13,840
Sunday!

287
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,840
You'll see the pill.

288
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:19,300
You'll see the bleeding head of Arnold Palmer.

289
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,020
It lives, it bleeds for you.

290
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,080
If you...

291
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,300
You don't vomit your money back,

292
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:28,580
friends, you will see things you wouldn't dare believe,

293
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,360
things you never wanted to believe

294
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:32,360
and things you'll wish you never saw.

295
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:33,240
That's right, Ivan.

296
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,300
Yetis will be copulating in the bushes.

297
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:37,020
Oh, dude!

298
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,000
The Loch Ness Monster will rise up from the little pond.

299
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:44,660
The crazed pagan drummers will drum all night long

300
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,780
and keep you from sleeping.

301
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,680
Mosquitoes the size of Dobson flies

302
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,940
will devour you, but you won't care!

303
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,500
You won't care!

304
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:56,280
Because you spent your money and came to the X-Day drill

305
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,620
July 5th through 7th in Brushwood, New York.

306
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,380
Brushwood, New York.

307
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,260
Only three hours from Cleveland.

308
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:04,560
And friends, you can call for information

309
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,100
216-0060338

310
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,520
I'll give that number again.

311
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:13,660
Write that number down.

312
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,020
It's the free information divinable hotline

313
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,020
at the Church of the Subgenius here in Cleveland.

314
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,260
0060338

315
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,480
That's 0060338.

316
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:22,480


317
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:24,880
0060338

318
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,580
What do those numbers add up to?

319
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:28,140
Aha! Now you know the secret.

320
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,580
Now you know what we're really trying to tell you about.

321
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,460
The froth. Yes, the froth.

322
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,420
There's no end to it.

323
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,640
I have a bucket of froth.

324
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:36,200
Back tubs full of froth.

325
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,040
Three months tired.

326
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:38,120
That's why I have a froth.

327
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:41,220
A different ancient Tibetan ocean full of froth.

328
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:41,660
Oh, dude!

329
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,480
Ancient Tibetan herbs

330
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,080
growing right up under your feet.

331
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:48,440
You won't be able to sleep.

332
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:49,840
There'll be so much froth growing

333
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:52,300
at high speed underneath your sleeping bag.

334
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:52,460
0060338

335
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,220
I'm tossing you around.

336
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,920
It's like a giant funhouse.

337
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,020
Yes, it's insane.

338
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:56,820
It's crazy.

339
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,000
But ain't it always been the crazy people

340
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,500
that were able to party like the new hell?

341
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,480
Yes, sirreebob.

342
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:05,820
Yes, sirman, sirlady.

343
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:10,680
You will finally learn what it's like to be a subgenius.

344
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,000
That's right.

345
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,680
I've been staying at the Church of the Subgenius

346
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:15,760
and so...

347
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:20,080
Oh, did I say that?

348
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,980
Well, then pick up on it, man.

349
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,500
It's said that the end of the world shall come in a great flash.

350
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,300
I sure hope so.

351
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,320
Some people might go and the other ones might last.

352
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:46,780
Will you be the one who goes?

353
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:49,280
Where will you be on next day, brother?

354
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,040
Where is your...

355
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:52,980
Where will you be on next day, brother?

356
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:59,500
Will you be in the sausage with Bob?

357
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:03,800
There's still lots of room.

358
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,220
Or will you be down in the room?

359
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,600
You can have anything you want.

360
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,420
Will you be burning?

361
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,020
Ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex-ex...

362
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,940
Will it be perfect pleasure or perfect pain?

363
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,180
Which will it be?

364
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,620
It's up to you to choose.

365
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:19,980
Bob gives you free will.

366
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,280
But you can't give anything until you sign on the dotted line.

367
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:27,900
And the next day is coming, so you better move fast because...

368
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,220
Where will you be on next day?

369
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:35,700
I've got plenty of time to spend my $30 on that Bob ministership.

370
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:37,120
I've got plenty of time.

371
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,120
I've got two more years for next day.

372
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,700
Why am I in any kind of hurry?

373
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:48,080
There couldn't possibly have been some kind of a misprint in the book of the subgenius.

374
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:48,520
I mean...

375
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:56,760
Just because that first edition from McGraw-Hill actually did say that next day was on July 5th, 1996.

376
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,420
Well, they changed it after that.

377
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,140
I'm sure that...

378
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:01,740
I mean, it looked like a mistake.

379
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,200
Probably was a mistake.

380
00:23:03,420 --> 00:23:08,220
I don't think I really have to spend that $30 quite yet.

381
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,640
Because that probably was just...

382
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,120
It's probably not that the world's going to end in this year, 1996.

383
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Probably not.

384
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,480
I could probably afford to...

385
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,520
Take that risk.

386
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,440
I mean...

387
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,520
I've got that $30.

388
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,340
That's not a problem.

389
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:27,200
But there's this Hootie and the Blowfish CD I wanted to get.

390
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:32,520
And, well, you know, I wanted to go to this movie about water spouts.

391
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,620
And, well, I just...

392
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,000
I just...

393
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,260
You know, I mean, Bob will wait on me.

394
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,180
I mean, Bob's a patient man.

395
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,340
He ain't a wrathful God.

396
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:48,500
Now, you see, I heard Bob would love the subgeniuses, even if they never spend any money.

397
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,260
He's a patient man.

398
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,820
A patient man.

399
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,640
Man, he ain't no patient.

400
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,840
Bob is the doctor.

401
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,400
He ain't no patient man.

402
00:23:56,460 --> 00:24:05,900
Bob is the surgeon who will excise the filthy rotting tumor that is America, that is modern

403
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:06,780
America today.

404
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:15,200
Yes, my fellow rebellious citizens and untax payers and militia members, all the citizens

405
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,780
of courts.

406
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:18,380
We must come together.

407
00:24:18,380 --> 00:24:21,940
We must come together. Quick, they're coming. They're trying to stop me from speaking.

408
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:27,760
All of us religious nuts and crazy, bright-winged maniacs, we must bang together against the man.

409
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,180
Because, oh, wait, they're coming. I've got to get my message out.

410
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:40,280
The last true hope is 5560338. Call 55603. Here they come.

411
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,220
No, come on!

412
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:42,740
Oh, my God!

413
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:43,700
Yes!

414
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,840
No, please!

415
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:45,660
No!

416
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:53,480
One more day, oh, it's going to be.

417
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,940
I won't give your love to me.

418
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:07,260
Your love will last more than one day.

419
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,520
I'm going to tell you nothing at all.

420
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:18,360
I won't hold you.

421
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:20,320
I'm going to tell you nothing at all.

422
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,800
Thank you.

423
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:54,440
Got a cobra snake for a necktie

424
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:01,320
Got me a church by the roadside

425
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,980
Made out of rattlesnake hide

426
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,380
Bob is gonna ask you, who do you love?

427
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:17,280
Bob is gonna ask you, who do you love?

428
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,020
Who do you love?

429
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:24,720
Oh, Bob's bigger than a cat in my eyes

430
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,640
Oh, who do you love?

431
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,400
Oh, I tried to live with the dark, but

432
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:38,800
It's all for me, got a man around

433
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,760
Oh, I'm in the mountain, my

434
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,480
Oh, you don't know just how I feel

435
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,880
Huh, huh, huh

436
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:49,080
Go on

437
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,800
My love is real and I find the way

438
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:09,400
My love is real and I find the way

439
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,720
My love is real and I find the way

440
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,160
My love is real and I find the way

441
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:16,460
Hooray

442
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,360
Hey, hooray, hooray, hooray, wah, wah, wa phew!

443
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:18,360


444
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:40,220
And, dear friends, that was Einstein's Secret Orchestra,

445
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:43,260
plus yours truly, Reverend Ivan Stang,

446
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,540
blabbering there along with Lonesome Cowboy Dave

447
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,980
and Professor Chaz.

448
00:27:49,180 --> 00:27:53,760
And that was 1,000 shows ago, Princess Wee.

449
00:27:53,900 --> 00:27:56,340
An even thousand shows ago.

450
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:57,120
No, not even.

451
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:58,340
But just about a thousand.

452
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:03,320
Yeah, it was number 569, and this is number 1517.

453
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,460
Oh, my goodness.

454
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:08,240
And I don't know what that phone number was

455
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,640
that I was giving out.

456
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,920
We've been sitting here trying to figure that out.

457
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:14,700
Maybe it wasn't recorded in the station.

458
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,380
There were times when Chaz would bring

459
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,780
his whole band in.

460
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,960
And Dave would have his guitar,

461
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,900
and Dave would actually be here.

462
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,980
And love is real, not fade away.

463
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:32,180
And I have some advice on mounting for you kids.

464
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:35,460
First, this is love advice.

465
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:41,180
Well, monster hunting advice, which I love.

466
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,500
First, make sure you're wearing your best armor.

467
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:47,360
Mix up your clothes.

468
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:47,360


469
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:47,360


470
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:47,360


471
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,000
Have some mega potions to make a more relaxed atmosphere.

472
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:55,500
Don't do anything to make the monster mad at you

473
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,760
because it's generally really hard to mount an angry monster,

474
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,580
with some exceptions.

475
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:04,500
Make sure the lighting is good.

476
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,080
Not too dark, but keep it low.

477
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,940
Don't rush it or be too pushy, aggressive.

478
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,060
That tends to just make things harder for you.

479
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,660
Just have fun.

480
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,160
Stay close.

481
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:17,760
Don't be afraid to the monster.

482
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,740
Be playful.

483
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,840
When the time comes, you'll both know it.

484
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,460
And the mount will just come naturally.

485
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,980
Make sure you're wearing plenty of protection,

486
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,280
even if you think you know the monster well.

487
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,120
Don't just go in with nothing and hope for the best.

488
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:40,000
And don't just run back to the village when your quest is over.

489
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:41,940
Stay a while.

490
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:44,900
Make sure to keep in touch.

491
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,340
Unless you both agree this is a very dangerous place.

492
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:47,340


493
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:47,340


494
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:47,340


495
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:47,340


496
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,280
This is a random, one-time mounting.

497
00:29:49,540 --> 00:29:51,600
Yeah, stay, bask in the afterglow.

498
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,900
But this isn't a one-time mounting, is it, Lonesome Cowboy Dave?

499
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,160
No, it's a frequent mounting.

500
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,000
It's a mountain of mountains.

501
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:03,280
I knew you'd say that.

502
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,020
A mountaine of mountings.

503
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:06,440
A mountaine?

504
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:10,480
That's why I was wondering about the last tract we just transmitted,

505
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:14,520
and if it got to you, know who on time correctly.

506
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:15,160
Heh heh.

507
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,080
You know where.

508
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:18,920
You know what I mean?

509
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,840
The last what that was transported?

510
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,560
The recording from...

511
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:22,620
That's correct.

512
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:28,280
I'm not talking about that APA dissertation that Dr. Jason Sky wrote.

513
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:32,860
I'm real familiar with APA, and they always talk that makes you want to kill them.

514
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:39,360
But I was talking about a little news release, we'll call it,

515
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:49,820
that you and I, and we, we all transmitted a short while ago, subconsciously and psychogenically.

516
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:53,740
You mean that old tape of Einstein's Secret Orchestra?

517
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,360
I'm hoping.

518
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,840
Yeah, that's what it was.

519
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:58,440
Okay.

520
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,220
You're just guessing, aren't you?

521
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,700
No, I feel relieved now.

522
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:03,520
Oh, okay.

523
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:08,580
Because I thought, but did it get to you know who, you know where?

524
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,800
What, did it get to Chaz in hell?

525
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:12,640
I don't know.

526
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:13,960
I'm not Satan.

527
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,000
Or heaven, or whatever, you know.

528
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:22,600
I mean, subgenius hell, same thing as Christian heaven.

529
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,280
Same difference, basically.

530
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:24,580
Yeah.

531
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:27,560
And you don't have to have big feet to get in either.

532
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:31,540
I mean, a lot of these religious paintings show people with huge big toes,

533
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:35,840
and chubby, chubby little toes, and stuff like that.

534
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,680
And I always wondered what that really meant,

535
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:39,080
especially since the instep.

536
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:39,860
It's so perfect.

537
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:42,520
But then they had these big yeti-looking feet.

538
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:43,460
I mean, you know, size.

539
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:47,280
I'm peculiar about that, at least at a moment's notice.

540
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,080
Well, it is where the soul is contained.

541
00:31:51,620 --> 00:31:52,400
Yeah, yeah.

542
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:53,900
I remember when we were discussing that,

543
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:58,260
and nobody could get past that except for about holes in their socks and stuff,

544
00:31:58,300 --> 00:32:00,020
and their socks were holey or something.

545
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:00,740
That was it, yeah.

546
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:04,640
Is that because they have a feet fetish?

547
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:06,300
A fetish.

548
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:09,040
Yeah, well, if they're feeling fetish,

549
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:11,140
and they have a foot fetish.

550
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,040
A feet fetish.

551
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:15,520
Praise Marge Lambert for that expression.

552
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,580
Thanks, Marge.

553
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:17,540
Huh? What?

554
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,500
Marge Lambert is the person who coined that,

555
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,120
the feet fetish.

556
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,160
Oh, I thought I was just coining it off the top of my head.

557
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:30,320
No, no, that happened many long years ago

558
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,460
when she looked into my apartment,

559
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:35,480
and she saw 5,000 pairs of shoes,

560
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:36,100
and she said,

561
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,080
Princess Wee,

562
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,400
do you have a feet fetish?

563
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,540
Oh, right, right.

564
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,120
Okay, now I remember.

565
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:44,980
Yeah.

566
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,740
Oh, she had, Marge had great feet.

567
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:48,540
Yes, she did.

568
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,340
Oh, la, la.

569
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,320
Very yeti-like.

570
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,940
Yeah, I understand that, yeah.

571
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:59,500
I mean, but what about a feet fetish?

572
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:02,500
Because I heard that that's even more peculiar.

573
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:05,460
Because they're so tiny, and they're hardly formed, you know?

574
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,820
Some people think that's actually sexual,

575
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:09,140
but I don't think that's sexual.

576
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,280
See?

577
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:12,020
Yeah, I don't know.

578
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:13,940
I don't understand any of that stuff.

579
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,340
Me neither.

580
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,720
I can't even see most people's feet.

581
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:19,720
I don't know why you'd make out with them,

582
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:20,780
or whatever you do.

583
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,640
At least the bumper stickers are creative,

584
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,540
because, you know, you can only handle

585
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:29,140
so many abstruse statements on one bumper.

586
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:32,640
And they're pretty good at it, you know?

587
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,580
But sometimes you almost get into an accident,

588
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:36,440
slamming into people.

589
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,660
What the hell?

590
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:37,940
What?

591
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,060


592
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,060


593
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,060


594
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,060


595
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:38,060


596
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:38,480
Yeah, what?

597
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:38,940
No.

598
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,760
If you can read this, you're driving way too close.

599
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:46,920
I bought a bumper sticker.

600
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:49,280
I actually paid money for a bumper.

601
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,400
I looked up where to find this bumper sticker,

602
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:53,980
because I'd seen it on a car,

603
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,120
and I admired it.

604
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,960
And I found it, and I bought it.

605
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:01,420
But now I don't know what to do with it,

606
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:04,840
because I'm not going to put a bust me please on my car.

607
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:06,340
It's not a bust me please.

608
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,960
It's a someone get angry.

609
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:12,580
It's a, it's a key my car and break the windshield with a brick,

610
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,680
and leave a little note saying, God bless you.

611
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:20,560
Because the bumper sticker I bought is the word fiction

612
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,720
spelled out in religious symbols.

613
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,860
Sort of like coexist, the smarmy one.

614
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,380
Only this is a mean one.

615
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,340
So it was like the cross and F?

616
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:34,500
Or was it the X?

617
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:35,660
Or the T?

618
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,620
The, the, the, the F.

619
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,280
The F is made with like a Russian Orthodox cross,

620
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,980
which has extra, you know, crossbars.

621
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:44,720
The two crossbars.

622
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:47,440
And of course the little T in the middle is a regular cross.

623
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:51,520
The C is the Muslimic crescent.

624
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,000
And so forth.

625
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,440
I think there's like a Taoist and a...

626
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:58,640
The I is dotted with a Star of David.

627
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,580
Right, yes.

628
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,380
Fiction.

629
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:02,980
Humble, punky, punk.

630
00:35:03,220 --> 00:35:05,200
But see, if I were to put that on...

631
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,200
New religions.

632
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,140
Huh, what?

633
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,700
Oh, I just, it's a plethora of related religions.

634
00:35:10,820 --> 00:35:12,520
They all have to do with abstinence.

635
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,400
And nevermind.

636
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,740
Well, they don't have a pipe in them.

637
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,120
Because Bob just doesn't,

638
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:25,160
the church's subgenius doesn't fit into that word.

639
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,700
It is that word.

640
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:33,600
That word is like one tiny part of the great church.

641
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,740
That word is one faction of the fiction.

642
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:37,440
It's the faction.

643
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,020
I think it's an acronym that's real good.

644
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:42,660
A-sog, or I mean, C-sog.

645
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:45,040
I mean, C or C, sog.

646
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:48,660
Hey, are you one of those Zog kooks

647
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:51,500
that were under the Zionist occupied government?

648
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:54,140
Reading A-sop's labels?

649
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,600
Because I think we're really underneath

650
00:35:57,140 --> 00:35:58,840
the government occupied government.

651
00:35:59,440 --> 00:35:59,620
Uh-oh.

652
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:03,700
Is the government occupying the government now?

653
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,160
That's what I've heard.

654
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,660
They're about to invade America.

655
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,400
At least that's what the Texans seem to be afraid of.

656
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:14,120
That the government's going to invade America.

657
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,120
That American soldiers are going to come onto our shores,

658
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,580
if you can imagine that.

659
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:23,140
Because they could take over any time.

660
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:27,340
I think they try to provoke these reminiscences

661
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,320
because I was on a regular highway once,

662
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:33,460
a main highway, you know, not a four-laner,

663
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,560
but a two-lane mainer and stuff like that.

664
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,260
But nobody was around.

665
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,960
It wasn't very crowded at all.

666
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,600
There was nobody around.

667
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:47,120
And I was passed by this Humvee-looking war type of wagon

668
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:50,740
with the guy sticking out on top wearing kind of...

669
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,020
I swear this is true.

670
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,320
I know it sounds like...

671
00:36:54,020 --> 00:36:57,600
But anyway, with this cat wearing kind of like

672
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,260
more NATO-ish looking clothes,

673
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,580
you know, kind of like Swedish Army hat,

674
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:04,740
American camouflage bottom, you know.

675
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,680
And I thought,

676
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,340
well, we never see soldiers of any kind around.

677
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:13,080
And why is he driving down this street?

678
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:15,360
It's kind of, you know, anyway.

679
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:18,960
If you lived in some places,

680
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:21,140
you'd see soldiers driving around all the time.

681
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:23,120
Sure, if you live near a base,

682
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:24,480
you know, you get on a bus

683
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,320
and you're surrounded by uniforms.

684
00:37:26,580 --> 00:37:31,420
But mostly people try to get rid of the uniforms

685
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,940
so they can have fun in town.

686
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,880
Well, I respect our soldiers.

687
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,040
They, for whatever reason,

688
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:42,380
signed up for the absolute worst job in the entire world.

689
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,580
And, you know,

690
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,640
I would...

691
00:37:49,080 --> 00:37:52,360
I wish I could be up there on the front lines with you men,

692
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,680
but they declared me 4F.

693
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:55,920
I have flat feet

694
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:58,720
and I'm just not good enough for this man's army.

695
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,940
That's what they told me back in Vietnam.

696
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,120
Vietnam, Texas.

697
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,800
And I heard that you had such a hard time.

698
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:07,120
And with that, you had to volunteer

699
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:08,860
for the greater day.

700
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,540
Plus children without homes.

701
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,000
Oh, I volunteered for everything.

702
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:13,620
But they all said I had flat feet.

703
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:15,420
I couldn't even do meals on wheels

704
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:16,640
because I had flat feet.

705
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:17,820
They just don't want me.

706
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,540
They don't care.

707
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,400
They don't want me.

708
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,600
And all the time this was going on,

709
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,400
you never once considered the fact

710
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,600
that you had misread

711
00:38:24,600 --> 00:38:27,340
what is so obviously preoccupies your mind.

712
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,120
It's fat feet.

713
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,180
Not flat feet, but fat feet.

714
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,680
I have a fat feet fetish.

715
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:34,520
And...

716
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:35,860
And so...

717
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:35,860


718
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:37,180
So they're still looking for you.

719
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,600
Just like the Kent 12.

720
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:40,260
The guys that got away

721
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:43,240
and snuck around back behind the guardsmen

722
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,460
and threw eggs at them and stuff like that.

723
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,860
They're still at large.

724
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:50,040
I don't know if that's the actual term they use,

725
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,720
you know, about size or anything like that,

726
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:52,040
but...

727
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:54,580
No, I made that up.

728
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,580
I had to.

729
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,280
I'm a communist.

730
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,800
No, I'm confused right now of anything.

731
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:02,860
Poor Dave.

732
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,080
Poor, poor Dave.

733
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:05,440
Poor old...

734
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:06,560
Poor old Wobbly.

735
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,080
They haven't been...

736
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:12,160
He's the last of the living Wobblies.

737
00:39:12,580 --> 00:39:13,960
The very last one.

738
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,280
That's the way they always have to sing it, too.

739
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,400
Like some...

740
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,800
I think it's a preacher voice

741
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:25,360
from the southern Midwest or the Southlands.

742
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,120
A creature voice, did you say?

743
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:28,920
Huh?

744
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,040
Goddamn, the creature man.

745
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:34,840
See, that's...

746
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,260
That's not the right tone of voice,

747
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,820
so you have to actually sound like you're oozing...

748
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,240
That's coming out of your pores.

749
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:42,040
Oh, you said preacher.

750
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,580
I thought you were talking about the creature

751
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:44,920
from the Black Lagoon,

752
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,660
which I'm much more interested in than most preachers.

753
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,800
They tell me about the preacher

754
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,420
who paints the picture of the preacher.

755
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,920
At least when he's still sweating.

756
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,660
They used to call old Dr. Lagoon

757
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:02,040
the preacher from the Black Lagoon.

758
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:03,200
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

759
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:04,800
Ha, ha, ha.

760
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:08,240
Well, if you haven't heard it 2,000 times before,

761
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,180
it's kind of funny.

762
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,020
Right.

763
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:13,160
Kind of like that whole Church of the Subgenius thing.

764
00:40:13,220 --> 00:40:16,180
If you haven't heard it 1,517 shows,

765
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:18,900
it'd be kind of funny, I guess.

766
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:20,860
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

767
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:24,600
So sad.

768
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,840
We've got to come up with something new.

769
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:28,140
Oh, wait.

770
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,820
Tater came up with...

771
00:40:30,820 --> 00:40:32,840
Tater Gumfrey came up with something.

772
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:37,140
It just came right out of me.

773
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:37,380
He said,

774
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:40,740
your rights end where Bob's fist begins.

775
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,880
And that is the stark fist of removal.

776
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,760
Yes, them Texans can worry all they want

777
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,980
about somebody coming in and taking away their gun rights,

778
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:55,680
but I'm afraid when Bob's fist enters the room,

779
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:59,340
you'd best kiss it or back out backwards, buddy.

780
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:03,760
I propose a new plan, a bold new plan,

781
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,700
wherein all members of the ministry

782
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,300
are given punching gloves,

783
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,100
big, fat, thick ones filled with lead.

784
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:13,200
At any moment of discourse where things cause pain,

785
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,960
they must chomp each other and punch each other in the face

786
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,640
roundly and savagely as many times as possible.

787
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,380
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

788
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,440
At least that's what I was hoping for.

789
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:24,840
Hey, did you hear about those...

790
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:26,580
Okay, there was that...

791
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,820
the mean lady in Texas

792
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:32,300
who says that she's like Jesus

793
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,660
or Martin Luther King,

794
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:39,860
because she invited some radical Muslimics

795
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,700
to come kill somebody

796
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,120
at her draw cartoon of Muhammad party

797
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:47,520
for free speech.

798
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,780
Okay, and a couple of guys showed up

799
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:52,280
and they got themselves killed

800
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,140
because, you know, Texas.

801
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:56,960
Anyway, guess what?

802
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:59,300
It's a story that doesn't make any sense.

803
00:41:59,480 --> 00:41:59,900
I'm sorry.

804
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,720
Guess what?

805
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,000
There was a subgenius

806
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,280
who had his artwork,

807
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:11,220
but I had them tomatoes when I'm eating.

808
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:11,220


809
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:11,220


810
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,140
So he showed him a lot of his artwork

811
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:14,740
and he said that this is a magic,

812
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:15,820
amazing show

813
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:16,600
and he literally gave this year

814
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:24,260
that's like a 50% juice to his time.

815
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:26,480
I was praying to him

816
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,400
that this will come to an end

817
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,200
and that this TV show

818
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:29,600
won't be the same,

819
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,520
that's really, really bad.

820
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,080
speak.

821
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,960
They hadn't invented word balloons.

822
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,420
His dialogue would be written

823
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:39,000
on his shirt. Anyway,

824
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,260
Onan drew a picture of the yellow kid saying

825
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,700
I am the prophet.

826
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:45,080
That was it. But

827
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,220
here's the problem.

828
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:48,940
When's he going to get his artwork back?

829
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:51,480
It's

830
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,360
sitting in this building

831
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:55,260
in Garland that's a crime scene

832
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,460
apparently with all the other artwork.

833
00:42:57,960 --> 00:42:59,620
And I guess some chalk

834
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:01,400
somebody said my favorite

835
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,320
artwork in there was chalk outlines around

836
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:03,600
bodies.

837
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:07,560
But anyway, Onan was more concerned

838
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,620
Most of

839
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:11,200
these things go and six months

840
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:12,680
there'll be a pre-trial hearing.

841
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,080
They've already been arraigned I suppose.

842
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,180
And since it's material evidence

843
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:19,360
to the case, it'll probably take another year

844
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,520
for it to come to court.

845
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,360
And then another year after that for him to get his

846
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:24,060
artwork back.

847
00:43:24,340 --> 00:43:26,360
Well, I just hope that lonesome

848
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:28,220
Onanist Onan

849
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,760
finally gets his

850
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:31,560
Mohammed picture back.

851
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:32,040
I do too.

852
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,840
That's what I'm saying. It doesn't seem likely

853
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:36,940
the way these things go.

854
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:39,980
Now we don't have to worry about that

855
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:41,820
because we don't

856
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:43,980
we're a radio station

857
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,180
so we can't draw pictures of anybody

858
00:43:46,180 --> 00:43:47,420
not even Bob

859
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:50,340
except, you know, in our minds.

860
00:43:50,540 --> 00:43:52,060
I think I just did draw

861
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:53,940
a picture of Onan's yellow kid

862
00:43:53,940 --> 00:43:55,660
picture. I think you did too.

863
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:57,260
Okay, well I guess we're on the death

864
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:58,200
we're on the death of Onan.

865
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,440
We're on the list now to us and Salman Rushdie.

866
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:02,200
Yep, you drew it with words.

867
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:03,160
We blew it.

868
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,720
Can I just ask one question?

869
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:08,160
Doesn't it seem like any kind of provocative

870
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,080
art like, you know,

871
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:11,820
a crucifix in urine or

872
00:44:11,820 --> 00:44:14,300
a dung statue of the Virgin Mary

873
00:44:14,300 --> 00:44:16,320
without the explanation of what it really was

874
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,060
at the time and stuff

875
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:19,860
like that as well as just purposely

876
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,580
trying to like, you know, show

877
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:23,780
Mohammed in his underpants

878
00:44:23,780 --> 00:44:24,880
and stuff like that.

879
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,580
And doesn't it seem like there's

880
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:29,640
a whole bunch of much cooler stuff

881
00:44:29,640 --> 00:44:30,960
going on right now?

882
00:44:31,180 --> 00:44:32,820
I mean, in the art world.

883
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:35,200
Well, yeah, of course.

884
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:37,700
Why are we directed towards these silly

885
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:39,940
neo-propagandistic

886
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:41,180
things?

887
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:42,140
I'm wondering.

888
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,240
Well, the lady who is sponsoring that thing

889
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,080
she kind of believes that all

890
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:49,340
Muslimics should be driven

891
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,640
out of America and rounded up

892
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,500
and put into some desert

893
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,000
and then

894
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:55,440
bombed.

895
00:44:55,480 --> 00:44:57,120
She's obviously not a citizen.

896
00:44:57,580 --> 00:44:59,860
She goes to the doctor

897
00:44:59,860 --> 00:45:01,700
once in a while and there's the Islamic

898
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:03,500
doctor there who wouldn't harm a person.

899
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:05,160
Well, it's true that

900
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,500
you know, the neighborhood is

901
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:09,480
7-Eleven or whatever you call it,

902
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,080
the convenience store and stuff.

903
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,980
Oddly enough, it is actually

904
00:45:13,980 --> 00:45:15,020
legal to be

905
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:17,660
a believer in Islam

906
00:45:17,660 --> 00:45:19,500
in the United States.

907
00:45:20,120 --> 00:45:21,880
Yes, Thomas Jefferson even

908
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:23,160
put him in a...

909
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:24,780
George Washington was a Muslim.

910
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:26,020
People don't know that.

911
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,520
Abraham Lincoln.

912
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:28,200
Abraham Lincoln was...

913
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:29,040
Well, he was a little...

914
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:32,500
He didn't always have that stuff piped out.

915
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,260
He had a little turban on

916
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:34,920
some of the time.

917
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,800
Well, you want to hear something real...

918
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:39,960
Did you ever hear about Thomas Jefferson's

919
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:40,640
flying carpet?

920
00:45:42,260 --> 00:45:44,560
Now, of course, then you're getting pre-Islamic.

921
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,780
I'm becoming a member of...

922
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:47,760
Never mind. I'm sorry.

923
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:48,900
I'm sorry, too.

924
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,200
I'm sorry, three.

925
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,280
I interrupted.

926
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:52,160
No, I'm here.

927
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,600
Oh, excuse me.

928
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:55,200
No, excuse you.

929
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:55,540
Oh.

930
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,120
But Thomas Jefferson was

931
00:46:00,380 --> 00:46:01,580
also enjoyed...

932
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,560
How shall we say it?

933
00:46:03,580 --> 00:46:04,740
He and Benjamin Franklin

934
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,220
were turned on to...

935
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:07,860
Or not turned...

936
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:08,700
How would you put that?

937
00:46:09,820 --> 00:46:11,620
They did little surveys

938
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:12,520
of the Middle East

939
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:14,380
and asked questions.

940
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:16,500
Huh?

941
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:19,240
Did you know that

942
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,480
this also was immortalized by,

943
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:23,220
of course, the Fireside Theater?

944
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,620
Thomas Jefferson and Ben Franklin

945
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:27,300
smoked urine.

946
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,800
I mean, smoked...

947
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:29,220
Yeah.

948
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,640
They got goodly stretched on the hemp.

949
00:46:32,420 --> 00:46:33,260
On the hump.

950
00:46:33,600 --> 00:46:34,160
Yeah.

951
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:35,700
And they directed the course

952
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:36,840
of this nation's affairs

953
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:38,760
for some 16 centuries now

954
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:39,440
since, oh, well,

955
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,640
in the Byzantine period.

956
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:41,560
Oh, they were...

957
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,220
They were total potheads.

958
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,440
They were so high

959
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,700
on the best skunk

960
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,840
from Amsterdam.

961
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:48,340
You can't even imagine.

962
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,900
They had the purple haze

963
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:52,240
mixed with the G13,

964
00:46:52,320 --> 00:46:53,940
mixed with the Jack Harrow,

965
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,500
mixed with the purple kush,

966
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,920
the silver kush,

967
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:57,560
and the...

968
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,980
the couch cushions.

969
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:01,280
And they were smoking that stuff

970
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:02,580
until their wooden teeth

971
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,380
turned brown.

972
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:06,580
Because that's what they could do

973
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:08,000
back in those days.

974
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:08,720
That was...

975
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,880
Did you know the original

976
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,320
zeroth...

977
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:13,860
the Bill of Rights,

978
00:47:14,060 --> 00:47:17,460
the zeroth amendment was

979
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:18,920
thou shalt smoke

980
00:47:18,920 --> 00:47:20,860
all the damn pot you want?

981
00:47:21,020 --> 00:47:21,920
And that was the one...

982
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,620
You don't even know about that one, right?

983
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,100
This first one that they sent you.

984
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:25,980
Well, no, I...

985
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,480
The Democrats said...

986
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:27,980
The Democrats answered it

987
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,800
back when they was the Republicans.

988
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,000
Remember those days?

989
00:47:31,380 --> 00:47:31,940
Yep.

990
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,360
When we were really little.

991
00:47:33,900 --> 00:47:35,980
When our parents were little.

992
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,380
When our parents were...

993
00:47:38,380 --> 00:47:39,280
Very...

994
00:47:39,280 --> 00:47:39,840
Grandparents.

995
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:41,140
Yeah, our grandparents were...

996
00:47:41,140 --> 00:47:41,720
When our grandparents were little.

997
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,520
When our great-grandparents were...

998
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:44,060
After the...

999
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:44,620
Teenagers.

1000
00:47:45,240 --> 00:47:46,600
After the Civil War,

1001
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,080
which was painful until removed,

1002
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:51,120
but still left scars behind,

1003
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:52,380
just like any war would.

1004
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,220
Well, you'd probably say that

1005
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:55,900
because you're...

1006
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:57,480
I bet your parents are Yankees.

1007
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,020
That's right.

1008
00:47:59,060 --> 00:48:00,240
We're proud Yankees.

1009
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,180
Not from recent...

1010
00:48:02,180 --> 00:48:03,380
Not from the days of when

1011
00:48:03,380 --> 00:48:04,600
this was a hotbed

1012
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:06,880
in this area of northeastern Ohio

1013
00:48:06,880 --> 00:48:09,620
where John Brown even trained

1014
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:12,940
his inabilities.

1015
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,900
And the Giddings and the Wades

1016
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:17,700
were from here

1017
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:18,840
who were in Congress

1018
00:48:18,840 --> 00:48:21,420
and were downright socialists

1019
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:23,180
who wanted to divide up the South

1020
00:48:23,180 --> 00:48:24,020
between the poor

1021
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:27,460
out-of-work white people

1022
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:28,640
and the slaves.

1023
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,300
They were going to give everybody

1024
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,640
a plot of land and say,

1025
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:32,220
hey, man,

1026
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:33,960
everybody's fine.

1027
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:35,420
But no.

1028
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:36,980
Yeah, right.

1029
00:48:37,880 --> 00:48:39,440
That really would have worked.

1030
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,260
Gosh, reconstruction.

1031
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,500
Well, why wouldn't it have worked?

1032
00:48:43,580 --> 00:48:44,980
Everybody was kind of getting along

1033
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:45,660
in some places.

1034
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:48,200
Because my slave-owning ancestors

1035
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:50,460
would have been run off

1036
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,380
of their own plantation.

1037
00:48:52,180 --> 00:48:52,860
That's why.

1038
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:54,580
That's another problem

1039
00:48:54,580 --> 00:48:55,420
they don't consider

1040
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,100
is how many...

1041
00:48:56,100 --> 00:48:57,460
How many have a life?

1042
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,420
This is Southerners

1043
00:48:58,420 --> 00:48:59,120
were punished

1044
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,860
by the Confederacy.

1045
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:02,660
Many, many, many.

1046
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,560
In fact, it was a violation

1047
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:06,640
of the right of pre-assembly

1048
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:07,860
in which is in our

1049
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:08,760
American conscience.

1050
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:10,840
I never...

1051
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:12,760
The American consecration.

1052
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:14,940
Yeah, they started

1053
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,620
deporting abolitionists

1054
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,580
who were born and raised

1055
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:18,140
in the South

1056
00:49:18,140 --> 00:49:19,840
for saying, well, you know,

1057
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:20,940
it ain't in the Bible

1058
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:22,300
that it's a good thing here.

1059
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:24,240
We're against it.

1060
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:25,060
Just...

1061
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,360
Out of the South?

1062
00:49:26,360 --> 00:49:28,720
Well, I'm of mixed blood

1063
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:29,980
and mixed feelings

1064
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:31,500
because my pappy

1065
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:33,840
is a Southerner

1066
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:35,720
from South Carolina

1067
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,380
in a long line of...

1068
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:39,900
But not...

1069
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:41,420
Well, some of them were...

1070
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,420
His cousins,

1071
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,060
his insane cousins

1072
00:49:44,060 --> 00:49:45,300
were plantation owners.

1073
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:48,660
But my mom was a Yankee.

1074
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,920
But her grandma

1075
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:53,020
was something much worse

1076
00:49:53,020 --> 00:49:53,700
than a Yankee.

1077
00:49:53,820 --> 00:49:54,760
An immigrant

1078
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,340
from a foreign country.

1079
00:49:56,340 --> 00:49:56,900
It was a foreign country.

1080
00:49:56,980 --> 00:49:58,720
It was a foreign country.

1081
00:49:58,860 --> 00:49:59,880
It didn't even speak English.

1082
00:49:59,980 --> 00:50:00,800
It was called Ireland.

1083
00:50:01,860 --> 00:50:03,340
And we're surrounded

1084
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:03,580
by foreign countries.

1085
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:04,960
Lazy, shiftless.

1086
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:05,960
You've heard about the Irish,

1087
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:06,500
haven't you?

1088
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:08,200
Lazy, shiftless, stealing.

1089
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:09,760
Drunks.

1090
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:10,840
Yeah, drunks.

1091
00:50:10,860 --> 00:50:11,460
They're all drunks.

1092
00:50:11,540 --> 00:50:12,360
They've given an Irishman

1093
00:50:12,360 --> 00:50:12,920
one drink

1094
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,220
and he's just completely gone.

1095
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,140
What's an Irish St. Patrick's

1096
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:18,640
State dinner?

1097
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:19,440
It's a six-pack

1098
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,340
and a boiled potato.

1099
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:21,400
They're out hard, hard.

1100
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,140
Oh, and my...

1101
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:22,740
And everyone laughs.

1102
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,740
And my Yankee mother's

1103
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:26,320
grandfather was a Yankee.

1104
00:50:26,340 --> 00:50:26,820
An immigrant

1105
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:28,180
from another country

1106
00:50:28,180 --> 00:50:29,180
where they're famous

1107
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:31,420
for being money-grubbing,

1108
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:32,040
greedy,

1109
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,120
and big in show business

1110
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,660
and banking and stuff.

1111
00:50:36,820 --> 00:50:37,700
Yes, the Scottish.

1112
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:39,700
Putman.

1113
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:41,860
Yeah, that's what they said.

1114
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,480
That's what they said.

1115
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:44,420
We know what that means.

1116
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:47,400
You're used to the whole culture,

1117
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:48,080
so to speak,

1118
00:50:48,120 --> 00:50:49,460
of transgenderism.

1119
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:49,880
Yeah.

1120
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:50,880
Because when you wear,

1121
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:52,100
you know, like a skirt

1122
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,020
and then lift up a big,

1123
00:50:54,020 --> 00:50:55,040
heavy, huge log

1124
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:55,840
and you're going to pump

1125
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:56,220
some...

1126
00:50:56,340 --> 00:50:56,900
You know,

1127
00:50:56,900 --> 00:50:57,500
one of the forehead

1128
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,380
with it real hard

1129
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,380
if you possibly can

1130
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:00,040
and you have to keep

1131
00:51:00,040 --> 00:51:00,840
worrying about what,

1132
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,580
you know, like...

1133
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:03,180
I'm an American

1134
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:04,500
made of immigrants.

1135
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:06,280
My right foot

1136
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,780
is a money-grubbing,

1137
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:10,720
old, miserly Scot.

1138
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:13,840
And my left foot

1139
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,900
is a drunk Irishman.

1140
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:17,860
And my right hand

1141
00:51:17,860 --> 00:51:20,440
is an evil,

1142
00:51:22,440 --> 00:51:23,480
perverted Englishman.

1143
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:24,880
And my left hand

1144
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,640
is a Nazi

1145
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:26,320
from Germany.

1146
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:28,040
Is it your family

1147
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,620
that invented the haggis bites?

1148
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:31,400
Just bites of haggis?

1149
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,340
You don't have to have

1150
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:32,840
the whole...

1151
00:51:32,840 --> 00:51:33,460
Just bites?

1152
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:35,100
Or slammers.

1153
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:36,320
No, that was Dave's.

1154
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:37,300
That was Dave's.

1155
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:37,700
Oh, wait.

1156
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:38,920
No, Dave was the other kind.

1157
00:51:39,040 --> 00:51:40,560
Dave's descended from...

1158
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:42,140
Well, they aren't even

1159
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:42,820
white people.

1160
00:51:42,980 --> 00:51:44,280
But Dave's descended from...

1161
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:45,240
I am descended from

1162
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,440
many, many groups.

1163
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:47,640
But the main thing

1164
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:48,200
I would say,

1165
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,100
there's the Mediterranean area.

1166
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:49,720
Pizza eaters.

1167
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:50,160
Mm-hmm.

1168
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,260
It's quite well represented.

1169
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,360
And I'm quite proud of it

1170
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,600
because we invented

1171
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:56,320
everything we could.

1172
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:56,320


1173
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:56,320


1174
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:56,640
in Europe

1175
00:51:56,640 --> 00:51:58,140
while the rest of you people

1176
00:51:58,140 --> 00:51:59,060
were picking your noses

1177
00:51:59,060 --> 00:51:59,940
in caves up there

1178
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:00,480
in the north.

1179
00:52:00,620 --> 00:52:01,360
Oh, I'm sorry.

1180
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:02,320
Yeah, I'd like to...

1181
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:02,700
I'd like...

1182
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:03,440
You Romans

1183
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,500
had to go and make slaves

1184
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,000
of my people, you know.

1185
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:07,640
That's a...

1186
00:52:07,640 --> 00:52:08,180
Where do you think

1187
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:09,340
we get the word slave?

1188
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,920
It's because the English

1189
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:12,060
were enslaved

1190
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:13,780
by the Romans.

1191
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:14,180
Of course,

1192
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,140
as I understand it,

1193
00:52:16,180 --> 00:52:17,240
the English really wanted

1194
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:18,500
the Romans to stay

1195
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,580
because they made

1196
00:52:19,580 --> 00:52:20,680
such great cloth

1197
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,060
and weapons

1198
00:52:22,060 --> 00:52:23,780
and pottery

1199
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:25,380
and just all kinds of...

1200
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,320
Their cloth was so...

1201
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:26,640
They were so smooth

1202
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:27,240
and they could make

1203
00:52:27,240 --> 00:52:28,300
the hair so purdy.

1204
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:29,640
But the Saxons

1205
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:30,020
And you know,

1206
00:52:30,180 --> 00:52:31,620
there's spear chuckers

1207
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,020
in England at that time.

1208
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,300
They're just...

1209
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,760
It was like,

1210
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,280
come back.

1211
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:37,080
Show us how to make

1212
00:52:37,080 --> 00:52:37,960
that really good wine.

1213
00:52:39,040 --> 00:52:40,320
All we have is this grog.

1214
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,120
with the great guys

1215
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:43,380
and all that stuff, man.

1216
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:44,080
They were mean.

1217
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:44,740
They were nasty.

1218
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,420
They tried to abolish

1219
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:47,320
the Roman blood.

1220
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:48,780
There was still a lot

1221
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:50,420
of it around at the time.

1222
00:52:50,680 --> 00:52:52,240
And they used to go

1223
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:52,760
in villages

1224
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,540
and blind people

1225
00:52:54,540 --> 00:52:55,480
or, you know,

1226
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:56,240
young males

1227
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:57,260
they would blind them

1228
00:52:57,260 --> 00:52:58,940
or remove their testicles

1229
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:00,480
which is a part

1230
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:00,980
of the anatomy,

1231
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:01,900
you know,

1232
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:03,040
that everyone's familiar.

1233
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:04,500
Well, you know,

1234
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,100
it's...

1235
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:06,260
If it ain't one thing,

1236
00:53:06,300 --> 00:53:06,740
it's another.

1237
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:07,780
And every country

1238
00:53:07,780 --> 00:53:09,280
gets their time

1239
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:10,340
in the sun

1240
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:11,140
where they get to

1241
00:53:11,140 --> 00:53:12,140
enslave everybody

1242
00:53:12,140 --> 00:53:13,180
around them

1243
00:53:13,180 --> 00:53:14,180
or on the other side

1244
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:14,880
of the world.

1245
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:17,060
And then the next thing

1246
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:17,360
you know,

1247
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,020
they're the ones

1248
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:18,700
that are broke

1249
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,880
and miserable

1250
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,560
and everybody's

1251
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:22,480
laughing at them.

1252
00:53:23,340 --> 00:53:23,860
Really?

1253
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:24,960
It's just everybody

1254
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:26,000
gets their turn.

1255
00:53:26,320 --> 00:53:27,520
I'm waiting for the

1256
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:28,320
Aborigines

1257
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,640
to get their turn again.

1258
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:31,560
I would hope so

1259
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,760
after all these years.

1260
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,500
What's it been like?

1261
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:34,500
Somebody said

1262
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:35,900
it was like 30,000 years.

1263
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:36,320
Right.

1264
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,420
Since they were...

1265
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:39,240
Since they had the giant...

1266
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,700
Since they were

1267
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:41,600
enslaving people.

1268
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:43,280
Well, since they had

1269
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,400
the means to wipe out

1270
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:44,720
humanity

1271
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:45,780
and to destroy

1272
00:53:45,780 --> 00:53:46,580
their surroundings

1273
00:53:46,580 --> 00:53:47,700
which they didn't think

1274
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,360
were important.

1275
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:49,200
You know, they just thought

1276
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:49,740
you're kind of

1277
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:51,440
self-born into this world

1278
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:52,680
like Bodhidharma

1279
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:53,780
or something like that.

1280
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:55,100
Next thing you know,

1281
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:56,140
you snap on a lotus.

1282
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:56,540
You know, you just pedal

1283
00:53:56,540 --> 00:53:57,220
and go dancing

1284
00:53:57,220 --> 00:53:57,940
down the beach

1285
00:53:57,940 --> 00:53:58,980
and try to get a pickup

1286
00:53:58,980 --> 00:53:59,620
on the 40,

1287
00:53:59,680 --> 00:54:01,220
41-year-old truck driver.

1288
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,200
You know, some kind of

1289
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:03,420
bizarre old...

1290
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,240
Well, in those days

1291
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,100
you could do that

1292
00:54:05,100 --> 00:54:06,080
because there were still

1293
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:06,920
plenty of resources

1294
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,220
and not many people.

1295
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,900
But not on the spaceships.

1296
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:13,080
Well,

1297
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:16,320
on the spaceships

1298
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,560
I guess we won't have

1299
00:54:17,560 --> 00:54:18,740
anything to worry about,

1300
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:19,560
will we?

1301
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:20,040
We're hoping.

1302
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,400
They won't let us worry,

1303
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,500
will they?

1304
00:54:23,380 --> 00:54:24,700
Yeah, that's another...

1305
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:25,840
That's another thing

1306
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,300
to try to do.

1307
00:54:26,320 --> 00:54:27,020
What if you're screwy, man?

1308
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:27,920
What if it's like,

1309
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:28,180
you know,

1310
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:29,260
mind control

1311
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:31,360
so you don't worry

1312
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:31,980
and mind control

1313
00:54:31,980 --> 00:54:33,460
so you do have a good time

1314
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:33,920
and you can...

1315
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,460
What about that?

1316
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,520
I don't know, man.

1317
00:54:37,960 --> 00:54:38,920
I don't know.

1318
00:54:38,920 --> 00:54:39,300
I don't know, man.

1319
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:40,600
What would Bob do?

1320
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,020
What wouldn't Bob do?

1321
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,720
What would Bob not do?

1322
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,600
Now, there's a question.

1323
00:54:48,380 --> 00:54:48,900
Yeah.

1324
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,520
Bob Dobbs I'm talking about.

1325
00:54:50,660 --> 00:54:51,020
Not...

1326
00:54:51,020 --> 00:54:53,520
I mean, J.R. Bob Dobbs.

1327
00:54:54,260 --> 00:54:55,580
Not just any old

1328
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:56,300
Noah Campbell.

1329
00:54:56,320 --> 00:54:56,600
Not just any old

1330
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:56,600


1331
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:56,600


1332
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,400
Those are a dime

1333
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,560
a billion.

1334
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:04,600
A dime a billion?

1335
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:06,140
Yeah, a dime...

1336
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,860
Yeah, a dime a billion.

1337
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:08,060
A dime a billion.

1338
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:09,200
That's how...

1339
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:10,560
That's what Bob's are worth.

1340
00:55:10,780 --> 00:55:11,640
Playing Bob's.

1341
00:55:11,660 --> 00:55:12,920
Then there's the...

1342
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,380
J.R. quote

1343
00:55:14,380 --> 00:55:15,640
Bob unquote

1344
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:17,320
Dobbs.

1345
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:17,940
And that's different.

1346
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,160
And the listener

1347
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,300
can gaze upon

1348
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,260
the visage

1349
00:55:24,260 --> 00:55:25,900
of J.R. Bob Dobbs

1350
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:26,300
if they...

1351
00:55:26,320 --> 00:55:26,900
If they were to look

1352
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:28,260
at subgenius.com,

1353
00:55:28,420 --> 00:55:29,340
they could also download

1354
00:55:29,340 --> 00:55:31,780
1,500 hours of

1355
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:33,280
quote,

1356
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:34,000
slack,

1357
00:55:34,280 --> 00:55:34,720
unquote.

1358
00:55:36,560 --> 00:55:38,080
But I don't expect

1359
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:38,860
him to do that.

1360
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:39,740
I don't expect him

1361
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:40,260
to do nothing.

1362
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:42,220
I give up on him.

1363
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:44,820
I don't know

1364
00:55:44,820 --> 00:55:45,560
what they expect,

1365
00:55:45,780 --> 00:55:46,420
but I just...

1366
00:55:46,420 --> 00:55:47,640
I just throw up my hands.

1367
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:48,600
Well, they don't not only

1368
00:55:48,600 --> 00:55:50,180
see the visage of Bob,

1369
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:50,720
they can see

1370
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,760
10 billion thousand

1371
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,060
trillion interpretations

1372
00:55:53,060 --> 00:55:54,640
of the visage of Bob.

1373
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:55,840
That is true.

1374
00:55:56,460 --> 00:55:57,460
And unfortunately,

1375
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,220
that also makes me sad

1376
00:55:59,220 --> 00:55:59,800
because now,

1377
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:01,040
what am I supposed to do?

1378
00:56:01,160 --> 00:56:02,860
Each time I interpolate

1379
00:56:02,860 --> 00:56:04,760
Bob's facial feature

1380
00:56:04,760 --> 00:56:05,840
in his smiling face,

1381
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:10,320
I start a whole new diatribe,

1382
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:11,480
an internal dialogue

1383
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:12,300
that pushes me

1384
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:12,980
in a different direction.

1385
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,040
It means this.

1386
00:56:14,140 --> 00:56:14,740
It means that.

1387
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:15,420
It means this.

1388
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,060
It means that.

1389
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:18,060
It's pretty mean,

1390
00:56:18,080 --> 00:56:18,500
all right.

1391
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:19,480
Yep.

1392
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,700
Mean to me so far.

1393
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:23,200
In the meantime...

1394
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:24,120
How can you argue

1395
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:25,060
with all those arteries

1396
00:56:25,060 --> 00:56:25,740
of enlightenment?

1397
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:27,680
Yeah.

1398
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,540
It's in his forehead

1399
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:29,760
having a bad afternoon.

1400
00:56:30,340 --> 00:56:32,180
We're having arterial bleeding

1401
00:56:32,180 --> 00:56:32,940
of enlightenment

1402
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:33,860
on this show.

1403
00:56:34,020 --> 00:56:34,460
We just...

1404
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:36,400
Enlightenment's just pumping,

1405
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:37,560
squirting out of us

1406
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,340
with every heartbeat.

1407
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:39,880
It's going to be gone soon.

1408
00:56:40,060 --> 00:56:41,040
We better hurry

1409
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:42,040
and finish this show

1410
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:43,380
before it's all gone out.

1411
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,860
I'm running out of breath

1412
00:56:44,860 --> 00:56:45,720
and enlightenment

1413
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,640
and everything.

1414
00:56:47,180 --> 00:56:48,080
I mean...

1415
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,020
God, I can't do that

1416
00:56:52,020 --> 00:56:52,900
for very long anymore.

1417
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,080
What a bloody mess.

1418
00:56:55,420 --> 00:56:55,720
Yeah.

1419
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:57,000
Man, wow.

1420
00:56:58,260 --> 00:56:59,560
Well, that's because

1421
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:01,380
we've been talking about

1422
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,960
the major bloodshedders

1423
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:04,640
on our planet right now.

1424
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:06,000
The dystopians.

1425
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:07,140
The...

1426
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:08,700
The denisovians.

1427
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:10,680
The denisovians.

1428
00:57:11,160 --> 00:57:12,100
Wow, man.

1429
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:13,320
We just invited...

1430
00:57:14,200 --> 00:57:15,220
Didn't we do something

1431
00:57:15,220 --> 00:57:16,520
during the last half hour

1432
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,480
to get ourselves

1433
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:20,100
targeted by fanatics?

1434
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:21,740
Oh, probably several things,

1435
00:57:21,920 --> 00:57:23,040
not just one thing.

1436
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:23,840
Right, but how many...

1437
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,700
Which fanatics

1438
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:25,700
are going to come after us?

1439
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,640
The T-Buckers.

1440
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,300
The Muslamics.

1441
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:31,140
The Christ Punchers.

1442
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:31,940
Remember that band

1443
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:32,920
in Detroit?

1444
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:33,360
Yep.

1445
00:57:33,980 --> 00:57:35,000
The Putin Thumpers.

1446
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,560
The car keyers.

1447
00:57:37,180 --> 00:57:37,760
Right.

1448
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,660
The fiction haters.

1449
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:40,880
The fiction lovers.

1450
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:42,560
They were the worst, man.

1451
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:43,740
Both of them.

1452
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,700
The feet fetishists.

1453
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:49,320
The popular cowboys.

1454
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,280
You know, the popular cowboys

1455
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:53,500
are so jealous of you,

1456
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,680
Lonesome Cowboy Dave.

1457
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:56,760
They wish they could be

1458
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:57,660
as lonesome as you.

1459
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:58,160
Yes.

1460
00:57:58,260 --> 00:57:59,980
I corresponded with those folks

1461
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:01,460
and I found them to be

1462
00:58:02,120 --> 00:58:04,280
just as good as stumps in the rain.

1463
00:58:04,420 --> 00:58:07,560
There were no artificial mistreatment

1464
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:09,120
or any kind of miscalculation.

1465
00:58:09,120 --> 00:58:10,220
That's just how they felt.

1466
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:11,800
Did you say they were as good

1467
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,620
as stumps in the rain?

1468
00:58:14,580 --> 00:58:15,020
Yeah.

1469
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:16,120
Did I?

1470
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,420
Yeah, I don't know,

1471
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,860
but that's what it sounded like to me.

1472
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:21,300
Does it resonate

1473
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,320
with adamantine hardness?

1474
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:25,480
Adamantine hardness?

1475
00:58:25,480 --> 00:58:25,700
Adamantine hardness?

1476
00:58:25,700 --> 00:58:25,700


1477
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,160
a stump in the red.

1478
00:58:27,540 --> 00:58:28,220
You know, like...

1479
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:29,300
Adamantium.

1480
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:30,220
That was a great band.

1481
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:30,820
Yeah.

1482
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,040
Adamantium.

1483
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,140
I'm just saying that

1484
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:34,800
I never actually...

1485
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:35,720
I wouldn't know a song

1486
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:36,760
by that band.

1487
00:58:36,920 --> 00:58:37,780
I wouldn't know

1488
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:38,760
anything about it.

1489
00:58:41,560 --> 00:58:42,980
I remember them,

1490
00:58:43,780 --> 00:58:44,000
unfortunately.

1491
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:45,980
Well,

1492
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,120
did I already say

1493
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:49,300
subgenius.com

1494
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:50,220
and people can

1495
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:51,120
check it out?

1496
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:52,580
And what other news?

1497
00:58:52,660 --> 00:58:53,500
What's coming up?

1498
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:55,260
Well, another show.

1499
00:58:55,260 --> 00:58:56,340
No, that's the best news.

1500
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,080
And...

1501
00:58:59,480 --> 00:59:00,760
Well, I guess that's

1502
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:01,600
about it.

1503
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:03,620
Well, there's lots of things

1504
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:04,100
coming up.

1505
00:59:04,140 --> 00:59:05,260
There's X Day coming up.

1506
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:06,360
There's Starwood coming up.

1507
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,280
There's millions of things

1508
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:07,780
coming up.

1509
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,460
Well, we've already...

1510
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:10,840
It's going to be

1511
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:11,880
a hot, hot summer.

1512
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:12,720
Yeah.

1513
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,680
Let's hope it's

1514
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:18,000
not that hot.

1515
00:59:18,580 --> 00:59:19,260
We'll see.

1516
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:19,780
We'll see.

1517
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:20,080
Friends,

1518
00:59:21,160 --> 00:59:22,160
I'm going to

1519
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:24,060
have to sign off here.

1520
00:59:26,180 --> 00:59:27,340
And I'm going to

1521
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:28,440
have to say praise Bob

1522
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:29,420
because I know

1523
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:30,740
Bob will kill me.

1524
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:33,460
He'll kill you too, buddy.

1525
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:34,720
He'll kill us.

1526
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,020
If we don't play

1527
00:59:37,020 --> 00:59:37,840
our cards right.

1528
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,320
So,

1529
00:59:39,280 --> 00:59:41,060
it's Dave fading time.

1530
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,340
Dave, you can start

1531
00:59:43,340 --> 00:59:44,360
into your lecture now.

1532
00:59:44,700 --> 00:59:45,520
I'll start.

1533
00:59:46,740 --> 00:59:49,240
Bye, Dave.

1534
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:51,420
There he went.

1535
00:59:51,520 --> 00:59:52,360
He's gone.

1536
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:53,880
And we're going to be gone,

1537
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,020
thankfully,

1538
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:55,820
very soon.

1539
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:56,680
I guess I'll just

1540
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,760
leave this music on.

1541
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:01,700
And I'll let

1542
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:03,900
somebody else say

1543
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:06,040
what this is.

1544
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:06,580
Praise Bob.
