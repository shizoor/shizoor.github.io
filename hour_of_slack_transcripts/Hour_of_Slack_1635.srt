Usually radio announcements merely recommend a product, but this station provides its clients with a special service.

00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:10,820
The Subgenius Hour of Swag.

00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:17,160

daily unite their efforts in the creation of programs to please and entertain a vast radio public.

00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:23,760
Ah!

6
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:36,200
The wide variety of broadcasts include group discussions, political speeches, and comedy.

7
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:41,940
On this program, frank opinions are expressed in response to their leaders' questioning.

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,820
Questions of the day are discussed and opinions and attitudes freely expressed on issues of the moment.

9
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,880
For there is keen interest in a radio program that invites personal participation by the public.

10
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:53,700
This is...

11
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,160
This is Independent Radio in a Democracy.

Knock, knock, no one's home

00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,660
We don't wanna dance alone

51
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,340
No, no, can't behave

52
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,620
We'll get tortured

We'll get tortured

54
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:27,340
We'll get in the cage

00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,020
Uh-oh, there's no time

The Earth is circled by the sun

Creation Science Polka

84
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,100
Science classes in our schools

85
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,060
Taught by superstitious fools

86
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,000

Creation Science Polka

88
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:41,840
The universe was fabricated

89
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,560
In six literal days

90
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:49,240
The humans and the dinosaurs

91
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,480
Shared a condo in L.A.

92
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,940
Carbon dating makes us cringe

93
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,860
We're the right wing lunatic fringe

94
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:59,860
Jesus died for our sins

95
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,500

00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:31,480


99
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:59,580
The Bible says the earth is only 6,000 years old

100
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:08,100
Deny and Jesus Christ will roast your balls on burning coals

101

Come on everyone, join the fun Ignorance has almost won

102

Get geology from a nun Creation Science Polka

103
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,600
Take your children out of school Homespun dogma is so cruel

Prop them up, watch them drool Creation Science Polka

105
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:46,360
The Rudy Schwartz Project, dear friends

106
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,120
Of course, their Creation Science Polka

107
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:53,580
Played that for a special friend

108
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,960
And there'll be another one at the very end for the same friend

109
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,560
Which we'll be talking about

110
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,240
Pretty soon

111
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,300
However, after Dave calls in

112
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:09,600
In the meantime, I'm going to read a quick rant

113
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,680
That I got off of the Scrub Genius Forum

114
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,460
A rant by the good Reverend Roger

115
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,080
Whose stuff I read a lot these days

116
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:25,280
This rant is called Why You're Screwed

117
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,520
He actually uses stronger language

118
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,480
Than I'm going to use

119
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,880
On the public airwaves

120
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,620
Weirdness is in the human being

121
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,720
Almost like a muscle

122
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,340
The more you use it, the stronger it gets

123
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,120
But the flip side of that

124
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,820
Is that when you stop using it, it atrophies

125
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,540
It shrivels up until one day

126
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,380
You're wearing dockers and khakis

127
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,260
And working on the TPS report

128
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:50,620
And looking forward to the Knicks

129
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,460
At the sports bar after work

130
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,240
Horrible, eh?

131
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,600
But that's how it goes

132
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,920
One day you're up to your butt

133
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,500
In freaks at the gay bar

134
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:02,260
And the next you're eyeing that Lexus commercial

135
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:04,040
With silent contemplation

136
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:06,160
You aren't going to buy one, of course not

137
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,180
But you're just curious as to

138
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:10,000
Whether you can make the payments

139
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,600
I mean, it's not like you'd be one of them

140
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,660
Even if you did

141
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,940
Because it isn't the car that makes you weird

142
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,060
It's you, right?

143
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:17,700
Right, right, right?

144
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,580
Oh, you're screwed

145
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,720

After all, it's had 8,000 years

150
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:29,560
To feed you

151
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,300
And figure out how to get the square pegs

152
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,740
Into the round holes, hasn't it?

153
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:36,200
I'll be weird tomorrow

154
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:39,160
You say you're tired

155
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:40,320
Burned out

156
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,500
The coming weird times are here

157
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,820
And now you're exhausted

158
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,600
But are you?

159
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,580
What have you done to get so tired?

160
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,020
You sure it isn't lethargy?

161
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,700
Some of you do have a lot on the ball

162
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,760
Granted, but shouldn't all these activities

163
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,540
Give you more of an excuse to be you?

164
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,160
As if you ever needed one?

There are active ways of getting you to shut up

170
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,560
If not, though, it has more passive methods

171
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,040
One of which is to make sure you understand about

Your headstone reads

Good citizen

186
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,820
Well done, that man

187
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,160
Shut up, you can't tell me what to do

188
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:39,700
No, and I wouldn't if I could

189
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:43,420
The people I'm talking to already know what they're supposed to do

190
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,860
They're just too busy to do it

191

Busy, busy, busy

00:10:48,260 --> 00:10:54,180

Too busy for making everyone move to the other side of the room

194
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:02,540
Too busy for Bob

195
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:03,440
Too busy for Bob

196
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,860
And doesn't that sound like the sort of persuasion

197
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:08,640
The machine Trademark would use?

198
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:12,680
Go ahead and rattle those prison bars to see which ones are loose

199
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,540
Tomorrow

200
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,240
Today you need to apply yourself to your monkey training tools

201
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,840
Like Farmville or whatever time-sensitive game is hot right now

202
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:26,220
Remember Tamagotchi, the virtual pets?

203
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:27,820
Neither do I

204
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,540
But I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do that today, but I'm going to try and get a little bit of a break from the game today

205
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:31,600
But I don't feel like Saturday night

206
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,360
That's okay, Saturday night doesn't feel like you

207
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,520
It is still out there, just, you know, without you

208
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,120
The fun never stopped, you did

209
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,060
The party still goes on

210
00:11:44,060 --> 00:11:45,840
It's been going on since Babylon

211
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,300
And it'll be going on long after your dust

212
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:52,040
Because, like the machine, Trademark

213
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:59,440
Saturday night has had 8,000 years how to figure out how to deal with Wallflower

214
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,420
And it does so by grinding over their bodies

215
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,340
With horrible squelchy crushy noises

216
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,780
And rumbling off into the sunset

217
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:14,480
So you can take your lurking and your TV and your crappy beer

218
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,680
And your wasted days and wasted nights

219
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,720
And your lethargy and your cause

220
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:23,400
And your whatever else the hell you've traded for your very life

221
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,740
And you can jam them up your arses for all I care

222
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:27,860
Me?

223
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:30,800
I'm off to pee on the power lines

224
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:34,900
Because Bob made me that way

225
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,740
Or kill me

226
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:42,720
Well, yep, there's another subgenius rant that ends with the phrase

227
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,140
Or kill me

228
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:52,400
I actually was planning to play a canned show of my Starwood rant

229
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,220
Just an hour of me talking

230
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:57,840
And I read a couple of rants by other subgenius

231
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,720
And they both ended

232
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:03,380
They all ended up with Or kill me

233
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:12,140
And, you know, we advise people not to commit suicide generally

234
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,260
Well, subgeniuses, anyway

235
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:18,540
We tell subgeniuses not to commit suicide because

236
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,580
You're gonna die anyway

237
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:25,180
We all end up on our heads, every single one of us

238
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,860
And, uh, um...

239
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,860
So you gotta make the most while you can

240
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,700
And, um...

241
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,480
We have a friend who did

242
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,940
We're gonna be talking about that

243
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,020
Oh, I should mention, um, the music that I was playing at the beginning of that rant

244
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:48,420
Was the Rudy Schwartz project from his new album

245
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,880
His latest CD

246
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,940
Uh, an instrumental called Fortnight of Glistening Stumps

247
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:56,860
Lovely

248
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,000
A lovely little fortnight there

249
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:06,300
And, uh, I've gotta prepare that last Rudy Schwartz project song for later

250
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,580
The music in the background is from classic Universal Monster movies, friends

251
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,460
And, uh...

252
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:18,060
Yes, yes, yes

253
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:20,560
It's...

254
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:26,460
It's been a long week for a lot of, uh, subgeniuses

255
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,060
And, uh...

256
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:30,980
I can't complain myself

257
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,320
We got our driveway covered

258
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,780
Oh, oh, I'm sorry, Princess We is here also

259
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,340
I didn't even have you turned on

260
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:42,320
Well, now I'm turned on

261
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,180
Mm-hmm, now everybody's turned on

262
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:47,320
When Princess We gets on

263
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,180
Come on, Dave, come on, Dave

264
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,280
Oh, I shouldn't say that

265
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:53,700
Um...

266
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,880
Well, I'll go ahead and tell you what's going on, friends

267
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:00,900
Uh, it's about our beloved subgenius

268
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,840
That, uh, a lot of you know in person

269
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:09,900
If you've been to any X Day Drill

270
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,400
Except this very last one

271
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,100
The one this last July

272
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:17,200
Because our friend was too sick for the first time

273
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:18,440
Ever

274
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:18,980
Ever

275
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,680
He has been at every single X Day Drill from 1990 to 2020

276
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,040
1996 to 2016

277
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:29,840
And there at 7 in the morning

278
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:32,060
Well, that's, yeah, that's the other thing

279
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,420
He was the only other person besides me

280
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,100
Who was not only at every X Day Drill

281
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:41,980
He was at every single 7 a.m. on July 5th

282
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:44,860
The hardest part of my year in some ways

283
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:51,600
And he, and he alone was always there to help

284
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,480
Always

285
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:58,480
He also brought a drive-in movie every single time

286
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:03,980
And, um, the person we're talking about is Dr. Dark, of course

287
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,200
Dave

288
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:08,160
Who's not a flash of a person to begin with

289
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:12,660
No, I just now, um, explained who we're talking about

290
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:18,220
I didn't know until this afternoon I got a call, I thought, from him

291
00:16:18,220 --> 00:16:21,560
I was thrilled because we knew he was really sick

292
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,280
And fighting cancer and kind of almost in hospice

293
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,460
And kicking ourselves for not going to see him every day

294
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:33,840
Well, but no, he didn't want people to come see him

295
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,200
I know

296
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:37,780
But we got, uh, I, I, I thought I was getting a call from him

297
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:45,220
But it was actually his sister-in-law, Candy, using his phone and calling his, his old friends

298
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:50,620
Yes, Dr. Dark boarded the saucers last Friday

299
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:55,380
Um, evidently at the time and in the way of his choosing

300
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,140
Given the fact that he'd been fighting all kinds of cancers for many years

301
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,280
And he beat them too

302
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,580
Until now

303
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,140
And, uh, I was told that it went quite fast at the end there

304
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:09,460
The cancer was spreading fast

305
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:14,480
And last Friday he decided he was ready to shoot through, as my late dad put it

306
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:18,400
And, uh, if I understand correctly, he went into hospice

307
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:20,600
And spent the day with his close friends

308
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:21,920
And his closest family members

309
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,360
Um, that mainly being the family of his wife, Her Highness Hell-No

310
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,420
I'm told he watched, uh, his fa- I guess one of his favorite shows

311
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,680
Rachel Maddow all the way through

312
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:41,480
And then, uh, spent his last moments alone with his wife

313
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,740
I was told there was, uh, no pain

314
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,760
And he felt surrounded by love

315
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:50,540
And, uh, and he did

316
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:58,200
He did get the big, uh, get well card that everyone at the X-Day party in July signed for him

317
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,260
And apparently that really meant quite a lot to him too

318
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,420
Um

319
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:09,240
Yeah, if you get a special envelope that's got the little furry critter inside and stuff like me over here

320
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,540
Thank you, thank you, thank you

321
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,300
And you close it up and you start crying and stuff like that

322
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,360
I don't know if it was the kind that talks

323
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:26,680
I'm not sure if it had a furry animal but there were lots of furry, lovey expressions expressed

324
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:29,140
Well, there was some great artwork on that card

325
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,660
There was

326
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,360
Well, there was some really good art, there were always really good artists at X-Day

327
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,860
Mm-hmm

328
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:40,560
Well, mainly because they were lunch, they were, uh, officially manicured lunch windows

329
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:45,600
Or, uh, what do they call those things you wear on your chest when you, that has the daily specials on them?

330
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:47,660
Lunch cards, no?

331
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,040
I know nothing of this

332
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:57,780
Have you seen like in pictures of the 1930s and 40s there's like a person that has like a billboard on his side of the clock

333
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,280
Sandwich board, it's a sandwich board

334
00:18:59,280 --> 00:18:59,660
Right

335
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:00,580
That's what you're looking for

336
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:00,960
Sandwich board

337
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:02,300
Yes, a sandwich board

338
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:07,540
And it says hot dog or whatever flavor wiener or something like that, $2.95

339
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:14,360
And then there's a person, you know, there's like a little cacophonous sound that accompanies each one of the arguments

340
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,280
You know, it's like, like it's

341
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,560
They're gonna bite you somehow, you know, you get scared but you still continue to, you know

342
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:28,020
Well, another thing that sandwich boards are famous for is end of the world predictions

343
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,200
Mm-hmm

344
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,920
The world is ending is often on sandwich boards in cartoon world

345
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:37,260
Jays

346
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:46,260
Um, anyway, uh, obviously it's, uh, Dr. Dark's, uh, boarding the escape van

347
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,440
And, uh, the one of the two vessels was not unexpected

348
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:51,820
But, of course, it's not fair either

349
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,900
Uh, he's just maybe a little bit older than me

350
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,100
And, um

351
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:01,120
Maybe a year, I mean, not much

352
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:08,680
But he, he and her highness, hell no, did get to spend the last couple of years traveling and visiting all the places they wanted to see

353
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:10,520
In a big minivan

354
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:14,040
I know they've been to Easter Island at least twice

355
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:14,580
Yes

356
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:15,760
Apuaku

357
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,860
Yeah, we got to see a great, uh, slideshow of that once

358
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,960
And they brought us back gifts from there

359
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:31,620
Friends, uh, for those of you who didn't know Dr. Dark, you've actually heard him on this show in the background for decades

360
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:36,760
Because he was the greatest of all subgenius hecklers

361
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:37,960
The Clipster

362
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:43,500
He got the Bobby Award for best heckling of subgenius preachers

363
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,820
Every year for 22 years

364
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:51,240
Even the year that he and his friends made the Bobby Awards

365
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,260
He couldn't help it, he was quick

366
00:20:53,260 --> 00:20:54,620
He was just born quick

367
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:58,540
He could spew out like 25 jokes within 25 seconds

368
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,200
It was just like

369
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,000
Or some other number like that

370
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,440
And there would just be this whole expository sandwich right out for you to wear on the sandwich board

371
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,880
Well, I mean, uh, you, uh

372
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,480
You hear him in the older DeVyv 4 years

373
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,760
And he's got a lot of wonderful recordings

374
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:20,360
Clearly, I was not, I didn't have time to find any examples of that

375
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,360
Apparently he narrated one of the, uh, the wrestling

376
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:28,540
The naked blood wrestling that we used to do at X-Days

377
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:34,780
Uh, I found a note saying that he did a great running commentary of that in 99 and I need to find that

378
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:40,220
I did find a couple, a cassette where he called, uh, Chaz's show

379
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,920
And I'll play that in a little while

380
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,820
But yeah, friends, um, he was, uh

381
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:49,120
His heckling was funnier than my preaching

382
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,580
And sometimes it was like he made the show

383
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,340
Absolutely

384
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:52,740
Yeah

385
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:56,620
He had this bizarre talent for punning

386
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,020
His fevered brain just

387
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,340
Spontaneously, spontaneously too, yes

388
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:03,560
Fiendishly churned out puns

389
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:05,540
Like nobody we've ever known

390
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:08,580
And we've known some really serious punners

391
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,200
Yes, it endeared him to puns

392
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:14,840
And he was mad at me very, very strongly because that made, reminded me of my father

393
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,800
And these, these weren't just regular bad puns, friends

394
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,900
These were god-beswogglingly painful puns

395
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:29,020
They were all original and all soaringly, inspiringly terrible

396
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:32,040
You know, I mean, that's what makes puns great

397
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,620
And he was the greatest

398
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,340
Yeah, in fact he's not

399
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,260
In fact, here's a, well this isn't exactly a pun, I guess

400
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:41,180
I found this line at one point

401
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,620
Somewhere on old subgenius forum

402
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:47,860
Do not go genital into that good night

403
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,540
He said

404
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,260
How apropos

405
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:53,860
Yeah

406
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,280
He was, he was a master quickenheimer

407
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,700
He was like one of those people who just like

408
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,380
Would fire off this barrage of puns and other humor, humor devices

409
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,160
The most unusual I thought was his ability to actually

410
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,160
Quip style deliver the

411
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:09,620
These jokes

412
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:13,440
Guy walks into a bar and it's like over in like less than two seconds

413
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,840
But it still was wonderful

414
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,960
Well, and he would coin words too

415
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:21,800
Here's an example

416
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,980
That's why I feared him a lot of times

417
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,060
Did you ever fear him?

418
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,980
No, not in the slightest

419
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:31,480
I did, like well I hope Dr. Dark is not gonna start a night late call because

420
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,300
Stuff like that, you know

421
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,440
No, I did not fear him

422
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,080
I depended on him

423
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,900
Well, I'm not, is that to say I'm stupid or something or

424
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:47,080
No, no, I mean I, I, we were, we were good friends

425
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,700
Um, but uh

426
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:53,600
Oh here's, here's one

427
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:56,760
He posted a word of the day back in 2004

428
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,140
On alt.slack

429
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,360
Word of the day

430
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,060
Gaia Rhea

431
00:24:02,060 --> 00:24:03,360
Proper noun

432
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,160
New age blather

433
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:08,160
Ex, uh

434
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,480
Example of use in a sentence

435
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,760
There was a lot of Gaia Rhea going around at Starwood last year

436
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:20,300
Uh, here's another one

437
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,040
Oh this is just a little, a very

438
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,780
He didn't post a whole lot

439
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,620
He, uh

440
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,120
Cause if he had I would have found it

441
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:28,580
I s-

442
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,080
He wasn't anti-postal

443
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,360
He just didn't find it

444
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,600
The way he does

445
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,540
At one point he, um, he announced that uh

446
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,120
He and her

447
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:40,480
Her Highness Helena were going to go on a trip to Paris

448
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:44,780
This was in 2003 I sugge- I, I think

449
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,180
And one subgenius suggested uh

450
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:52,820
The Pavillons de Bercy or something and

451
00:24:52,820 --> 00:24:54,240
Uh, he said

452
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,980
He looked at the link and he said

453
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:59,300
Looks swell, too bad I can't read French

454
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,460
Now I know what an illiterate feels like

455
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,920
Not ever having been there before

456
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,660
I like to imagine Paris as being like the city

457
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:10,620
Depicted in the movie City of Lost Children

458
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,140
Ever see it? Very atmospheric

459
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,140
As a subgenius tourist

460
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,840
I'll eschew the Eiffel Tower

461
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,540
For the sewer tour

462
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:23,120
The Louvre for appreciating the art

463
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,660
In piles of dead people's bones in the catacombs

464
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,660
Uh, plus the two great places I've been tipped off to now

465
00:25:29,660 --> 00:25:30,460
Thanks y'all

466
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,600
You know what, I did that

467
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:35,760
I went, I saw the, the piles of dead people bones in the catacombs

468
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,640
Instead of the Louvre

469
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:41,140
The one or two days that I was in Paris

470
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,780
Of course we couldn't get into the Louvre

471
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,640
There's not a long line for the catacombs

472
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,840
But uh, yep

473
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,320
I really don't know where to begin with that

474
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:55,760
I know that uh, Louis Quatorze was quite a

475
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,160
Was a vicious old swine

476
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:58,640
Louis Quatorze

477
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,740
But he wasn't as bad as history reported him

478
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,060
But he did, he did turn out to be a traitor

479
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,620
I'm not saying I think Dr. Dark was a traitor

480
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:12,000
In fact I think he's befuddled in the chemist at the same time

481
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,480
Or you know, like any combination of the three

482
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,520
Well he was a trader

483
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,720
He would trade

484
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,260
Right

485
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:22,520
Copies of rare obscure movies for copies of other rare obscure movies

486
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:25,060
And he could, he could whistle and or hum

487
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,620
Each and every one of the theme songs from any of those B-movies

488
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,560
Or any of the ambient music as well

489
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,660
Yep, they're playing in the background right now

490
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:35,700
Well that's very, he didn't do that on purpose

491
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:36,980
Mostly he was just like

492
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:40,780
Heckle people who were trained to perform

493
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:44,040
Well you know Dave, um

494
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:47,340
Unlike many subgeniuses

495
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,400
Dr. Dark believed in an afterlife

496
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,460
And therefore he still does

497
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:57,900
Um, and evidently he mentioned lots of plans I was told

498
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,700
Plans to contact us from the other side

499
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:05,720
So I'm expecting to get some faint but very distinctive heckling in my head

500
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,320
In the wee hours of the night sometime

501
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,840
And I am too

502
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,320
I expect tricks

503
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,840
The old Italian ladies used to say you can't wish to communicate too hard

504
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,160
Or the spirits don't come

505
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,340
Well didn't you

506
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:22,240
You have to relax and let your mind be open

507
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:28,080
I don't know if that requires like taking a butter knife or a surgical instrument to your forehead, you know

508
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,420
It would with me

509
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:32,660
It would, he's gonna have to heckle pretty hard to contact me

510
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,480
I'm pretty thick headed to

511
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:34,940
Right

512
00:27:34,940 --> 00:27:36,360
Now didn't you get

513
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,280
Didn't you feel a tremor in the force?

514
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:43,700
Well I often do, I often before a friend of mine just

515
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,440
Who also had the big G

516
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:49,940
Um, just departed and he made through our

517
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:53,760
What did you say his veins collapsed around his forehead again?

518
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,440
No that's me, that's what happens with me

519
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:57,820
That's what I had, yeah

520
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,200
Well that's what it usually means anyway

521
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,880
And I didn't say I thought of him that way

522
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,740
I just, I forgot of him in that way if you know what I mean

523
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:09,860
Like quote unquote

524
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:12,280
Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh

525
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:16,360
Well apparently he already had, he already started playing tricks

526
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,760
The second he shot through

527
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,160
Cause his sister-in-law told me that

528
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:30,100
Um, when she came into the room where he was laying after, I mean, well his body was laying

529
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,020
He had departed

530
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:34,860
And she put her hand on his neck

531
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,640
And she put her hand on his head and leaned over and kissed his head

532
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:40,320
And the nurse ran in the room and said

533
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,200
Hey what are you doing? His heart just restarted for a second

534
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:50,580
So she took that as a kind of a last little um, you know

535
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,340
Ha ha, you think I'm, you think I'm, he ain't gone yet

536
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,180
Wow

537
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,720
I have uh

538
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:04,640
Well I know, I believe in such things are not, you know humorous subjects to be discussed on the Hour of Slack

539
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,540
I'm sure, or I don't

540
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:12,680
But I, I, I share it a lot in common as far as the view of the afterlife which is like um

541
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:16,960
Um, Hindu or something almost

542
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:23,100
Or Patagonian, I think it maybe describes the shrimp people cause they're so small

543
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,380
The, the briny little shrimp people

544
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:30,040
The actual briny shrimp

545
00:29:30,040 --> 00:29:31,120
No, we have to, we have to

546
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:31,960
Like the kind near Las Vegas

547
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,780
We have to talk about uh things

548
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,320
Like the big C and death on the Hour of Slack

549
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:41,760
Because people still need slack

550
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,700
No matter what

551
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,520
And yet the, I mean obviously you, you, you can't laugh at it

552
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,200
But you can

553
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:50,900
You have to

554
00:29:50,900 --> 00:29:52,760
You can't but you have to

555
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:55,820
Yeah I was gonna add to that earlier

556
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:58,520
But whatever service he's going to have

557
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,600
Is going to be a joke fest

558
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,380
Excuse my language

559
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:04,860
But whoever gets up and starts talking about it

560
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,480
Stands up for him and says I remember Dr. Dark

561
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:10,360
Or I forgot his real name right now

562
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,980
I wasn't gonna, actually

563
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,160
You're not supposed to

564
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:16,460
We probably shouldn't say that

565
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:19,060
Because there's a couple of people uh who

566
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:23,840
They're unlikely to find out on this show

567
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:26,120
But they might on Facebook

568
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,320
And that wouldn't be cool

569
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:31,500
Uh I was given permission

570
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,860
By, in fact I was encouraged by, by him

571
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:35,740
By his uh survivors

572
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:37,880
They said oh yeah he'll be listening

573
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,680
So hey Dr. Dark

574
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,980
We really miss you already

575
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:46,860
Now that I think about it

576
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,300
But I'm here to be a laugh riot

577
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,400
Because speaking of things that you were just talking about

578
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,660
A friend of mine who recently died

579
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,460
Everybody seemed to laugh

580
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,540
When people would go and stand up and be

581
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:02,540
Tell something that was only moderately humorous

582
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,800
And people would be slapping their

583
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:07,080
Thighs and crawling around the aisles

584
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,120
And barking like animals and so forth

585
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:12,080
Well laughter and tears are very close

586
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,200
They are

587
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,040
And then a picture

588
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:18,040
A picture that was in the memorabilia items area

589
00:31:18,040 --> 00:31:20,020
Flew at somebody and everybody went

590
00:31:20,020 --> 00:31:20,380
Whoa

591
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:23,980
And looked at each other

592
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,120
Well yes

593
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:29,260
Well of course things become more meaningful at times like that

594
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:32,700
Oh god I remember Chaz's service

595
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:34,840
It was a

596
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,020
It wasn't exactly funny

597
00:31:37,860 --> 00:31:38,360
And uh

598
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:41,620
They played his last song

599
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:46,120
As they were carrying him out to plant him in the ground

600
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,120
And I lost it

601
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,240
I had not cried up until then

602
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,300
But I completely broke down

603
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:55,580
And it takes a lot

604
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:59,080
It takes a train to laugh or something like that

605
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:00,180
Or a train to cry

606
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,800
Well that's an air conditioning system

607
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,240
I ended up uh

608
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,480
Um

609
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,520
It's like when I finally bust loose

610
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:07,940
I

611
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,140
You know I'm crying for everybody

612
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:11,740
I know

613
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:14,960
I remember you were leaving road apples all over the floor too

614
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,700
Before we

615
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,640
Set our bon voyages

616
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:22,600
Dr. Dark was also sick

617
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,400
And I mean he was sick in the Lenny Bruce kind of way

618
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:26,800
Yep

619
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,440
Sick, sick humor

620
00:32:28,440 --> 00:32:29,340
Um

621
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,460
He probably would not have lasted long

622
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,740
On a radio show like this because

623
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:37,740
Talk about not being politically correct

624
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:40,460
Now this guy was the biggest libtard

625
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,680
Uh in the world

626
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,340
I mean uh

627
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:44,900
Well I shouldn't say that

628
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,600
But I know that he was a dedicated

629
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,580
At least in this dimension we're in right now

630
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,080
Yeah uh

631
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:49,860
Uh

632
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:55,980
I'm sure he'll be watching the continuing train wreck from

633
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,460
You know his HDTV set

634
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:00,560
The Akashic

635
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,880
Uh

636
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:03,900
Viewing room but uh

637
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,280
Here's an example

638
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,760
This is from actually from years ago

639
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:10,400
Uh

640
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,180
This was he was filling us in on some news about Bill Cosby

641
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,960
This is before

642
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,360
The word really was out about Bill Cosby

643
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,120
He said um

644
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:23,180
Uh

645
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,700
To quote Dr. Dark

646
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:31,420
He won't face criminal charges but comedian Bill Cosby may face a lawsuit over allegations that he fondled a Canadian woman

647
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:38,100
Pennsylvania authorities could not find enough credible and admissible evidence since it melted

648
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,380
Against Cosby that would lead to a criminal conviction but

649
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,580
A former Temple University student says

650
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:49,480
Cosby drugged her with a date rape drug riddled

651
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,260
Jello pudding pop

652
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:55,400
And then fondled her with a strap on jello pudding pop

653
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,400
At his Philadelphia home

654
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,900
Cosby

655
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:03,020
Wiping his fingers on a trademark Huxtable sweater

656
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:04,620
Denies the allegations

657
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:09,140
The woman's lawyer says she will probably file a lawsuit

658
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:13,500
Since there isn't always room for jello

659
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,600
See what I mean

660
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:17,900
Yeah

661
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:18,960
Yeah

662
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,760
It's uh

663
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,040
That's not the kind of thing I would say on the

664
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,000
College radio

665
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:24,680
I

666
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:25,220
Oh wait

667
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:25,400
I noticed

668
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,880
Yeah she was capable of hitting the mark depending on the time

669
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,460
Depending on what kind of shoe size she was talking about you know

670
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,980
It'd be like if one moment you would be marvel

671
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,820
If not marvel at the um

672
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:40,560
The um adaptability

673
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:44,200
Of the species especially with a long nose named John

674
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,920
Or some kind of Arabic title

675
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,560
Suleiman

676
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,900
Nahoo

677
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:57,480
Not only was Dr. Dark unbelievably sick and twisted

678
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:01,140
But another thing that made him a true subgenius

679
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,580
Top to bottom through and through

680
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,200
Was his terrible taste in motion pictures

681
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,040
B

682
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:17,020
Or rather his superb taste in what we might call great bad film

683
00:35:17,020 --> 00:35:18,120
Yes

684
00:35:18,120 --> 00:35:22,440
And I don't mean just mediocre movies we're talking about

685
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:23,420
Oh no not just mediocre

686
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,300
The movies that are so good that

687
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,060
So bad

688
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:32,040
That they reveal more about the human condition than they ever intended to

689
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:37,260
The Plan 9's that we dream of when we're having our munchkin feisty parties

690
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,080
Or we're lying asleep trying to consume a brownie with our rectum

691
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:46,020
It's just those strange nights that we call out to Bob or anybody else who will listen

692
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:50,020
And we just and these films were that's the reason

693
00:35:50,020 --> 00:35:50,820
Um

694
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,220
Um

695
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:55,920
I found one of his playlists from a uh

696
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,760
A Dr. Dark's drive-in

697
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,160
This was uh the

698
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,960
These were the movies that said

699
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,520
And it really was a drive-in

700
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:02,900
Yes

701
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,920
Uh you could in fact in the early days he even had like a radio broadcasting the soundtrack

702
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,580
That's right

703
00:36:09,580 --> 00:36:12,020
So that you could listen to the movie in your car

704
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:13,040
On your car's radio

705
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,440
And watch um

706
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:16,780
Which they still have it didn't go away Stan

707
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:18,440
No um

708
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:20,000
Well uh

709
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,220
It it uh

710
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,900
He had he didn't usually use it

711
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,940
He used a 16 millimeter projector that was usually a video projector

712
00:36:28,940 --> 00:36:29,540
But it would

713
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:33,000
He'd put it put it on the great big screen at Brushwood

714
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,720
And then later on the big screen at Wisteria

715
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:41,020
Here's here's a list of the movies that we got treated to

716
00:36:41,020 --> 00:36:42,560
One X Day

717

00:37:17,220 --> 00:37:19,300
Freaks 1932

729
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,980
Glenn or Glenda 1953

730
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:23,840
That's another Ed Wood

731
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,240
Hercules in the Haunted World

732
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:29,460
Invaders from Space 1959

733
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:34,100
Iron Man but not the one you're thinking of

734
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:34,880
No

735
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,680
Jan Joe the Beast from the East

736
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,180
Oh Joe Riley's Japanese Monster Mash

737
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,080
And there's another

738
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:45,180
Late subgenius

739
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:47,380
Saint Joe Riley

740
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:50,460
He was a collector of bad films

741
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,820
And he made uh cut cut-ups of them and media broadcasts

742
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,340
And stuff

743
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:56,560
What a brilliant set of

744
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,720
He was one of those uh

745
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:00,260
One of those fellows who was

746
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,860
Everyone and himself thought was in

747
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:05,220
Perfectly normal health and just

748
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,920
One Wednesday night

749
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:09,620
He fell over dead in his kitchen

750
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,940
From an undiagnosed heart condition that he'd always had

751
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:14,680
But no one knew

752
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:18,040
What would you prefer staying if you were to expire tomorrow?

753
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:22,540
What kind of certificate would you want on your luminary tablet there?

754
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:24,700
Oh I've given that some

755
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,640
I can't make up my mind between

756
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,000
I'll get him for this

757
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,720
On my tombstone

758
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,460
Which is a pretty vain

759
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:36,600
Forlorn hope

760
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:37,700
Or

761
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:40,920
And this one came from our friend

762
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,440
Tonya

763
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:43,880
Uh

764
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,140
Keep off my grass

765
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:49,520
Get off of my lawn

766
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:51,920
Get off of my lawn

767
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,460
Get off my lawn sorry

768
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,900
I blew that one

769
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:56,260
Typical

770
00:38:56,920 --> 00:39:00,980
If there's two ways to say something I'll say it the wrong way

771
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,480
Keep off my gra-

772
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,620
Yeah get off my lawn

773
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,940
Keep off my grass

774
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:05,360
Right

775
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:08,480
I personally don't want my

776
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,800
Uh body laying in a box in the ground

777
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:13,040
I'd rather have uh

778
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,920
Mortuary students play with it

779
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,920
Yeah especially if they're gonna plant you like a tree

780
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,820
Or a piece of statuary

781
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,560
Somethin' I guess they're doin' that lately

782
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:26,200
They're having these little like statue parks

783
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:30,200
Where it's the actual person entombed in a cellophane glass of

784
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,260
Of cement and obscure items

785
00:39:32,260 --> 00:39:33,060
Uh

786
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:34,840
Somethin'

787
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,200
And they all have to drink it at the same time or something

788
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,740
I don't know

789
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,520
Well I'm not sure I mean

790
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,780
To you it's all division and extraction

791
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:46,020
To me it's multiplication man

792
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,740
You lost me on that one Dave

793
00:39:47,740 --> 00:39:48,420
Sorry

794
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:50,760
Well where the

795
00:39:50,820 --> 00:39:52,760
Where the hell were you expecting me to go?

796
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,220
I got lost at the pass

797
00:39:54,820 --> 00:39:55,900
Okay I'm gonna-

798
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:58,180
Well the pass had three corners and like Stang said

799
00:39:58,820 --> 00:40:01,200
We are only here for 45 minutes

800
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:03,560
And then we have to go and argue with the

801
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,860
The agent and make sure we can get another gig

802
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,660
You know what I'm sayin'

803
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,620
I know I know

804
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:11,480
Well here I'm gonna try and experiment

805
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,480
I- this is something I haven't done in a radio station for about

806
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:17,060
20 years

807
00:40:17,060 --> 00:40:18,320
I'm gonna play a cassette

808
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:21,460
I found this uh

809
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,540
In my searchings online

810
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:28,380
I found that there was a recording from a

811
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:31,640
An ESO radio show

812
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,240
One of the Chazz's shows

813
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:36,000
And you and me were here Dave

814
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,660
Or in the old studio

815
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:42,320
This is from hour of slap number 724

816
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,420
This is from 2000

817
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,620
The year 2000

818
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:48,300
And it's Dr. Dark calling in

819
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,100
Although here's the thing

820
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,900
He wasn't Dr. Dark then

821
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,300
When we first knew him he was Dr. Gorgonzola

822
00:40:57,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Like the keys

823
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,960
Yeah he was Gorgonzola for a long time

824
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:05,040
And uh I believe this is him calling in

825
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,160
It doesn't sound like him

826
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:08,540
They also made a fine uh salad dressing too

827
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,740
But it doesn't sound like us either

828
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,400
Cause we're-

829
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,280
Well it's got that kind of munchkin quality

830
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,200
Once you- you're over like over 25 years old

831
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,580
You hear everything like that you-

832
00:41:18,580 --> 00:41:21,440
When you were 15 you sound like a- a hoss

833
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:24,460
Okay, okay let's- let's see how this sounds

834
00:41:24,460 --> 00:41:28,280
Okay he doesn't- as you might expect

835
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:30,580
He hardly got a word in edgewise

836
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,900
Cause of you and me

837
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,140
So I'll fade it out after- after

838
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,280
He- his last words I think

839
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,540
On this tape

840
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:40,460
Let's see if this works

841
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:41,200
Yeah

842
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,120
Our merchant credit card company

843
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:44,820
Quit doing business with us

844
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:45,260
Wow

845
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:48,280
Having looked at the website and discovered that there was

846
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:52,020
Quote questionable material unquote

847
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:54,720
So Jesus- Jesus

848
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,000
Fat- fat naked people in a swimming pool at Brushwood

849
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,180
Yeah Jesus had to call up

850
00:41:58,180 --> 00:41:58,980
That is always questionable

851
00:41:58,980 --> 00:41:59,980
A new bank

852
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:00,200
And who-

853
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,440
We had to find a- a- a pornographer's bank

854
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,180
That would do anything for a buck

855
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:06,200
Praise Bob and God bless America

856
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:09,680
Where there's still people who do anything for a buck

857
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:11,620
And understand the values

858
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,520
You're on the air with Lonesome Cowboy Dave

859
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:18,300
You know you were complaining about the one world advertiser

860
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,380
I- I think it's a fine little giveaway paper

861
00:42:21,380 --> 00:42:22,960
I find on my doorstep

862
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:23,720
Every day

863
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:25,560
The one world paper boy throws it in here

864
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:26,480
Look over here

865
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:30,400
One- one church of the subgenius for sale

866
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:31,620
What?

867
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,400
Yeah

868
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,840
It's on page three of the one world advertiser

869
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,580
Underneath the garage sale listings and the lost kitties

870
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:39,840
Well

871
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:44,180
The church of the subgenius has been willing to sell out for a long time

872
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:44,940
It's in the shopper

873
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:46,320
They haven't had any buyers yet

874
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:49,300
Oh man if you get it in the shopper that means it's definitely going down

875
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:53,900
Those guys see they're- they're very anxious to jump the stories they say in those local news gardens

876
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,560
Market analysis summary

877
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:59,020
The subgenius market is not restricted by age, gender, belief system or even international boundaries

878
00:42:59,020 --> 00:42:59,980
Anybody might be interested

879
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,800
The majority of our members fall in ridden males 18 to 25

880
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:06,160
Above average intelligence

881
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,940
Computer literate and somewhat rebellious

882
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:11,320
That's not what this says

883
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:13,520
It says almost free to good home

884
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:15,480
And then tape jacks

885
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:22,120
Sounds like a good profile of hackers who may have attacked the sites over the last few days

886
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:24,060
I don't know if they got the profile

887
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:26,080
They got you know John Douglas

888
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:27,460
They might all be in this together

889
00:43:27,460 --> 00:43:29,280
The same people that knocked down those sites

890
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,960
Can you imagine the FBI profile

891
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,960
I think someone called up Talk of the Nation today and claimed the church of the subgenius had something to do with that

892
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:37,740
Figures

893
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:39,760
Wouldn't that be a funny joke

894
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,100
As long as they spell the name right in the newspaper

895
00:43:42,100 --> 00:43:42,940
You're an RBI

896
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:45,780
I'm referring to Papa Joe's stunt

897
00:43:45,780 --> 00:43:46,320
Yes

898
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:52,120
The world's first Macintosh virus was blamed on the church of the subgenius

899
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:53,480
It was a lie

900
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:54,500
A lie

901
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,260
Because it was a peace message

902
00:43:56,260 --> 00:44:02,500
Well that is the reason why the genetic spawn that you have for fornicating apples have ruined mankind

903
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:04,700
And have ruined our business structure

904
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:05,120
That's why we have to leave

905
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,240
Have ruined the social infrastructure and our cultural beliefs

906
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:09,300
Look at what it's become

907
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,520
It's you know it destroyed everything with that

908
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,920
It's like the story of Para Ubu

909
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,380
Like the absurdity of mankind

910
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:17,240
Yeah

911
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:17,920
Yeah

912
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:20,200
Well I'm gonna fight that out

913
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:27,060
That's I think that was the last that we heard from Dr. Dark on that recording

914
00:44:27,060 --> 00:44:27,720
Goodness

915
00:44:28,520 --> 00:44:30,300
That's unbelievable the voices

916
00:44:30,300 --> 00:44:31,120
I thought yeah

917
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,060
I thought it was quite well done

918
00:44:33,060 --> 00:44:34,200
It sounded like him

919
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,120
It was a little more tenorous

920
00:44:36,120 --> 00:44:39,440
Stan was slightly very slightly more tenorous

921
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,680
I was a bit bit more tenorous

922
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,540
Oh yes

923
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,960
But I think that's a quality recording

924
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:50,660
As far as like going bowling with it and trying to pick up some prostitute or something

925
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:52,480
I don't know if it's gonna make any sense

926
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,280
Well you should try that

927
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:56,360
Go ahead and try it Dave

928
00:44:57,260 --> 00:45:02,400
Oh so you're urging me you're spawning me to take my spawn the spawn of my loins

929
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,800
Which is hard and fast and heavy for many thousands of years right now

930
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,900
Especially when my genetic coding

931
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,480
Which is about

932
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:12,680
Looks like a regular standard draft paper

933
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,720
And that's why I had to leave the Air Force

934
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:17,720
It's

935
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:21,020
You know the abuse you take every few moments

936
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:28,580
Now here's a recording of from another ESO show an even older one

937
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:32,700
I would list this from hour of slack number 664

938
00:45:33,480 --> 00:45:35,620
Which would make it about a year before this

939
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,200
The one we just heard so this would be about 1999

940
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:40,120
Oh that makes sense because

941
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:41,800
We had just done the

942
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,680
Subgenius new

943
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:47,580
In woe

944
00:45:47,580 --> 00:45:52,780
New world order game with Steve Jackson games

945
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,700
It was a role playing game

946
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:56,180
Card set

947
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,180
And we were talking you and me

948
00:45:59,180 --> 00:46:01,360
Were talking about

949
00:46:03,160 --> 00:46:04,540
What the

950
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,800
Something about how aliens

951
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,040
Sex with God

952
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:14,460
Then aliens hiding in plain sight

953
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:17,120
And then it says quote Medusa versus Gorgonzola

954
00:46:18,420 --> 00:46:23,640
And we were talking about like if when you play the subgenius card game

955
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,500
If you draw a Medusa one player draws Medusa card

956
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:30,820
The next one draws say the doctor Gorgonzola card

957
00:46:31,780 --> 00:46:36,220
And they hit they pit it against each other here I'll just play this type

958
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:40,000
Those are the aliens that are hiding in plain view

959
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,560
I mean they're right out in front of us

960
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:45,280
You never actually saw one of them though they had a real face right

961
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,000
I mean

962
00:46:46,580 --> 00:46:47,940
Well if I how would I know

963
00:46:47,940 --> 00:46:52,560
I mean we all might have they might be around us all the time we wouldn't know

964
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:56,300
Yeah but you made it sound as if you had heard or had some taste of

965
00:46:56,300 --> 00:47:01,720
Clonians going on where people were saying that they knew what they described their face to

966
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,600
And you said it was horrific like was Gorgonzola and Hegesys them guys

967
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:09,980
Yeah exactly they were hideous like Gorgonzola like that thing that drips off on you

968
00:47:09,980 --> 00:47:10,280
And you can see the blood on his face

969
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:11,040
Yeah

970
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,680
When he gets all worked up

971
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:20,700
And that's why Medusa had to hang a shield up there so he could look at it and say check this out man you need a shield you know

972
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:26,740
Right and yeah it was stupid it was like Medusa had the super power of turning people to stone

973
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:31,320
But Gorgonzola had that smell that could even kill Medusa

974
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:35,920
Well that's what you were saying if the guys wanted to be actually decomposed in space

975
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,960
They would have to transfer them smells into their chambers where they make them into the blood

976
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,340
And they would have to go into different homes where they are

977
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:46,320
Like if you're playing Illuminati New World Order on some secret orchestra

978
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:49,820
And you use the plug in the Gorgonzola plug in

979
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:55,340
You can like if you get that when it's infected that will take your opponents

980
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:00,640
Chainer device or Legume or Lonesome Cowboy Dave or whatever

981
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:04,480
And you know then you can convert you could you get their powers

982
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:09,720
Yeah but if you start double clicking on them things come up I heard that whole civilization's disappeared

983
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:15,360
This is Dr. Q Ellis here coming to you live from Friendly

984
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,700
Well so there was a little bit of that in there

985
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:22,440
I think I accidentally cut off my cordon

986
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:29,340
Quite an adaptive an adventurous soundtrack which I think is equals parallels none

987
00:48:29,960 --> 00:48:30,980
I could tell by the sound

988
00:48:30,980 --> 00:48:33,780
If you divide something by zero

989
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:39,880
That was when I was calling WCSB from Texas

990
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:43,520
And recording the shows off the internet

991
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,960
That's why it had that unique horrible quality to it

992
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,620
Hollywood is what you meant right that unique Hollywood quality

993
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:55,760
No I wouldn't say that exactly

994
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:01,520
Well would you say Meekie or would you say devout or impersonal

995
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:03,920
Or any of those other four letter words

996
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:06,060
I would say praise Bob

997
00:49:07,360 --> 00:49:09,580
And I would say hail Connie

998
00:49:10,440 --> 00:49:11,580
I would say

999
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:12,160
Hail yeah

1000
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,520
I would say apparel

1001
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:17,740
But

1002
00:49:17,740 --> 00:49:19,500
If that's your name

1003
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:26,900
Yeah well this was a show that we didn't expect to do

1004
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:29,600
But I'm glad we did it

1005
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:39,040
I hope that Dr. Dark approves and I'm sure he'll find out a way to let us know if he doesn't

1006
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:45,720
Yes and we will be highlighting those as you encounter them in the future weeks I'm sure

1007
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,560
Well you know I don't believe in ghosts

1008
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:51,280
Because I'm scared of them

1009
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,440
Me too

1010
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,520
They're the worst in the haze

1011
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:57,920
Yeah that just freaks me out

1012
00:49:57,920 --> 00:50:01,060
And so we'll see

1013
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:03,360
Well we'll see

1014
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,040
President we'll see the third year

1015
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,020
That's the guy who started all this with all these random things

1016
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,780
And strange thoughts and strange recollections

1017
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:11,040
Who?

1018
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:17,680
That's why Randolph Scott or Wilma Jane Turker or something

1019
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:18,620
I forget

1020
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:20,720
The heck is he talking about H.P. Lovecraft

1021
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:24,480
H.P. Lovecraft that's right he was lurking here someplace

1022
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:32,240
And he said that if Dr. Dark was going to come back he would come back as a French werewolf

1023
00:50:32,240 --> 00:50:35,840
A dark haired lovemeister French werewolf

1024
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,080
With paws and teeth

1025
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,720
Let's see

1026
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,580
I didn't make it up I just related the information

1027
00:50:46,420 --> 00:50:47,540
That's all I ever do anyway

1028
00:50:47,540 --> 00:50:51,580
To convey any idea of these monstrosities is impossible

1029
00:50:51,580 --> 00:50:59,200
They were of the reptile kind with body lines suggesting sometimes the crocodile sometimes the seal

1030
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:04,280
But more often nothing of which either the naturalist or the paleontologist ever heard

1031
00:51:04,280 --> 00:51:06,700
This is H.P. Lovecraft

1032
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:11,900
These are from Papa Joe Mama's H.P. Lovecraft trading cards

1033
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:17,560
Papa Joe makes trading cards on the side

1034
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:22,560
He just gave me his 100 card set of dinosaurs

1035
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,900
Yes quite impressive

1036
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:29,540
I'd never heard of 99% of those 100 dinosaurs

1037
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:32,880
Well what happens if you lose your Cthulhu card

1038
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:35,800
Can you send back for another one?

1039
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,780
No you can use the Gorgonzola card

1040
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,420
And use the stinky cheese power

1041
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:41,080
Right

1042
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,060
To beat Cthulhu

1043
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:43,820
Absolutely

1044
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:48,940
You know if you use a subgenius's abnormality power

1045
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:52,240
Is its greatest power

1046
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:56,540
And each of us has different abnormality powers

1047
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:58,500
Our subject for tonight

1048
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:03,540
The late but early to the saucers Dr. Dark

1049
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:09,320
Was had many many great abnormality powers

1050
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,000
Unfortunately he had some that weren't

1051
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,320
He told me at one point he was really a genetic mutant

1052
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,860
And that was the reason that he had to deal with all those cancers

1053
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,780
And he did beat a whole bunch of cancers

1054
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:25,200
Oh he sure did

1055
00:52:27,460 --> 00:52:31,820
But you know and I'll say this every day

1056
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:33,460
I'm not going to lie to you

1057
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:35,800
It's tough being a large mammal

1058
00:52:37,340 --> 00:52:39,440
There's just no way around that

1059
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:45,060
It's even very difficult to be a small mammal

1060
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,440
I don't know how the side figures into it

1061
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:49,700
Although I certainly agree with the sentiment

1062
00:52:50,460 --> 00:52:53,180
Especially where the wisecracker army is like really

1063
00:52:53,180 --> 00:52:55,540
Is facing certain doom you know

1064
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,700
And they're all lined up on the sides of the hills

1065
00:52:57,700 --> 00:53:00,800
And they're ready to set their underpants on fire

1066
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,440
In front of a thousand people just to fight them

1067
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,520
And watch the spectacle

1068
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:08,220
Well most small animals don't know

1069
00:53:08,220 --> 00:53:10,500
That they're going to die

1070
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:12,740
Right large mammals have these big brains

1071
00:53:12,740 --> 00:53:14,240
They can think all about it

1072
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:15,040
Yeah they can fret

1073
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:15,780
Fret

1074
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:19,040
Or plan as the case may be

1075
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,080
Or why not both

1076
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:20,800
Tread to access

1077
00:53:22,200 --> 00:53:23,800
When they offered

1078
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:28,320
When they offer me the red pill or the blue pill

1079
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:30,260
Why not both

1080
00:53:31,220 --> 00:53:32,600
That's what I'm going to say

1081
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:35,940
Why not both

1082
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:40,100
Friends you're listening to the hour of slack

1083
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:44,120
This is episode number 1635

1084
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:47,620
That's how many we've done

1085
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:50,200
Although we sometimes run reruns

1086
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:53,960
But mostly they're fresh

1087
00:53:53,960 --> 00:53:56,600
And it'll be canned

1088
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,680
A new canned show that no one's heard next week

1089
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:03,200
Actually people on the internet have heard it

1090
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:05,320
We're doing everything out of order

1091
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:08,360
And that's another thing

1092
00:54:08,360 --> 00:54:10,320
That endears us all to

1093
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,580
B-b-b-bad

1094
00:54:12,340 --> 00:54:13,900
I like to think

1095
00:54:14,900 --> 00:54:15,960
Yes that's why

1096
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,100
That's why TSLA was a

1097
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:21,600
A hack and a heistermeister

1098
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,160
And like if they were

1099
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:25,040
Dr. Dark were still

1100
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,260
In the reptile room

1101
00:54:27,260 --> 00:54:29,080
Without you know not being able to

1102
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,120
Have to cause me trouble

1103
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:31,920
Cause remember he used to wear

1104
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,500
A sweat mask something

1105
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,160
Or not a sweat mask but a

1106
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,160
He had a Mexican wrestler mask

1107
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:38,660
Yes

1108
00:54:38,660 --> 00:54:41,660
Oh I was talking about the surgical mask

1109
00:54:41,660 --> 00:54:44,120
Oh yeah remember his penis nose mask

1110
00:54:44,120 --> 00:54:48,360
God he would show up with the most outrageous costumes

1111
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:53,600
He had a penis nose face thing

1112
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,820
And who wouldn't want one

1113
00:54:56,680 --> 00:54:59,520
Well it fit him perfectly I must say

1114
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,180
It was you know quite a

1115
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:03,180
Handsome penis nose

1116
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:04,640
Gross

1117
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:07,040
That's why they call them titanium microns

1118
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,900
But if you're into that sort of thing yeah

1119
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:11,580
You're afraid of business

1120
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,940
Because that's what my grandfather used to

1121
00:55:14,940 --> 00:55:16,480
That's what he tried to teach me

1122
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:17,140
He said you know

1123
00:55:17,140 --> 00:55:19,160
The wisdom of the little people

1124
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,060
Or the starlings

1125
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,340
Or the hectorades of confusion

1126
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:25,280
It's one of those groups

1127
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,440
In Washington D.C. near the beltway

1128
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,500
Where they have like secret temples underneath them

1129
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:29,840
And they're like the earth

1130
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:33,760
Because I guess Washington D.C. is on a

1131
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:34,620
33rd

1132
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,260
33rd degree parallel

1133
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,380
Of longitude

1134
00:55:39,380 --> 00:55:41,680
Well you're listening to

1135
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:42,980
Subgenius Hour of Slack

1136
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,060
And if you need to know more about

1137
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:47,720
Any of this

1138
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:50,460
There is a subgenius.com

1139
00:55:50,460 --> 00:55:53,120
Which is like a bottomless pit

1140
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,260
But the simplest thing

1141
00:55:55,260 --> 00:55:58,280
What a lot of people do is they skip all the instructions

1142
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:01,280
And just go straight to some free Facebook page

1143
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,340
And there's lots of those

1144
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:05,780
There's even one called

1145
00:56:05,780 --> 00:56:09,280
There's too damn many subgenius Facebook pages

1146
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:09,780
Yes

1147
00:56:10,560 --> 00:56:13,560
So Dave I'm going to play this last song

1148
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,900
By the Rudy Schwartz Project

1149
00:56:15,900 --> 00:56:19,160
I think that Dr. Dark would have approved of it

1150
00:56:19,160 --> 00:56:21,420
And I hope he enjoys it

1151
00:56:21,420 --> 00:56:25,380
Although I think I had to cut one of the cuss words

1152
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:27,420
Three or four times

1153
00:56:28,280 --> 00:56:29,280
Rudy Schwartz

1154
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,420
Thanks for calling Dave

1155
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:32,680
It is difficult work

1156
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,920
And we'll do it again

1157
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:39,560
And meanwhile here is the Rudy Schwartz Project song called

1158
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,060
Kill for God

1159
00:56:43,280 --> 00:56:43,920
See you Dave

1160
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,280
Bryan

1161
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:48,240
I want to join Islamic Jihad

1162
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:51,920
I just want to kill for God

1163
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:56,240
Praising Allah is the life for me

1164
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:02,620
I'll use pipe bombs, what the fuck

1165
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:06,260
Killing Hebrews brings good luck

1166
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:10,560
Gotta make Khomeini proud of me

1167
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:15,700
Load a car with dynamite

1168
00:58:15,700 --> 00:58:19,200
And drive into a synagogue without any brakes

1169
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:22,720
Nothing could be better than

1170
00:58:22,720 --> 00:58:26,220
Impaling your intestines on a big rusty stick

1171
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:31,620
Hand grenades and cattle prods

1172
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:34,700
Let's go out and kill for God

1173
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:39,140
I can hear Mohammed calling me

1174
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:48,000
Yowza, yowza, yowza

1175
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:02,340
I'll have Ð¿Ð¾Ñ on myavantela

1176
00:59:02,340 --> 00:59:05,440
And I'll be

1177
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:10,160
Intended 0-0 to be

1178
00:59:14,260 --> 00:59:16,580
Uptown madman of myantela

1179
00:59:16,580 --> 00:59:26,220
Winning And've got to end them then

1180
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:46,160
Though the Koran seems quite odd, I still want to kill for God.

1181
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:50,440
Praising Jesus is the life for me.

1182
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:57,160
Fuck those pagans, they're such cynics.

1183
00:59:57,300 --> 01:00:00,500
Let's bomb the abortion clinic.

1184
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,740
Jerry Falwell is my cup of tea.

1185
01:00:07,620 --> 01:00:13,020
Never thought I'd make it big by selling God to idiots on cable TV.

1186
01:00:14,740 --> 01:00:20,080
What the fuck, it's not GE, but still a better way to use my business degree.

1187
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:25,440
Use a rifle, spare the rod.

1188
01:00:25,860 --> 01:00:28,980
Let's go out and kill for God.

1189
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,280
Praise the Lord and hand that gun to me.
