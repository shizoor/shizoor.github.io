1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
The phone you are using does not allow...

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,900
The Self Genius Power of Swagging!

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:22,140
This device requires recall passes. Please hear a clinical note early, then reach in card.

4
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:38,420
Sitting on his pedestal and reaching for a roll of paper, Mr. Satan Butterwolf began to plan his fiendish caper.

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,880
With a grin and with a look that reminisced of butter books, he wiped the residue from neath his tail,

6
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:51,100
buckled his perfect trousers right, and to himself we hear him pray.

7
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,120
Or do we?

8
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:52,380
Or say.

9
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,620
Or whatever.

10
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,620
My body's full of shit and bones. My body's full of angel light.

11
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:05,200
My legs get very sweaty when I sleep alone at night.

12
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:10,300
My body's full of angel light. My body's full of shit and bones.

13
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:14,280
My legs get very sweaty at night when I sleep alone.

14
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:19,260
And when Mr. Satan Butterwolf came up, all the bunnies gathered round.

15
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:21,460
And when Mr. Satan Butterwolf came up,

16
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,120
he saw the fiendish caper.

17
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,580
He saw the fuzzy bunnies for miles and miles.

18
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:27,860
And when Mr. Satan Butterwolf came up, all the bunnies asked his name.

19
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,040
He answered them with vicious lies.

20
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,640
Their laughter made them all fair game.

21
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:38,340
Now sitting on his pedestal and reaching for a roll of paper,

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,100
Mr. Satan Butterwolf found humor in his recent caper.

23
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:50,100
Peering in the water cool, he saw the faces in his stools

24
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:55,660
of Bunny Bob, Clark and Carl, Bunny Biff, and Baby Bunny Sue.

25
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:01,480
They appeared to have fun out laughing in the sun in their carefree bunny gardens.

26
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,300
Vegetation everywhere, life without a care in a carefree bunny, bunny garden.

27
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:12,520
Everything was happy there, bunny crap left everywhere to sit in the sun and harden.

28
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:16,340
But Mr. Satan Butterwolf had plans for tomorrow.

29
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:20,080
Their cheap facade of innocence would lead the bunnies all the way to the sun.

30
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:25,100
But Mr. Satan Butterwolf would hide his face behind the shadow sheet.

31
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,980
And Bunny Greed brought bunnies to believe it best to just pretend

32
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:34,420
not to see the cloven hoofs that butterwolves are forced to wear for feet.

33
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,540
For a fair weathered cherub is a butterwolf's meat.

34
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,980
As they come hopping, as they come hopping to hell,

35
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:43,360
as they come nonstop hop, hop, hopping to the sound of devil bells,

36
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:48,860
all pride-eyed and bushy-tailed, the bunnies found it well for them to cheat.

37
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:56,720
And to tell lies behind your backs so vulgar that a gentleman like Mr. Satan Butterwolf

38
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,920
could never find fit to repeat.

39
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:08,880
Gracious indeed.

40
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,560
Alright, that's all I have against the Billy Dare Show.

41
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,500
Thank you very much for having us here.

42
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,600
Thank you for bringing us.

43
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,340
Quite welcome, quite welcome.

44
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:22,640
That was the Billy Nayer Show, live at 9X Day.

45
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:27,520
BillyNayer.com is where you can learn more about them

46
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:31,040
as well as their great movie, The American Astronaut.

47
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,480
This is Hour of Slack number 1058,

48
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:43,240
a fourth of the specials recorded entirely at the 9X Day subgenius festival of July 5th week,

49
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:48,200
or at radio stations WCSB Cleveland and KPFA Berkeley,

50
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,520
right afterwards.

51
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,020
This episode features some great ranting and music,

52
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,800
especially from the Billy Nayer Show soundboard recordings

53
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,340
made by Reverend Maynard Graynard.

54
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:05,080
These soundboard tapes don't do justice to the way the band really sounds,

55
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:09,520
and yet they're still better than most bands' best recordings,

56
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,620
just because of the extremely high bull-dada content.

57
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,040
You'll see what I mean.

58
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:18,180
Also, this show will feature and play,

59
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,020
and document the ongoing travails of Reverend Magdalene,

60
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:27,020
whose child, Con Bow, is still in the custody of Peaks

61
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:32,680
because of a judicial system so dumb that it thinks the church of the subgenius,

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,760
since it's obviously not Christian,

63
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:37,500
must therefore be the work of Satan!

64
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,600
Is it?

65
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,020
Let's find out, along with this caller, to the Puzzling Evidence Show

66
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:46,980
with Dr. Philodrum and Dr. Hal Puzzling Evidence and some little girl.

67
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,900
The church of the subgenius?

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,220
Yes, this is subgenius. Can I help you?

69
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:53,880
Hi, Colleen.

70
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,780
I have a question, please.

71
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,480
A subgenius-type question?

72
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,920
We have an answer. They may not match, but go ahead.

73
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,440
I've been considering joining your religion.

74
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,180
Well, that's right, Hanson.

75
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,220
Demanding our religion?

76
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,380
You can see it behind us here.

77
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:07,860
Joining.

78
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,520
At the wrists and elbows.

79
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,860
I think I may want to be a subgenius.

80
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,240
Well, here you are.

81
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,980
You say you want to know where to send me.

82
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:22,200
Is this a monotheism that you have here?

83
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,660
No, it is most definitely not.

84
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:30,780
It has to do with the consideration of the bewildering number of deities.

85
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:36,500
And now I know of something I can say that will be of interest to other people.

86
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,920
I was searching among the odd fragments that I heard

87
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,400
when I was out there at that great festival called X-Day,

88
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,000
and here is the scoop.

89
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,040
That you're just gonna love.

90
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,080
Yeah, yeah.

91
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,660
Vanilla, chocolate, quartz.

92
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,540
All this is very real. That's the sad part.

93
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,560
People don't understand that.

94
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,460
No, it is.

95
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:59,840
The event he's describing was just held, the end of the world.

96
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,280
All right, well.

97
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:01,560
And here we are.

98
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:09,000
What we heard more about was the presiding child custody trial involving Magdalene.

99
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,160
Well, it turns out.

100
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,200
All of a sudden we get dragged down to real.

101
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:16,980
Well, it turns out that the prosecution really tried to make a big thing out of this.

102
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,680
And it was a subgenius and how it was really a Satanic cult.

103
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,340
So there was testimony with the court recorder taking it down.

104
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:27,080
All right, could you describe the meaning of Gabor Fram, please?

105
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:27,800
Yes!

106
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,200
Narnini and Narnunu.

107
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,900
Where is this?

108
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,340
This is public record.

109
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:34,520
Yes, let's watch it.

110
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,700
Court recorder is just going like this.

111
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,440
Oh, that'd be great.

112
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,700
Because she's seen pictures of Gary coming up on her computer.

113
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,580
It sounds like this.

114
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,400
Meanwhile, Judge Punch stormed out of the courtroom.

115
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,580
And came back without his robes on.

116
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,360
It's like Iraqistan.

117
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,840
And called them over for a conference and then recused himself.

118
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,940
And he was quite angry about all the bad things he got on the internet.

119
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,200
People calling him bad names.

120
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,360
That's what he gets when he messes with all the techno.

121
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:13,100
And he gave Magdalene a tongue lashing in court.

122
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,940
Ever seen that?

123
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,160
The Russian tank in Afghanistan?

124
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,300
I don't remember.

125
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,540
I don't have any idea what people write in Boing Boing or on the internet.

126
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,240
Yeah, Laughing Squid.

127
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,400
Yeah, she didn't get a movie.

128
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,960
So it was all very interesting.

129
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,180
Yeah, man.

130
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:31,420
It's a sinister plot against a…

131
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,920
Oh, we should mention, what schedule is there?

132
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,700
One thing that definitely will happen at a time tonight.

133
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:45,040
And that is the burning of the sacred icon.

134
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,760
And the book burning.

135
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:48,640
The Judge Punch Memorial book burning.

136
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,340
Oh, and I've got to remember, we've got to remember to put together the Judge Punch Memorial

137
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,480
punching bag.

138
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:57,880
We're going to be punching and bitch slapping Judge Punch by proxy.

139
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,600
We're going to be burning Bob's head, burning our parents' divorce papers, burning

140
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,920
whatever kind of hated documents or things we've got on us.

141
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,840
I wouldn't recommend membership cards.

142
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,020
That's an old joke.

143
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,740
And it was…

144
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:15,020
Sending onerous, uh, books.

145
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,020


146
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,880
Paperwork to bureaucratic shiel.

147
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:18,020
Right.

148
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,200
And, uh, and also the Judge working out aggressions.

149
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,600
Unfortunately, Jesus isn't here.

150
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:30,620
I've noticed that when the Lord is at X day, at some point or another, he gets the crap

151
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:36,360
beat out of him just because people have such powerful feelings about him.

152
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:38,580
Even though they know it's not his fault.

153
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:44,080
He didn't mean to put the Y-0-K bug.

154
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,040
He just wanted to put the Y-0-K bug into effect and cause the Dark Ages.

155
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,540
Uh, that was all his fan club.

156
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,680
But nonetheless, people, God, they always just tear him to shreds.

157
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,120
Maybe that's why he's not here.

158
00:08:57,740 --> 00:08:58,660
It could be.

159
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,820
Last time we saw him at X day, he was carrying a cross formed into a dollar sign

160
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,560
of pool noodles down the road.

161
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,400
And half the people here were hitting him, striking him, and squirting fake blood at

162
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:14,400
him through silly squirt guns to humiliate him.

163
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:16,860
Aw.

164
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:20,080
Thanks again east of A災.

165
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:29,380
Don't mention siitä, writs е!

166
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,240
That was literally his first comment.

167
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:31,440
Just seeing Brian DePaulus are not blind.

168
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,280
So, uh…

169
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,400
It gets me.

170
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:32,400


171
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:32,560
It's been interesting.

172
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,420
I don't even want to talk about it pal.

173
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,580
Ladies.

174
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,420
Him who shall come is Bob.

175
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,360
J.R. Bob Dobbs.

176
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:48,220
Yes.

177
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:54,820
And he also has not been seen at an ex-day or drill in a long time or any revival

178
00:09:54,820 --> 00:10:00,040
because every time he did, somebody would take him up on that advice to kill him.

179
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,700
Young punks.

180
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,460
Yeah.

181
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:06,440
So he got tired of having to wear bulletproof clothing at shows.

182
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:12,940
He had to go up against every young whippersnapper who came along

183
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,740
and tried to take old Dobbs down.

184
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,420
Now they use me instead.

185
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:21,600
It's like, oh, I'll show that I'm not a Bobby by making fun of Reverend Stang constantly.

186
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:26,400
But tonight you can all take a whack at Judge Punch,

187
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:30,800
the Judge Punch by proxy punching bag punch out,

188
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:35,360
and later on dance dementedly around the fire.

189
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:39,820
Well, maybe we should describe what happened at the bonfire, or do you think not?

190
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,900
Sure, why not?

191
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:41,560
The bonfire?

192
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:41,680
The bonfire.

193
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:48,300
First off, the Brushwood Woodbusters, which are the fire experts there,

194
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:53,760
built us a wonderful copy of the Dobbs head icon,

195
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:59,480
sort of a stripped down Bob head that looks almost like a cross,

196
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,460
but with more cross bars on it and a pipe.

197
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,140
Yeah.

198
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:10,200
And that thing was set on fire, and I ranted interminably over the bullhorn as always.

199
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,220
And so now.

200
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:15,280
Judge Punch thought we were satanic because of the goat head.

201
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:18,760
And now we're burning crosses, so he's going to think we're affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan.

202
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,460
Well, but we tried to bring it all together in a symbolic moment.

203
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:29,460
During this particular burning of the icon, the little pipe part fell off in one piece.

204
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:34,080
It's actually two pieces of wood, but it fell off of the face part onto the ground,

205
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:37,080
and the whole of that wooden pipe was smoking.

206
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,740
It was an all-smoking pipe.

207
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:39,820


208
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:40,420
Right.

209
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,260
Right.

210
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:41,540
Right.

211
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


212
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


213
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


214
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


215
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


216
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


217
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


218
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


219
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


220
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


221
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


222
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


223
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


224
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


225
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


226
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


227
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:41,540


228
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:47,240
The pipe up to the satanic goat head that, well, actually it was a cute goat head.

229
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,500
Yeah, really, that's not satanic at all.

230
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,640
That Judge Punch had complained about.

231
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,500
And so the goat head came together with the all-smoking pipe.

232
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:03,800
Later on, there was like a bigger log pipe, which was smoked by the big fire itself.

233
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,020
I'm still trying to figure out the logic of that one and what it means.

234
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,440
Basically what it all means, all right, is that you can burn Bob to death,

235
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,460
you can burn him alive, but his pipe will keep on burning and burning.

236
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,900
His pipe will smoke forever.

237
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:16,400
That's right.

238
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,400
And sometimes it will smoke itself.

239
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,040
It's got froth in it.

240
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,560
What do you expect?

241
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,520
Well, it's got more than that.

242
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,900
No, actually, Bob mostly smokes Borkham Riff.

243
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:30,500
Did he come back from the ashes like a phoenix?

244
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:41,540
But I was very surprised because we were burning hated books like American History Text.

245
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:41,540


246
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:41,540


247
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:41,540


248
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:41,540


249
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:43,800
Now we're burning books, too.

250
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:49,840
There was also a full-sized Judge Punch punching bag,

251
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:57,560
which I had actually purchased at one of those stores that has toys.

252
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,500
It was really hard to find a punching bag.

253
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,340
Anyway, that was the Judge Punch punching bag.

254
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:08,340
And I expected the subgeniuses to be lining up to abuse that thing.

255
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:11,120
But oddly enough, the most famous...

256
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:11,460
Nobody wanted to touch them.

257
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,640
The most vicious Punch Puncher was a little five-year-old girl.

258
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:16,320
She was five.

259
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:16,680
Wow.

260
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,080
Named Haley, who was the...

261
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,060
Daughter of the wood dealer.

262
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,780
Yeah, she was the daughter of one of the wood busters.

263
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:30,660
Haley, a little PC pagan child, was just furiously angry at Judge Punch

264
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:33,380
and tore into him with all her heart.

265
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:39,600
Her mom later came up and knifed him, although she knifed him in the air part.

266
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,300
His bottom part was full of water.

267
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,120
And I gutted that part.

268
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,340
Just like the real Judge.

269
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:46,360
It got kind of violent.

270
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,880
And then, of course, we had to...

271
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,960
Eventually, there was a sacrifice.

272
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:57,780
And as usual, who had to drag the burned-up guy out of the fire?

273
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:00,060
Me, Reverend Stang.

274
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,340
Everybody else had gone off to party.

275
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,380
Well, me and Reverend Nicky.

276
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,080
Nicky had his experience with that.

277
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:10,520
Well, I mean, you kind of broke Haley's heart when you tore apart the Judge Punch doll.

278
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,460
Oh, she knew that was going to happen.

279
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,860
She was really having fun torturing him.

280
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:19,300
Actually, her dad told me that he was going to find her another one.

281
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,320
And I was able to...

282
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:24,660
Luckily, I was able to tell him all about every kind of punch bag available.

283
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,080
Wait a second.

284
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,880
Having just shone for him.

285
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:31,720
You know, it's weird the things you end up doing just before the end of the world.

286
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,980
Oh, my God, I've got to find this punching bag.

287
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,480
Well, it's a pity that you couldn't be there.

288
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:43,220
Fly high over the lawn sprinklers.

289
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,620
Okay, I've got some bubble gum.

290
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,280
I'm going to patch that hole.

291
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,760
It's dawn in that forest that you were just in.

292
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:50,980
Causing the reverse pressure leak.

293
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,380
It's more pressure in here now.

294
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,100
Cooking chicken and ale ate there in the forest.

295
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,820
Ah, yes.

296
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,320
That's what they do.

297
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:03,740
They get this soda pop from Kentucky and they cook chicken in it.

298
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:07,240
It comes out with a very strange taste.

299
00:15:07,280 --> 00:15:08,660
The taste of X-Day.

300
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,240
So, how many...

301
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:10,880
How many...

302
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:11,260
This tastes like X-Day.

303
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:11,280
This tastes like X-Day.

304
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,060
The ashes and smell.

305
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:12,680
It's not bad, no.

306
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,440
It's just...

307
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:18,220
You could ask how many weirdos and occult poops were there.

308
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:18,900
I don't know.

309
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,320
How many weirdos and poops were there this year?

310
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,660
More than you could shake a stick at.

311
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,600
Yeah, the Wonder Bread logo.

312
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:32,500
For the most part, you didn't, but you wanted to go to Doc Frop's camp and vape out every hour, every day.

313
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:33,820
I saw somebody...

314
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:38,640
I saw the little over-weight go face down in the vape-o.

315
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,320
Oh, yeah.

316
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,720
He had to go to the hospital.

317
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,140
And almost get me arrested just to take a picture of him.

318
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,020
A certain vape entity said he...

319
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:47,120
He had to go to the hospital.

320
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:50,280
So, did anybody have to go to the hospital this year?

321
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,840
No one went to the hospital.

322
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:55,460
See, that's the measure of a good stock of any kind, like Doc Stock.

323
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,380
But one thing is...

324
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,080
Somebody has to go to the hospital.

325
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:02,620
Nikki Deathchick is actually a medical technician of some sort.

326
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,660
So, she is essentially the medical person on the spot.

327
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,120
She's like the general, the secretary general.

328
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:10,760
The...

329
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:12,000
What do they call them?

330
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,900
The Joyce elders of the...

331
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:15,680
Joyce Day.

332
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:17,800
Of the subgenius church.

333
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,200
Magdalene Sister Zeus is also studying nursing.

334
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,860
The surgeon general.

335
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,980
She's like the surgeon general of the church, Nikki Deathchick.

336
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,740
Officially, whether or not the church is satanic.

337
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,280
Well, that...

338
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,480
It all depends on what...

339
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:38,240
What happened is with the new trial, they said we refuse to admit this subgenius thing as evidence.

340
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:39,920
It has nothing to do with anything.

341
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:41,040
It was...

342
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:41,540
You know...

343
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,340
Yay!

344
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,000
But...

345
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,580
But then the court said...

346
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:45,120
Don't fall over.

347
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:45,660
Stand up there.

348
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:52,860
The court said we're going to allow it anyway because it shows the state of mind of the defendant.

349
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:55,580
Wait, yay!

350
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,280
But...

351
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:56,980
State of mind?

352
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,580
Subgenius shows state of mind?

353
00:16:58,580 --> 00:17:03,120
But the lawyer tried to get it completely thrown out on the grounds that it had...

354
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,780
It was not composed at the same time.

355
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,240
It was not about the defendant.

356
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:07,820
It...

357
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:08,800
You know, it was...

358
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,300
It's really being brought in in there.

359
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:10,360
They're...

360
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:13,400
They're having all this testimony about Gabofam.

361
00:17:13,580 --> 00:17:13,880
And...

362
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,360
Yeah.

363
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:17,000
And who can define Gabofam?

364
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,240
We've tried it a lot of times here on the show.

365
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,020
Yeah.

366
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:20,660
To define...

367
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,000
Yeah.

368
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:21,580
Define it now.

369
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:21,960
Do it.

370
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:22,960
Or Bohongas.

371
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:23,320
The...

372
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:24,520
The Gafine...

373
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,780
Gabofam.

374
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:26,320
Yeah.

375
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:26,320


376
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:30,040
Some people would say divine, but we say Gafine for Gabofam.

377
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:30,700
Gafine...

378
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:31,760
Gabofam.

379
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:32,140
Mighty fine.

380
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:33,720
Stammy fine.

381
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:34,600
Mighty fine.

382
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:34,860
Stammy fine.

383
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:35,720
Gabofam.

384
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,200
Gabofam.

385
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:37,880
Gabofam.

386
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,100
Gabofam.

387
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:38,820
Gabofam.

388
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:38,900
Gabofam.

389
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,220
Gabofam.

390
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:39,460
Gabofam.

391
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:39,560
Gabofam.

392
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,080
That's a real...

393
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:41,840
That's like nailing Jell-O to a wall.

394
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:44,100
Or stuffing it into a parking meter.

395
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:44,660
Jell-O?

396
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,080
But why?

397
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:45,740
And...

398
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:45,800
And...

399
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:49,680
I like to take Jell-O and put it into a parking meter.

400
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:52,040
Or trying to clean the windshield of the same vehicle with it.

401
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:52,260
Yeah.

402
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,260
Trying to clean the windshield with Jell-O.

403
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,960
If you have enough of it, it's okay, because you just spray it on.

404
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:58,840
Oh, okay.

405
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,280
The Puzzling Evidence Show there with Dr. Hal...

406
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,940
Dr. Philodrumon and Callers and K. Rob's girlfriend.

407
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,660
Friends...

408
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,580
Reverend...

409
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,260
Magdalene...

410
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,480
Magdalene needs help.

411
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,460
Seriously needs help.

412
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,180
Her lawyer bills are huge.

413
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,740
In fact, she needs $10,000 yesterday.

414
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,940
As you can hear, the subgeniuses are frantic about this.

415
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:27,040
Friends, I'm going to pull that music down because this is important enough.

416
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:33,620
If you want to get more information about the Bevilacqua case and how to donate...

417
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,580
I'm going to give you some...

418
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:39,060
Well, first, the PayPal address for...

419
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,300
Moms4Bob, if you just want to PayPal it.

420
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,600
MagdaleneatSubgenius.com

421
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:51,180
Magdalene is spelled M-A-G-D-A-L-E-N.

422
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:53,680
Or, her blog...

423
00:18:53,680 --> 00:19:04,360
Well, her name is Rachel Bevilacqua and she's on blogspot.com at rbevilacqua.blogspot.com.

424
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,600
I'm going to spell rbevilacqua.

425
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:08,580
That's R-B...

426
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:17,920
E-V-I-L-A-C-Q-U-A.

427
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:26,160
R-B-E-V-I-L-A-C-Q-U-A.blogspot.com.

428
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:34,320
Or, modemac.com.wiki.com.reverend.magdalene.

429
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,320
Praise Bob.

430
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,700
I think that's all the questions.

431
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:41,400
We do have one more. Can we do one more question?

432
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:41,940
All right. Certainly.

433
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,800
And this is... I don't know why this one wasn't asked before.

434
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:49,240
The question is, why a goat?

435
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,520
Well, you see, Bucky...

436
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,820
I should have brought that goat head down here. I have it.

437
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,600
Well, we have it. We have it nearby.

438
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:01,900
In a sense, it is always hovering nearby.

439
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:07,620
An ethereal presence to remind us that we are, after all,

440
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:11,740
dealing with religion here, with numinous powers.

441
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,140
Not only a cleverly constructed goat skull,

442
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:20,900
but also a goatish presence who no one knew would have the power

443
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:25,860
to reach ahead through time and affect and manipulate future events.

444
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:27,880
But why choose a goat anyway?

445
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:34,080
The fact is that in all previous cultures, sacrifices were made to the gods,

446
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:38,840
because these older gods had a taste for blood.

447
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,240
Yes, the blood was poured on the smoking altars.

448
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:48,660
And even the Christian gods, so goody-goody and namby-pamby,

449
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:55,160
enjoyed torn flesh and blood when it was offered up by Abel,

450
00:20:55,200 --> 00:21:00,980
and not the completely vegan and politically correct repast offered up by Cain.

451
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,080
Thus, Cain, in utter frustration,

452
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:10,090
slew Abel and was discharged from the Garden of Eden

453
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,370
with the disfiguring mark of the bobby on his brow.

454
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,250
So, why a goat?

455
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:20,650
Because the Judas goat, the sacrificial goat,

456
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,390
the one who goes before,

457
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:29,930
the goat is the symbol of the entity, the being,

458
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:33,450
that the hammer of injustice will come to.

459
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:34,190
And the goat is a beast that will come down upon,

460
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:35,630
right between the horns,

461
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,170
in order so that the same thing doesn't happen to us.

462
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:40,790
Let it happen to something,

463
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:43,810
and let that something be a goat.

464
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,130
The goat.

465
00:21:45,910 --> 00:21:50,630
Dr. Howell, there's another answer to that question.

466
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:51,750
There usually is.

467
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:58,330
I think Reverend Magdalen was a little too flustered

468
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,570
by being asked the question by the judge,

469
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:03,630
but there was a very simple answer to why a goat.

470
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:05,190
Well, of course, there's the...

471
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:07,970
When young Conbo asked her once,

472
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,770
Mom, why does the moon get bigger and smaller?

473
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:15,030
So sometimes there was a full moon,

474
00:22:15,090 --> 00:22:17,170
and then it would become a crescent moon.

475
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:18,790
He said, why does that happen?

476
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,930
She didn't want to go into the whole complicated explanation

477
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:24,470
about the sun and moon and everything,

478
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,130
and she said, well, that's the sky goat comes

479
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,250
and eats a little out of the moon every night.

480
00:22:30,570 --> 00:22:31,750
That's a real neat joke.

481
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:32,250
And it grows back.

482
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:37,930
And Reverend Magdalene, during the deity ball that year,

483
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:41,050
dressed herself as the sky goat.

484
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:42,110
There you go.

485
00:22:42,110 --> 00:22:46,610
This charming, self-created myth that she told her little boy

486
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:48,850
so that he would...

487
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,490
She quit asking questions about scientific,

488
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:54,590
astronomical, geophysics, and so forth.

489
00:22:55,510 --> 00:22:57,030
And that the...

490
00:22:57,030 --> 00:22:59,170
I'm sorry I didn't bring it down here.

491
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,390
We should bring it down.

492
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:02,530
Certainly for the ceremonies at the fire tonight.

493
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,430
We have the original sky goat mask.

494
00:23:05,950 --> 00:23:10,590
We had no idea how important that would be to Judge Punch.

495
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:12,590
It wasn't that important to us.

496
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:13,570
She almost threw it away.

497
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:17,970
But it turns out that that was the key

498
00:23:17,970 --> 00:23:22,050
to the hidden Satanism of the subgeniuses.

499
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:24,430
Speaking of Satanism, you know, at Starwood,

500
00:23:24,490 --> 00:23:26,190
they have 1,500 pagans here.

501
00:23:26,310 --> 00:23:29,190
And I've stood here, and I usually...

502
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:30,470
I don't get all 1,500.

503
00:23:30,570 --> 00:23:33,850
Come to my thing, because they have a nude body painting opposite.

504
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:39,710
But I've many times asked the assembled pagans in front of me,

505
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:40,590
200 or 300 people,

506
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:42,710
how many people here believe in Satan?

507
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:46,910
And one year, one guy held up his hand,

508
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:48,890
and he was a heavy metal band member.

509
00:23:49,290 --> 00:23:50,950
Well, it's a Christian sect.

510
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,190
You have to be a Christian if Satan is a member.

511
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,170
That's what I used to say.

512
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:58,010
But Nenslow corrected me very insultingly and said,

513
00:23:58,110 --> 00:24:00,490
My God, do I have to explain everything to you?

514
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,350
Satan has been around for 3,000 or 4,000 years.

515
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:04,570
He was Shaitan.

516
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:09,950
Under the name Shaitan, he was a sand devil or demon

517
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:12,570
of a pathetic little wandering tribe

518
00:24:12,570 --> 00:24:16,230
whose rep just got bigger and bigger and bigger.

519
00:24:16,350 --> 00:24:18,510
You know how that happens with some gods and demons.

520
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,770
They don't do anything that big,

521
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,430
but they become celebrities nonetheless.

522
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:27,210
And so for 2,000 years, we have to follow laws

523
00:24:27,830 --> 00:24:29,570
made up by their dipshit.

524
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:30,550

535
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:36,330
A

536
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:36,350
A

537
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:36,370
A

538
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,030
A

539
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,030


540
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:38,070
A

541
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,070


542
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,070


543
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:38,630
A

544
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,630


545
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,630


546
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,630


547
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:38,810
A

548
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:40,450
A

549
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:02,550
philosophy. You can't

550
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:04,170
contradict it. It's the ultimate

551
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:05,510
kook vehicle.

552
00:25:06,170 --> 00:25:08,610
And as a result, we've got a lot of

553
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:10,690
kooks hanging off the rear bumper

554
00:25:10,690 --> 00:25:11,950
of our fine vehicle.

555
00:25:12,350 --> 00:25:14,610
Yes, it's too much for them.

556
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:16,670
The seething eddies

557
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:18,390
of our passage have

558
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:20,470
disturbed them from their trance-like

559
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:20,830
sleep.

560
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,410
Hi, I believe

561
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,690
you should check out The Legend of Atlantis.

562
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:28,490
As Bob said, it's going to be

563
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:30,370
a bummer, man. The prophecy will

564
00:25:30,370 --> 00:25:32,410
ring through. Check it out.

565
00:25:32,610 --> 00:25:34,190
I better hear something on the next

566
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:36,290
hour or so. And peace out.

567
00:25:36,810 --> 00:25:37,890
Ivan Stang.

568
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:39,130
Peace out.

569
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:42,290
You know, Bob

570
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,190
did

571
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:46,110
say over and over again

572
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:47,730
the kind of things that

573
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:49,990
schizophrenics and

574
00:25:49,990 --> 00:25:52,190
crackpots most want to hear.

575
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:53,850
And

576
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:56,390
they have flocked to hear

577
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,230
him say that.

578
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,350
Now, we probably don't have to

579
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,450
deprogram many

580
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:04,390
of you, but

581
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:06,510
you know, there's people in the basement

582
00:26:06,510 --> 00:26:07,830
of the Dobstown University

583
00:26:07,830 --> 00:26:10,610
Science Clinic that we just can't

584
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,510
tell the conspiracy news media

585
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,470
about. We've never been

586
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,350
able to deprogram them. They're

587
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:18,270
still down there going, Bob Slack,

588
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,490
Bob Slack. Nothing wrong with that.

589
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,410
I did that for my first five years, too,

590
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,250
just as I'm sure most of you did.

591
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:26,490
But there is

592
00:26:26,490 --> 00:26:28,150
such a thing as you going overboard.

593
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:30,370
They do work for us at airports and

594
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:32,190
bus stations and things. They really

595
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:33,250
need supervision.

596
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,170
Right. So we find these people who

597
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,370
believe all the

598
00:26:38,370 --> 00:26:39,950
jokes and

599
00:26:39,950 --> 00:26:42,210
get the lies and then

600
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:43,870
call everybody else Bobbies.

601
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,730
So

602
00:26:45,730 --> 00:26:48,070
I was the first Bobby.

603
00:26:48,250 --> 00:26:50,090
If anybody calls another

604
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:52,230
subgenius a Bobby, you've got to call me

605
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:54,110
a Bobby first. I was the first Bobby

606
00:26:54,110 --> 00:26:55,730
and I'm the most slavish

607
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:57,630
and corny Bobby.

608
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:00,330
I'm not going to let anybody else

609
00:27:00,330 --> 00:27:01,610
out Bobby me.

610
00:27:03,350 --> 00:27:04,690
Nor shall we let

611
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,370
the Jehovah's Witnesses out

612
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:08,730
kook us. That's right. How many times

613
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:10,470
have they waited for the end of the world?

614
00:27:10,510 --> 00:27:12,010
Not more than six or seven.

615
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:14,670
We've waited for the end of the world. This will be my

616
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,610
eleventh time.

617
00:27:16,270 --> 00:27:18,230
Well, the ninth time.

618
00:27:19,070 --> 00:27:20,790
Yeah, maybe this will be

619
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:22,330
it, though. There have been omens

620
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,490
that this could be the

621
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,650
X-Day. The angel turds that

622
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:28,190
have been left all over the campground.

623
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:30,250
Verily, a great marvel.

624
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:32,750
A great marvel. The collision

625
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:34,890
of the two great storms on Jupiter

626
00:27:34,890 --> 00:27:36,650
that's due to start tomorrow.

627
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,870
We have no idea what kind of result

628
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,570
that could be. Yes, between the

629
00:27:40,570 --> 00:27:42,850
great spot and the not so great

630
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:45,010
spot. Yeah, Red

631
00:27:45,010 --> 00:27:46,570
Junior, they call the smaller

632
00:27:46,570 --> 00:27:47,110
red spot.

633
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:50,090
But it's still going 350 miles an hour.

634
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,450
Before the eyes of the astronomers of Earth.

635
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,650
Oh, that's right. And the other,

636
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:56,690
thank you very much, Reverend Scalpod.

637
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,290
During this X-Day,

638
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:00,090
friends, this is the most important one of all.

639
00:28:00,170 --> 00:28:02,590
See the X-designed

640
00:28:02,590 --> 00:28:04,270
electrostimulo wristbands?

641
00:28:05,090 --> 00:28:06,410
We ran

642
00:28:06,410 --> 00:28:08,410
out of them this

643
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:10,510
weekend. And since that time,

644
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,190
people have been wearing the

645
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,410
Dayglo orange electrostimulo

646
00:28:14,410 --> 00:28:16,690
wristbands. By this, we know

647
00:28:16,690 --> 00:28:18,390
the time is nigh

648
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,890
for their arisal.

649
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:22,630
And it's possible that some may be

650
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,770
divvied up into the

651
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,150
X-wristband

652
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,230
kind and the... Well,

653
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,650
you mean that the writing

654
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:31,950
and they shall have two bands.

655
00:28:32,090 --> 00:28:34,330
I thought that was the amino acids

656
00:28:34,330 --> 00:28:36,550
in the Billy Nair show. I didn't realize

657
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,250
that it referred to two wristbands.

658
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:40,070
But this shows how

659
00:28:40,930 --> 00:28:42,310
difficult it is

660
00:28:42,310 --> 00:28:44,330
to understand these prophecies until

661
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:46,310
one gets right on the cusp

662
00:28:46,310 --> 00:28:48,290
of them. Right. Sometimes you don't know what

663
00:28:48,290 --> 00:28:50,290
it meant until after the miracle

664
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:50,710
happened.

665
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:56,370
Well, that's a possibility. It could also

666
00:28:56,370 --> 00:28:58,270
mean that you're more like part of the

667
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:00,570
refreshments that will be served

668
00:29:00,570 --> 00:29:02,350
during the trip.

669
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:03,730
But we just don't know.

670
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,030
As you board those great ships,

671
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,290
some will be led, in fact,

672
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,490
to those first class seats. And no doubt

673
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,210
some will be led through the

674
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,310
slaughterhouse doors.

675
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,270
They may be pink. Their money is

676
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,310
green. I sold

677
00:29:18,310 --> 00:29:20,270
a membership last week to somebody

678
00:29:20,270 --> 00:29:21,990
that I would

679
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,450
judge to be the dumbest,

680
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:26,490
just the pinkest

681
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:27,770
fuckwad.

682
00:29:28,490 --> 00:29:30,170
And yet, he sent his 30 bucks.

683
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,730
So how pink could he be? I grappled.

684
00:29:32,830 --> 00:29:34,210
I really, really thought

685
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,850
I didn't cash that

686
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:38,450
I didn't punch in those credit card

687
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,690
numbers for a whole week.

688
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,670
Because I had to

689
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:44,450
But finally, in the end, I thought, what would Bob

690
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,390
do? Bob would take the fucking

691
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:48,130
money, tell the guy, yeah,

692
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,510
you're a subgenius. Now chant this.

693
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:52,630
Oh, wah, tagus, I am.

694
00:29:52,950 --> 00:29:54,510
And, you know, 500 times

695
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:55,550
a night, everything's cool.

696
00:29:56,570 --> 00:29:58,390
And, by the way, don't you need

697
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:00,430
this new, improved Arise

698
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:00,750
video?

699
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,190
Reverend Stang, may I take a minute for a very

700
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,650
brief commercial announcement?

701
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,270
Sure, sure.

702
00:30:06,370 --> 00:30:10,030
Everything set up here is a commercial

703
00:30:10,030 --> 00:30:11,350
announcement. Praise Bob.

704
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:12,330
Praise Bob.

705
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:15,950
But, of course, I do want to

706
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:17,730
just give one more mention to the

707
00:30:17,730 --> 00:30:20,030
lovely person who won the most stoic

708
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:21,850
award, and that would, again, be Reverend

709
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:23,550
Magdalene. And since

710
00:30:23,550 --> 00:30:26,110
we have all of you here, now is a good time

711
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:27,930
to make a plug for a very,

712
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,030
important fundraiser for

713
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,790
Reverend Magdalene's legal fund

714
00:30:31,790 --> 00:30:33,550
that is going on at this time.

715
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:36,030
The noble folks of IRC

716
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:37,670
Taphouse have

717
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,190
produced a series of

718
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:41,430
t-shirts that state

719
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,070
Why a Goat?

720
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:46,070
Also, they have one special

721
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:47,810
shirt that they are going to auction

722
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:50,130
off that has been autographed

723
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,190

724
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:53,830
100% of the proceeds of this shirt

725
00:30:53,830 --> 00:30:55,270
will go to her legal fund.

726
00:30:55,810 --> 00:30:56,970
Thank you very much.

727
00:30:59,690 --> 00:31:01,450
Obviously, it's autographed.

728
00:31:01,450 --> 00:31:03,330
I don't know how many of you are doing the online thing.

729
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:05,530
It says Why a Goat in the front. I'll read you the back

730
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:06,650
and then show it to you.

731
00:31:07,190 --> 00:31:08,970
We are dedicated to our art.

732
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:11,190
I'm sorry that you don't understand it, sir.

733
00:31:11,590 --> 00:31:13,150
Signed, Rachel Bevilacqua,

734
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:14,210
Reverend Magdalene.

735
00:31:14,870 --> 00:31:17,430
Stop talking. Obviously, there's nothing

736
00:31:17,430 --> 00:31:18,910
funny in those pictures.

737
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:21,350
Honorable James P.

738
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:23,630
Punch, Family Court Judge.

739
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,230
Woo!

740
00:31:25,510 --> 00:31:25,510


741
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:26,230


742
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,130
And so we auction this shirt

743
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:31,790
in memory of

744
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:34,370
a time when subgenius

745
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,590
could run freely through the country

746
00:31:36,590 --> 00:31:37,630
without being persecuted

747
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,950
for their heads.

748
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:42,230
Alright. So, it has to start

749
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:44,190
at $20. That's what they cost

750
00:31:44,190 --> 00:31:46,070
on the internet. If you get one for $15 that's

751
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,570
autographed, that's just stupid.

752
00:31:49,230 --> 00:31:50,210
It's a bargain.

753
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:50,890
...

754
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:52,850
...

755
00:31:52,850 --> 00:31:53,430
...

756
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:53,430


757
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:56,630
Sold!

758
00:31:58,490 --> 00:31:58,830
$220!

759
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,490
That's not loud enough, ladies and gentlemen.

760
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:14,430
I wish there was someone responsible

761
00:32:14,430 --> 00:32:15,410
to give this money to.

762
00:32:17,910 --> 00:32:18,810
That is all.

763
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:19,550
Anyone else?

764
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:20,730
...

765
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:20,910
...

766
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:22,450
...

767
00:32:23,810 --> 00:32:24,250
...

768
00:32:24,250 --> 00:32:24,810
...

769
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:24,850

770
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:24,890

771
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:24,910
...

772
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:24,910


773
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:24,910


774
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:24,910


775
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:24,930
...

776
00:32:24,930 --> 00:32:25,230
...

777
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:25,230


778
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:25,310
...

779
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:25,310


780
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:25,310


781
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:25,310


782
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:25,350
...

783
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,350


784
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,350


785
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:25,510
...

786
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


787
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


788
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


789
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


790
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


791
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


792
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


793
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


794
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


795
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


796
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


797
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


798
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


799
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


800
00:32:25,510 --> 00:32:25,510


801
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:28,990
...

802
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,230
...

803
00:32:38,990 --> 00:32:39,990
...

804
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,750
...

805
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,350
...

806
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:44,150
...

807
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:45,410
...

808
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:48,770
...

809
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:48,770


810
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:51,850
...

811
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:51,850


812
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:51,850


813
00:32:51,850 --> 00:32:52,070
...

814
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,070


815
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,070


816
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,070


817
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,070


818
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,070


819
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,070


820
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,070


821
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,070


822
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,070


823
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,070


824
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,070


825
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:52,090
...

826
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:52,110
...

827
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:52,130
...

828
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:52,150
...

829
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:52,170
...

830
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:52,170


831
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:52,190
...

832
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:52,210
...

833
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


834
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


835
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


836
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


837
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


838
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


839
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


840
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


841
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


842
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


843
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


844
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


845
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


846
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


847
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


848
00:32:52,210 --> 00:32:52,210


849
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:00,570
Nick Abbey of The Billy Nair Show.

850
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:04,570
All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

851
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:08,310
On this day, we became newly ordained ministers on this very day.

852
00:33:10,790 --> 00:33:17,350
And someone requested certain topics, certain subject matters on this day,

853
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:19,750
on this very day when we became newly ordained ministers.

854
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:26,830
So I think we'll start off by telling a story with a little conceptual dance I once learned.

855
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:31,810
I was there the day that Christ was born.

856
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,810
I heard Gabriel blow his happy horn.

857
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:36,990
Three men came to the manger.

858
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:38,430
They whispered, howdy, stranger.

859
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:41,630
And I could tell right then the child's life would be in danger.

860
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:43,950
I heard him talking on the hilltop high.

861
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:47,010
And I remember thinking, what a guy.

862
00:33:47,590 --> 00:33:50,590
He didn't look too tough, but he said some real cool stuff.

863
00:33:50,790 --> 00:33:53,590
And he quit talking after everyone had heard enough.

864
00:33:53,790 --> 00:33:56,150
And I was there the night he had his trial.

865
00:33:56,630 --> 00:33:59,070
I took a seat because it took a while.

866
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:01,330
It got pretty intense, though.

867
00:34:01,390 --> 00:34:02,830
He had no real defense, though.

868
00:34:02,910 --> 00:34:05,830
But everyone I know's been talking about it ever since, though.

869
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,710
And I was there when he was crucified.

870
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:11,110
I hung around and watched him as he died.

871
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,770
I packed a simple lunch, just something I could munch on.

872
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:17,550
I couldn't hear what he was saying, but I had a hunch.

873
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,970
And I was there the night he rose from the dead.

874
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:22,970
He had a light that went around his head.

875
00:34:23,490 --> 00:34:24,990
He drove around all night.

876
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:26,130
And he was quite a man.

877
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:26,130


878
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:26,490
He was quite a sight.

879
00:34:26,590 --> 00:34:29,370
And when I talk about this part, people get real uptight.

880
00:34:29,470 --> 00:34:31,850
But I was there the night he rolled his truck.

881
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,090
And I remember thinking, what the fuck, man?

882
00:34:35,410 --> 00:34:36,910
He was a real good driver.

883
00:34:37,030 --> 00:34:38,230
He was a real survivor.

884
00:34:38,590 --> 00:34:41,390
He had the driving skills Americans should really strive for.

885
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:43,570
His truck bursted into a flaming heat.

886
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,530
That's what you get when you buy trucks that cheap.

887
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:48,710
But all his deeds were simple.

888
00:34:48,850 --> 00:34:50,270
One time he got a pimple.

889
00:34:50,370 --> 00:34:52,110
He waved his hand and it was gone.

890
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,170
And it was just that simple.

891
00:34:53,290 --> 00:34:55,570
I watched him walk out of the burning pile.

892
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:58,630
He blew the crowd a kiss and flashed his smile.

893
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,610
You should have heard them clapping.

894
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:02,010
He act like nothing happened.

895
00:35:02,210 --> 00:35:04,930
And then he sang a song that said, everyone's toes are tapping.

896
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,990
And it went a little something like this.

897
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:21,210
I saw Santa and I saw Satan.

898
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:23,650
And I said, it looks like they're about to begin it.

899
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:25,230
No, you're wrong.

900
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:28,410
A voice said, the boys in red will be back in a minute.

901
00:35:33,090 --> 00:35:35,650
I saw Lazarus sitting on the sidewalk.

902
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:37,770
I sat down by his side.

903
00:35:37,830 --> 00:35:38,730
I said, he died.

904
00:35:39,050 --> 00:35:40,090
What's it like to be dead?

905
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:42,550
He just looked me in the eyes and shook his head.

906
00:35:47,310 --> 00:35:50,270
Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,

907
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:54,370
I will fear no evil, hear no evil, see no evil,

908
00:35:54,370 --> 00:35:56,790
speak no evil, I just keep walking.

909
00:36:01,490 --> 00:36:04,910
I saw Lazarus walking through the valley of the shadow of death.

910
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:05,950
He was out of breath.

911
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:08,390
I said, you've always been a hero to me.

912
00:36:08,450 --> 00:36:10,850
He said, if I'd known that, I'd have done things differently.

913
00:36:11,130 --> 00:36:13,190
I saw Santa and I saw Satan.

914
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:15,650
And I said, it looks like they're about to begin it.

915
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,250
No, you're wrong, said the boys in red.

916
00:36:18,530 --> 00:36:19,990
They said, you're soaking in it.

917
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,110
There is a world

918
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:27,890
that's so hard to find between reality and your mind.

919
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:33,810
There is a part of you that works like a spy

920
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:37,610
between your conscience and your eye.

921
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:43,550
And each time you swallow, it photographs your thoughts.

922
00:36:43,970 --> 00:36:48,010
These are the only moments God will ever see.

923
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:50,370
Believe it or not,

924
00:36:50,690 --> 00:36:52,090
ready to die.

925
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:56,230
Fear not, you've been recorded for posterity.

926
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,390
And if you don't believe in God,

927
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:01,690
it's because he never gave you a soul.

928
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:04,110
And if you don't believe in God,

929
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:06,890
then it really shouldn't bother you to know this fact.

930
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,690
And if you don't have a soul,

931
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:11,250
then you're never going to get one.

932
00:37:11,350 --> 00:37:13,950
If you don't have a soul, then it doesn't really matter,

933
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:15,690
so you might as well just have fun.

934
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,090
If you seek inner peace,

935
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,930
in a world of strife and struggle,

936
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,750
and if you can achieve some personal relief,

937
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:30,150
well, don't let God's face burst your bubble.

938
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,070
A battle that's well chosen

939
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:34,270
is a battle that's already won.

940
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:36,070
So pick your fights,

941
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:37,110
focus on yourself,

942
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,910
and above all, just have fun.

943
00:37:43,890 --> 00:37:46,250
Make this world a better place

944
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:48,170
by living a good life

945
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:51,070
with your wife and your kids and your cars and your house

946
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:52,850
and your houses and your cars and your wife.

947
00:37:53,250 --> 00:37:54,990
Set a good example,

948
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:57,310
not like the unfortunate ones

949
00:37:57,310 --> 00:38:00,270
who struggle and suffer and starve and die

950
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:02,030
because they don't know how to have fun.

951
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:16,530
And then also we had the Billy Nair show up here.

952
00:38:16,690 --> 00:38:17,590
How was that?

953
00:38:17,670 --> 00:38:20,450
That was ultra cool and groovadelic,

954
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:22,550
and it drove the females into a tizzy

955
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:25,650
as his lanky cowboy hat had formed,

956
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:26,970
danced on the stage.

957
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:30,090
Then his film, The Reluctant,

958
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,710
I mean, The American Astronaut was shown.

959
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,730
Yay! That's my favorite movie ever!

960
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:37,270
Yes. The Reluctant Astronaut, of course,

961
00:38:37,270 --> 00:38:38,910
is the Don Knotts classic.

962
00:38:39,090 --> 00:38:40,090
Not the same.

963
00:38:40,090 --> 00:38:40,830
What a classic.

964
00:38:40,830 --> 00:38:43,810
Not the same, and yet in a class by itself.

965
00:38:44,250 --> 00:38:47,110
And of course, we also had other films shown there,

966
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,090
including Island of Lost Souls,

967
00:38:49,090 --> 00:38:51,090
Five Thousand Fingers of Dr. T,

968
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,590
The Tingler,

969
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,470
House on Haunted Hill,

970
00:38:55,010 --> 00:38:56,430
Sky Cap Tink,

971
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,470
and The World of Tomorrow,

972
00:38:57,730 --> 00:39:00,270
and the King Kong remake,

973
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:03,910
with special focus on giant insect scenes

974
00:39:03,910 --> 00:39:05,510
and other felicity.

975
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,690
So speaking of Don Knotts...

976
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:10,630
Yes, you could tie yourself in knots laughing at...

977
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:14,170
He has a boulevard named after him

978
00:39:14,170 --> 00:39:15,530
in Morgantown, West Virginia,

979
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,890
where he hails from, as do I.

980
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:21,050
You have a boulevard named after you?

981
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:21,390
No.

982
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,330
I just hailed from Morgantown.

983
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,110
Oh, well.

984
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,590
Yeah, there's Don Knotts Boulevard.

985
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:28,510
Where music like this plays in the bank.

986
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,670
Well, sure makes the line go faster.

987
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:37,090
Yep. While you're waiting in line,

988
00:39:37,190 --> 00:39:39,230
you can read the supermarket tabloids

989
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:41,490
on Coogee and Joogee's new baby,

990
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:45,490
and the stretch marks that appeared on San's hand.

991
00:39:47,890 --> 00:39:51,470
I am gonna take out my favorites

992
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,050
Don't think that you have to take it

993
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,070
home

994
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:04,010
Hitch it, hitch it, hitch it,ім

995
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,450
Get it, get it,交

00:40:06,450 --> 00:40:08,950
Get it, get it,àcies 획

997
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:22,070
Don't think that you have to take it

998
00:40:23,210 --> 00:40:23,930
Home

999
00:41:01,350 --> 00:41:08,630
I fell in love in the usual way

1000
00:41:08,630 --> 00:41:11,430
I said things that lovers say

1001
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:14,210
Lovers say, lovers say

1002
00:41:14,210 --> 00:41:16,910
I went to work on the wrong highway

1003
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:17,870
I fell in love in the usual way

1004
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:47,870
I fell in love in the usual way

1005
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:50,290
I set my back on the ground

1006
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:53,090
I sat down and she sat down

1007
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:55,810
What's that sound, what's that sound

1008
00:41:55,810 --> 00:41:58,310
What's that sound that's calling me

1009
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:01,110
In a most familiar way

1010
00:42:01,110 --> 00:42:03,770
Could it be the wrong highway

1011
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,170
Twinkle, twinkle, little heart

1012
00:42:17,890 --> 00:42:20,030
Where you are is what you aren't

1013
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:22,590
What you are is what you are

1014
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,470
Where you are is what you aren't

1015
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:27,910
There's a lover holding me

1016
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:30,610
Holding me to make me stay

1017
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,190
Holding me to the wrong highway

1018
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,410
There's a star up in the sky

1019
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:47,870
There's a star up in the sky

1020
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:48,130
There's a star up in the sky

1021
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:48,130


1022
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:48,130


1023
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:49,210
Scenery there when I die

1024
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:51,830
It will always shine for you

1025
00:42:51,830 --> 00:42:54,570
Loving you the way I do

1026
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,210
Till the sun comes shining through

1027
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:59,890
And it's time to go away

1028
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:02,830
And there's nothing you can do

1029
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:05,450
And there's nothing you can say

1030
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:08,170
You're the star of where you are

1031
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,650
Shining on the wrong highway

1032
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:17,470
There's a star up in the sky

1033
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:17,790
And there's nothing you can do

1034
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:17,790


1035
00:43:26,990 --> 00:43:28,730
Thank you.

1036
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:02,470
Thank you.

1037
00:44:25,970 --> 00:44:28,770
Thank you.

1038
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:53,890
In terrible color, but we had nothing to do with the contraption that's projecting it.

1039
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:58,290
What we have to do with is the result which has been achieved.

1040
00:44:58,850 --> 00:45:03,650
Yes, one can be proud and stand tall as a subgenius.

1041
00:45:03,930 --> 00:45:06,150
Tall as a brachiosaurus, indeed.

1042
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:12,890
Tall as the extended neck of the Atlantosaurus or the giants of the Mesozoic Age.

1043
00:45:13,030 --> 00:45:17,030
What is the largest dinosaur now known?

1044
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:23,650
Well, it's difficult to say because the Seismosaurus was the longest dinosaur.

1045
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:29,670
Though Seismosaurus shook the earth with gentle steps from day to day,

1046
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:34,850
she sought the uplands of her birth, devouring forests on the way.

1047
00:45:35,550 --> 00:45:39,470
But larger than the Seismosaurus was the Argentinosaurus.

1048
00:45:39,870 --> 00:45:46,850
The old-style Brontosaurus could walk under the legs of the Argentinosaurus

1049
00:45:46,850 --> 00:45:50,630
and not touch its pendulous, rumbling abdomen.

1050
00:45:52,710 --> 00:45:56,190
Vomit Argentinosaurus was not welcome at parties.

1051
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:04,810
No, but there was an entire category of busy insects which welcomed the vomiting behemoth.

1052
00:46:05,570 --> 00:46:08,190
Think of how much that could feed, friends.

1053
00:46:08,210 --> 00:46:14,330
Think if you were there with the dinosaurs as they vomited fast gouts,

1054
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:16,830
enough to feed a small man.

1055
00:46:16,850 --> 00:46:18,710
I've been a mammal for weeks.

1056
00:46:19,070 --> 00:46:20,690
Those small mammals were there.

1057
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:24,850
But they didn't have weeks to dine on nature's bounty.

1058
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:30,670
They had to snatch and grab what they could to do a dine and dash and eat alfresco

1059
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:33,830
in the jungles of the prehistoric world.

1060
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:36,430
And you know what, folks?

1061
00:46:36,650 --> 00:46:39,350
Our own kind was represented even then.

1062
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:40,910
The primate order.

1063
00:46:41,350 --> 00:46:42,490
Oh, it was there.

1064
00:46:42,690 --> 00:46:45,330
It didn't look like King Kong that much,

1065
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,830
but you can't blame the animals.

1066
00:46:46,830 --> 00:46:49,230
You can't blame the humies for a little bit of glamour in their productions.

1067
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:53,210
No, if you look back into the labyrinth of ancestral memory,

1068
00:46:53,450 --> 00:46:57,190
you'll see a little fuzzy fellow squatting there

1069
00:46:57,830 --> 00:47:01,130
as Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus do bloody battle

1070
00:47:01,130 --> 00:47:04,610
under the quivering fronds of Arboraceous palms.

1071
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:06,110
Man, you're turning me on now.

1072
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:10,990
The Brontosaurus, a living mountain of flesh and bone.

1073
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,530
All right, all right.

1074
00:47:13,570 --> 00:47:16,210
Well, we'll get into that later.

1075
00:47:16,250 --> 00:47:16,810
What did they tell you?

1076
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:18,950
They were too heavy to support their own weight

1077
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:21,610
unless they floated around in swamps of blood.

1078
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,330
Well, if they let themselves go.

1079
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:27,990
I mean, aerobic exercise was important for all beings

1080
00:47:27,990 --> 00:47:30,870
and particularly for large sauropods

1081
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:34,610
because if they fell down, they could injure themselves severely.

1082
00:47:34,790 --> 00:47:37,790
So every step really had to be skillfully done.

1083
00:47:38,010 --> 00:47:41,570
It makes me sick how these Johnny-come-lately humans

1084
00:47:41,570 --> 00:47:44,270
who have only been around a few million years

1085
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:46,690
go on and on about a legend.

1086
00:47:46,690 --> 00:47:48,050
It's not just about the rigid dinosaur clumsiness.

1087
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,430
It's humans who are always falling over.

1088
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:51,070
And why not?

1089
00:47:51,190 --> 00:47:52,250
They can get back up again.

1090
00:47:52,450 --> 00:47:54,330
Unlike the ponderous dinosaurs

1091
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:58,410
who would have to be aerobically successful and clever

1092
00:47:58,410 --> 00:48:02,470
beyond the agility of stumpy, bumpy humans.

1093
00:48:02,790 --> 00:48:05,790
And even the primitive humans were in many ways

1094
00:48:05,790 --> 00:48:08,750
the superior of the modern man

1095
00:48:08,750 --> 00:48:13,890
because they had to be to exist in their strange, wild world.

1096
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:18,070
We think of a caveman as some belching slob.

1097
00:48:18,090 --> 00:48:19,550
Nay, not so.

1098
00:48:19,790 --> 00:48:22,110
The modern TV-watching pink

1099
00:48:22,110 --> 00:48:26,270
is the belching, stubbled, scratching, farting slob.

1100
00:48:26,330 --> 00:48:29,030
Our intelligence has devolved.

1101
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:29,910
The caveman

1102
00:48:29,910 --> 00:48:31,190
It can't help but devolve.

1103
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:32,190
or cavewoman

1104
00:48:32,190 --> 00:48:33,290
Until next day!

1105
00:48:33,430 --> 00:48:35,290
like all so-called savages,

1106
00:48:35,570 --> 00:48:38,690
intensely ritualized every portion of life.

1107
00:48:39,250 --> 00:48:40,850
You were talking about the fact that

1108
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:43,050
It's something about dumb versus stupid.

1109
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,270
I got that.

1110
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,150
Dumb versus stupid.

1111
00:48:46,310 --> 00:48:49,310
And dumb wins when it comes down to it.

1112
00:48:49,570 --> 00:48:53,250
But there's two kinds of monkeys.

1113
00:48:53,710 --> 00:48:56,510
Dumb monkeys and stupid monkeys.

1114
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:59,090
And praise Bob, I'm a dumb monkey.

1115
00:48:59,230 --> 00:49:00,390
But I ain't a stupid monkey.

1116
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,670
Now, of those monkeys there are other variations

1117
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:07,370
of which one might perhaps account

1118
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:11,610
the situation of the mean monkey

1119
00:49:11,610 --> 00:49:11,850
and the stupid monkey.

1120
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:15,670
More often than not, the mean monkey is a stupid monkey.

1121
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:19,410
But there are occasions where the mean monkey is a dumb monkey.

1122
00:49:19,610 --> 00:49:21,410
In which case we have problems.

1123
00:49:22,710 --> 00:49:23,830
Severe problems.

1124
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:25,570
Because the dumb monkey,

1125
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:28,570
although dumb, is not stupid.

1126
00:49:28,750 --> 00:49:33,050
And when mean, can commit acts of egregious

1127
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:36,250
and unreasonable verisimilitude.

1128
00:49:38,770 --> 00:49:40,050
And the monkeys,

1129
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:45,010
well, I have heard speak of monkeys

1130
00:49:45,010 --> 00:49:47,110
with a nature that is neither dumb nor stupid.

1131
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:50,190
One might call them perhaps smart monkeys.

1132
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:54,990
But I myself have not had the glory or honor

1133
00:49:54,990 --> 00:49:57,610
of interaction with such monkeys.

1134
00:49:57,910 --> 00:50:00,970
Such monkeys are, to my own experience,

1135
00:50:01,330 --> 00:50:02,630
strictly hypothetical.

1136
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:08,490
And not in any way legitimately real or referenceable.

1137
00:50:08,490 --> 00:50:12,490
But the hypothetical possibility exists

1138
00:50:13,490 --> 00:50:14,970
for the smart monkey.

1139
00:50:15,190 --> 00:50:16,890
And towards this end,

1140
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:20,070
I think it is not inappropriate

1141
00:50:20,070 --> 00:50:23,610
for us to aspire in such a direction

1142
00:50:23,610 --> 00:50:28,750
as to perhaps consider ourselves as potentially smart monkeys.

1143
00:50:28,870 --> 00:50:32,130
Although I would say, in that regard,

1144
00:50:32,330 --> 00:50:34,150
it is perhaps overly ambitious

1145
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:37,230
for us to consider ourselves presently smart monkeys,

1146
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:38,910
but only hypothetically...

1147
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:41,450
Yahtzee!

1148
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:44,290
...future smart monkeys,

1149
00:50:44,470 --> 00:50:46,350
in a Yahtzee sort of a sense.

1150
00:50:47,330 --> 00:50:47,890
Right.

1151
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:54,990
Well, some might agree,

1152
00:50:55,230 --> 00:50:56,490
and some might not.

1153
00:50:56,890 --> 00:50:59,170
And I would say to those that do not,

1154
00:50:59,350 --> 00:51:00,350
that they are incorrect.

1155
00:51:01,210 --> 00:51:02,390
And those that agree,

1156
00:51:03,190 --> 00:51:04,930
they probably just misunderstood.

1157
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:12,270
Frankly, with the issue of the dumb versus the stupid,

1158
00:51:12,450 --> 00:51:16,730
there are also other varieties of monkeys.

1159
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:19,590
Drunken monkeys.

1160
00:51:19,850 --> 00:51:24,110
And the drunken factor can augment

1161
00:51:24,110 --> 00:51:27,710
and magentify the...

1162
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:29,530
Magentify.

1163
00:51:29,630 --> 00:51:30,430
It's a color!

1164
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:34,290
It's, yes, it makes them...

1165
00:51:34,290 --> 00:51:36,150
It has a really nice flavor, magenta.

1166
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:38,430
I don't know if you've had any lately.

1167
00:51:38,730 --> 00:51:41,510
They can magentify and augment

1168
00:51:41,510 --> 00:51:44,070
in particular directions and spectrums

1169
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:49,270
so as to manifest various other quantities and qualities.

1170
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:55,510
The dumb monkeys may or may not be mean monkeys,

1171
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:59,870
and the stupid monkeys are often inadvertently mean monkeys.

1172
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:00,730
But you know what?

1173
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:04,090
If you keep poking the retarded dog with a stick,

1174
00:52:04,150 --> 00:52:06,370
don't be surprised if he bites your ass.

1175
00:52:07,230 --> 00:52:09,910
Dogs and monkeys are much similar in that manner.

1176
00:52:11,110 --> 00:52:13,530
Poke a monkey with a stick, he'll bite your ass too.

1177
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,170
Whether or not he's retarded.

1178
00:52:48,330 --> 00:52:48,810
But

1179
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:52,370
please repent if you use your smart hands at this time.

1180
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:52,370


1181
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:52,370


1182
00:52:53,130 --> 00:52:55,370
Some of you missed the first half of the set

1183
00:52:55,370 --> 00:52:56,750
so we'll start it all over again.

1184
00:52:59,590 --> 00:53:01,470
We're the Billionaire Show, ladies and gentlemen.

1185
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:04,250
This will be our last song for the night.

1186
00:53:04,310 --> 00:53:05,830
Thank you so much for having us up here.

1187
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:09,110
This is a blast, and it's so nice to see all of you.

1188
00:53:09,910 --> 00:53:12,790
We have our movie playing tomorrow night,

1189
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:13,570
The American National.

1190
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:15,610
We wrote it, directed it, acted in it,

1191
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,890
did the music for it, and so on and so on.

1192
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:18,830
It'll be playing tomorrow night.

1193
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:22,070
Oh, I envy you the experience of watching it,

1194
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,670
even though I have seen it myself.

1195
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:27,370
You must find...

1196
00:53:29,130 --> 00:53:29,590
What's that?

1197
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:31,590
Our contract?

1198
00:53:32,290 --> 00:53:33,390
We signed the contract,

1199
00:53:34,850 --> 00:53:37,210
and we are ordained ministers on this evening.

1200
00:53:37,310 --> 00:53:38,290
Thank you very much.

1201
00:53:41,670 --> 00:53:43,310
So again, we're the Billionaire Show.

1202
00:53:44,030 --> 00:53:45,330
If you don't come up and say hi,

1203
00:53:45,490 --> 00:53:46,790
do please stay in touch.

1204
00:53:46,930 --> 00:53:48,790
We've got a new film we're working on right now

1205
00:53:48,790 --> 00:53:50,210
called Werewolf Hunters of the Midwest,

1206
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:53,290
and hopefully that'll be out at some point soon

1207
00:53:53,290 --> 00:53:54,690
or by next year,

1208
00:53:54,690 --> 00:53:56,150
and we'll let you know when that is.

1209
00:53:56,350 --> 00:53:58,090
Again, thank you very much.

1210
00:53:58,370 --> 00:54:00,890
I'll finish all my lunch

1211
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:04,590
And I'll eat all my fries

1212
00:54:04,590 --> 00:54:06,370
And I'll prove to you

1213
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:10,210
That my stomach's as big as my eyes

1214
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:12,650
I'll spring for the check

1215
00:54:12,650 --> 00:54:15,610
And walk you to my home

1216
00:54:15,610 --> 00:54:19,110
That's where I spend all my days

1217
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:20,750
All alone

1218
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:23,790
I'll show you my chair

1219
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:24,670
And I'll show you my chair

1220
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:26,470
And show you my bed

1221
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,810
And I'll show you movies

1222
00:54:28,810 --> 00:54:30,070
That I've taped

1223
00:54:30,070 --> 00:54:32,290
And all the books I've read

1224
00:54:32,290 --> 00:54:35,550
I'll show you pictures of me

1225
00:54:35,550 --> 00:54:37,690
When I had lots of hair

1226
00:54:37,690 --> 00:54:40,570
And I'll tell you all the things

1227
00:54:40,570 --> 00:54:43,290
I think of when I sit and stare

1228
00:54:43,290 --> 00:54:46,330
I'll tell you some of my plans

1229
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,930
And some of my schemes

1230
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:51,750
And I'll tell you all about

1231
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:54,590
Some of my dreamy little dreams

1232
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:54,650
And I'll tell you all about some of my dreams

1233
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:54,650


1234
00:54:54,650 --> 00:54:57,430
I'll tell you that my apartment

1235
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,910
Is the center of the universe

1236
00:55:00,410 --> 00:55:02,150
It gets hot there

1237
00:55:02,150 --> 00:55:03,630
It's hot there now

1238
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:05,970
But it's been known to get a lot worse

1239
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:08,730
I'll show you paintings that I painted

1240
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:11,430
And tell you all about my lamp

1241
00:55:11,430 --> 00:55:13,550
I'll show you water damage

1242
00:55:14,090 --> 00:55:16,990
In the corner where it gets damp

1243
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:20,170
I'll put my chair in front of your chair

1244
00:55:20,170 --> 00:55:22,530
And my feet against your feet

1245
00:55:22,530 --> 00:55:24,630
Then later on I'll show you my lamp

1246
00:55:24,650 --> 00:55:26,130
And maybe we'll want to

1247
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:27,890
Go and get a bite to eat

1248
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:30,270
I'll finish all my dinner

1249
00:55:30,270 --> 00:55:33,690
And I'll eat all my fries

1250
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:35,470
And I'll prove to you

1251
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:39,490
That my stomach's as big as my eyes

1252
00:55:39,490 --> 00:55:42,190
And after I have shown you

1253
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:44,650
All there is to see

1254
00:55:44,650 --> 00:55:46,730
I will ask you

1255
00:55:46,730 --> 00:55:51,170
Will you marry me?

1256
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:00,930
Will you marry me?

1257
00:56:29,370 --> 00:56:33,010
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no

1258
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:33,010


1259
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,910
I'll just better cool off

1260
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:36,730
I'll just better cool off

1261
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:41,370
I'll just better cool off

1262
00:56:41,370 --> 00:56:41,990
I'll just better cool off

1263
00:56:41,990 --> 00:56:44,230
I'll just better cool off

1264
00:56:44,230 --> 00:56:48,070
I'll just better cool off

1265
00:56:48,070 --> 00:56:49,250
I'll just better cool off

1266
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:52,710
I'll just better cool off

1267
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:54,270
I'll just better cool off

1268
00:57:03,870 --> 00:57:05,650
Thank you very much!

1269
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:09,370
And in addition to the Billy Mayer show,

1270
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,990
we also had the amino acids,

1271
00:57:11,150 --> 00:57:12,410
and the amino acids,

1272
00:57:13,030 --> 00:57:13,990
and some other bands.

1273
00:57:15,070 --> 00:57:15,770
Professional bands.

1274
00:57:16,130 --> 00:57:17,450
Some other...

1275
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:19,830
Making all the subgenius bands look all the more stupid.

1276
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:24,630
Was there much jamming by the subgenius bands?

1277
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:25,430
There was a little.

1278
00:57:25,470 --> 00:57:27,190
Even it wasn't too terrible.

1279
00:57:37,810 --> 00:57:40,470
You know, I think we had it a little wrong.

1280
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:48,110
It seems...

1281
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:52,830
There will be bar and damnation.

1282
00:57:54,910 --> 00:57:56,870
But it's not like there's some.

1283
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:05,030
The end is nigh.

1284
00:58:07,950 --> 00:58:09,450
Time to die.

1285
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,890
The end is nigh.

1286
00:58:16,990 --> 00:58:18,330
Time to die.

1287
00:58:26,950 --> 00:58:29,830
The end is nigh.

1288
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:30,350
The end is nigh.

1289
00:58:35,690 --> 00:58:36,490
The end is nigh.

1290
00:58:38,530 --> 00:58:40,710
Friends, you have been listening to

1291
00:58:40,710 --> 00:58:42,730
the subgenius hour of Slack.

1292
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:44,870
The background music here is,

1293
00:58:44,890 --> 00:58:46,290
and before, is by

1294
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:48,670
Reverend Angry Larry with Lonesome Cowboy Dave,

1295
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:49,810
Reverend Carter LeBlanc,

1296
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:52,990
Reverend Two Beans, Reverend Phil, and Princess Wee,

1297
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:58,110
altogether known as Five-Fisted Tales for Connie that one night.

1298
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:00,970

1300
00:59:07,290 --> 00:59:08,390
if that gives you slack.

1301
00:59:08,890 --> 00:59:12,950
Subgenius, by the way, does not have an O in it.

1302
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:16,150
However, Bob does, and praise Bob.
