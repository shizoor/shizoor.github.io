You've got something in this room.
Something strange and magnetic.
Something behind the amplifier.
The South China Sea.
The South China Sea.
Wow.
He's probably groggy from lack of sleep.
All right, you fuckers.
You're forgetting this is the end of the world.
It's time to start acting like it.
It's happening right now.
If you're masturbating,
wrap it up, make it a good one.
It's the last masturbation you'll ever have.
I actively don't plan anything for After X Day.
Been doing it since 96.
And it's like, yeah, if there's any chance,
I'm not going to screw it up by not buying into this.
Okay, folks, it's almost quarter past
four of seven in the morning, July 5th, 1998.
Friends, it's not about when we get everything we want.
What it's really about, like every other religion,
it's about when the non-believers get what they deserve.
No, seriously now, and I do mean seriously,
you're going to get whatever you want,
but you're not going to get what you want.

The important thing is to really know what you want.
If your imagination is so limited that all you can think of
is a better version of your crappy apartment,
that's exactly what you'll get.
And it won't seem that different after 7 a.m.
Bob is teaching me things about disappointment,
except the disappointment in Bob is sweeter
than the disappointment in life.
Ten seconds.
Life's disappointments are brutal.
Bob's are part of a joke that once you finally get over the butt hurt,
you start laughing at it.
Two, one.
Fuck them, they can't take my child.
Motherfucker.
For 30 years, almost none of us ever broke character.
It threatens sometimes that the character might take over.
Once he gets over it, he's going to be a fucking jerk.
And that's when we find ourselves in that age-old traditional situation.
7 a.m. or something like that, something like July 5th,
something like 1998, something like the planet Earth,
we don't have any idea where or when we are,
and that is the point of the whole thing.
X day could happen any second.
It may not happen this year.
There have been times when we were so good at keeping a straight face,
that we could have had another Scientology.
We love fooling people, but we don't want to fool anybody that way.
The young people of our generation have no moral norm for their actions today.
They want somebody to stand up and say what is right and what is wrong.
How far can I go?
Nearly moment by moment, young people are bombarded by distorted visual images
that are saturating their minds and, yes, sabotaging their futures.
In the early 80s, we were outliers.
We were outside the norm.
People who had grown up in the 50s were just trying to come out of all of the weird stuff that had been heaped on us.
Once a person is perverted, it is practically impossible for that person
to adjust to normal attitudes.
The 60s were still echoing, but it turned into the 80s,
and that whole spirit got flipped on its head.
You are being deceived.
You are being brainwashed every day by the devil.
Everything's getting too square again.
The normalcy was oppressive to me.
I grew up in a cultural vacuum, a small, conservative Illinois town.
I kind of prided myself on being the outsider,
the guy that was so weird, no one would talk to him.
There is a conspiracy of unimaginable proportions
working solely to rob you of your very abnormality.
And I'm here to tell you tonight...
The conspiracy is them.
They're the ones that want to hold us down.
They're the ones in control.
People always tell us how to talk, how to walk.
It was the war of the weirdos against the straights.
To enjoy the feeling.
The feeling of being with the in crowd is so seductive.
Marion was rejected today.
If she felt accepted, the whole pattern of her life would be different.
We were grasping for this crazy religion to help us see the light.
It's the church of the subgenius.
Their prophet's name is Bob.
Bob Dobbs came to town to sit free.
It was just this outpouring of expressing ourselves
and how wrong we thought the direction of society was.
I thought it was hilarious.
We're probably the only cult
that admits that we're ripping them off every day
and teaching them to enjoy it.
There must be discipline.
It's wrong.
It's sin.
Just so you know.
If Jim Jones could talk 900 people into killing themselves,
we could talk 900 people into sending us a dollar.
There's only one guaranteed way you can have peace.
The world will end in 1998.
God said judgment is going to come.
Repent. Quit your job.
Swag.
The idea of being able to...
get away from this shit zoo of a world...
it's a dream.
For those who've abandoned hope,
we'll restore hope and we'll welcome them into a great national crusade
to make America great again.
Great again.
Great again.
Ah, yes, dear friends.
You guessed it.
That's a clip from the beginning of the subgenius documentary by Sandy Boone,

Meanwhile, here are a couple of new tracks from Reverend Negative
from his album Losing My Religion.
Reverend Negative and Friends.

By the way, our background music is the Empire Drive.

Next up, a topical tune from a band that for broadcast radio purposes
I must call Crib Pooper, but the real name is Crib Shitter.
A song called COVID Cove.
Somewhere nestled between what is now Madison and Wanakee
there existed a gathering site for the ancients.
A harmonious confluence of the natural and mystical realms
is the Crib Pooper.
Its murky green waters are said to possess unimaginable healing powers.
Free from laws and sometimes clothing,
folks from all walks of life make the pilgrimage
to stew in the cleansing nectar of COVID Cove.

Used my Vuvuzela for a gas funnel
I'm fully Bluetooth connected, not infected

COVID Cove

Bikini top, she got her booty popped
Got my Tommy Bahamas and my aqua socks
Pulling up with a Yeti full of white claws
Hand in her mouth like I'm Santa Claus


Slap that body up against mine
My body's warm but my temp is fine
Some snowflakes telling me to wear a mask
I'll take a Zen 9 to 5 and wipe my ass
Life jacket types, Clorox wipes
Beelzebub, jumper, watch the numbers spike
Boat work is hard so I'm hardly working
A real man needs a woman with a freshwater merkin

Getting greased up, creased up, greased up
Twelve pack of beer

Pontoons, zooms, rhythm and booms
Cyanobacterial, failed to bloom

Easy sweetheart grist, leading me

reaction? Well, that didn't sound normal to me. At least it didn't sound like a church.
I mean, aren't churches supposed to be quiet and not really boring? I mean, I could hardly
understand what went on there. I mean, was it meant to be funny or what? I mean, come
on, tell me, is it serious? Like, you know, do you have to, are they telling you to stop
listening to Top 40, give up things like watching Dynasty or eating Haagen-Dazs or maybe shopping
at home from an Esprit catalog? What? Huh? What are you trying to say? What is this note?
Listen, stupid, stop babbling or I'll ship you to Dallas with a sign saying, U.S. Grade

you even ask me? What?
Just, just sit over there, okay? You try and experiment down here and it just doesn't
work. You try to bring an opposing viewpoint, a rebuttal, and you never can tell. This is
Sister Chris here.
Um, so, tell us about, um,

No.


I'm sorry.

No.




It was a dark, polarizing feeling.

Album called Better Living Through Confirmation Bias.
Zeer is spelled Z-I-R.
And now, back in time, a mere 35 years,
for Hour of Slack number 76,
with Dr. Philo Drummond, Doctors for Bob,
Pastor David Epley,
Pope Sternodocs, and Dr. Hal.
Only we know what we don't know.
And when we do know it, we shall find out later
just exactly what we don't know.
What it was that we didn't know.
But, in the meantime,
we shall experiment further
and delve into the deeper recesses of the human mind
to find out exactly what causes this device
not to function properly.
Could it be a malfunction of the foot gland?
Or the nose gland?
Yes, possibly you did not know
that the nose and the feet are true glands.
The human body.
And only after permanent foot and nose glands gaping,
can you know how to make your feet smell and your nose rhyme.
Which would mean, possibly, that you were backwards.
Or, built upside down.
But, you'll delve further into that
at the end of the broadcast,
when you and I cannot hear you.
Oh, that was Dr. Philodrummen, good friends.
And we can get into this too,
this psychoneurotic mastosurgery,
the techniques of which has been developed
by the many great doctors
who have come over to Dobbs
and from many of the other religious cults around the world.
It may have been the same as I had my frontal lobotomies.
And we've got Europeans and Lithuanians
and ice doctors and the big doctors.
and the doctors of the trees
and the tree-walking brain socket doctors.
We wrote a song about doctors.
And here, hypercletes, here it is.
Let's play.
Doctors for Bob.
Doctors for Bob and everything real in my life.
Doctors and Bob and everything real in my life.
Oh, real in my life.
Damn pickup truck come out of the blue, doesn't run over my wife.
He's got the blues because they run over his wife.
Some of you are going to get mad at me.
Jesus ain't in the church.
Don't turn the radio off.
Keep it on.
And I wouldn't infer that our secondary state is Antichrist.
But I'm telling you that preparations are being made
and that the very door of the day of the wrath of God is at hand.
And that if you plan to get saved, you'd better do it now.
There will be a day not in the too far distant future
in which Antichrist will be revealed.
And the mark of the beast will be introduced.
And people will have a number in their hands and in their foreheads.
They'll be given a computerized number, if you please,
that will entitle them to do business in this world.
And with that, you can starve.
We have a lot to do in a very short time.
Boy, you aren't kidding.
And that's why we're here.
That's the way I've felt for quite a while.
Get ready to ease out of orbit.
Ah, you bet, honey.
That's what we're going to try to do.
I have never flown a city before.
Many of you in this stadium have been deceived.
I think they'll pass the $10 bridge.
The original concept was that throughout history,
all great geniuses,
had somebody at their side that was kind of steering them.
You know what I mean?
So you say that person is a subgenius.
That was the subgenius.
He was the guy that was really...
He was making sure the genius was used to his proper potential.
Right.
And not a subgenius above the genius.
That's why the name is misleading, you know.
Now, I want you to hear a little of the service
where the Holy Spirit was using me with the gift of discernment.
I was ministering in the Spirit.
God was showing me things about people I didn't know,
I'd never seen before, but the Lord was talking to me.
God was talking and I was walking.
Listen to a little of this right now.
And you have come to the end of your rope.
Oh!
I don't know which way to turn.
Give me money!
It's starting to affect your nerves.
It's affecting my mind.
And sleepless nights.
It's affecting my mind. I want to kill my husband.
Today we're going to put this in the hand of God.
Kill my husband and my kids.
In the Bible in two different places.
A handful of meal brought a miracle.
I want you to hold that envelope open.
I'm going to give you a handful.

Now.

In some ways, the brain is less important to a subgenius than to a pink.
Being less intuitive, pinks need more brains than we do.
Their value system is based on intelligence rather than good sense,
which is related not so much to thinking as to the feelings of the heart and the foot.
As mentioned before, however foolish it may sound,
a subgenius foot doubles as a gland, and a very complex gland at that.
Don't you want to be treated the way you need to be treated?
It treats you the way you need to be treated by intuiting the world around you
so subtly that you rarely notice its machinations.
It was discovered by Dr. Philo Drummond,
and he best explained its functioning in this excerpt from his daily radio show,
On the Road, so named because it is usually recorded in a car.
Self-worth.
Or money.
To love people because they need it.
Or their money.
I believe it's something God puts in us.
Or what else does God put in us?
I wish he'd give us some money, huh?
Yeah.
I want the money.
Oh, if we could truly know nothing only.
Reinforcing the powers of the brain and foot gland
is a small secondary brain at the base of the subgenius.
The subgenius spine, the mighty stegosaurus,
also possessed this organ, which made it tweet like a bird.
It helped it direct the reproductive and eliminative systems
that are so important to us.
Another gland unknown to normals is the peen gland in the brain,
which regulates the eight separate stages or character generations
through which the subgenius personality evolves during an average day.
Literally eight different personalities each have control
at the jessie helm of the brain.






In addition to the subgenius brain,
we also have the ability to control the behavior at varying intervals.
We each contain eight people in our corrugated,
rugated subconsciousness.
The actual average human has but four,
good, bad, bland and asleep,
the last thought by some scholars to overpower the others
for up to 18 hours a day.
These different personalities account for the compartmentalization
of the subgenius brain into eight distinct units or efficiencies
in the descending order of control.
First the left brain, the peen brain, which controls paranoia,
anal compulsion, overwork, trying too hard, thinking too much.
Then the north brain, the make brain or take brain,
it handles jobs and money.
The south brain, the fake brain or talk brain,
which covers the gray and limbic areas of speech, writing and lying.
Then the hind brain, the me brain, the pivotal center brain,
the private you rides piggyback on the lord and is infected by drugs or religion.
Bob comes in on this channel.
Then the forebrain, the sane brain, which covers love, friendship,
traditional family values, called by some the tame brain.
The inner brain, or sex brain, is self-explanatory.
Finally the right brain, or lame brain, or more brain,
depending on your orientation, intuitive, art, music, drug addiction.
And the eighth brain, the outer brain, is a pseudo-physical shell.
Encasing not only the other brains, but the entire body.
This diffuse brain, larger but far less controllable than the others,
is the nenta life.
The nenta life represents fully half of our brain power.
But because it is so independent from us, we can rarely make use of it.
Occasionally a subgenius comes along whose nenta life is incorporated into his thinking
processes.
Such less subgeniuses were Da Vinci, Einstein, and currently Howard.
For most of us, however, the nenta life is a separate entity.
A semi-conscious ghost twin which mindlessly follows the physical vessel about,
but remains dormant throughout most of our lives.
Are we controlled by secret forces?
Are alien space monsters?

Are we the most powerful of all the other monsters bringing a startling new world?
Do people think you're strange?
Do you?
Then you may be on the right track.
Unpredictables are not alone and possess amazing hidden powers of their own.
Are you abnormal?
Then you are probably better than most people.
Yes, your kind shall triumph.
Praise the Lord.
Your power is ears, and mighty power
Praise Bob.
The Church of the Subgenius is the pan-religion of the future
and rebels against the namby-pamby,
goody-two-shoes, new age, and Aquarian ideals of most occult weirdos.
P-p-p-praise Bob!
P-p-p-praise Bob!
P-p-p-praise Bob!
P-p-praise Bob!

P-p-praise Bob!
P-p-praise Bob!
Such people are fools.
They do not curse.
They have no understanding of the need for spiritual violence
in this modern space-age-a-go-go society.
The Subgenius wants no part of the new age.
It is already here, and it obviously sucks.
The Subgenius would rather retrieve
the manly past before 1971, or even 1953,
or else dwell in the naughty, fun-loving, remote future.

And now back to the subgenius documentary.
The clips in which Dr. Philo Drummond and I take turns explaining ourselves.
Don't you wish you could see the crazy subgenius home environments in which these interviews were filmed?
I grew up as a little white boy in America in the 1950s in a middle class home.
So I have...
nothing to complain about.
I feel like anybody who grew up in that situation has it better than most medieval kings.
Because we had aspirin and some people had air conditioning.
I'm one of those guys that was fortunate to have like an idyllic childhood.
My family was as normal as they could get.
I was forced to go to a fairly fundamental church for a year.



I was, uh, you know...
I got into Ahmadiyya Teachers制服 for the first 18 years of my life.
So that probably had some effect on why I rebelled so strongly
once I got in away from my folks.
I can't say that I'm rebelling against my religious upbringing or anything like that
because I didn't really have one.
I was raised basically secular humanist scientist.
This is Fort Worth Texas, I was surrounded by Baptists.
I was raised basically secular humanist scientist. This is Fort Worth Texas, I was surrounded by Baptists.
I was very much into comic books and any kind of alternate publications and music like Frank
Zappa and Captain Beefheart and people that were not mainstream. I did not feel like my classmates.
Despite my very fun childhood, I had terrible teenage years. I had to hang around the theater
department in order to meet girls. That's how I met my first wife, in fact. I was discouraged
from participating in the theater department. I was discouraged from participating in the theater
department. I was discouraged from participating in the theater department. I was worried about
ij crazy film or remaining living in the theater. But I made
Lindsay Hatfield's choice, which is what? I was happy and Seed's movie.
My För Dies sauldhard is my favorite thing to do, and I really like filming and rock
music around. I think I can do toys магазins without having to put the money in the savings
account. Why do I think I should have brought my savings account with me to the theater
department? Because I knew thepet Dentists and Adaptivists were going to get the money
in the living room, and I just distinctly wanted to do that.
I feel that science is the real thing. Um...
All right.
I don't need friends.
So no, you might like this guy.
He collects comic books and he likes Captain Beefheart.
I thought, what?
Both comic books and Captain Beefheart?
We just became great friends.
He was the liberal.
I was the conservative.
But we were both so disaffected with politics,
we didn't believe any of it was true.
What we really had in common was collecting,
well, what we might call kook pamphlets,
or extremist literature of religious or political kinds.
You know, you'd go to a laundromat
and there would be The Watchtower from Jehovah's Witnesses
or a comic book from Chick Publications,
you know, This Is Your Life.
We loved the range of ridiculous things
that human beings can convince themselves

of, and that's what we're doing.
If I went out and made my daily quota,
the first thing I'd do is go over
and wake up Reverend Stang.
Let's get up, let's go do something,
let's have some fun.
We were trolls before they had that term.
The internet hadn't been invented, but CB radios had.
And Philo, because he had a real job, had a CB radio.
But we didn't use it to help the world, we used it to make a living.


it to puzzle and confuse strangers. We would get on and say things like,
Men of Earth, men of Earth, we are speaking to you from 50 million light years away in space.
Come in, Pink Boy. Well, there was these two guys that were doing it back to us. They were
trolling us, and they were saying, shut up, Pink Boy, shut up, Pink Boy. And we interpreted that
as, oh, the aliens are finally talking to us. And that was what they had to say. The next thing we
knew, Pink Boys were everybody we didn't like. Bosses, rude waiters, nasty clerks in stores.
We were surrounded by dumbasses. We knew that we were dumbasses too,
but we felt like it was a matter of degrees. People that we didn't want to have anything
to do with, the pinks and the mediocritans, the technoglorps.
Me was in terror of all of that. But there was also the terrible stress of having to,
you know, make the living and not lose your soul.
Well, if you want to get, if you want to be damned by Bob.

Nearsighted Romeo had no problem reading the script. He had a problem with the script itself.
Hired by his headshot alone, Romeo was not well regarded among social circles
for his perceptiveness, nor his self-perceived talent.
Indeed, it is told that his dramatic performance prematurely brought the curtain down,
and in truth, his shrill, unmanly voice had offended countless,
stately,
patron barons.
What is this? he says, eyes scanning the script back and forth.
I cannot read this. What language is this? And see here.
He holds the book out at arm's length, fingers his chin with the other hand,
and cocks his eyebrow up in dramatic pause.
I die?
Bill, let's talk. You don't kill the hero. It's just not done. I'm the star.
Granted, I did not sign on to do a sequel because of my typecasting fears,
but this is no way to present my glorious exit.

Oh, how she lost her truancy.

Juliet was awkward to a fault, and in fact needed her long dress trimmed, else she would
trip and fall again, as her replacement front teeth would attest to.
She was also, in turn, quite rude and obnoxious.
Come on with your line already there, sucknuts, she says in the echoing silent theatre.
That's Romeo to you, chiclet tits, he proclaims, and pushes her back onto her stage mark under
the low-budget spotlight.
Here for art I got.
Damn it, he declares, and produces a knife from his custom Harley-Davidson quick-release
special mail-order only belt.
He plunges the knife over and over into Juliet's flailing body, holding her by the hair, letting
her drop when he is exhausted.
Romeo stands panting in the spotlight, going dim as the batteries grew weak.
See, he shrieks, I don't have to die, I can take the bitch out instead.
We can get a new one for every performance.
She can even use her own name if she's too stupid to remember the character's name.
Romeo turns, at the sound of Juliet groaning.
Fuck you, thumb dick.
Juliet gasps.
Romeo looks at the knife in his hand.
There is no blood.
It was a stage prop rubber knife from Archie McPhee, sellers of more fun and bizarre items
than you will ever need in your lifetime.
Juliet is rushed to the hospital.
Romeo is whisked off to the police station.

He is questioned.
Romeo sits in the chair at the interrogation desk, twiddling his idiot thumbs and occasionally
rattles the handcuffs because he likes the sound and refuses to talk.
Juliet, though not suffering any sharp puncture wounds to her body, had nonetheless taken
extreme blows to her neck, head, ribs, and neck.

called the Cult Awareness group.
There's a group here in Dallas called Cult Awareness.
And, uh,
had called them up just to see what they would say about the Church of the
Subgenius.
And they taught,
taught,
the funny thing is that I,
when they first opened,
I called them up and said,
yeah,
I'm kind of concerned about these,
these insane cults myself.
And, uh,
I thought I'd send you some of our material and,
and, uh,
so you could,
you know,
you can refer people to us.
And they,
uh,
apparently,
they,
they didn't like the material I sent.
I'd never heard from them since then,
but they're now telling people,
whatever you do,
stay away from those guys.
That's subgenius.
Man,
that's the worst.
Well,
I guess they,
and,
and especially what,
keep your kids away from them,
especially keep your kids away from the Church of the Subgenius
because of the,
uh,
sexually explicit material.
Now see,
y'all that only listen to the radio show,
you don't know what,
you,
you don't know what you're missing.
Woo.
Woo.
And who don't order the tapes,
but I can't advertise that stuff.
And all you can really do is write for information from,
uh,
P.O.
Box 807,
Glen Rose,
Texas,
76043.
For more information about Church of the Subgenius,
um,
and for that sexually explicit material,
which you don't get for free,
by the way,
not like,
I mean,
you get this radio show for free and get our information for free.
And,
uh,
it's not very sexually explicit,
uh,
but,
uh,
like I say,
you,
those of you who've been putting off writing to P.O.
Box 807,
Glen Rose,
Texas,
76043.
Fine.
I don't care.
I honestly,
I really don't.
It,
the last,
I always end up getting the last laugh,
dear friends.
I have total confidence that that will continue to be true.
Uh,
so,
um,
you know,
I can't,







I can't tell you what the deal is with the money,
but,
I gotta get some money.

Great stuff
So what are you guys going to do at this revival meeting?
You're going to make fun of religion stuff right?
We never make fun of religion
Never make fun
You must understand
We're making money
We're making money off religion
But not fun of religion
No
No
No fun
No fun
No fun
We hope to erase the slack area
We are missionaries
This is hard work
This part of the country
Brutal and gruesome work
And hopefully
We'll
Yes I will
Really now
Are you guys in this cult business just for the bucks
Or do you
Mr. Wilsey isn't it a fact really
That you've invented this whole thing
That you've thought up all these little gimmicks
And you're taking advantage of a lot of people
And you're taking advantage of a lot of ignorant people
By getting money out of them
People who believe in you and your silly preachings
No it isn't Joe
The Illuminati will be unmasked
And the subgenius cult will have a lot to do with that
Bob is going to see that the whole conspiracy
The Illuminati, the trilaterals, you name it
The guys that drive up and down the street selling ice cream
All of that will be exposed
That's what America needs
To have their brains washed!
Clean up!
Clean out all that filth and all that garbage
And all that fear
And all that sickness and perversion
And all that junk that comes from the pit of hell
Radio announcer and many friends of the rail land
This is the old fashioned healing broadcast
Coming direct from the auditorium here in Dallas
This is a special night tonight
This is oil night
Would you love to have a heart like God
Come out and be anointed with this miracle oil
That God has let me use for quite a few years now
And we're giving it out
Come and join the hundreds of people
Bring that bottle
And get some of this miracle oil
That's absolutely raised the dead
That's performed some of the greatest miracles
You name it
It's performed every known miracle
That it's happening
But look it's
No, Hal, look out!
You clumsy fools!
What have you done?
The show, it's ruined!
Ruined!

Actually, if you look at Subgenius.com
There's links to all kinds of new
Uh, forums and things
The website itself is basically just an archive
But the social life
Well, it gives you links to the
Perplexingly rich
Uh, social media sites of the subgeniuses
Some of which are
Basically moderated somewhat by our friends
Our old timer subgeniuses
And some of which
Are
Basically a bunch of pink bobbies
Who don't, literally can't spell Bob's name right
And call everybody else bobbies
It's like the sheeple that call everybody else sheeple
I'm a real individual
I stand in this crowd of people all dressed in the same hat
I'm a individual
I'm no sheeple
I'm a sheeple
Anyway, friends
You can go to a subgenius event someday
And stand around with people all wearing the same t-shirt
Well, it's not a cult
It's a fan club, officer
Heck, Price Bob
Help me somebody
