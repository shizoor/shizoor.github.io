1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
This is your last chance.

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:03,920
After this, there is no turning back.

3
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:05,900
You take the blue pill.

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,540
The story ends.

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,960
You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.

6
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,700
You take the red pill.

7
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,320
You stay in Wonderland.

8
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:17,880
And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.

9
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:19,520
Remember,

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,440
all I'm offering is the truth.

11
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:23,220
Nothing more.

12
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:29,740
Time for show.

13
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:31,280
Live show for you now.

14
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:33,700
This is Doug Smith, radio operator.

15
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:36,500
I'm going to bring you a piece of that green cheese for sure.

16
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:41,920
Welcome to the subgenius radio ministry.

17
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,440
Hour of Slap.

18
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:49,060
Sponsored by the Church of the Subgenius.

19
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,320
Laughter

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,240
Music

21
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,540
Music

22
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,460
Music

23
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:03,460


24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:03,460


25
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,220
Music

26
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:05,560
Music

27
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,200
Samuel Bruce.

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,200


29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,680
Text to Uncle Dan, meeting with the Ku Klux Klan.

30
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,180
Tell him there's a change of plans, the South won't rise again.

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,060
Yammering with the Southern drawl.

32
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,920
Bless your heart.

33
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:34,860
Howdy y'all.

34
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:38,380
President Trump won't build that wall and the South won't rise again.

35
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,200
General Sherman came to town riding on a horsey.

36
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:47,180
Stuck his boot inside your ass and burned your town of carsey.

37
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,420
Corpulent, seditious scum pining for a donkey's bum.

38
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,920
Yodel, stomping, clapping, strum, but the South won't rise again.

39
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,940
Let's see what's going on in the cornfield.

40
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,040
Hey, Clarabelle, where'd you get that pretty Q-9 baseball cap?

41
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,080
Oh, Rufus gave it to me.

42
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:10,400
He got it at that riot up in Washington, D.C.

43
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:14,880
Well, as pretty as you are, Clarabelle, I bet he gives you lots of nice gifts.

44
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,340
Well, he ain't given me nothing since he went to prison.

45
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:19,880
Hey!

46
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:26,320
Jimmy Bob, what's the difference between President Trump and President Obama?

47
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,560
I don't know, Clem, you tell me.

48
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:32,940
What's the difference between President Trump and President Obama?

49
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,600
Well, I want President Trump to f*** my dog.

50
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,160
Oh, f*** him!

51
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:48,660
Oh, f*** him!

52
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,660
I don't know, Clem.

53
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,020
I don't know, Clem.

54
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:09,620
I don't know, Clem.

55
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:09,700
I don't know, Clem.

56
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,740
Football-watching tubs of lard

57
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,540
Likes for General Beauregard

58
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,640
Arithmetic is pretty hard

59
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,280
And the South won't rise again

60
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:19,880
Knife-siege thugs with rebel flags

61
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,120
From our buffers

62
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,900
We will drag, ship them home in body bags

63
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,460
But the South won't rise again

64
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,480
Racist fucks in Alabama

65
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,240
Bombed a church in Birmingham

66
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,500
Then they rotted in the slammer

67
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,440
When you fuck your next of kin

68
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,640
Go and tell your white trash friends

69
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,600
You lost before and you'll lose again

70
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,220
The South won't ever win

71
00:03:46,220 --> 00:03:48,860
The South won't rise, the South won't rise

72
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,320
The South won't rise again

73
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,340
Oh, Frabjous Day, Kaloo Kalay, friends.

74
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:02,040
Not one, but two Rudy Schwartz Project albums came out today.

75
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:06,880
Saving this show and my mood.

76
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:12,940
One is an album of songs called

77
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:16,240
Adjacent to the Latex Gerbil.

78
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,520
And the one we just heard,

79
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,240
The South,

80
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,740
The South Won't Rise Again, is from that one.

81
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:27,440
We'll be hearing more of those later on in the show.

82
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,380
The other album is called Frop Music.

83
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,960
And it's all instrumentals.

84
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,980
The one in the background right now

85
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:42,880
is called Devil Horns on the Forehead of Broderick Crawford.

86
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,080
Ahead.

87
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,500
We'll also be listening to some

88
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,780
uh, uh,

89
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,000
old synesthesia radio

90
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,140
with Dr. Hal

91
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,180
and Lonesome Cowboy Dave

92
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:57,600
and some puzzling evidence

93
00:04:58,460 --> 00:05:00,760
show from KPFA Berkeley

94
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:02,140
from the old days.

95
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:07,440
The synesthesia show is from WCSB Cleveland.

96
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,800
And, uh,

97
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,900
and some ancient fire sign theater.

98
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,480
But now this.

99
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,140
Ah, if only we could bring this

100
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:19,820
special,

101
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,320
special understanding to so many of our citizens

102
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,240
who unknowing are searching in the dark

103
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,560
and thirsting for it.

104
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:27,620
But these early days,

105
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,040
Stang,

106
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,760
is Stang counseled for us

107
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,620
as he used it to bring them the message.

108
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,780
I don't know if this is still valid

109
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,500
in today's world of modern times.

110
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,120
Well, the first Stangian orthodox fist temple

111
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:40,500
of whatever it is,

112
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,460
is standing by to leech away your vital essence

113
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,520
and turn it into solid blocks of subgenius understanding.

114
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,660
Slack, come.

115
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,120
Slug guns from the barrel of a gun, Dave.

116
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,480
The slug gun.

117
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,940
Looks like one of these.

118
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,240
I bet you wish you had one of these.

119
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,880
Slug guns like this one, see?

120
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:58,840
Yeah.

121
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,520
Pretty sharp, huh?

122
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,660
I can smell your guys' pineal glands

123
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:03,700
all the way from out here, 50 miles away.

124
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,860
Oh, I guess that's me.

125
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:05,820
I can smell crackling and burning

126
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,680
like a big forest fire out there in the west.

127
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:07,900
I'm slightly embarrassed.

128
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:10,980
I'm not, I'm just in such an awe

129
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:13,480
because I wanted you guys to explain Dobbs Town

130
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,720
and the good works.

131
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,560
And it faded out as I began to transflux.

132
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:19,640
Transflux.

133
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:21,200
Well, you know, we practice acubiting

134
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,080
and opening of the third nostril to all inductees,

135
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:29,620
but that's just at the first few weeks of big boot camp.

136
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,560
Afterwards comes hell month.

137
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,180
Now, the legends and rumors

138
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,860
about the balls and vice grips and the hazings,

139
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:41,100
that's a bunch of propaganda for me.

140
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:41,540
That's right.

141
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,740
It's not nearly so hard.

142
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:43,680
Benny, enjoy it.

143
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,020
And they come back again and again

144
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:48,060
to retake our slinky subgenius seminars.

145
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,700
Well, sadly, some of the propaganda is being recirculated

146
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:54,860
by various sectors of the Church of the Subgenius itself.

147
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:55,600
They are conspiracy dupes.

148
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:57,680
But I wouldn't ask you to direct yourself to that.

149
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,120
They're in the pockets of Time Warner,

150
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,400
Clear Channel and the Saturday Evening Post.

151
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,100
They're everywhere.

152
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,260
They're everywhere.

153
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:05,880
That's right.

154
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,880
Just like the carpet under your feet

155
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,180
or the nails at the end of your fingers.

156
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:13,400
Your little tinfoil helmet ain't gonna keep them out.

157
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,300
Yes, pyramids won't do it.

158
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:18,040
But my tinfoil helmet has worked out.

159
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,800
For an awful lot of the evil things you've tried to do,

160
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,320
you know, playing with my mind and stuff,

161
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,020
it has helped.

162
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,100
You have to remember that.

163
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,060
It doesn't have a self-destruct button

164
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:26,460
like our helmets do.

165
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,500
Well, that's another thing in the hierarchy.

166
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,860
How come you guys got better technology

167
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,640
than the rest of us?

168
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,360
Well, we were there when they passed out the beans.

169
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:36,700
Hmm.

170
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,100
The what?

171
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:40,020
You mean the multicolored beans?

172
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:42,300
Well, you plant them in the backyard

173
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,080
at the full of the moon.

174
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,960
Should we be giving away this information?

175
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,100
I think...

176
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:47,760
Nobody's listening.

177
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:48,460
All right.

178
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,260
Well, it doesn't matter.

179
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,480
You cast your beans on the fertile earth,

180
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:55,640
and the next day, there's a humongous big piece

181
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,720
of crabgrass out there with your name on it.

182
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,400
Now, I wouldn't give these special things to you.

183
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,340
Go see my new movie, Terminator 3,

184
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,720
and please go vote for me, please.

185
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,560
Now we see we're listener-censored radio

186
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,360
and still being interrupted by public service announcements.

187
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:13,460
That was...

188
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,700
...NPR affiliate.

189
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,880
Oh, that's very annoying.

190
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:19,060
...that itches out the inside of your ears.

191
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,120
Here we go.

192
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,880
But I think it's a form of cosmic relief

193
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:25,220
for the whole rest of the evacuation, you know,

194
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,820
you guys have been sputin' out.

195
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,620
I mean, some of it's right on the money,

196
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,180
but the rest of it is just to take your money.

197
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
Well, you know, you don't know what to say about that.

198
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,920
Well, you're like cracking stones, buddy.

199
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,720
We can't control every aspect of the way this has developed

200
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,320
and promulgated?

201
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,320
I'm with you 100%.

202
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,680
It's just that, you know, I...

203
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,920
I have the eyes to see and the ears to hear, you know, like they used to say in the old company.

204
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,060
And now you're looking through a glass darkly.

205
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,980
Get some Windex and get a better view.

206
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:58,960
I've got 360 vision, man.

207
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,220
That's the best part of these helmets.

208
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:05,520
I mean, I'm not saying it's keeping out all the bad vibes you guys are sending right now or anything,

209
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,520
but I can still see behind my head.

210
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:11,080
And you can see in the dark without searching blindly in the dark.

211
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:11,640
That's correct.

212
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,960
And it's been very, very valuable for so many members of my family who keep losing me daily,

213
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,400
especially, you know, after the sun goes down.

214
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:23,080
They should let their fingers do the walking up your spine.

215
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,020
Yeah, I knew you were going to talk about doing that stuff to my spine again.

216
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,620
Don't, you know, don't.

217
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,000
I'm not going to forget it.

218
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:29,860
Let's just put it that way.

219
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,600
You've got to release the Kundalini energy, see?

220
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:37,900
There are 33 little bumps here, and after each one is tweaked, you'll feel like a new being.

221
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:39,740
Yeah.

222
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,620
I have felt like a new...

223
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:44,240
It hasn't done me any good.

224
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,580
Well, you just don't have faith.

225
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,880
You've got to have faith, and faith will move mountains and molehills, too.

226
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:52,000
Every day, a new personality.

227
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,100
Every time I wake up, a completely new, different history.

228
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,540
You contain really, really, you know...

229
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,900
Your name is Legion.

230
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:00,880
You have a hundred zip codes.

231
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,940
Have faith and eat more prunes, Dave.

232
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,440
Well, I'll give that a try, but no more of the Satanist hobo stuff.

233
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,240
You know, my name is Legion and everything.

234
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:11,380
My name's not Legion.

235
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,580
That challenge, you know...

236
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,380
Well, not most of the time.

237
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,840
Let's take that other call there.

238
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,760
Oh.

239
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,040
The L stands for lumbar.

240
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:23,980
Vertebrae.

241
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:26,820
Hey, Dan, Jack, and Jim, go over to see Tim.

242
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,240
Dan, Jack, and Jim, go over to see Tim.

243
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:31,680
Can I borrow a toothbrush to clean my shoes?

244
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:35,000
Wouldn't you guys like to buy a bottle of long water?

245
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,140
This isn't a lending library.

246
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:37,720
Hello?

247
00:10:39,080 --> 00:10:39,480
No.

248
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:39,880


249
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,140
No.

250
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,720
No.

251
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,360


252
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:41,600
No.

253
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:41,620
No.

254
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,620


255
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,620


256
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,620


257
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,620


258
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,620


259
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,620


260
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,620


261
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,620


262
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,620


263
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,620


264
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,620


265
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,620


266
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,620


267
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:41,620


268
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,120
Special privileges.

269
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,160
They all do.

270
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,120
You know, and after all the years that I've been sucking up to you guys and stuff,

271
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,060
how many have I got?

272
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,380
Three.

273
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:53,140
Well, you see, those who do don't receive the benefits,

274
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,080
and this is very ironic of those who simply lap up the cream.

275
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,760
See, back to perplexation again.

276
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:03,300
This Buddhist-type stuff, if I seek it, I will not find it.

277
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,820
If I sit down and I take a nap, maybe it'll happen and et cetera.

278
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,620
You know, I don't know.

279
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,680
I do lose my faith once in a while.

280
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,400
You know, I don't know.

281
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,920
I sit under that fig tree and concentrate on the eternal infinite.

282
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:18,840
Okay.

283
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,720
But what does that really mean?

284
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:25,620
Well, it means that there is a universe of emptiness inside you.

285
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,600
Oh, man.

286
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:30,680
Now, that's not what I feel when I'm sticking my hand down there.

287
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:31,600
Well, what?

288
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,140
You've got an amusement park inside?

289
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:34,820
What?

290
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:39,460
No, but I have a lot of misdirected hairs and calloused parts.

291
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:40,700
College radio.

292
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:41,340
College radio.

293
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:43,620
My name is actually Lesion, not Legion.

294
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,120
I've got scars the size of the San Diego Freeway.

295
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,880
Why don't you put a Band-Aid on that sucker?

296
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,940
That's unsightly.

297
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,700
Our listeners aren't interested in your wounds.

298
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,220
He needs to drink lots and lots and lots of aloe vera juice, Dave.

299
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:57,480
I've suffered these wounds for Bob Dobbs.

300
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,680
Much in the same way.

301
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,900
To heal the inside of you.

302
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,340
You know, I'll tell you one thing, Dave, as long as we're talking here, man to man.

303
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,860
Chicks dig scars.

304
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,400
You know what I'm talking about?

305
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:06,920
Yeah.

306
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:11,120
So those lumps and wounds, lesions, things that you're talking about,

307
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:13,160
they help you along in life.

308
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:13,940
They're chick magnets.

309
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,200
Yeah, exactly.

310
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:17,460
Just like on your refrigerator.

311
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,120
So buck up and pull yourself together.

312
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:23,840
Things aren't as bad as they seem,

313
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,260
and it's always darkest just before it goes completely pitch black.

314
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,760
Oh, yes, dear friends.

315
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,660
It seems like it was somehow easier to do shows

316
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,680
back when we had a radio station to do them in.

317
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,680
That's from Dr. Sinister's show on WCSB Cleveland.

318
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,020
It still follows the Hour of Slack after like 20 years.

319
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,300
I should call that show.

320
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:51,440
It's just that I'm usually asleep or half asleep by then on Sundays.

321
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:58,300
I've been doing this weekly show for 36 years, friends.

322
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,520
Almost 2,000 episodes.

323
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:05,300
And I was about to write up a report on how I've been slowing down

324
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:09,600
because I have the malaise from my advancing arthritis

325
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:10,660
and I'm not feeling well.

326
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:10,660


327
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:10,660


328
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:10,660


329
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:10,660


330
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:10,660


331
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:10,660


332
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:10,660


333
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:15,780
And declining motivation and this dang chest cold,

334
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:18,420
which you may be able to hear in my voice.

335
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,720
It's been clinging on.

336
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,120
But then I looked at my email,

337
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:28,160
and there was the weekly flat-out donation

338
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,500
from listener Reverend John Flanagan

339
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,680
with the phrase,

340
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,060
Thanks for Hour of Slack.

341
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,160
Pray, Bob.

342
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,220
And it's things like that that motivate me

343
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,500
to go ahead and try to throw together a new show.

344
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:43,020
Even if it's made of old parts, largely.

345
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:47,420
Instead of sitting on the bed staring into space,

346
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:50,040
which has been getting easier and easier to do.

347
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:56,440
There's another guy that sends $130.13 every month.

348
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,460
And another guy that sends $50 every month.

349
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:04,860
And about 10 subscribers who actually pay $5 an episode for each show.

350
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:08,560
Otherwise, I think I might be too tired of this

351
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,480
to even bother to put out a rerun.

352
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:13,880
But knowing there are at least 20 listeners

353
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,180
that care that much,

354
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:17,880
well, now I'd be a real wuss to quit now.

355
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,400
Plus, X-Day is in a month,

356
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,640
and after that I won't have to worry about anything, right?

357
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,120
I'm going to go to Reverend Zanthea's campground

358
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:29,260
in Florida, Land O'Lakes, Florida,

359
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,700
and see lots of buddies.

360
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:34,520
And that'll be my first trip past Granbury, Texas

361
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,520
in over a year.

362
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,220
The Granbury's only 20 miles away,

363
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,840
but they have doctors,

364
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:42,280
and even a movie theater there.

365
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:44,600
Heck, they even have an opera house.

366
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,900
Where I live, in Glen Rose,

367
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:49,920
there are two grocery stores,

368
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:51,380
two drug stores,

369
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,280
three banks,

370
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:53,380
a dollar store,

371
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,380
and about 100 churches.

372
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,820
However, I like it here

373
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:02,380
because there's a half mile of unspoiled woods and creeks

374
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,100
around my house in every direction,

375
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:07,760
and a few houses occupied by my siblings and nephews,

376
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,400
and a big herd of goats.

377
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,580
But I think during the last year and a half,

378
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:16,080
we've had a grand total of five visitors.

379
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:20,120
Luckily, almost all of them were beautiful ladies.

380
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:22,000
So there's that.

381
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,980
Also, we've been seeing subgenius friends on Zoom

382
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:29,120
and other weekly or monthly internet meetups

383
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,820
like the Subgenius Diaspora every Saturday,

384
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,120
and Ask Dr. Hal once a month.

385
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,500
And I'm in daily touch with Philo,

386
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,120
Philo,

387
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:40,900
Onan,

388
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:41,660
Sterno,

389
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:42,540
Sphinxo,

390
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:44,320
and Puzlo Evido

391
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,860
via a secret channel.

392
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,500
Now, Onan's helping me get some new and old books out.

393
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,520
Now, nobody in Glen Rose, Texas,

394
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,940
knows who Bob is,

395
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:58,900
except for one subgenius who isn't related to me,

396
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,520
and she's one of the beautiful ladies that visits.

397
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:04,820
Because I don't wear Bob shirts around.

398
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,660
My car has no bumper stickers.

399
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:09,140
I don't want to get into that conversation.

400
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,760
Nobody knows about the movie.

401
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,960
Which reminds me,

402
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:16,040
I haven't played the rest of the soundtrack

403
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:21,400
of Sandy Boone's excellent 2019 documentary about us

404
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,180
on the show yet.

405
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:27,000
So I'm about to.

406
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,260
Incidentally, it's no longer on Amazon.com

407
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,580
or Prime or whatever,

408
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,220
but it's still on Apple TV

409
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:38,420
and I think Hulu.

410
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,860
Several, a whole bunch of other ones.

411
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:45,260
You can look at dobstown.org

412
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,720
and that explains all of that stuff.

413
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,020
Anyway, here's some

414
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,680
hopefully not too dated stuff

415
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,000
from near the end of the subgenius movie

416
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,660
by Sandy Boone,

417
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:59,240
J.R. Bob Dobbs,

418
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,220
and the Church of the Subgenius.

419
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:06,120
The world never did know about Church of the Subgenius.

420
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:08,720
We never were that,

421
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,360
that big.

422
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,860
It is kind of obscure.

423
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,100
That keeps it special.

424
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:14,900
If everybody knew about it,

425
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,240
it would be normal.

426
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,320
We were just too lazy.

427
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:20,740
We didn't want to be responsible

428
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,300
for our own cult members.

429
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,660
We just wanted to tap them on the forehead

430
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,020
and say, wake up.

431
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,580
And of course,

432
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:32,220
some people you have to hit with a sledgehammer.

433
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,120
And even then, that doesn't do the trick.

434
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,580
Or you can get them to wake for a second or two.

435
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,560
And then they doze off again

436
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,140
as soon as they see a cat picture on the internet.

437
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,720
Today's secret ingredient is...

438
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,380
How am I doing? Am I doing okay?

439
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:06,040
I'm present.

440
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,340
Hey, I'm president.

441
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,700
Do you believe me?

442
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:08,700


443
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:08,700


444
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:08,840
I believe.

445
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,280
Donald Trump's probably

446
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:15,820
the most subgenius world leader there's ever been.

447
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,260
He's completely caught up in his own world,

448
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,460
does what he wants,

449
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,760
makes up his own reality.

450
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,340
I'm not going to give you a question.

451
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,180
Can you stay cataclysmic?

452
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,040
You are fake news.

453
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,760
Sean Spicer, our press secretary,

454
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,420
gave alternative facts.

455
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:37,000
Facts and lies have no meaning to him.

456
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:38,700
Subgenius.

457
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,780
Genius, but not in a good way.

458
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:41,740
Trump's stakes.

459
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,320
Where are the stakes?

460
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:42,900
Do we have stakes?

461
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:43,180
Do I?

462
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,540
We've been friends for a long time.

463
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,240
We're living in a world that's upside down.

464
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,480
Trump is the perfect example now of a world turned upside down.

465
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,700
He's the Joker.

466
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,040
This is a special year.

467
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,300
Our country is doing great.

468
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:07,360
We've got surreal, unbelievable, shocking, psychedelic,

469
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,700
covered with reality.

470
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:14,820
It's not a good place for any party to end up with a cult-like situation.

471
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:21,220
I mean, Bob Dobbs is not in any way weirder than Donald Trump.

472
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:22,240
I mean, Donald Trump wins.

473
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,520
I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn't lose any

474
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:27,140
voters, okay?

475
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:27,960
USA!

476
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:29,040
USA!

477
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:35,220
It's very effective to slice the world up and to pit everyone against each other.

478
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,660
It's an effective means for power.

479
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,680
The country of Mexico is a country of power.

480
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:40,160
Mexico is killing us.

481
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,300
The crime and the gangs and the drugs.

482
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,220
Build that wall!

483
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,520
Build that wall!

484
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,640
Build that wall!

485
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:57,440
We're torn as subgeniuses because, of course, a good portion of our viewpoint is that the

486
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:00,020
conspiracy is out of control.

487
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:07,660
In fact, to our horror, each passing day the world seems more and more subgenius.

488
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,260
All natural weight loss age.

489
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:16,840
The great story here is this vast right-wing conspiracy.

490
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,660
There are many people that don't agree with that birth certificate.

491
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,960
I can't trust Obama.

492
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:22,400
He's an Arab.

493
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:23,940
He is not.

494
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:27,320
Everybody is in their own private Idaho.

495
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:33,480
Everybody's in their own bubble and all they do is go into a feedback loop where they can

496
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,800
get things to reaffirm what they already think.

497
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:38,580
This administration is trying to fool you.

498
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:38,680
This is a conspiracy.

499
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:38,700
It is a conspiracy.

500
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:38,700


501
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:38,700


502
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:38,700


503
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:38,700


504
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,460
It makes you believe the news the White House doesn't really like well isn't news.

505
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,360
3 million illegals voted.

506
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,880
Where are you getting your information?

507
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:50,560
The Soviet Union has a worldwide disinformation network.

508
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:57,740
They go to media sites that incite them, that make them paranoid and worried and fretful

509
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,840
about the future.

510
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,520
They can't control the amount of rapes that are going on.

511
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,020
Just because they're refugees doesn't mean they're rapists.

512
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,860
They're racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic.

513
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,160
I am no racist.

514
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:08,480
I am a racist.

515
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:08,660
I am a racist.

516
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:08,660


517
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:08,660


518
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:08,660


519
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:08,660


520
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:08,660


521
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:10,020
You're voting for Donald Trump.

522
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:14,260
None of them are interested in breaking out of the loop and realizing,

523
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,860
oh, I've been doing, I've been programmed.

524
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,060
Trump's derangement syndrome.

525
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:24,400
Hatred of Donald Trump so intense that it impairs people's judgment.

526
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:31,460
Like if you quit being real humans and thinking for yourselves, it's over.

527
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,580
This is your country.

528
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:47,740
I don't know how you carve out a place for that kind of playful us and them

529
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:53,700
in a place where the news is filling so many of those roles.

530
00:21:54,460 --> 00:22:00,980
That being said, I also couldn't have thought of a subgenius in 1978.

531
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:06,400
So obviously they're better at this than I am.

532
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,100
There's always going to be a conspiracy.

533
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:14,660
It can morph, it can change, and it can evolve, and so can the Church of the Subgenius.

534
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:17,020
We'll never fix the government.

535
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,700
We'll never get it to where everyone is happy.

536
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:25,960
There will always be acrimony, and so we desperately need comedy.

537
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:31,460
Well, I think the best thing we can do is spread our message

538
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:36,380
and hope that it is useful in the coming years.

539
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:39,840
It's coming weeks away until things get tough,

540
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,420
and how can you meet someone like John Donald that can have that trust on Hong Kong

541
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:58,980
during a golden adolescence and take you down below highest ranking on the MustP physicists list to the National기 website.

542
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,100
So sometimes I get those Get to the West notes,

543
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,100


544
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,100


545
00:22:59,100 --> 00:22:59,100


546
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:10,100
For the last 20 years, the only thing I had to do to make my half the mortgage payments

547
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:13,020
is keep selling subgenius ministerships.

548
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,940
And it occurred to me, wait a minute, this isn't a bad gig at all.

549
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:22,560
Once a month I have to sit here and assemble these things, maybe spend half an hour a day

550
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:23,660
taking them to the post office.

551
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,060
That's not bad.

552
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,200
People are still obviously getting a lot out of it.

553
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:38,100
Just last week I went to the post office and there was this envelope there, postage due.

554
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:45,320
I had to fork out $2.45 just to find out what was in this letter, and it had no return address

555
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:45,920
on it.

556
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:49,820
The postal guy said, well, I could just throw it away.

557
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,400
I went, no, it's probably a joke, but it better be funny.

558
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,720
I got home and opened it up.

559
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,040
It had a thousand letters.

560
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,920
It had a thousand dollars in $20 bills in there, just out of the blue.

561
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:06,360
I immediately took half of it to a sick person I know who cried with gratitude.

562
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,480
It's like, no, we're not crazy to keep doing this.

563
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,080
It really does come along at the right time for some people.

564
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,320
Palmer, what happened to Philo?

565
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,240
He's hiding.

566
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:25,320
He's hiding.

567
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:25,740
Oh.

568
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,320
You guys look awful, but a lot better than I expected.

569
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,060
Yarr, yarr, yarr, yarr, yarr.

570
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,340
Price Bogg.

571
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,820
Welcome to Austin.

572
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,980
This is sort of like a booze quest.

573
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,540
Uh-oh, another human blockade.

574
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,560
Look, there's something.

575
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:51,540
There's a mermaid woman, a mer-woman.

576
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,820
It's you once you get your shirt off, honey.

577
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,420
Oh.

578
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,140
I thought it was for real.

579
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:57,440
You first.

580
00:24:57,660 --> 00:24:58,220
This is just a sad.

581
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,320
I'll bet you if you take your clothes off, everybody here will follow you.

582
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,840
This is just a sad, sad joke.

583
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:02,980
Seriously, man.

584
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,240
Do it.

585
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:03,700
No, no, no.

586
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:07,180
If you took your clothes off, and I'll bet you anything this is true.

587
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:07,400
I'm not a leader.

588
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:07,780
I'm not a leader.

589
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,040
I'm just a fast follower.

590
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:13,000
If you were to do that, I'm the second guy in.

591
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:18,160
To me, it's always been play.

592
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,680
You go to a subgenius show, they're not waving their arms in anger.

593
00:25:24,780 --> 00:25:25,220
They're just like, hey, you know what?

594
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:30,980
They might be pretending to, but that's the main thing you get is laughter.

595
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,280
And we're still just playing.

596
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,500
This is Philo.

597
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,060
I'm Philo.

598
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:41,000
I've been Tony.

599
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,440
This is Reverend Stang.

600
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:43,460
Yeah, I'm a reverend.

601
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:44,380
We're cult leaders.

602
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:45,640
That's what we really are.

603
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,700
Our real job is to be cult leaders.

604
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:48,960
There you go.

605
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,040
This will take you like a week and a half to read.

606
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:54,580
It's called Church of the Subgenius.

607
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:58,120
If you're not a genius, you're probably qualified.

608
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:07,020
If you feel different and you feel oppressed by society's imposition of normalcy on you,

609
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:09,280
you don't have to be that way.

610
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,120
You can be the person that you want to be.

611
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:19,980
We know that we think for ourselves, and that's more important than you thinking like me.

612
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:53,520
God knows when that нач играє, but...

613
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,260
We'll see you around again and forevermore, bass.

614
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:54,500
Good night.

615
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:54,500


616
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:54,500


617
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:54,500


618
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:54,500


619
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:59,480
Moaning and groaning won't get you nowhere, don't you be misled

620
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:08,260
Take some silver sappen with some thunderbird wine and talk to it as much as you can

621
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:31,940
It's got two friends Chad and Fred, both of them are really just heads

622
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:36,960
They got a room with a black lab poster and they both got their very own beds

623
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:42,000
Chad and Fred like Portuguese bread and they always gotta be fed

624
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:50,760
So I go to the bakery when a rooster crumbles and subsequently visit Ben Asner's head

625
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,740
That's a good looking head

626
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:31,120
Sometimes Chad and Fred are stubborn, they won't leave us alone

627
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:38,660
Edgehead glares at Chad and Fred's head and speaks in a very stern tone

628
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:46,140
Chad and Fred roll out of their beds and leave with a Portuguese bread

629
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:53,740
Now at last I've got plenty of time to talk to Ed Asner's head

630
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:17,540
So what do you do when you're feeling so low that you think you'd rather be dead?

631
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,760
What do you say when the landlord's knock on inhumanity fills you with dread?

632
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,420
Cussing and spitting?

633
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,560
Won't get you nowhere, remember what I said

634
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:36,520
Drop a hundred micrograms of LSD and talk to Ed Asner's head

635
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,340
Ed, you've got a mighty fine looking head

636
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,780
And that was Ed Asner's head

637
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:23,620
A song I needed to cheer me up this very day

638
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:27,520
And by the Rudy Schwartz Project

639
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:34,180
Old Waldo and Gunther are old friends of mine, actually

640
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:38,280
They used to live in Austin a long, long time ago

641
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:39,560
Now live in Canada

642
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:44,260
Where they get much better medical treatment, by the way

643
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:49,020
Much more affordable and generally more advanced

644
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:50,400
Isn't that funny?

645
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:54,220
You wouldn't know it to listen to the AM talk shows

646
00:30:54,500 --> 00:30:55,460
These days, would you?

647
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,660
And now this

648
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:04,040
Some more reading from the Dobbs Town Mirror

649
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:08,120
Published by Dr. Onan Canobite

650
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:12,160
Now of Columbus, Indiana

651
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:14,120
Isn't that strange?

652
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,400
He left Portland

653
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:22,220
Why would anybody leave a peaceful town like Portland?

654
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,480
And this is...

655
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,640
This issue, I might add, is dedicated to Reverend Just John

656
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,860
Whose music I used to play on this show

657
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,580
And his music is in a lot of my music videos of microbes

658
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,020
Or my microbe videos on my YouTube channel

659
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:40,360
Rev Stang

660
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,360
Yeah, he died last year

661
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:50,040
He was kinda old and in bad health

662
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:54,480
We also lost Reverend Rock Roswell, Jr.

663
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:54,480


664
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:54,480


665
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,680
Even more recently.

666
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,640
But I ain't dead yet.

667
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,620
Convenience personified.

668
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,560
Why do chefs wear chef hats?

669
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:14,200
Most people will try to come up with some kind of functional reply, an origin story,

670
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:18,220
but the answer is to identify themselves as chefs.

671
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:25,160
The teleological heresy, creationism, is everywhere when you know how to look for it.

672
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,480
When someone you don't like does something you don't like, it shows how evil they are.

673
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,380
And when they do something you like, it shows how clever they are.

674
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:44,200
Anything, as long as you get to retain your chef hat that identifies to everybody else you like and who you don't like.

675
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:47,980
I do not argue for hatlessness.

676
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:52,820
But I suggest there's more slack to be had if you can switch out those hats now and again.

677
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,540
Instead of identifying the good and the wicked, say,

678
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,780
I prefer it and see what happens.

679
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,200
As Charles Fort said in Wild Talents,

680
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:13,080
I conceive of nothing in religion, science, or philosophy that is more than the proper thing to wear for a while.

681
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,940
The genius panel.

682
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:17,840
Yes.

683
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:18,680
Here we are.

684
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,040
What kind of help can you give?

685
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,260
We are ready and waiting for your question.

686
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,940
Because we are subgenius, we do go very low.

687
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,100
Well, I'm not actually a member, but they are.

688
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:34,160
How low can you go is a question that's never been fully explored.

689
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,460
Yeah, if you've been through basic, then you can understand the show.

690
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,420
Like, what is the subgenius, or what does it mean?

691
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,040
It means a shout.

692
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:45,700
I've got to tell you, then, you know.

693
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,260
95 million miles.

694
00:33:47,380 --> 00:33:47,760
That's our mission.

695
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:48,160
That's our mission.

696
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:48,200
That's our mission.

697
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,200


698
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,200


699
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,200


700
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,200


701
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:48,200


702
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:49,640
I just started talking to you here now.

703
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,220
I can't see all the babies behind.

704
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:56,660
It means it's the same as having a baseball glove radar strapped to your butt.

705
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:57,800
I think you got it.

706
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:58,660
I think you got it.

707
00:33:58,660 --> 00:34:00,240
It's like, Bob Dobbs, huh?

708
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:07,120
Just remember, the one thing that's most important to subgeniuses everywhere,

709
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:12,020
the one thing you can't forget, a subgenius must have slack.

710
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:17,240
Of all other things, a subgenius must have slack.

711
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,200
That is the most important thing.

712
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,820
It's the motivator for the subgenius.

713
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:24,300
So if you're one that has felt like you needed this thing,

714
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:26,380
that you didn't know how to explain what it was,

715
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:27,480
and yet there it was,

716
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,640
because it's a subgenius, huh?

717
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:31,580
grabbing, completing you.

718
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:32,100
What is that?

719
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:37,200
Well, it makes you jump five or ten inches higher, that's for sure.

720
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:40,940
A subgenius must have slack, but in order to get the slack,

721
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,100
so clip those coupons,

722
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:47,180
the subgenius must disengage from the conspiracy and be under his own genius.

723
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,200
Voltaire said,

724
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:54,000
We shall leave the world as foolish and wicked as we found it.

725
00:34:54,520 --> 00:35:01,800
Only the church of the subgenius can guarantee to leave the world far, far more foolish than when we found it.

726
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:08,220
If the sole function of language was to communicate, then we'd have one language.

727
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:13,200
We have more than one language, therefore we have more than a sole function.

728
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,800
What other functions might there be?

729
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,540
To exclude?

730
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:18,940
To not communicate?

731
00:35:19,460 --> 00:35:25,940
This explains many languages, and language dialects, and within dialects, slang,

732
00:35:26,180 --> 00:35:29,760
so young people and old people can exclude each other.

733
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:35,380
Now, is the sole function of the internet to communicate?

734
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:41,080
Is the sole function of your religion to get commune?

735
00:35:42,020 --> 00:35:45,300
This is the golden age of literacy.

736
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,340
Never before,

737
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:50,660
have so many written and read for their own pleasure.

738
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:55,240
It just turns out that for many people, their pleasure is

739
00:35:55,240 --> 00:35:56,480
sermonizing,

740
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,500
scolding,

741
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,340
tattling,

742
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,260
bullying,

743
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,220
and cats.

744
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:03,280
Lots of cats.

745
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:05,300
Cats are fine.

746
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,740
My pleasure, says Onan,

747
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:14,840
is reminding the listener to join the church of the subgenius.

748
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,400
And now this.

749
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,960
The

750
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:47,320
The

751
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,320


752
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,320


753
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,320


754
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,320


755
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,320


756
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,320


757
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,320


758
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,320


759
00:36:47,320 --> 00:37:17,320


760
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:47,320


761
00:37:47,320 --> 00:38:17,320


762
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:47,320


763
00:38:47,320 --> 00:39:17,320


764
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:47,320


765
00:39:47,320 --> 00:40:17,320


766
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:47,320


767
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,480
The

768
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,160
The

769
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:52,640
The

770
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:52,980
The

771
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:53,280
The

772
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:53,460
The

773
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,620
I don't mean Joe Newman.

774
00:40:55,680 --> 00:40:58,340
I mean Waldo and Gunther.

775
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,020
And all the Egyptians

776
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:02,820
digged round about the river

777
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,040
for water to drink.

778
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,600
But they could not drink

779
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,860
of the water of the river.

780
00:41:07,580 --> 00:41:09,020
Men shrink from tasting.

781
00:41:09,140 --> 00:41:11,320
Human beings thirst after water.

782
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:14,120
And what does natural history tell us?

783
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,220
Destructions, dear friends,

784
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,040
are things on earth.

785
00:41:18,940 --> 00:41:21,180
Destructions not of all at once,

786
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,000
but of a very large number

787
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,880
are attributed by it

788
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,900
to two principal causes.

789
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,900
The tremendous onslaughts

790
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,680
of fire and water.

791
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:34,140
These two visitations,

792
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,240
we are told,

793
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:36,800
descend in turns

794
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,340
after very long cycles of years.

795
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:40,680
When interviewed,

796
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,520
Los Angeles Police Chief Ed Davis said,

797
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,860
when the agent is the conflagration,

798
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,400
a stream of heaven-sent fire

799
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:49,680
pours out from above

800
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,460
and spreads over many places.

801
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:54,980
And overruns great regions

802
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:57,100
of the uninhabited earth.

803
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:57,860
George.

804
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:58,660
Dear God,

805
00:41:58,660 --> 00:42:00,380
I have been reading all the things

806
00:42:00,380 --> 00:42:01,320
that happened long ago

807
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,060
when the sun stood still

808
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:04,100
and David and Goliath

809
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,380
and Daniel with the lion's den

810
00:42:05,380 --> 00:42:06,700
and the story of Ruth

811
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:07,800
and the fall of Jericho.

812
00:42:08,080 --> 00:42:10,260
A lot of things happened in your days.

813
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:12,180
Yours truly, Joe.

814
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:14,680
Thou who walks in the sky

815
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,100
with splendor and terror,

816
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,320
king of battle.

817
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:17,960
Let it go.

818
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,660
The raging fire god.

819
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,660
God, Nurgle.

820
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:22,340
Nurgie.

821
00:42:22,380 --> 00:42:22,860
Nurgie.

822
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:23,200
Nurgie.

823
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:23,720
Nurgie.

824
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:24,940
Your dog, Nurgie?

825
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,220
Nurgie, the dreaded Nurgie,

826
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,800
fire dog of the Venusians.

827
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:29,000
Hey, Nurgs, did you hear that?

828
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:30,560
I'll read it.

829
00:42:30,580 --> 00:42:31,180
I'll read it some more.

830
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,140
Okay, Nurgie, sit up now.

831
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:33,760
Nurgie, the fire star,

832
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,880
comes like a raging storm.

833
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,580
He is also called

834
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,580
Sharapu,

835
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:39,660
the burner

836
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:42,380
and light that flames from heaven

837
00:42:42,380 --> 00:42:45,600
and lord of destruction.

838
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,300
And Farnod the Flatulent, too.

839
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,400
That's Nurgie also.

840
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:49,740
Nurgie was the god

841
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,760
during like pre-Babylonian times

842
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:52,760
when the Babylonians

843
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:53,640
were just beginning to,

844
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,620
as we say in natural history now here

845
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:56,640
at the Groucho Marx University,

846
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:57,560
getting it together.

847
00:42:57,820 --> 00:42:59,060
During the Assyrian,

848
00:42:59,060 --> 00:42:59,620
getting kind of

849
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,780
the Assyrian groovy period,

850
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,080
the great god Nurgie

851
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,820
was known to fly over the people

852
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:05,260
and...

853
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,500
Oh, good, I'm glad you got that fish.

854
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,440
The great god Nurgie

855
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:13,880
was known to fly over large areas

856
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:14,960
of the Sumerian desert

857
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,900
and flatulate.

858
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:17,740
Flatulate is an astronomical expression

859
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:19,920
meaning growing flat like a cod

860
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,500
across the solar eclipse.

861
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:22,260
Like a piece of...

862
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:22,740
Like a piece of...

863
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:22,740


864
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:22,740


865
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,240
Like a piece of cod.

866
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,140
Like a piece of cod.

867
00:43:24,180 --> 00:43:24,600
Like a cod.

868
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:25,980
Like a piece of cod.

869
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:26,680
Like the old...

870
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,860
There was the old Babylonian,

871
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:30,600
you know, beginning myth

872
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:31,460
that the whole earth

873
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:32,940
was not a bowl turned upside down

874
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,100
but a cod piece raised

875
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:35,220
by its experience

876
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,220
and that holes in it

877
00:43:37,220 --> 00:43:38,220
because of the bleach

878
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:39,020
used on the material

879
00:43:39,020 --> 00:43:40,000
would let through the light

880
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:40,980
from the living room

881
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,380
and the Babylonians

882
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:43,220
then thought of this

883
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,180
as god, basically.

884
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,000
Adventures in Cosmology.

885
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:48,900
Hello, dear friends.

886
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,420
I'm Louis P. Illuminato.

887
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:54,820
President of the United Snakes

888
00:43:54,820 --> 00:43:55,820
of a miracle.

889
00:43:56,660 --> 00:43:58,280
Let's talk about Cosmology

890
00:43:58,280 --> 00:43:59,940
and its future for you.

891
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,960
Cosmology is a budding young industry

892
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,320
in the United Snakes

893
00:44:04,320 --> 00:44:06,100
ever-expanding

894
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:07,900
faceplate

895
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:09,820
mechanized industry.

896
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,660
What's that?

897
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:14,480
Cosmology

898
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,020
holds great futures

899
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:17,920
for the youths of tomorrow.

900
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:20,340
Dear God,

901
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:22,360
if you are so smart,

902
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,120
let's see if you can read

903
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:25,340
what I am saying.

904
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,400
It's in my own code

905
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:28,840
and no one knows it.

906
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:30,860
Vittle, rooped,

907
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,080
clishks, nipsted,

908
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:35,460
clums, otfo.

909
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:37,760
If you can read it,

910
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:39,400
make it rain tomorrow

911
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:40,960
so I will know.

912
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:42,940
Your unknown friend,

913
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:44,480
Gabe.

914
00:44:45,520 --> 00:44:46,580
Dear Gabe,

915
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,960
this is Louis P. God,

916
00:44:50,340 --> 00:44:52,420
President of the United Snakes

917
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:52,740
of a miracle.

918
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,460
Let's talk about your question.

919
00:44:55,660 --> 00:44:56,480
But first,

920
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:58,780
how about this sound effect?

921
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,100
God, or Louis P. Illuminato,

922
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,020
knew that within the next few minutes

923
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:07,120
he would have to fight.

924
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:09,600
As he crossed the porch of the Royal Flush

925
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,380
ahead of the sheriff and two deputies,

926
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,060
he slipped his hand beneath his buckskin jacket

927
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,780
and bricked the anger of a knife.

928
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,620
He knew there would be no chance

929
00:45:17,620 --> 00:45:19,460
to draw the rifle from its scabbard

930
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,240
on the side of Scott.

931
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,540
He would have to depend entirely

932
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:22,720
on the rifle.

933
00:45:22,740 --> 00:45:23,280
He would have to depend entirely on the knife

934
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:25,020
in a fight against three men.

935
00:45:25,380 --> 00:45:27,520
Each of them was well armed.

936
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,560
Hey, hey, hey.

937
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,940
That poet's got a knife.

938
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:32,660
Watch out.

939
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,880
Hello, dear friends.

940
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,580
I'm Ernest P. Illuminato,

941
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,600
chief poet and president

942
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:40,660
of the United Snakes of a miracle.

943
00:45:40,680 --> 00:45:41,220
Hi, Ernie.

944
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,080
Hi, Peter.

945
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:42,800
Can I have your...

946
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:43,580
No, forget it.

947
00:45:43,580 --> 00:45:44,180
No, it's all right.

948
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,280
I wanted your autograph,

949
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,000
but I know you can't.

950
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,640
Oh, look, I'm just a plain guy.

951
00:45:47,640 --> 00:45:49,120
200 million people would ask for it.

952
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,260
Just because I'm God, Pete,

953
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:51,520
doesn't mean I'm not human.

954
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,600
I can dig it.

955
00:45:52,740 --> 00:45:53,780
God has to get up

956
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:55,620
and put on one pants at a time, right?

957
00:45:55,700 --> 00:45:57,260
One leg at a time through the universe.

958
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,760
God's just a guy like you and me.

959
00:45:59,020 --> 00:45:59,900
You know, you want to hear

960
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,700
the greatest and the latest

961
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:02,720
from God's laboratory?

962
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:03,380
What?

963
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:04,680
Where all the little elves are working?

964
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:05,040
Yeah.

965
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:05,920
Well, I'll tell you,

966
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:07,120
we got a plan going now

967
00:46:07,120 --> 00:46:08,340
in God's workshop.

968
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:09,900
There's a guy in there

969
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:10,560
who's got a plan

970
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:12,460
to kill all the paranoids.

971
00:46:12,460 --> 00:46:13,400
Oh, no, really?

972
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:14,720
Yeah, isn't that a great idea?

973
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:15,720
What about the horizontals?

974
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:16,480
Anything about them?

975
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:18,160
Nothing about them, no siree.

976
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:19,360
Let them lie, let them lie.

977
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:20,040
Let them ascend.

978
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:20,980
Well, that's beautiful.

979
00:46:20,980 --> 00:46:22,100
Let it go, dear friend.

980
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:22,720
Let it go.

981
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,700
Let it go.

982
00:46:23,740 --> 00:46:24,900
Oh, you got to let it go, dear friends.

983
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:26,260
Before we talk about your future,

984
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,460
we've got to talk about

985
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,220
your way of getting there

986
00:46:28,220 --> 00:46:29,380
when you're talking about transportation

987
00:46:29,380 --> 00:46:31,100
and that's God's language, friends.

988
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,580
That's where God steps in

989
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,480
to help you get there.

990
00:46:33,720 --> 00:46:37,280
Here's a beautiful 1964 Duster.

991
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,300
It's a beautiful cherry.

992
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:39,960
It'll get you all the way, friends.

993
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:41,340
$1,449.

994
00:46:41,640 --> 00:46:42,300
Isn't that right?

995
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,800
Louis P. Illuminata,

996
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,000
President of the United States.

997
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,160
This is your captain speaking.

998
00:46:47,480 --> 00:46:47,760
Captain.

999
00:46:47,840 --> 00:46:51,780
We are approximately 14 feet above Cairo

1000
00:46:51,780 --> 00:46:52,620
at this moment.

1001
00:46:52,740 --> 00:46:53,560
14 feet?

1002
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,100
Wait a minute.

1003
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:59,820
Captain, this is Louis P. Illuminata,

1004
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,520
President of the world and God.

1005
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:03,340
Am I talking to God now?

1006
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,380
Yes, this is it, Dave.

1007
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,520
I wish I could see you, God,

1008
00:47:07,560 --> 00:47:08,500
at a time like this.

1009
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:10,320
Well, why don't you point the plane up

1010
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:11,660
a little bit, Ed?

1011
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:13,140
Drive out sleep.

1012
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:15,960
The books and pamphlets sold

1013
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:17,160
by the Subgenius Foundation

1014
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,460
can literally be used to make a wish.

1015
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:22,580
Not just one wish either,

1016
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,740
but as many wishes as you like.

1017
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,260
Simply purchase said items,

1018
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,340
hold them in your hands,

1019
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:30,660
and make a wish.

1020
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:33,460
Results vary.

1021
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:39,460
If you've ever tried to dig the empty part

1022
00:47:39,460 --> 00:47:40,340
out of a hole,

1023
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:43,520
you know what it's like to take the rules

1024
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:46,020
literally and not seriously.

1025
00:47:48,460 --> 00:47:51,340
If you've ever felt low and asked,

1026
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,460
what's the point,

1027
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,100
like I was this morning,

1028
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:58,540
that must mean that among all the possible points

1029
00:47:58,540 --> 00:47:59,420
there could be,

1030
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:00,920
one of them is this.

1031
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,140
Your point is to feel low.

1032
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,720
If that's objectionable to you, good.

1033
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:09,800
That must mean you have a better point in mind.

1034
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:11,220
In the future,

1035
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,040
a future,

1036
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,640
you've just talked yourself into something interesting.

1037
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,700
Find where that'll take you next.

1038
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:20,940
No hurry.

1039
00:48:21,300 --> 00:48:24,520
It took all your life to get to merely now.

1040
00:48:27,020 --> 00:48:27,520
Yes.

1041
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:29,860
When is there going to be another Devival?

1042
00:48:30,440 --> 00:48:32,440
Ah, when is there going to be another Devival?

1043
00:48:33,020 --> 00:48:34,840
Hopefully around November 14th.

1044
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:36,520
Around November 14th.

1045
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:38,020
Keep watching the area.

1046
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:38,920
What did you say?

1047
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:39,720
And the location?

1048
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,480
What would the location be?

1049
00:48:41,620 --> 00:48:43,320
Let's look through the mists of time

1050
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:46,360
and see what the location of the Devival is.

1051
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:48,880
Could it be the beach land?

1052
00:48:48,880 --> 00:48:50,020
Yeah, I had fond memories.

1053
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,680
Actually, the first Devival I ever went to.

1054
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,220
The beach land ballroom.

1055
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:54,360
Was it the beach land tavern?

1056
00:48:54,420 --> 00:48:56,200
The beach land tavern,

1057
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:58,580
the little old tavern on the beach.

1058
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:00,320
Wonderful. Well, good to know.

1059
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:01,920
All right, deaths before dishonors,

1060
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,000
drugs before lunch. Later.

1061
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,080
I do. That's right.

1062
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,160
Enjoy a work-free drug place.

1063
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:08,260
Yeah, actually, it's kind of funny.

1064
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:10,140
There, we actually transmitted some information,

1065
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:11,500
and it feels kind of good, you know?

1066
00:49:11,540 --> 00:49:11,780
It does feel good.

1067
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,800
I feel a little bit cleaner now.

1068
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:13,580
It feels really good.

1069
00:49:13,660 --> 00:49:15,380
The first Devival I ever went to, actually,

1070
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,020
was at the Euclid Tavern,

1071
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,380
and I had a pretty,

1072
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,840
pretty good night, actually.

1073
00:49:19,860 --> 00:49:21,140
I got picked up that night.

1074
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:23,400
Well, you know, Euclid looked on Beauty Bear.

1075
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:26,120
What did you get picked up for?

1076
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,220
Not picked up for, picked up by...

1077
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,980
He was picked up for indolence, intransigence,

1078
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:33,760
and inefficiency.

1079
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,360
It was kind of crazy, actually.

1080
00:49:37,820 --> 00:49:39,300
I never expected...

1081
00:49:39,900 --> 00:49:41,060
You see, it really works, folks.

1082
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:41,820
...that I'll promise to join our church,

1083
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:42,620
and you will get laid.

1084
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:43,560
It really does happen.

1085
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:44,260
I never expected that to be true.

1086
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:46,600
We offer benefits...

1087
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:46,660
And it wasn't true.

1088
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,120
...that no other religion can provide.

1089
00:49:49,540 --> 00:49:51,140
I can show you too many details.

1090
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:51,840
I can show you the protect goddesses.

1091
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:53,340
You have read the literature.

1092
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,640
Oh, yes, and the pleasure saucers,

1093
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,640
and you do follow the controversy.

1094
00:49:58,520 --> 00:49:59,640
Y'all boys are wild.

1095
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:00,800
I've been listening in.

1096
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,960
You guys, you guys are special.

1097
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:03,680
Thank you.

1098
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,080
Wow.

1099
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,220
We're special.

1100
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,900
Yes, they call me Special Ed.

1101
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:07,980


1102
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:08,380
Extra and Special Ed.

1103
00:50:08,580 --> 00:50:09,660
We're special.

1104
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:11,600
Wow.

1105
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,060
That made my night,

1106
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:14,220
to have a total stranger say

1107
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:15,200
that we're special, actually.

1108
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:15,980
Well, we are.

1109
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:17,560
We're each and every one of us.

1110
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:18,180
I wish we could.

1111
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:18,360


1112
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:18,360


1113
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:18,360


1114
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:18,360


1115
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:18,360


1116
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:18,360


1117
00:50:18,360 --> 00:50:18,940
Big ones.

1118
00:50:18,940 --> 00:50:19,000
Oh, you should be.

1119
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,260
I'm telling you, we're really special.

1120
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,320
I don't think you need to be here.

1121
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:23,480
I think y'all know already.

1122
00:50:24,540 --> 00:50:26,140
I think y'all know you're special.

1123
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:28,120
Well, just don't lose your specialness

1124
00:50:28,120 --> 00:50:29,940
on this special evening.

1125
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,420
We are all special.

1126
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:35,680
Oh, yeah.

1127
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:36,260
We are special.

1128
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:37,720
I'll have the special, too.

1129
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:38,920
I ordered the special.

1130
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:41,400
You ordered the special today, too?

1131
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:42,720
I ordered the special, yes.

1132
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,860
I'm still waiting.

1133
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:46,300
Sorry.

1134
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,300


1135
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:46,680
We are all special.

1136
00:50:46,680 --> 00:50:46,960
Sorry, Matt.

1137
00:50:47,080 --> 00:50:48,260
A total jock of the background.

1138
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:48,340


1139
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:48,340


1140
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:48,340


1141
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:48,340


1142
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:48,340


1143
00:50:48,340 --> 00:50:51,940
We are all each one part of this whole universe.

1144
00:50:52,080 --> 00:50:52,800
We'll have two more specials.

1145
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,800
And the universe will not be the same.

1146
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,660
Just concentrate on the pure, bright, white light of imbecility.

1147
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:04,760
Actually, I maintain that the birth of any person diminishes the value of all other persons.

1148
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:06,060
Particularly the lower birth.

1149
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:08,080
Always try to get the upper birth.

1150
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,300
Because, you know, it's just a matter of supply and demand.

1151
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,660
Or the afterbirth.

1152
00:51:11,840 --> 00:51:16,260
We had that special show on Ant-Man's birthmarks in Vivid Technica.

1153
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,440
Okay, 7 billion people on Earth.

1154
00:51:18,560 --> 00:51:21,880
How much is that per person?

1155
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,840
29.95.

1156
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:24,320
I don't know.

1157
00:51:24,340 --> 00:51:27,680
What is the global per capita income on average?

1158
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,000
That's something I never see.

1159
00:51:29,140 --> 00:51:31,180
Like, you see it for countries.

1160
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:32,180
But I wonder what it is globally.

1161
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:35,760
And can that even be a measure of the...

1162
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,280
Well, I don't know.

1163
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,720
Basically, it's just a supply and demand issue.

1164
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:38,440
Human life...

1165
00:51:38,440 --> 00:51:40,140
Isn't that what we said last night?

1166
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:41,660
Think globularly.

1167
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:42,460
Act loco.

1168
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:43,860
Oh, yes.

1169
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:45,880
I think the...

1170
00:51:46,260 --> 00:51:47,780
Supply of human life...

1171
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:48,820
The demand.

1172
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:49,720
I'm sorry, cut.

1173
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:50,120
Speak up.

1174
00:51:50,720 --> 00:51:53,640
What if you're a person who's special and it's really a demand for you?

1175
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:54,560
Oh, man.

1176
00:51:54,840 --> 00:51:55,600
That's something...

1177
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,640
You know, some people are not that special.

1178
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,240
Yeah.

1179
00:51:58,240 --> 00:51:59,160
And there ain't no demand for them.

1180
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,560
But if you're special, you gotta be more valuable.

1181
00:52:02,780 --> 00:52:03,900
Because it's a demand for you.

1182
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:10,540
Well, then you have to spread the specialness around into every crack and crevice and crevice.

1183
00:52:10,540 --> 00:52:11,700
Every crack and crevice.

1184
00:52:12,860 --> 00:52:14,460
Buttered up with specialness.

1185
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,260
Oh, yeah.

1186
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:15,840
The supply of life...

1187
00:52:16,260 --> 00:52:17,000
It's always the demand.

1188
00:52:17,220 --> 00:52:23,320
Too many people are following the story of Onan and not letting their seeds spill.

1189
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:24,220
Yeah, everybody knows that...

1190
00:52:24,220 --> 00:52:25,220
Because they don't want to piss off God.

1191
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:26,260
Pulling out does not work.

1192
00:52:26,260 --> 00:52:30,120
Because, you know, God laid the smackdown on Onan after he pulled out.

1193
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:30,980
You know, all he's doing is...

1194
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:32,780
50 million pregnant Catholic teenagers can't be wrong.

1195
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:33,680
He's practicing...

1196
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,820
Unless they're talking about pulling out.

1197
00:52:35,020 --> 00:52:39,360
He's practicing contraception, not self-abuse.

1198
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:44,780
So, Onan is tarred with the brush right from the start.

1199
00:52:45,540 --> 00:52:46,060
Unfairly.

1200
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,860
Uncharged with a crime he did not commit.

1201
00:52:48,940 --> 00:52:52,740
Although there was reason for God to be quite angry with him.

1202
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:59,220
And to hurl a thunderbolt which reduced him to a tiny grease spot in the margins of the Bible.

1203
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:02,640
God f***s us all in the end.

1204
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:03,940
There we go.

1205
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,700
Those seven magically malign words.

1206
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:09,100
But that's what they say.

1207
00:53:09,300 --> 00:53:10,300
It hurts to...

1208
00:53:10,300 --> 00:53:14,380
It is painful to come into this world and painful to leave it.

1209
00:53:15,020 --> 00:53:15,960
And in a...

1210
00:53:15,960 --> 00:53:19,520
Blaze of irritable ouchness, we live our lives.

1211
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:20,960
Hmm, that's true.

1212
00:53:22,580 --> 00:53:23,840
Unless you're dying of sleep.

1213
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:28,840
Well, we can't sleep now, but we can answer your questions if you want to call in.

1214
00:53:28,940 --> 00:53:32,880
And we'll do our best to tell you the answers to the things that are troubling you.

1215
00:53:32,980 --> 00:53:34,380
We've got a panel of experts up here.

1216
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:35,800
Any question...

1217
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:37,400
A church service...

1218
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:38,900
Is possible.

1219
00:53:39,060 --> 00:53:40,580
There is no question off-limits.

1220
00:53:41,020 --> 00:53:43,820
Provided by this radio station and the Church of the Subgenius.

1221
00:53:45,960 --> 00:53:47,560
Just think, any question.

1222
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:52,120
For example, you might want to know how much the earth weighs or something like that.

1223
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,420
So just call in and we'll tell you.

1224
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,280
I think we're going to take another call here.

1225
00:53:58,480 --> 00:53:59,820
I'll show you my bacon.

1226
00:54:00,240 --> 00:54:01,480
I have a question.

1227
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:02,920
Ask your question.

1228
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,680
How much does Bob weigh?

1229
00:54:05,460 --> 00:54:07,640
Ooh, how much does Bob weigh?

1230
00:54:08,100 --> 00:54:10,980
There's a question for you, Dr. Howell.

1231
00:54:12,440 --> 00:54:15,800
Can Bob lift... make himself so fat?

1232
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,240
That he cannot lift himself?

1233
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,680
I think that... I'm going to guess before you answer.

1234
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:20,780
Well, all right. You're welcome to do that.

1235
00:54:20,780 --> 00:54:21,580
Guess Bob's weight.

1236
00:54:22,040 --> 00:54:28,680
My guess is that Bob travels at the speed of light and therefore his mass is infinite.

1237
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,220
Well, um, if Bob were to do that, yes, but we're talking about Bob at rest.

1238
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:36,700
Oh, look, the caller hung up.

1239
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:40,600
I was going to say 265 pounds, too.

1240
00:54:40,860 --> 00:54:43,480
Well, that's just one of those mysteries.

1241
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:44,340
Who's still with us?

1242
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:45,580
I'm here.

1243
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,600
I'm having a signal interruption, a little bit of difficulty.

1244
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:55,900
You see, part of Bob's makeup is heavy matter from extrasolar planets,

1245
00:54:56,800 --> 00:55:02,980
which, like deuterium, is quite compressed, like the heart of a neutron star.

1246
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,320
But a far more significant puzzle in the annals of the subgenius

1247
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,820
is the search for the missing artifact, the holy grail of the Church of the Soul Genius,

1248
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,000
the scissors of sight.

1249
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,940
What we need is to locate...

1250
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:17,600
Locate the famous scissors of sight.

1251
00:55:17,860 --> 00:55:23,660
And we are stumped, since the true scissors have been lost to mutant kind for many centuries.

1252
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:27,540
In a private letter, Reverend Ivan Stang, I will now quote him, said,

1253
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:30,400
No man today has those scissors.

1254
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:36,580
He also said that the scissors were most likely created from the remains of a huge Atlantean crystal,

1255
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:44,820
the misuse and subsequent explosion which caused that continent to sink with a watery splash beneath the waves.

1256
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:51,880
As the Atlanteans were major contributors to the gene pool that eventually produced the subgenius race,

1257
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:56,280
it does seem plausible that rather than trying to rebuild the lost empire,

1258
00:55:56,560 --> 00:56:00,360
the remaining Atlanteans would instead build a few power icons,

1259
00:56:01,260 --> 00:56:04,620
before tragically diluting their seed, like Onan,

1260
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:10,280
by crossbreeding with ancient pink human slave tribes they themselves had helped to create.

1261
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:14,640
It is from this distant epoch, 80 to 79 million BC,

1262
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:15,940
that the scissors and man-eating tools of the past have been used to create the power icons.

1263
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:20,360
And many other powerful but little-known sur-dur-per-saves originate.

1264
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,420
I hope you have been satisfied by this answer to your question.

1265
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:29,860
Correlation is not causality, but coincidence is conspiracy.

1266
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,620
What's the difference?

1267
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:34,940
Whether it brings you slack or takes away your slack.

1268
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:40,020
That's what it says here in the Dobstown Mirror.

1269
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,700
And I better check off the ones that I read.

1270
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,960
Because I'm getting old.

1271
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:49,580
I can't remember what all I've said and what I haven't said.

1272

This pen doesn't work for hooey.

It works about as well as my fingers.

1274
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,540
Okay, all right, okay.

00:58:15,120 --> 00:58:16,580
Give me back my fun thing.

1294
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:20,580
Oh, aye aye aye aye.

1295
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:21,700
Oh, ah.

Oh.

Give me back my fun thing.

1299

Give me back my fun thing.

1300
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:36,500
Oh, yes dear friends.

That was the swinging love corpses.

1302

Closing the show out there.

1303
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,320
Give me back my fun thing.

1304
00:58:43,700 --> 00:58:58,960
I got my fun thing back. That was my old buddy, Dr. Philo Drummond on vocals with his brother and cousin also in the band, the Swingin' Love Corpses. Man, that was a great band.

1305
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:18,300
And we're still around. And so I can put the show to bed and put myself to bed. I'm ready for bed. Thank you and nighty night.
