1
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:13,320
It is later than you think.

2
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,640
From Hollywood.

3
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:54,600
From Hollywood.

4
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,720
Club, if I had not read The Origin of the Species by Darwin,

5
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,280
I could not bear to be descended from an ape.

6
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:00,960
Certainly I understand.

7
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,180
Too ghastly to bear you.

8
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,500
And this is B.S. New York.

9
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,300
10 p.m. B.S. time.

10
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,200
America runs on B.S. time.

11
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:23,080
Who knows what evil lurks in the evil hearts of evil men?

12
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,120
Yes, master.

13
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,060
You're to do nothing.

14
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,720
Let your mind kill.

15
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:35,720
Kill.

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:36,920
Kill.

17
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:37,820
Kill.

18
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:38,880
Kill.

19
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:39,680
Kill.

20
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,540
Kill.

21
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,120
Kill.

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:41,700


23
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,720
Kill.

24
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:42,880
Kill.

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:44,100
Kill.

26
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,460
Is there anything wrong in that, Commissioner?

27
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,940
No, no, I like death.

28
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,520
The bomb will start a chain reaction in the water.

29
00:01:55,440 --> 00:02:00,600
Converting it all to gas and letting all the ships on all the oceans drop down to the bottom.

30
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:05,200
It will blow out the bottom of the sea and let all the water run down the hole.

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,240
It will destroy gravity.

32
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,920
I am an atomic playboy, exploding these bombs to satisfy my personal whim.

33
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,260
He's in there.

34
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:32,420
Well, would you tell him he's won 47 million dollars?

35
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,320
Right.

36
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:33,900
Well...

37
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,960
47 million.

38
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,860
I'll get him.

39
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:50,040
I think that cartoonists and editors have a responsibility to be irresponsible.

40
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:54,180
Whenever I'm drawing a Catholic,

41
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:58,420
I try and draw Jesus Christ in a position to make pedophilia.

42
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,640
Peace be upon him.

43
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:03,740
Well, but they were using violent violence.

44
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,920
That's valid.

45
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,100
Islam is hateful.

46
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,980
Islam is violent.

47
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,160
Islam is burning people.

48
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:10,760
That's fine.

49
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,860
I enjoy that.

50
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,080
The sheer grotesque violence, of course, we all agree with that.

51
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:18,160
So to wrong is make her right.

52
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,300
Aha!

53
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:20,620
Aha!

54
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:22,760
Aha!

55
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,360
Aha!

56
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,960
Well, bless my soul, what's wrong with me?

57
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,780
I took some crank and some LSD.

58
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:37,880
I drank poor wine from a big brown jug.

59
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:38,940
I'm on drugs.

60
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,040
I'm all fucked up.

61
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,100
Hey, hey, hey.

62
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,980
Well, my hands are shaky and my knees are weak.

63
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,880
The smack I shot is about to peak.

64
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:55,880
I think I need to have my stomach pumped.

65
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,720
I'm on drugs.

66
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,860
I'm all fucked up.

67
00:03:59,040 --> 00:03:59,580
Mm-hmm.

68
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,360
Mm-hmm.

69
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,860
Hey, hey, hey.

70
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:07,640
Well, please don't ask me what I hear and see.

71
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,600
Because there's a big brown sausage and it's talking to me.

72
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,580
Well, I sweat and I think if I forget to breathe.

73
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,620
My heart will stop and all my fans will grieve.

74
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,520
Well, it took 12 pills so I could come on down.

75
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:22,480
I even drank a six-pack of Royal Crown.

76
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,420
And then I ate a Reese's peanut butter cup.

77
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,480
I took drugs.

78
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,420
I'm all fucked up.

79
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,200
Mm-hmm.

80
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,060
Mm-hmm.

81
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:33,500
Hey, hey, hey.

82
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,280
Well, my tongue gets swollen and my eyes bug out.

83
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,100
I don't even know what the hell I'm talking about.

84
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,140
There's only one cure that'll ease my mind.

85
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:46,100
I'm gonna take a big crap on that epocillinamine.

86
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:49,040
Well, the touch of my butt and what a chill I got.

87
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:52,000
My heart seized up from an old blood clot.

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Who'd ever have thought this is where I dropped my took drugs?

89
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,560
Oh.

90
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,740
Uh-uh.

91
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,720
Uh-huh.

92
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,260
Oh.

93
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:02,360
Oh.

94
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,540
I'm all fucked up.

95
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,460
All fucked up.

96
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,380
Dear friends, by...

97
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,020
Great Reverend Phineas Narco.

98
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:30,280
And you can download entire hour-long shows full of mixes and cut-ups by him

99
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:36,860
from this website, nationalcynical.com.

100
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:41,760
We've been hearing a bunch of random stimpy cut-ups

101
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,500
thanks to Reverend New Monet who posted those.

102
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:51,140
And we've heard some Norrell Preff, but mostly Fernanda Nande-Lemur.

103
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:51,880
Friends?

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,740
This is Hour of Slack number 1036.

105
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:04,120
But now, let's have some of WCSB's radio synesthesia from Cleveland

106
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:11,400
from February 12th after the fuss over the Danish cartoons about Muhammad.

107
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,480
You know, it's funny.

108
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,040
You were talking about the cartoons, the Muslim cartoons getting people so upset.

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:19,180
Right.

110
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:21,680
And nobody sent me any cartoons of Jesus.

111
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,380
Or Bob, for that matter.

112
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,320
Well, I'm sorry about that.

113
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:27,700
There certainly are plenty of them out there.

114
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,760
Well, let me...

115
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:32,000
See, I'm trying to make sure that the Postal Service has some business.

116
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:36,200
You know, I'm trying to make sure that Hughes gets to keep his job, you know,

117
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:40,580
by making people patronize the Postal Service and send us these things in the mail.

118
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:50,040
To WCSB, Rhodes Tower, 956-2121 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44115.

119
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:50,780
Attention.

120
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,760
Yeah, Box 20.

121
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,960
Box 70, I guess.

122
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,300
What was that address again?

123
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:05,900
That was WCSB, Rhodes Tower, 956-2121 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44115.

124
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,660
And actually, another important number that people need to know is 217.

125
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:13,760
I'm going to add a caller here, actually.

126
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,380
Hello, you're on the air.

127
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,380
Hello.

128
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,540
I think I just missed what the...

129
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,480
Is Reverend Ivan Strang's been on there?

130
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:20,780
Has he?

131
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,920
This is the man who...

132
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:27,520
Who did those cartoons about me, and I want his head brought to me on a silver platter.

133
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,320
Well, I think we've already got the head prepared here.

134
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:30,640
It's been mummified.

135
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:31,700
On a nest of boogers.

136
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:37,040
It's been mummified along the rituals and the rites and the symbology used for all the ancient ones

137
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:42,320
who've had their heads preserved and who are prayed to and who are used for oracles.

138
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,160
I've been making my living mocking religions.

139
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,160
How come nobody's killed me yet?

140
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,960
You know, if you like, I can issue a fox law against you.

141
00:07:50,460 --> 00:07:51,320
If you like.

142
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:51,800
What?

143
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,020
I can issue a fatwa against you if you like.

144
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,040
Maybe the problem is that you haven't been offensive enough...

145
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,540
Maybe the problem is that you haven't been offensive enough to Islam.

146
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,880
Because really, out in the Muslim world, you know, I mean, people take those things much more seriously.

147
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,520
Well, they were never in our faith.

148
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:13,900
Maybe you need to, you know, draw some cartoons of Bob penetrating Mohammed from behind, perhaps.

149
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,760
It's opposite, Dr. Strang.

150
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:21,160
His religion, the religion, is the opposite of Islam or even fundamentalist.

151
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,440
Many...

152
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,880
Many brands of Christianity which say, thou shall not have graven images.

153
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,280
And this is why they get offended when they see crucifixes, too.

154
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:33,120
You can't have a prophet portrayed in any way that's...

155
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,740
You can't have a prophet portrayed.

156
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:39,800
Now, Strang, on the other hand, wants you to put, like, objects in the anus of Bob, you know, and...

157
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:41,640
Yeah, we want him painted...

158
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:42,860
By eight canvases and stuff.

159
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:43,960
Yeah, layer upon layer.

160
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:45,500
Paint him every day.

161
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:47,980
Paint that idol.

162
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,420
And especially in verbiage, you know, the more insulting you are to the man...

163
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,120
Disrespect the prophet as much as possible.

164
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:54,960
He's not a prophet.

165
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:55,440
He's a freak.

166
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,780
He's not even a real freaking avatar.

167
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,340
He's a money-lusting, you know, one of those guys with a thing hanging out of his nose...

168
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:01,800
You're talking about Bob?

169
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,600
...that's not really part of his brain.

170
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,180
Yeah.

171
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,300
Now, I can see why Mohammed would not want his...

172
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,260
Might not want his picture taken or...

173
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,860
He was trying to protect his privacy.

174
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:10,780
I mean...

175
00:09:10,780 --> 00:09:16,620
Well, and also, you know, when it's left to your imagination, then it's what you most want.

176
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:17,260
You know, when you can't really see Big Brother...

177
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:18,560
When it's left to your imagination...

178
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,100
You can't really see Big Brother.

179
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:21,380
You can't really see Big Brother.

180
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:21,380


181
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:21,420


182
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:22,040
...what Big Brother looks like.

183
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:24,740
Then he really looks like Big Brother.

184
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,500
Honestly, when I was a kid, I couldn't...

185
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,140
You know, it was left to the imagination, like, what Santa Claus really looks like.

186
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,360
You never actually see him.

187
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:31,480
Oh, yeah.

188
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:31,920
What?

189
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,080
And I just assumed he was like...

190
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,900
Well, you know, you see the fake mall Santa, of course.

191
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:38,420
But, you know, I was a little trying to think of, like, what the real one actually looked like.

192
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,380
And I couldn't picture it.

193
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,560
It was like a cartoon or something.

194
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,900
Or the bunny.

195
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,080
The bunny?

196
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:47,260
You're talking about something that really struck me very deeply tonight.

197
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:50,600
I think they embed psychosubliminal...

198
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:55,980
embeds of squares of some kind in people's heads with Frosty the Snowman,

199
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:59,980
who scared the living bedobs out of me as a young girth.

200
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,860
I was very small and trapped in a small room

201
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:05,660
and forced to watch these public service announcements about,

202
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:10,640
remember, if the snow is above your neck, you're probably not breathing anymore and all this stuff.

203
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,540
How's the weather out there?

204
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:14,160
It's...

205
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,040
It's delightful.

206
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,520
Do you still breathe?

207
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:20,500
I just came back from a little skating romp around to the neighborhood store,

208
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,280
I skated down to the neighborhood store,

209
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:28,420
and then I cross-country skied to a massage parlor and had my doodad erected.

210
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:35,900
You know, my profit friends tell me that as soon as we have a really big cold snap in this country,

211
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:39,680
all the power goes down and it won't be able to come back,

212
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,280
and it'll be a downhill slide from there.

213
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:44,980
That will signal the end of America as we know it.

214
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:47,500
Or at least up in this part of the country.

215
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,240
Well, it doesn't take a profit to figure that out.

216
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:50,560
I mean...

217
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,980
I mean, if you really dramatically change the weather enough,

218
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:55,900
that really is going to dramatically change everything else.

219
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:58,240
Well, the ice age is coming back anyway.

220
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,700
We're going to have glaciers here.

221
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:03,100
I don't know.

222
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,440
There's no way to stop that.

223
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,140
We may have contiguous glaciers and palm trees in a delightful setting we'll call the Frozen Oasis.

224
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:13,880
At the same time, though, the polar ice caps are melting at the same time, though.

225
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:17,140
And they're regenerating in Tierra del Fuego.

226
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:17,740
Oh, sure.

227
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,800
We may have Waterworld first.

228
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:20,580
I'm talking about...

229
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:21,420
Not on the long range.

230
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:24,000
We're on a slope slide back into, you know...

231
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,480
You're talking like 10, 20, 30,000 years from now.

232
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,060
Everybody conjectures so fondly about tribalism once this all occurs.

233
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:33,240
Has it occurred to anybody yet?

234
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:40,760
We might not be any survivors of any kind and that the exes or any of their friends or even their distributors...

235
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,580
Conjectured?

236
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,440
Hell, that's given.

237
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:43,720
Unfortunately.

238
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:44,380
That's a known.

239
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:47,000
On a platter like a pile of dung, I think.

240
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,140
Yeah, no, that's...

241
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,460
You better have that saucer.

242
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,500
Take it in your pocket.

243
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,320
You're either on the saucers or you're off the saucers.

244
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:57,000
Or you'll be wearing one of those dog collars that hurts.

245
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,200
That's right.

246
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:03,600
You better wear that collar, that alien collar around your neck that keeps you thinking right.

247
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:11,880
Now, is it true that they expect to make those radio devices that everybody's going to have on the soles of their feet if you take them off?

248
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,680
They don't have to yet because they're listening right now.

249
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,120
Listen to them listening.

250
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:17,920
You can hear them.

251
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:20,560
I know there are people listening to us right now as we speak.

252
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:23,080
Even especially the ones in their cars.

253
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:23,760
Oh, yes.

254
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,620
My heart goes out to you, listener, in the car right now.

255
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,020
Especially...

256
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:28,420
My heart goes out.

257
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,100
Do you feel it?

258
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:37,880
If Stang only had a heart, it would probably get all the way out of the studio and down to maybe around Superior.

259
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,080
My heart's actually fine.

260
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:42,380
It's my soul that is in hock.

261
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,680
Yeah, and we know there's one person listening through the FUBAR 2000 client, which I've never heard of.

262
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,560
Well, I could do that.

263
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,020
It's called FUBAR.

264
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,820
It's called a monitoring device.

265
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:52,760
That could be Bob.

266
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,540
You know who you are.

267
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:53,980
You're listening.

268
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:56,480
That could be J.R. Bob Dobson.

269
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:56,760
It could be.

270
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,240
So we're going to...

271
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,540
Through the FUBAR.

272
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:18,540
FUBAR.

273
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,060
Superstar.

274
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:33,300
You see.

275
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,860
Because I'm a well-groomed model citizen.

276
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,600
I said I'm a well-liked model citizen.

277
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:50,120
And I never parked my car in a handicapped space.

278
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:52,520
I take my chances with a lot of enclosed cliches

279
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,920
I keep an eye on my neighbors and so-called friends

280
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:57,420
Cause I'm always on alert, yes, I'm always on edge

281
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,600
I buy insurance just in case it may rain someday

282
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,140
And I put everything I can in a 401k

283
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,460
Work through war, kill some souls as an innocent man

284
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,980
I follow orders and I follow the latest trends

285
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:10,240
Cause I'm a well-trained model citizen

286
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,140
I said I'm a self-made model citizen

287
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,740
I'm just that kind of guy

288
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,640
We'll be right back.

289
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:26,960
We'll be right back.

290
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:46,300
We'll be right back.

291
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:19,080
And now, the news.

292
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:45,880
Yes?

293
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:53,180
Since my sabbatical in the Amazon, my head's been inhabited by a friendly parasite named Choo-Choo Nong-Nong Head.

294
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,320
Well, isn't that a coinkydink?

295
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,800
Come and get it!

296
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:03,460
Uh-oh. An unexpected complication has arisen in the form of a rival lummox, our friend the Booger Red.

297
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:08,760
Hey, Stimpy. I have a little confession to make.

298
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,060
And I...

299
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,380
While you're asleep...

300
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,960
I polished my boots.

301
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:15,900
To your tongue!

302
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,320
That's okay, Ren. I was really asleep.

303
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,460
What? Are you crazy?

304
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:28,240
He ripes, man!

305
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,480
Cripes! I'll get right on it. Leave everything to me.

306
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,240
That's right. Eat him up good.

307
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,660
Yeah!

308
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:45,020
Ladies and gentlemen, I, Cornus Cranborn!

309
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:48,860
And I, Cornus Cranborn!

310
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:49,680
And I, Cornus Cranborn!

311
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:50,540
And I, Cornus Cranborn!

312
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:50,560
And I, Cornus Cranborn!

313
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:50,560


314
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:50,560


315
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:50,560


316
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:50,560


317
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:50,560


318
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:56,420
Our guests right now are the Reverend Ivan Stang and the right, honorable, lonesome cowboy Dave.

319
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,380
We're just shooting the breeze up here.

320
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:58,720
Two ones.

321
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,040
Yeah, I have no mouth for you from the vest.

322
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:02,100
If you want to get in on this.

323
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:08,300
You know, I've been making fun of sacred cows for a living.

324
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,920
They make the best hamburger, don't they?

325
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,600
What a ridiculous sight to live in.

326
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,160
Sacred cows make the best hamburger.

327
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,220
And in this country...

328
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,380
In this country, no, not the Christians.

329
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,940
The most they've ever done is kind of threaten to not pray for us.

330
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:23,780
Or threaten to pray.

331
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,020
Or threaten to...

332
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,960
The white supremacists have actually threatened to kill us, I'll say that.

333
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,400
You know what, I've heard...

334
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,300
Thanks be for that.

335
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:36,600
Yeah, but the, you're right, we never picked on the Muslim community much,

336
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,920
partly because we were simply kind of ignorant.

337
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:41,180
Yes, and you're...

338
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:41,980
I'll admit, you know.

339
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:44,260
Yeah, I would advise you to come up with something.

340
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,880
You know, you could come up with something really offensive and send it to the Grand Ayatollah of Iran.

341
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:51,940
Well, actually, I believe that some of the pictures that you described,

342
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,620
the offensive pictures you described, exist right now somewhere on sub-site.

343
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:02,460
I will eventually be able to tell where they are, because I have to dig through all that stuff.

344
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,680
You've already mentioned hand grenade-laden Jesus, have you not?

345
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,280
Yeah.

346
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:07,220
As an icon.

347
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:13,740
Dr. Legem has done artwork on there that's offensive enough to kill somebody over.

348
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:20,960
I don't see why Pat Roberts has issued a fatwa on your small head.

349
00:19:21,680 --> 00:19:24,720
Right, he put a fatwa on the president of Venezuela.

350
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:26,160
And numerous other people.

351
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:27,800
He thinks God should strike them dead.

352
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,460
So why doesn't God strike you dead?

353
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:32,320
Especially like Ariel Sharon, who, he's like a...

354
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,260
He's like a...

355
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:34,900
By the way, Colin, you're on the air.

356
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:35,360
Welcome.

357
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,220
Yes, you know, Ariel Sharon, he's got two feet of large intestine missing.

358
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,380
Is that Ragnar?

359
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,400
That is Ragnar.

360
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:43,720
And they're reselling it.

361
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:44,740
Two on the black market.

362
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,280
Think of all the money they're going to make off Ariel Sharon's left intestine.

363
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,720
They want to make some chitlins out of them.

364
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:55,580
If anybody is listening who can get that stuff, I've got a little bit of the McKenna brain.

365
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,240
Ooh, they saved McKenna's brain.

366
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,660
You can get pretty high off McKenna's brain.

367
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:01,020
A little bit.

368
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:03,620
And as far as I know, it's just about the last in the world.

369
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,400
Man, put that in your pipe.

370
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,880
I'm looking for some of that colon.

371
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:07,360
Not for me.

372
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:08,240
Not for me.

373
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:08,860
I'm nothing...

374
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:09,340
Sure.

375
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:13,420
You know, nothing weird about old Reverend Stang, they always say.

376
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,300
All we need is a pair of eyeballs and a couple of feet.

377
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,260
You've got tons of weird things in filimule bags around your house.

378
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:22,000
Just little members of different body parts of saints and sadhus and prophets and bandoliers.

379
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:26,420
I've got a couple of Bob's teeth in a shrine in the Bob Museum.

380
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,440
Oh, yeah, that's right.

381
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,540
I'm surprised you haven't seen that.

382
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:33,500
They're from Puzzling Evidence, aren't they?

383
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:37,480
No, no, those are the Puzzling Evidence teeth, and someone bought those at X Day.

384
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:39,920
But, no, I have a couple of Bob's teeth.

385
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,080
Oh, that's right.

386
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,860
When he was a baby.

387
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:48,320
Not his adult teeth, but little tiny teeth that were passed down in his family.

388
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:54,620
He had swallowed these teeth, so they were literally passed down out of him when he was a child.

389
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:54,940
Wow.

390
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:58,700
And saved and kept in this encrusted container.

391
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,300
But they came out looking better.

392
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,100
That was the freaky thing.

393
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,320
They came out looking better.

394
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:10,620
Well, unlike Ariel Sharon, Bob's intestine is like a little factory, an olfactory,

395
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:12,480
that smells out these different little things.

396
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:13,460
It destroys them.

397
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,640
Like little nano-Bobs.

398
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,840
It converts them into slack.

399
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:24,720
He sucks your soul through that tube, and after you've been, so to speak, digested,

400
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:33,020
you're, so to speak, excreted as pure love and slack that radiates out from the Dobbs head of J.R. Bob Dobbs,

401
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:38,540
that pipe-smoking mystic salesman with that seemingly insane grin.

402
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,960
Not unlike that of a skull, some have said.

403
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:43,200
Yeah.

404
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:50,640
Indeed, it does have a very necro-flavor to it, a very, very macabre, and let's say it puts it on the thanatos side.

405
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:56,540
Like it knows something you don't know, and you better be damn glad you don't know it yet, but you're going to find out.

406
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,600
If you have the right glands.

407
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:57,960
Like everybody does.

408
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,760
If you have the right glands to make it through the surgery, sure, of course.

409
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:08,300
You know, some people are not gifted with the alien vertebrae as the adepted masters can be.

410
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:10,420
Wow.

411
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,100
The buzzing in my head tells me that.

412
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:12,800
Wow.

413
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:12,840
Wow.

414
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:12,840


415
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,640
You should try and sell the holy relics of Bob a little harder, a little faster.

416
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:18,220
Harder, faster, like that.

417
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:18,900
Well, there aren't many.

418
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:24,000
There's a few pieces of the stage on which he was shot and killed the first time,

419
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:33,520
but then after that, we shot him and killed him so many times that there's so many stages that have splinters that are on sale on eBay.

420
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:36,980
Bob's blood was spilled upon the splinter.

421
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:42,100
This painting was done on a chunk of wood from the very stage.

422
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:46,100
Bob's holy ichor spills upon so forth.

423
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:47,920
You know, check out eBay.

424
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,880
Google around on eBay and you'll see.

425
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,440
A cherry Kool-Aid squib was, I think, a lot of was.

426
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,240
That's all it was.

427
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:56,760
And yet people, you know, when they were ready to buy, they bought.

428
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:57,560
Yeah.

429
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:59,880
Now, you know, with real blood, they don't seem to even care.

430
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,660
Not anymore.

431
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:01,220
Not anymore.

432
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:10,160
And now the funny thing is, if the in the one case where it was really Bob's blood, when the.

433
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,740
The blanks weren't blanks.

434
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,820
The first one, in fact.

435
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:24,480
Whoever's got those bloodstain planks could, when Jurassic Park technology comes around, clone Bob.

436
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,600
But then that would be the anti-Bob.

437
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:32,180
Well, and the other somebody's got Hitler's bloodstains somewhere.

438
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:35,000
Perhaps Bob himself has them.

439
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,060
Someone has bloodstains from Jesus.

440
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:41,660
The thing is, though, it's going to take a long time to clone Bob.

441
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,400
Because Bob exhibits some genetic abnormalities.

442
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,360
I mean, they've had a hard enough time trying to clone different kinds of mammals.

443
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:48,820
Right.

444
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:49,160
Yeah.

445
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:49,640
I mean, nobody.

446
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:50,840
It would be a short-lived Bob.

447
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,120
They didn't even manage to clone a sheep until 1997.

448
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,160
And, you know, they're still working on trying to clone humans.

449
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:58,860
And like human embryos, they still.

450
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,660
Well, in my mind, Dobbs is more simple an organism.

451
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,500
He's like an ur-organism.

452
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,000
He's like a stem cell.

453
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:05,820
Or a proto-person.

454
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,640
See, what I have understood is that.

455
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,400
You're never going to be able to clone somebody like that because the wave density.

456
00:24:10,520 --> 00:24:11,980
So it's just too strong.

457
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,140
Well, he doesn't.

458
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:17,820
He has less intelligence, as we reckon intelligence, than a sheep does.

459
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,520
It's his morphic resonance of his shell.

460
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:28,380
His own body image would be enough to allow the cloning to happen.

461
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:32,660
Because it would be more the body image that was cloning the spirit of Bob.

462
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,760
And like many other problems.

463
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,060
It would be passed down to each clone because there was some of any of that in the blood that you were cloning from.

464
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:40,700
Of course, it's.

465
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,780
You need.

466
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,280
Fairly fresh blood.

467
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:46,200
I understand they're working on mammoth marrow.

468
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:56,680
Extracting good DNA from mammoth marrow in hopes of impregnating an elephant.

469
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,520
Or gestating a mammoth inside of an elephant.

470
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:07,560
Yeah, but wasn't the reason the mammoth so hairy was because it was crossbred with the Yeti?

471
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,320
No, that's actually a myth.

472
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,020
Oh.

473
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:12,820
Yeah, I'm sorry.

474
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,400
I'm sorry.

475
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:22,440
That's a myth told by silly subgenius non-scientists who didn't graduate from Dobbs Down University like I did.

476
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,980
A lot of hot air circulating.

477
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:24,480
Yeah.

478
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,060
You can believe me.

479
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,880
You can believe Dr. Crankpotsky.

480
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,420
You can believe Dr. Howell.

481
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,220
You can believe that anything Lonesome Cowboy Dave says is a prophecy.

482
00:25:35,680 --> 00:25:37,780
But not necessarily true now.

483
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:40,060
A grim vision.

484
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:40,840
Vision.

485
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,540
And you can believe anything Dr. Sinister says about business because he's the business man.

486
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,760
Yes, I'm now the BM up here at WCSB.

487
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,500
The burning man.

488
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,840
The bowel movement.

489
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,080
The bloody monkey.

490
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,420
I've always wanted, yes, I've always wanted to be able to call myself the...

491
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,300
Biggest.

492
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:00,200
Yeah, not really.

493
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:05,880
But yeah, now I actually have official other duties up here and it's pretty cool actually.

494
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,600
I get my own office.

495
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,500
It's not my own office.

496
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,740
I share it with two other people actually.

497
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:12,080
Get my own key to the station.

498
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,820
I now have a key.

499
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:14,920
He gets in that limo.

500
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:20,240
He gets the limo and there's that special timeshare deal that they all go out to Tahoe.

501
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:23,180
There's Furs Unlimited and the Gambling Demo.

502
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:23,720
Oh, man.

503
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,140
Yeah.

504
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,060
Yeah.

505
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,880
And it can suck a monkey through 30 feet of garden hose.

506
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,100
What are you gawking at?

507
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:40,740
Don't you...

508
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:41,920
People have lives.

509
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:48,580
You know, you guys look like a couple of geeks to me.

510
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:50,920
We're geeks.

511
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,020
Oh, yeah?

512
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:54,460
What does it pay?

513
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:56,260
Oh, we're union.

514
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:01,000
All the chicken heads you can eat.

515
00:27:02,620 --> 00:27:04,000
Stimpy, you're a genius.

516
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,180
He spoke.

517
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,660
He's a genius.

518
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:08,760
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

519
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,340
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

520
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,960
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

521
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,040
He, he.

522
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,140
Oop.

523
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,820
He, he, he, he, he.

524
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,860
He, he, he, he, he.

525
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:21,720
I'd better put on my patented Stupomatron helmet.

526
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:22,940
Hemorrhoids.

527
00:27:23,380 --> 00:27:25,740
Really bad hemorrhoids.

528
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:26,700
Hmm.

529
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:27,800
My, my.

530
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,160
Oh, my.

531
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,380
My, my.

532
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:32,380
My, my.

533
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,020
Oh, my.

534
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,340
My, my.

535
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,240
My, my.

536
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,760
Oh, my.

537
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,120
My, my.

538
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:39,860
My, my.

539
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:40,120
My, my.

540
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:40,420


541
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:41,660
Oh, my!

542
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:42,980
Oh, my.

543
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:43,980
Oh, my.

544
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,160
Oh, my.

545
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,220
Oh, my.

546
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,320
Oh, my.

547
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:47,320


548
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,220
Oh, my.

549
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,220


550
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,220


551
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,640
Oh, my.

552
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:48,720
Oh, my.

553
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:48,720


554
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:48,720


555
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:48,720


556
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:48,720


557
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:53,940
A little artemia salina there, dear friends.

558
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,420
Go on, make a fool out of yourself.

559
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,720
I am in the mood for some future meat products.

560
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:03,020
What's wrong with you now?

561
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,640
Vesty.

562
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:05,980
Want drink?

563
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,800
What would you like to drink, Kowalsky?

564
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,840
Me!

565
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,500
Get him a glass of meat.

566
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,820
You stiffy!

567
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:17,680
You sick little monkey!

568
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:20,200
Say, who's this pretty lady?

569
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,740
Is that your fiancé?

570
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,360
No, it's my sheep.

571
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,320
Hey, that's no horse.

572
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:30,760
That's my wife.

573
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:34,520
His lack of brain activity can only lead to one thing.

574
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,180
Now, what's that, Doc?

575
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,660
Death, of course.

576
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:43,120
So many clever girls depend on their toilets for a quick, refreshing butt secret.

577
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,800
And screen stars tell you they love toilets, too.

578
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,920
Why not get some fragrant toilets tomorrow?

579
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:50,300
Makes you sh-

580
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:57,320
Uh, Reverend Stank, could you please tell me about the moment that Bob came into your life?

581
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:02,100
Or came in his shoes?

582
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:05,240
I think Stank, I think Stank's might be having trouble hearing you.

583
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:08,620
Hello, hello, no, I just went over to check the, uh, the-

584
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,200
Oh, okay.

585
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,420
Tape recording was, uh, did somebody ask a question of, uh, the wise and powerful Reverend Stank?

586
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:17,000
Yes, can you hear me, Reverend Stank?

587
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:17,420
Yeah.

588
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:22,860
Okay, I would like to, you to tell me about the moment that Bob came into your life.

589
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:38,640
Uh, well, actually, uh, I was with, uh, Dr. Philo Drummond, and, uh, we were, uh, he had been kind of breaking me into this knowledge of this guy, uh, Bob, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that, that.

590
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:41,080
that he had gone to college with.

591
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,960
And although Bob was quite a bit older than him,

592
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,220
I'm kind of confused as to how all that happened,

593
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,500
because apparently Bob fought in World War II, and yet...

594
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,420
Well, Bob was friends with Philo.

595
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:56,240
Philo, and Philo's not that much older than I am.

596
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:59,100
Bob fought in World War I and the Spanish-American War II, though.

597
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,580
I mean, Bob's been around a long time.

598
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,800
Yeah, it's really peculiar.

599
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,620
And he also went to college with Henry Kissinger.

600
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,240
So it's like we're not sure how many times he was in college

601
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,980
and how many times he was dating Connie.

602
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,700
Connie originally was going out with Philo,

603
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:18,500
and Bob stole Connie away from Philo.

604
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,020
It wasn't difficult, apparently.

605
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,540
Well, what about...

606
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,200
Pretty much everybody had stolen Connie away from Philo.

607
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,440
Are the rumors still around that Bob was indeed,

608
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:33,420
if not the man himself, but a follower of the Ascended Master,

609
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:34,240
St. Germain?

610
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:37,080
Well, Bob had...

611
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,760
He had undergone his immaculation back in 1953.

612
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,640
We know the year for that.

613
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,980
It was because he built a TV set of his own design.

614
00:30:46,140 --> 00:30:48,640
Yeah, but he didn't...

615
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,460
And he was actually working in the conspiracy.

616
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,480
He was a big part of the conspiracy then.

617
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:58,580
But after he had his vision during his immaculation,

618
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:03,160
he kind of became dissatisfied with conspiracy

619
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,600
and wanted to start his own.

620
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:06,340
He wanted to start his own counter-spiracy,

621
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:10,020
which eventually became the Church of the Subgenius.

622
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:14,380
He had quite a few experimental, social experiments,

623
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,120
sexual societies, and all these weird...

624
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,100
There were these chains of nudist camps.

625
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,840
I don't know if you ever heard about those

626
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,760
that were closed down all over the coasts.

627
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:29,080
Oh, it was because of Kinsey, wasn't it?

628
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:32,060
Well, yeah, they were the fallout from all of that.

629
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,600
Bob was involved with Dr. Kinsey,

630
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:35,140
and he was involved with Dr. Kinsey's experiments.

631
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:35,840
He was...

632
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,120
In fact, in that movie, Kinsey,

633
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:42,280
there's a guy based on J.R. Bob Dobbs who appears.

634
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:45,380
He's the hyper-sexed, crazy man

635
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,480
who's had sex with 9,000 people.

636
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,120
Oh, the one who wrote everything down?

637
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:52,400
Yeah, that character in that movie

638
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:57,980
is loosely, very loosely based on the actual J.R. Bob Dobbs.

639
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,640
Freely based on Bob Dobbs,

640
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:02,180
which means they were freebasing when they wrote the character.

641
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:02,780
Right.

642
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:04,580
Well, Bob was kind of...

643
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:06,680
an amalgam, but he was mostly...

644
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:07,760
Bob's a gas man.

645
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:08,580
Yeah.

646
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,140
I'm most interested in Bob's gas experiments.

647
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:10,860
He's a gas man?

648
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:13,020
He's gonna come down into my basement and check my meter?

649
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:16,380
He's the kind of gas that makes you

650
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:20,280
rise and inflate up into the upper atmosphere

651
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,160
and float away.

652
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,880
Well, what about all the high voltage

653
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,020
and all the machinery and stuff

654
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,080
that was seized by the government?

655
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:30,280
I had heard that Bob had huge...

656
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,280
not just the social experiments involving his psychosexuality,

657
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:34,560
but...

658
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,920
much of his machinery and his...

659
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:40,300
much in the same way that the old Reiki baby had his...

660
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,660
Right, he was a tinkerer and had...

661
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:47,520
not orgone collectors, but orgosmonic radiators.

662
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:47,960
Yeah.

663
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,900
He himself was a battery of orgosmonic energy,

664
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,900
which is much, much more powerful.

665
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:59,540
But orgone is basically a made-up new age superstition.

666
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:02,620
Orgosmonic energy, however, is easily measurable

667
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,460
by machines.

668
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:15,720
So, you must ask, how did this stuff get out of the United States

669
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:18,400
from the Justice Department's hands after seizing it from Bob?

670
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:22,280
Well, much like Viagra, it was a product that actually worked.

671
00:33:22,400 --> 00:33:25,500
And it was, you know, it was the rhino horn that worked.

672
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,200
And there's no suppressing something like that.

673
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,240
Of course not.

674
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,320
Not when it's right up in your face like that is.

675
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:34,600
Yeah, and you see the fallout in those screens.

676
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:34,600


677
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:34,600


678
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:38,780
I've seen those silly Enzyte commercials with the Bob-like character in them.

679
00:33:38,940 --> 00:33:39,800
I wonder if Bob...

680
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,480
For that men's...

681
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:43,480
You've seen those commercials for the men's enhancement pills.

682
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:44,980
Cloudwater Zendo.

683
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:49,560
Did I ever tell you the Cloudwater Zendo was hijacking the image of Bob Dobbs?

684
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:50,760
Who?

685
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,240
What?

686
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:52,680
Cloudwater Zendo.

687
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:54,020
It is a...

688
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,100
Is that a band or a cult?

689
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:55,980
No, this is a...

690
00:33:55,980 --> 00:34:00,160
Well, it's a Zen Buddhist center where you can go to do meditation.

691
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:00,600
Oh, that's long.

692
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,040
Uh-huh.

693
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,100
And I saw a flyer for, hey, come meditate at Cloudwater Zendo.

694
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:04,580
And it had a...

695
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:04,580


696
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:05,840
It had a picture of Bob Dobbs on it.

697
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:06,440
Oh, that is long.

698
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:13,260
Now, you know, actually, that may be a legitimate use of the Dobbs head by a subgenius minister.

699
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:21,620
There have been a couple of Zen Buddhist monasteries that were run by Buddhists who were also subgenius

700
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:21,920
believers.

701
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:25,540
Well, that's the wonderful thing about these subgenius and the Buddhism.

702
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:27,060
They're both non-exclusive.

703
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,200
Yeah, they give you a lot of slack.

704
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:34,140
Yeah, but you know, you really need Buddhism to handle becoming a subgenius.

705
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,420
Well, you can be a subgenius or a Buddhist and a snake handler.

706
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:40,620
Yes, but...

707
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:45,060
You can be a Buddhist and a Sufi master, a dervish.

708
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:51,340
Yes, but this means that just the subgenius, the church of the subgenius is not the only

709
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:56,740
necessarily religion you will ever need because you will first need the techniques of the

710
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,880
Buddhists to calm yourself down because your mind will be in disarray.

711
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,180
You know, you need all of the religions.

712
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,240
You should study and believe every religion.

713
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,580
And then over all of it is the...

714
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:04,580


715
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:04,580


716
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:04,580


717
00:35:04,580 --> 00:35:08,360
The faith looms the face of Bob, which is leading you onward through the murk of all

718
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,620
that false belief.

719
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:10,700
But it's all necessary.

720
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:17,300
You have to go through that crucible, that gauntlet of false, silly superstition.

721
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:21,100
And into the glorious forbidden science of K.R.

722
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,040
Bob's throbbing forehead veins.

723
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:25,000
And speaking of...

724
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:25,980
And speaking of...

725
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,860
And speaking of...

726
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,040
And speaking of...

727
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:32,580
And speaking of...

728
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,560
And speaking of...

729
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,500
Now I've tried to see things different But I can't argue with my sight

730
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:43,320
It sounds as stupid as my haircut And as strange as my whole life

731
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:49,640
My whole damn life Appearances stare

732
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:54,280
Keep up appearances for everyone here These disappearances are common up here

733
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:56,660
Or at the very least explainable As usual with men

734
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,060
As only their methods are debatable

735
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:01,380
It's too bad to stare, I feel a ditch I gotta woosie, bought a stop from the pair

736
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,700
No, I cannot reveal the details They're liable to hear

737
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:04,540
They've hidden moments of truth, they'll know my future

738
00:36:04,540 --> 00:36:06,040
Just the frequencies in my inner ear

739
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,300
It's awful queer they don't appear

740
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,480
And what was standing right here?

741
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,820
And what was standing right here?

742
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,160
Hell no, where are we at?

743
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,500
And what the fuck are we discussing?

744
00:36:14,600 --> 00:36:15,660
Oh, pardon my friendship

745
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,720
Please excuse my blue disgusting

746
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:17,800
Where are my manners at?

747
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,200
A little too much robot testing

748
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,120
I'm in the air, but now

749
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:21,440
Due to the pressure and the stress

750
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,500
The supernatural effect

751
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,880
Another constant channeling

752
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:24,880
Of the deceased in the past

753
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,220
But by having the stigmata

754
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:27,440
And a case of Tourette's

755
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:28,420
I've had a dark and interrupted

756
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,500
But I never forget

757
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:32,040
That I see Sasquatch making

758
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:35,040
Crossicles beneath the northern lights

759
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:36,380
And I've been witness

760
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:37,780
To a strange occurrence

761
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:39,720
Damn near my whole life

762
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:40,980
You see, now I've tried

763
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:42,140
To see things different

764
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:44,340
I can't argue with my sight

765
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:46,860
It sounds as stupid as my haircut

766
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,200
And as strange as my whole life

767
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,400
My whole damn life

768
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:52,800
My whole damn life

769
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:55,620
It sounds as stupid as my haircut

770
00:36:55,620 --> 00:36:56,840
And as strange as my whole life

771
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,340
And as strange as my life

772
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,880
I'm gonna lay on the ground

773
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,300
I'm gonna lay on the ground

774
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,580
And hit that!

775
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:13,440
And I say

776
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,980
I'm gonna lay on the ground

777
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,620
I'm gonna lay on the ground

778
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:19,620


779
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,100


780
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:20,780
No, that won't work

781
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:29,900
No, that won't work

782
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,880
No, that won't work

783
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:34,360
I'm saying it's all about how you're sitting and seeing what I saw

784
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:47,980
And I've seen Sasquatch making crops or gulls beneath the northern lights

785
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:52,700
And I've been witness to strange occurrence damn near my whole life

786
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:57,260
You see, you know I've tried to see things different, but I can't argue with my sight

787
00:37:57,260 --> 00:38:02,200
It sounds as stupid as my haircut and as strange as my other life

788
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:02,460
Ma Whoa!

789
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:03,420
My Herodian Life!!!!

790
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:11,520
It sounds as stupid as my haircut and as strange as my oooOOOOOO end

791
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:25,340
The Goodyear Pimps

792
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:26,560
Massachusetts

793
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,200
formant

794
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,740
is the name of that song, and you know

795
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,500
every subgenius,

796
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,460
every true subgenius is part

797
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,540
Sasquatch.

798
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:36,800
As we cover eventually

799
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,960
in this live pre-recorded

800
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:40,960
clip from last week's

801
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:42,600
Radio Synesthesia featuring

802
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,520
Dick Cheney's Bigfoot.

803
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,820
And speaking of false superstitions,

804
00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,760
portions of the following

805
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,800
broadcast may be found objectionable by some

806
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,220
members of the listening audience, therefore

807
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,080
listener discretion is advised.

808
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:56,380
And the views and opinions expressed on this

809
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:58,000
program are not necessarily those of

810
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,560
WCSB, its members,

811
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:02,220
or Cleveland State University, or anyone for that

812
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:04,260
matter, or the Church of the Subgenius,

813
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,200
or Cloudwater Zendo, or

814
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,680
Dick Cheney's

815
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:08,860
shotgun,

816
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,200
or any of those things.

817
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,320
So anyway.

818
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:15,600
I wonder if Cheney was saying,

819
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,080
well, do you feel lucky?

820
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:20,240
No, he had

821
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:20,680
a private

822
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:21,800
ambulance

823
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:25,040
standing by, actually.

824
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,080
Well, I thought you were going to blow the lid.

825
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,920
There's always a private ambulance standing by.

826
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:30,900
Private health care workers

827
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,140
were on hand.

828
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:33,800
Right, in case he had a heart attack.

829
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,120
Oh, I'm sure he did. He's like, oh my god,

830
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,640
oh my god, I just hit my friend.

831
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,020
And he hit him good

832
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,120
with a shotgun, too.

833
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:45,160
So as he was having a heart attack,

834
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:47,080
he actually swerved to the

835
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:49,200
far right and blew off the face of his friend.

836
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,680
Is that what happened?

837
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,020
No, I think he hit him

838
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,940
in the back, actually.

839
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:54,620
Well, he got

840
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,240
tagged in the shoulder and the

841
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,960
lower face, and

842
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,200
I guess his genitalia was mauled

843
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,440
by a small tiger.

844
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:04,000
Cheney went hunting and

845
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,020
shot a man, uh-huh.

846
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,260
And they're just like

847
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:10,240
the old dukes of old, you know. They go out and they

848
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,260
shoot a bunch of squirrels and quails and stuff

849
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:14,260
like that and give them to the boy, you know,

850
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,340
who takes care of all the squirrels and the quails

851
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:18,460
and stuff. Dick Cheney was a man.

852
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,140
He was a real

853
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:22,440
man, but the bear was bigger

854
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,280
so he ran like a subgenius up a tree.

855
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,900
Oh, man.

856
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:30,160
You know, when I saw it on the news,

857
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,640
I thought, oh, shoot,

858
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,840
something's happened to old

859
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,920
Cheney. And then I was watching

860
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:37,320
and it's like, oh,

861
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,680
Cheney hit him?

862
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,960
And then I thought about it more. It's like,

863
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:44,060
don't they train assassins for this

864
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,640
job? Right. Yeah, really.

865
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,120
Yeah, I mean, it's like getting like Stalinism, you know.

866
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:49,860
Back in the old days of Stalinism, you'd

867
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:51,760
take out your opponent who, you know, had

868
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,040
found his favor with Stalin. You'd just like take him

869
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,620
him in the other room and say, you're fired and shoot him.

870
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,860
Those were the days.

871
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:58,880
Those were the days.

872
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:02,060
When Bob comes back

873
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:04,020
and rules this world,

874
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:05,840
then that's the way things

875
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,900
will be again. It'll be like feudal

876
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:10,260
warlord system with the subgeniuses

877
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:11,740
on top and all the humans as

878
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:13,320
slaves and serfs.

879
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,700
It'll be a beautiful, huge, heavenly world

880
00:41:15,700 --> 00:41:17,900
with harmony between all the

881
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:20,120
races among the subgeniuses.

882
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:21,920
All of those

883
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,960
of the subgenius race, of course,

884
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:25,940
will live in harmony. The humans will live

885
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,760
the way they always have.

886
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:29,680
Well, now, once the exodus arrives, the subgeniuses come

887
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,380
in literally every

888
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,900
possible race, color,

889
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,000
and species, actually.

890
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,940
Once the exodus arrives,

891
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:39,460
they're going to start mutating, right?

892
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,260
The humans will stay the same, but the...

893
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,840
Oh, right. I mean, yeah, by the time

894
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,220
we're finished mutating,

895
00:41:45,320 --> 00:41:47,880
the differences between human

896
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,260
races will be negligible.

897
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,280
Oh, exactly.

898
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,900
They'll all look the same.

899
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:53,860
I think they're already negligible.

900
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:56,460
To begin with, I think the problem is the shrink wrap.

901
00:41:57,660 --> 00:42:00,120
I think what we need to do when we need to market

902
00:42:00,120 --> 00:42:02,060
the human race, we need to, like,

903
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:04,140
write in some totally different stuff, like maybe

904
00:42:04,140 --> 00:42:06,180
not just the third nostril, but maybe

905
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:06,640
like maybe

906
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,640
an extra set of eyes.

907
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,860
Dave, how do you think this whole thing

908
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:13,780
started? Yeah, I guess so.

909
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:15,940
80 million years ago in Mutantus, that's

910
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,780
exactly what the Yetis were doing.

911
00:42:17,860 --> 00:42:19,720
The Yeti scientists were saying,

912
00:42:19,900 --> 00:42:21,980
hmm, let's see what

913
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,540
we can do with these primitive,

914
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:26,400
monkeys, these apish

915
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:27,780
predators.

916
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,100
Let's see, you know, these silly little

917
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:32,060
things. Let's see what we can do with them by

918
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:34,180
tinkering. Not even monkeys, really.

919
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:36,140
They were more like squirrels, weren't they? Yeah.

920
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,100
Like little

921
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,180
itty-bitty rodents. Well, actually, no.

922
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:41,940
They weren't that small, and they were

923
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,940
surprisingly close

924
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:46,280
to a primate sort of a shape.

925
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,620
The fossils

926
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:49,860
have never been found

927
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:52,260
that are that old by human

928
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,480
scientists. They were eating nuts.

929
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:54,020
They were eating nuts.

930
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,580
They were eating nuts, and the Yetis obviously

931
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:57,620
realized, hey, they're smart little guys.

932
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:59,580
They know how to break nuts apart

933
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,900
with, like, rocks and sticks. They were eating each other.

934
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,880
They were cracking each other's brains open

935
00:43:03,880 --> 00:43:05,480
and eating their brains. Right.

936
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:07,860
The Yetis were impressed with

937
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:09,520
that. They went, well, their instincts

938
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,340
are right. They're just very stupid.

939
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:13,620
And they started, and they

940
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,100
changed those

941
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,240
Adamic pre-human

942
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,160
dinosaur-age primates

943
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,660
into, directly

944
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,520
into the human beings that we see today.

945
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:25,720
And teleported them ahead

946
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:27,940
in time to the time of the Neanderthal,

947
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,820
where they promptly

948
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,940
wiped out the happy Neanderthal

949
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,640
and Homo erectus people and

950
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,940
brought the conspiracy that we know now.

951
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:38,000
And, in fact, fathered

952
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,300
us. Yes, we, the

953
00:43:39,300 --> 00:43:40,640
sad, pathetic

954
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,100
descendants of the Yeti,

955
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:45,300
with so much

956
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:47,260
human blood intermixed.

957
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:49,580
You know, let's face it, we're all

958
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:51,620
mostly human. We've only got a little bit of

959
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:53,000
Yeti in us. It's sad.

960
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:53,520
It's pathetic.

961
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,500
And deluded over the generations.

962
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:57,740
But, friends, if you can resist

963
00:43:58,200 --> 00:43:59,580
mating with a human,

964
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,420
oh, go ahead and use them, but don't

965
00:44:02,180 --> 00:44:03,600
impregnate them. Don't get

966
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:05,220
impregnated by a human.

967
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:07,880
Because if we can just

968
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:10,220
stay within our subgenius

969
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,760
race, we can bring back the

970
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:13,780
true Yeti. Like I say, when I

971
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:15,720
say race, I'm not talking about the kind

972
00:44:15,720 --> 00:44:17,320
of race that humans think about.

973
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:19,640
That's right. I'm talking about the kind of race that

974
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:21,440
aliens think about. How about

975
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,660
incubi, succubi, yeah, like that kind of thing.

976
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,120
And the kind that aliens think

977
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,620
dirty thoughts about.

978
00:44:26,980 --> 00:44:29,500
That's what we want to get back

979
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,180
to, man.

980
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,320
The old ways were the best.

981
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,480
I mean prehistoric

982
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:37,220
ways. That's true.

983
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:39,460
Pre-human historic.

984
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:40,440
You said about the old ways.

985
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,260
Especially when we think about our clothing.

986
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:44,840
I mean, why do we even need clothing?

987
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,280
But the Yeti needed no clothing. They'd just

988
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,480
grow hair in whatever parts got cold.

989
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:51,320
They just adapted their bodies to what was

990
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:53,120
going on. They instantly

991
00:44:53,660 --> 00:44:55,780
their pelt. Now, that's

992
00:44:55,780 --> 00:44:57,500
the reason why we have clothing is because

993
00:44:57,500 --> 00:44:59,680
the Yeti hair was able to change the

994
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:01,520
density and change the color

995
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,400
to where we thought it resembled clothing.

996
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,260
It's a sad imitation of the original Yeti.

997
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:07,040
Control over the body.

998
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,440
They had their order

999
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,740
of hair. It looked like

1000
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:13,100
a suit, a three-piece suit.

1001
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,740
Just as a human subgenius yogi

1002
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:17,640
today can, if he concentrates

1003
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,440
enough, he can grow a full

1004
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:21,640
head of hair. Just like when he was

1005
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,420
young, by taking the bob pills,

1006
00:45:23,660 --> 00:45:25,440
the Yeti in those days could do that by

1007
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:26,200
will alone.

1008
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:29,220
And it would just take hours

1009
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,660
instead of a week. But they could shift their bone structure.

1010
00:45:31,780 --> 00:45:33,380
They could do all kinds of things. And we

1011
00:45:33,380 --> 00:45:35,460
will be able to do that, too, after the exes

1012
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:37,300
come and give us back

1013
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:39,280
our rightful destiny

1014
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:41,020
thrown upon the

1015
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:42,780
genetic inheritance of

1016
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:45,280
what was I saying? Yeah, Bob, man!

1017
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:47,440
Bob! A swipe of the

1018
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,520
wand and the DNA has changed.

1019
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,600
Now, how long

1020
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,600
was the Yeti lifespan compared to

1021
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,900
the mere humans?

1022
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,440
There were giants on the Earth in those days

1023
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:59,860
and they lived 999

1024
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:01,600
years, some of those patriarchs.

1025
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,320
So, the Bible

1026
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:05,640
refers to them obliquely

1027
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:06,600
in a primitive way.

1028
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:09,200
Speaking of being oblique, weren't they, some of them

1029
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:11,620
have, like, macrocephalic skulls

1030
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:13,600
and the rest of their body was much

1031
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,760
smaller and they had these huge oyster-shaped

1032
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,600
skulls? Big heads and big

1033
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:19,920
feet.

1034
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:21,540
And that's why

1035
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:23,060
they call them Bigfoot now.

1036
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:25,740
Uh, and you know what

1037
00:46:25,740 --> 00:46:27,740
big feet mean? Human tripod,

1038
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:29,660
but not human. Big

1039
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,080
footprints. And, uh,

1040
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,900
and yet the Yeti

1041
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:35,800
in a way ironically left a small

1042
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,660
footprint because they really were only

1043
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,740
on the Earth in a

1044
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,800
civilization for a relatively short

1045
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,420
time before they went back to

1046
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,280
living, uh,

1047
00:46:45,460 --> 00:46:47,400
pretty much an entirely spiritual,

1048
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,780
barely physical life, like

1049
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,820
the exes themselves. What remains

1050
00:46:51,820 --> 00:46:53,420
of them today? I'm curious.

1051
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,360
I know, but I'd like to hear it.

1052
00:46:56,340 --> 00:46:57,340
Armies, frozen

1053
00:46:57,340 --> 00:46:59,580
underground, uh, in

1054
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:01,440
the shell just above the hollow

1055
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:03,260
Earth, but beneath the Himalayas.

1056
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:05,360
Thousands of soldiers? Millions of

1057
00:47:05,360 --> 00:47:06,640
frozen Yeti

1058
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:09,480
who are watching us now. Like

1059
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:11,560
I say, they're spiritual beings. They don't need

1060
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,400
their bodies. They've left their bodies preserved.

1061
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,560
But their minds are constantly active.

1062
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:17,640
Yes, they're watching, they're watching us. They're not

1063
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:19,640
uh, they're watching us like Beavis and Butthead

1064
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,280
watch MTV.

1065
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,320
They're not really watching us in a protective

1066
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:24,920
manner. They're watching us in a

1067
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,700
sarcastic, superior, smirking

1068
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,220
way.

1069
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,680
Just like Beavis and Butthead watch MTV

1070
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:33,700
and just as we in turn watch

1071
00:47:33,700 --> 00:47:35,740
Beavis and Butthead, we are

1072
00:47:35,740 --> 00:47:37,580
being watched. You don't

1073
00:47:37,580 --> 00:47:39,840
know, the fish

1074
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,700
does not know it's in an

1075
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,360
aquarium. You understand?

1076
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,640
Is that why my eyeballs are

1077
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,720
so high-peeling? Why it hurts so bad

1078
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,900
all the time? I mean, is my pineal

1079
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:51,340
gland growing or is it shrinking?

1080
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:53,460
Dave, I hope it's growing.

1081
00:47:53,600 --> 00:47:55,240
How much coffee have you had?

1082
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:57,820
But sir, discipline is slack. Discipline

1083
00:47:57,820 --> 00:47:59,680
is slack, slack. They're just in it

1084
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:01,440
for the girls. It will be glorious,

1085
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,580
Nick. I will scale the walls

1086
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,580
of paradise and raise it to

1087
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,360
its foundations. The cosmos

1088
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,480
will crack and tremble with the opal

1089
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:11,100
din of Armageddon.

1090
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:13,360
I will rise triumphant.

1091
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,620
I will, I'll, I, and then

1092
00:48:15,620 --> 00:48:17,240
he'll, he'll, everything,

1093
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,080
everything will, will...

1094
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:21,540
Why won't he call?

1095
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:22,960
I know.

1096
00:48:23,600 --> 00:48:25,040
I know. It hurts.

1097
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:27,400
It hurts, Norrell, it hurts.

1098
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:29,760
That was Norrell

1099
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,220
Preff from

1100
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,780
norrellpreff.com

1101
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,040
and now

1102
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:36,100
Schwump.

1103
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,260
Drain the people.

1104
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:45,960
Drain and cry.

1105
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:48,440
Drain the people.

1106
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,220
Hear them cry.

1107
00:48:51,640 --> 00:48:52,680
Drain the people.

1108
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:54,320
Drain and cry.

1109
00:48:55,420 --> 00:48:56,840
Drain the people.

1110
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,600
Watch them die.

1111
00:48:59,020 --> 00:48:59,380
Die, die, die.

1112
00:49:03,460 --> 00:49:05,080
I took a walk

1113
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:06,720
through the stately insane.

1114
00:49:07,620 --> 00:49:09,200
I stopped to watch

1115
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,980
the procession of pain.

1116
00:49:12,340 --> 00:49:13,380
The people burned

1117
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:14,940
but the kingdom remained

1118
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:16,980
and all the lovers united

1119
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,200
with the ball and the chain.

1120
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,740
Oh, to rain the people.

1121
00:49:22,740 --> 00:49:23,340
Drain and cry.

1122
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:24,780
Drain and cry.

1123
00:49:24,780 --> 00:49:25,000
Drain and cry.

1124
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:25,860
To rain the people.

1125
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:27,600
Hear them cry.

1126
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:28,900
Drain and cry.

1127
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,060
To rain the people.

1128
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:31,780
Drain and cry.

1129
00:49:31,860 --> 00:49:32,820
Drain and cry.

1130
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:34,040
Drain the people.

1131
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:35,760
Watch them die.

1132
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:36,320
Drain and cry.

1133
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,720
Drain and cry.

1134
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:39,420
Watch them die.

1135
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:42,120
Well, I climbed the hill

1136
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,900
near the valley of sin

1137
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:46,620
to watch the people swim

1138
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:48,040
in eels and pins.

1139
00:49:48,760 --> 00:49:50,120
The Lord above

1140
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:52,040
sent a message to me.

1141
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,360
Although it sounded

1142
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,300
like freedom,

1143
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:56,100
it was just liberty.

1144
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,780
To rain the people.

1145
00:49:59,740 --> 00:50:00,440
Drain and cry.

1146
00:50:00,860 --> 00:50:02,940
To rain the people.

1147
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:04,560
Hear them cry.

1148
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,020
To rain the people.

1149
00:50:07,460 --> 00:50:08,560
Drain and cry.

1150
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,020
Drain the people.

1151
00:50:11,460 --> 00:50:12,740
Watch them die.

1152
00:50:12,940 --> 00:50:13,620
Die, die, die.

1153
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:29,360
Oh, tomar a guia comma su pin.

1154
00:50:36,660 --> 00:50:37,740
Tu hai 188 살�a experience

1155
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:37,740


1156
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:37,740


1157
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:38,280
You're a drawer

1158
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:38,280


1159
00:50:38,280 --> 00:50:38,560
You are in full run

1160
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:39,180
You're totem

1161
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:42,600
You're choreographed

1162
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:46,320
Now you're fit

1163
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:46,320


1164
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:46,320


1165
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:46,320


1166
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:46,320


1167
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:46,320


1168
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:47,120
Shear your home

1169
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:48,040
Fearless

1170
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,040


1171
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,040


1172
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,040


1173
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,040


1174
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,040


1175
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:48,040


1176
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:51,240
Get real

1177
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:52,400
Well...

1178
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:52,400


1179
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:59,460
I took a ride on a riverboat train, to watch the little fishies die in vain.

1180
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:07,520
The captain drowned and the crewman reprained, although I knew they were sorry that they'd do it again.

1181
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:15,900
To rain the people, drain them dry. To rain the people, hear them cry.

1182
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:24,120
To rain the people, drain them dry. To rain the people, watch them die.

1183
00:51:26,640 --> 00:51:28,260
Watch them die.

1184
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,320
Watch them die.

1185
00:51:50,680 --> 00:52:14,120
Hey, Dave! Dave! There's a movie about you, um, called The Island.

1186
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:15,180
Oh.

1187
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:15,880
Why is it called The Island?

1188
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,080
I had no idea it was an island. I thought maybe an archipelago or an issue.

1189
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:23,900
Yeah, you're so lonesome as a cowboy, as an island.

1190
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:28,880
There's a movie called The Island with Scarlett Johansson and Obi-Wan Kenobi in it.

1191
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:31,600
Obi-Wan Kenobi is an actual, um, yeah, okay.

1192
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:32,520
Yeah, and, uh...

1193
00:52:32,520 --> 00:52:33,480
Alec Guinness is dead.

1194
00:52:34,620 --> 00:52:44,360
It's about these clones who find out that they're really just clones to provide organs for rich guys in the world.

1195
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,640
Well, that's what we're hiding here.

1196
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:54,800
The difference is that they are pampered clones in a Logan's Run sort of future world that's actually a factory.

1197
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:58,880
Uh, and kind of like cows on my brother's farm.

1198
00:52:59,140 --> 00:52:59,700
When's lunch?

1199
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:05,300
And when their body parts are needed or when the baby has come to term, they're disposed of.

1200
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:12,000
Well, that's like what we figured out you were, only they don't really...

1201
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:14,340
Whoever owns you isn't taking very good care of you.

1202
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:15,560
That's right.

1203
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:20,420
And also, who, why doesn't anybody think of who comes up with these?

1204
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:26,160
To begin with, doesn't this mean that society is clambering backwards down a slow hill and can't really, you know...

1205
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,160
This, this sounds like in time set kind of literature.

1206
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:37,000
Well, you know, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer to the point where the, the, the poor are just the organ farms for the rich.

1207
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:42,280
Uh, by the way, there's dozens of homeless guys that look exactly like Bill Gates.

1208
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,240
If you gave him a shave and...

1209
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,260
Some glasses and a bad haircut and a suit.

1210
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:48,060
Yeah.

1211
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:50,600
But currently they look like Howard Hughes.

1212
00:53:50,840 --> 00:53:55,100
Well, those guys will all be getting, as soon as Bill needs a liver, one of those...

1213
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:58,900
That's what I don't understand is why they don't take better care of their property.

1214
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:04,360
They've got these, these liver cattle, but they're letting them become drunks.

1215
00:54:05,560 --> 00:54:06,840
Well, it seasons the liver.

1216
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:10,280
See, the thing is you can always cut off part of the liver and grow a new one.

1217
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:10,380
You always want a good, reused liver.

1218
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:11,800
That way you don't have to break it in.

1219
00:54:12,620 --> 00:54:13,020
Yeah.

1220
00:54:13,120 --> 00:54:13,340
Yeah.

1221
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:22,520
Hey, um, the island was ripped off from a movie from 1976 called Parts the Clonus Horror, which has been on Mystery Science Theater 3000.

1222
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,280
Well, I'll be.

1223
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:35,440
Well, actually, I'm, I would imagine that that movie itself was probably ripped off from some 1950s sci-fi story and amazing fantasy or something.

1224
00:54:35,700 --> 00:54:38,640
And probably some 40s one in Argosy or 39 or something.

1225
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:39,240
Right, exactly.

1226
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:42,420
It's like, and before that, Plato talked of the...

1227
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:43,440
Yeah, the island.

1228
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:44,340
Yeah.

1229
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:48,080
It's like, yeah, it's kind of an old story.

1230
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,360
All right.

1231
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:07,120
Yeah.

1232
00:55:08,060 --> 00:55:09,660
Praise Bob.

1233
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:20,980
I receive lots of slack, I can listen to Stang, it keeps me stable for a day's praise, Bob.

1234
00:55:39,100 --> 00:55:47,740
Here with my Bob, where my brain cells break down, will you visit me please, if I give you some fra-praise, Bob.

1235
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:59,200
Here with my Bob, I just stare at his face, my brain in deep outer space, I can feel alone with Bob.

1236
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,420
A by Phineas Narco.

1237
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:26,060
Friends, again, more from him at NationalCynical.com.

1238
00:56:26,540 --> 00:56:28,000
Nice little parody there.

1239
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:32,260
The background music on this show was done by yours truly, and...

1240
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:37,160
Alright, well, guys, we're kind of running out of time here.

1241
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:40,180
We've only got about 17 minutes left in the program.

1242
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:46,960
And I do have some music I need to play, so I would appreciate if you guys could share some last thoughts for the evening.

1243
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,480
A fatwa against Fred Phelps.

1244
00:56:49,660 --> 00:56:50,120
In conclusion.

1245
00:56:51,640 --> 00:56:52,420
I think...

1246
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,040
I was just reading about Fred Phelps tonight.

1247
00:56:55,560 --> 00:57:05,840
You know, there's this thing that's been online for a few years about how he abused his children and drove one of his son's girlfriends to suicide.

1248
00:57:05,980 --> 00:57:11,700
I mean, he's just a more terrible man than you would know from watching him on TV.

1249
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,340
Oh, he would sue random people for $1,500.

1250
00:57:15,060 --> 00:57:19,520
And then he would just, you know, say, well, that's your out-of-court cost settlement, it's $1,500.

1251
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:20,960
And then if they didn't...

1252
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,940
If they didn't take him up on the $1,500, he'd sue them for a lot more.

1253
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:27,080
Man, I need a lawyer.

1254
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:29,440
I don't know who that is.

1255
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,060
I forgot.

1256
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:34,160
Fred Phelps, he's a guy that hates homosexuals.

1257
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,080
Godhatesfags.com.

1258
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,500
He's a minister who leads Loud and publicity getting...

1259
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:46,200
Yes, they've actually been known to set up protests in front of the funerals of Iraq war veterans.

1260
00:57:46,460 --> 00:57:46,720
Right.

1261
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:50,960
Because they died protecting a country that protects the rights of...

1262
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:51,880
Of homosexuals.

1263
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:52,020
Oh.

1264
00:57:52,180 --> 00:57:56,940
And he will continue protesting at soldiers' funerals.

1265
00:57:57,380 --> 00:58:03,100
Well, I thought it was like, you know, Brownback being a part of Agnes Day and wanting the end of the world to come real quick or something.

1266
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:04,260
They are from the same state.

1267
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:07,200
The end of the world is coming, Dave.

1268
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:08,620
And the end of this show is coming.

1269
00:58:08,760 --> 00:58:10,560
And we must have our last thoughts.

1270
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:12,400
And they probably will be our last thoughts.

1271
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:12,820
Yeah, I...

1272
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:14,720
Because the bombs are on their way.

1273
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:15,240
Yes.

1274
00:58:15,560 --> 00:58:16,440
We'll meet again.

1275
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:18,160
Don't know where, don't know when.

1276
00:58:18,320 --> 00:58:19,820
My last thought is that...

1277
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:22,620
You know, I mentioned Mystery Science Theater 3000.

1278
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:25,820
Just as we watched that show, the subgeni are watching us.

1279
00:58:26,560 --> 00:58:27,120
That's right.

1280
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:27,820
Okay, so...

1281
00:58:27,820 --> 00:58:28,580
Thank you, Mark.

1282
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,400
When fewer I can walk, I guess I'll just, you know...

1283
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,920
A benign subgenius.

1284
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:37,600
All right.

1285
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,300
Thank you very much.

1286
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:41,340
Good night to one and all.

1287
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:50,820
I stole them.

1288
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,380
You're talking padre?

1289
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:58,580
Yeah.

1290
00:58:58,580 --> 00:59:00,700
You stole them?

1291
00:59:00,860 --> 00:59:01,280
You always tell me about the stables, kid.

1292
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:01,280


1293
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:01,380
We were looking for the stables.

1294
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:01,380


1295
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:01,380


1296
00:59:01,380 --> 00:59:01,540
Fix a gmail account and move someone down something like this toubby is the secret code of planning.

1297
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:01,540


1298
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:01,540


1299
00:59:01,540 --> 00:59:06,120
I cutting Mr. Cub from a newspaper died a month ago with an lengths of hours of hurry.

1300
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:09,640
A maniacal attack on a newspaper fucking Naruto guy doing night dream coverage.

1301
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,860
My own seventeen.

1302
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,820
This is Frank and Ross.

1303
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:14,820


1304
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,560
And thanks toall of you.

1305
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:20,960
TheANAEV począt-winners.com

1306
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:28,900
And that was, uh, Hell Pope Huey.

1307
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:29,960
Praise Bob.

1308
00:59:32,580 --> 00:59:33,920
Good night, Ren.

1309
00:59:34,560 --> 00:59:36,640
Good night, Sophie.

1310
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:40,220
And now all I need.

1311
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,320
Is eight hours.

1312
00:59:44,020 --> 00:59:46,060
I want you to wrap this.

1313
00:59:46,060 --> 00:59:46,400
Yes.

1314
00:59:47,540 --> 00:59:47,660
Yes.
