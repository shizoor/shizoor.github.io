1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:06,800
Well, maybe Pete Therese learned something and came back to tell us who it was amongst us we had to look out for.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,560
I know who it is! I know who the monster is!

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,220
Who is it, Charlie? Tell us!

4
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,920
I know who it is that doesn't belong among us!

5
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,880
What are you waiting for? Come on!

6
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,060
I swear I know who it is!

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,000
Well, come on, Charlie! Come on!

8
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:22,320
Tell us! It's...

9
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,940
The Snake!

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,800
Understand the procedure now. Sit back and watch the pattern.

11
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:33,140
And this pattern is always the same?

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:37,860
With few variations. They pick the most dangerous enemy they can find.

13
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,360
And it's...

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,920
The Self-Genius!

15
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,720
Power of...

16
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,740
Swatch!

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,720
And I take it this is not unique?

18
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,100
By no means.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,240
Their world is full of...

20
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,480
Power of...

21
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:52,300
Swatch!

22
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:53,920
And we'll...

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,280
We'll go from one to the other and destroy their radios.

24
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,260
One to the other.

25
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,300
One to the other.

26
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,700
One to the other.

27
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:17,800
Man, that has got to be one of the greatest intros for Hour of Slack by Fernand and Andy Lemur ever!

28
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:21,380
And he's done hundreds of those.

29
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,680
You might look at...

30
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,060
Archive.com

31
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,860
Well, friends, we're doing it just like last show, again.

32
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,660
All new, but all pre-recorded from other people's shows.

33
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,600
With puzzling evidence, Dr. Drummond and Dr. Howell coming later.

34
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,200
But first, it's part two of four from the podcast called...

35
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,680
My Family Thinks I'm Crazy.

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,720
And I had a lot of fun with the young weirdos hosting it.

37
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,780
This part starts with me talking about first taking on Jesus in 1990.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,600
In 1994, as business manager of the Church of the Subgenius.

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,340
The internet welcomed us with open arms.

40
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,220
And about that time, I got a young partner, Jesus.

41
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,060
Not Jesus from the Bible, but he looks like Jesus.

42
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,720
He is painted with long blonde hair, white man.

43
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:12,460
You know, he really looked the part.

44
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:14,420
I started calling him Jesus.

45
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,660
Jesus for a partner.

46
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:23,260
And he got us on using credit cards.

47
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:25,080
and modernized everything a whole lot.

48
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:30,840
Then because of photographs that he and his wife put online,

49
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:40,440
there was a child custody case where his wife's ex-husband got the child

50
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,000
because of Church of the Subgenius.

51
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,840
This judge just didn't get it.

52
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:48,940
And their pictures were pretty bad.

53
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:55,680
He was reenacting the Stations of the Cross at one X-Day drill.

54
00:02:55,880 --> 00:02:57,840
These were campouts that we had.

55
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:04,120
We have them at usually clothing optional campgrounds

56
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,200
that are normally used by pagans.

57
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:14,600
In fact, in 1990, I was invited to the biggest pagan festival in the Northeast

58
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,160
called Starwood Festival.

59
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:18,260
I thought they were going to ambush me

60
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:22,260
because I'd been making fun of all that woo-woo for my career.

61
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,420
What part of the Northeast?

62
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,400
They knew how to party.

63
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:29,400
And long story short, I was back at Starwood

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:35,060
as sort of the mascot skeptic and other religious nut

65
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:36,500
preaching about Bob.

66
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,080
They loved that stuff.

67
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:44,320
And I ended up, my second wife I met there,

68
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,440
and then she ended up running the festival.

69
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:48,980
And I was there several years.

70
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:49,660
I helped.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,060
So I ended up married into the pagan community.

72
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,580
It's very strange.

73
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,480
I got to know quite a few of the people I'd made fun of in a book,

74
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:02,980
an early book that's out of print now called High Weirdness by Mail,

75
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,740
where we explained all the other cults you could join,

76
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,820
or at least get free mailings from them.

77
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:12,740
You know, just send this form letter to these weird addresses

78
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,120
and you'll get something back.

79
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,480
And it's a great hobby.

80
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,260
It was how we started, actually.

81
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:18,240
The reason we started was because we were so excited.

82
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,360
We were so excited.

83
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,920
And the reason I met Philo besides his Yellow Page ad

84
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:24,000
was that he collected kook pamphlets.

85
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,160
And he was into comic books.

86
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,500
And he liked Captain Beefheart.

87
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:31,600
Now, of course, that describes every subgenius now.

88
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,100
But at the time, it was unheard of.

89
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,760
Who's Captain Beefheart?

90
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,460
What?

91
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,760
Yeah, Captain Beefheart, the great Captain Beefheart.

92
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,720
No, I don't know.

93
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,220
Who is it?

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,320
Well, he was a very weird musician.

95
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,140
He was very influential on people like The Residents.

96
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,280
Man, Church is a subgenius for that matter.

97
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:57,320
He was actually a buddy, a high school buddy of Frank Zappa's.

98
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,320
But he was even weirder than Zappa.

99
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,060
And Zappa got him his first record deal,

100
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,500
which is one of the classic albums of all time.

101
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:07,600
But it's really hard to get used to.

102
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,700
Trout Mask Replica was the first Captain Beefheart album.

103
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,700
Captain Beefheart and his magic band.

104
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,180
But this is a real person.

105
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,800
Yeah.

106
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,400
Well, his real name was Don Van Vliet.

107
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,380
Don?

108
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,400
OK, cool.

109
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,160
Yeah, there you go.

110
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,240
There's Captain Beefheart.

111
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:22,600
Cool.

112
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,940
I thought you, you know, OK.

113
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,300
He has an amazing singing voice.

114
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:31,540
And like I say, he was, you guys may have also never heard of the Firesign Theatre.

115
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:36,520
They were a comedy group that did, well, they were really radio theatre.

116
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:40,720
They were about 10 years older than us subgeniuses.

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,160
And Firesign Theatre were, they were ahead, way ahead of the time.

118
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,000
They were kind of like Monty Python, but they were way before Monty Python.

119
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:55,980
They were inspired by The Goon Show, which also inspired Python.

120
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,300
But we were inspired by the Firesign Theatre.

121
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:05,560
And we didn't expect to be lucky enough to be them.

122
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:08,700
But we did sort of end up carrying the torch.

123
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:15,140
And that there were a subgenius radio show started up in Berkeley on Monday.

124
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:19,220
The KPFA, one of those hippie Pacifica stations.

125
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,920
And that was in 1982.

126
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,900
Puzzling Evidence Show started.

127
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:25,140
I was the first guest.

128
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,520
Then Hour of Slack started up in 1985.

129
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,800
That was my show.

130
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:40,780
I did it in a little station in Dallas until they kicked me off for, believe it or not, for crazy racial reasons.

131
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:42,580
We just got fired.

132
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,420
We don't care.

133
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,380
We started doing it from home.

134
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,420
We were already syndicated by then.

135
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,860
I was mailing cassettes to these other stations.

136
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:52,640
And so I started doing this thing from home.

137
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:55,100
And later on, I ended up moving to Cleveland.

138
00:06:55,620 --> 00:07:00,620
And was where the station there was, had already been playing my show for years.

139
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:03,340
And I just started doing the same time slot.

140
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
And worked with some Cleveland folks.

141
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:08,840
There was a lot of subgenius activity in Cleveland.

142
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,840
A lot more than there ever had been in Texas.

143
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,220
What were you talking about on the show?

144
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,280
Were you preaching to people about Bob?

145
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,200
Oh, yeah, a little bit of everything.

146
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,980
I mean, we'd preach about Bob some.

147
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,980
We'd play music.

148
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:24,600
Often, mostly, unreleased music.

149
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:29,600
Music by subgeniuses or off weird stuff.

150
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,620
You know, outtakes.

151
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:33,140
So the guys at Devo were our friends.

152
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,180
Yeah, that makes sense.

153
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,600
I worked on a couple of their music videos.

154
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:39,220
And they contributed to our...

155
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,000
Mark Motherspawn did music for our little commercial that's on...

156
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,360
front page of subgenius.com.

157
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,440
Ivan, I'm Reverend Juan Ayala now.

158
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:52,100
Can you sign my subgenius pamphlet, please?

159
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,300
I ordered one.

160
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,200
Are you able to sign that for me?

161
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:56,620
Yeah, sure.

162
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,080
You only ordered a pamphlet?

163
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:01,500
I ordered the 44 thing, whatever it was.

164
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,400
Oh, you've got the membership pack.

165
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,220
Yeah, I'm a reverend now, right?

166
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,980
I already did.

167
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,480
They're already signed.

168
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:11,880
I mean, there's like a letter from me in it.

169
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,980
And it's...

170
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,820
I actually sign each one for real.

171
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,980
But it doesn't have...

172
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,060
When did you order it?

173
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:19,860
Just now.

174
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,940
We were on air like 10, 15 minutes ago.

175
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,080
Oh, just now?

176
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:22,840
Yeah.

177
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,160
Oh, okay.

178
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,160
Ivan, I need to tell you something, bro.

179
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,200
You're my favorite.

180
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:30,140
You are my favorite guest by far and away, dude.

181
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,180
You are great, bro.

182
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,720
I loved everything you're saying.

183
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,400
This is fantastic.

184
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,700
We're only just getting started.

185
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:37,120
I don't trust you.

186
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:40,200
Don't trust anything Chris says.

187
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,160
That sounds suspicious to me.

188
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:41,960
Reverend, don't...

189
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,980
I'm serious.

190
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:46,000
Reverend, we have him here for comedic purposes.

191
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,880
Don't trust anything he says.

192
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,780
Ouch.

193
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,320
Ouch.

194
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,760
Those are my feelings, bro.

195
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,740
Those are my feelings.

196
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,860
Chris, be careful now.

197
00:08:52,960 --> 00:08:53,900
You know I love you.

198
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,940
I actually have been...

199
00:08:54,940 --> 00:08:56,320
I've done a lot of interviews.

200
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:03,300
When our books were being published by Simon & Schuster, they would send copies to radio

201
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:04,420
shows.

202
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:09,320
They had this huge list of PR stuff that they would...

203
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:19,440
And so I ended up doing a lot of these straight radio things, just stupid drive time FM stations.

204
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,720
The rock jocks were the worst.

205
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,960
They were the dumbest.

206
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,340
Honest to God.

207
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:26,560
Those...

208
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:33,000
I just got to where I just dreaded those, because the guys that thought they were real

209
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,860
hip, Jesus Christ, they're so lame.

210
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,040
Every time I ever walked into...

211
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,120
There were times when...

212
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:44,400
I remember one of the big stations would go, oh, we heard your little indie show.

213
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,360
Why don't you come in and talk about doing a for real show with us?

214
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:53,980
Somehow the minute that you started hearing subgenius material played in one of those

215
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:58,060
corporate offices, everyone in the room knew it wasn't going to work.

216
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:00,420
It's like, no, no.

217
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:04,080
Advertisers would never put up with...

218
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:09,020
We're making fun of people's most serious things.

219
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,100
Yeah.

220
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,540
Absolutely.

221
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,040
And we weren't overtly putting down Christianity particularly, because hell, that was old

222
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,260
hat.

223
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,540
Saturday Night Live was already doing that.

224
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,840
We were more interested in UFO cults.

225
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,760
Jonestown was the one we used as an example.

226
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:33,680
If Jim Jones could talk 900 people into killing themselves, we can talk 900 people into sending

227
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,440
us a dollar.

228
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:35,460
I love you, man.

229
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,460
You're my kind guy.

230
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:41,740
And it turned out if we'd wanted to, we could have talked 900 people into killing themselves.

231
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,160
People are that ready to follow something stupid.

232
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:50,060
We've had to fucking deprogram our own zombies.

233
00:10:50,420 --> 00:10:52,320
So these people will...

234
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,440
When do I get to meet Bob?

235
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,560
How did that make you feel, Ivan, that you had that much power?

236
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,480
I crossed my fingers and go, look, man, I'm going to have to tell you a real hard fact.

237
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,840
Bob, you're never going to meet Bob.

238
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:06,360
He's dead.

239
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:06,440
He's dead.

240
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,440


241
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,440


242
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,440


243
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,440


244
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,440


245
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,440


246
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,440


247
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,440


248
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,440


249
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:06,440


250
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,540
I don't care about me.

251
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,720
The dumbest one of all was the richest guy that I ever met.

252
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:23,300
He had inherited a fortune, and he thought he was going to meet Bob.

253
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,380
I couldn't believe how dense this guy was.

254
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:32,140
Over the years, I learned that the rich can afford to be stupid.

255
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:35,440
And there's nothing more dangerous than a trick.

256
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:42,520
a drunk rich man or woman i guess that's the most dangerous creature in the world is a super rich

257
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:48,440
person who's really drunk so they can do anything they want and somebody else will drive them home

258
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:54,220
and they could pay to make it forgotten you know how did that make you feel ivan that you had that

259
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:01,660
i want to get rich that's oh no i want it's my turn to get rich i fucking love this i i you know

260
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:07,040
i couldn't agree more with that last statement and i do want to know your answer to juan's

261
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:13,520
question but i want to know your thoughts on conspiracy with that last statement we just

262
00:12:13,520 --> 00:12:19,740
heard i mean a lot of the conspiracies we look at involve very rich people getting away with very

263
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:26,340
very bad things well that's all you need is to be incredibly rich you can do just about anything

264
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,700
the way things are now i mean it's like

265
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,520
one percent of

266
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:40,860
the people in the country own 99 of the shit everybody else is uh sorry i pardon my language

267
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:46,700
oh no please internet podcast swear away see if i use this on my show i have to i have to if i use

268
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:52,860
any clips from it i have to cut that stuff or bleep it for at least for this only about four

269
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:59,580
real stations now but i do have to think about them they can get in big trouble for stuff

270
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:06,140
but this is your syndicated radio show you're talking about yeah well the hour of slack i mean

271
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:12,580
it's it started out as a broadcast radio show on independent you know public type

272
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,620
stations college stations sure college radio basically cool and it was running on about

273
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,620
15 different college stations for a while but gradually people couldn't listen to the radio

274
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:31,440
for one thing you could at cleveland state i was with the station there for about 15 years

275
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:36,880
they couldn't get students to come in and do shows almost everybody doing shows there were

276
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:44,380
50 year old alumni you know who hadn't had been classes years but they still had their same old

277
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:51,620
shows because nobody else would take the time slots it was nuts and i i now do the show from

278
00:13:53,060 --> 00:14:00,620
my desk basically although every now and then we do phone things or and every x day we would have

279
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:07,740
quite a few of us together to record a lot x days were great and we we did them up until

280
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:15,480
well we're going to keep doing them but we just lost our venue we we we had the perfect place in

281
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:23,060
florida it was kind of like a hippie nudist semi-nudist resort but it was really nice that's

282
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:29,540
but she's moving she's moving it to somewhere else so we don't have any place to do it this summer

283
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,000
uh and

284
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:39,680
um we came up with great excuses for that but juan lives in florida we've done 25 of these

285
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:47,880
outdoor events that that have had bands and people doing like live radio show type things but mostly

286
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:54,040
it was standing around on the road talking if subgeniuses meet each other they a lot of them

287
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:59,260
would only see each other once a year a couple of times a year but they were special friends you

288
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:01,500
know so it was a a lot of fun and i think that's what i'm trying to do with the show is to have a

289
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:05,320
what philo and i didn't expect would that would turn into such a social

290
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:13,720
thing the number of subgenius facebook pages is too damn high there's so many of them i can't

291
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:20,860
keep track of them right it seems like this is the most infamous anti-cult because like you said

292
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:26,320
you're literally deprogramming your zombies what kind of uh feeling did that give you you're

293
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:31,300
realizing you had such power and you really weren't looking for it it's like if only we could

294
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:38,360
keep a straight face if only if only i didn't smile when i was saying this yeah we've got to be like

295
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:44,040
l ron hubbard by now oh for real dude you have got the hat you have the boat dude yeah i got the yacht

296
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:49,020
hat i got the sailor's hat you gotta tighten it up ivan man you gotta be real serious with this

297
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:55,020
bro because people can you know we we'll help you man i'm in bro i'm down can i be in i want

298
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:01,380
to be i love this 44 bucks we're about to go into a well i can't talk too much about this but we're

299
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:07,740
we are i think we're going to be entering a phase two soon i love it that's going to be a little

300
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:13,780
different but does that involve um and it might actually make some real money now ironically

301
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:24,580
well i'm where i'm sitting right now is uh a big house in the middle of the woods on a on a ranch

302
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:31,400
property in rural texas so it's almost like we've got the perfect place for the

303
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:39,880
cult compound like but the problem is i mean i just don't like minions so this next day is going

304
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:46,760
to be a series of parties local parties like i'll invite my friends that i know that are from around

305
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:55,160
you know this texas arkansas and maybe maybe a guy up in upstate new york will throw a big party

306
00:16:55,160 --> 00:17:00,860
there maybe they'll do some at the pagan campground that we used to use in in ohio

307
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:08,380
we i was in ohio for about 20 years and but now i'm back in texas for good but not dallas

308
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:16,120
it's a goat ranch i didn't really know much about the subgenius and start looking into it and i love

309
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:23,960
the ideology i can get behind the system all that you know and be your own person do your

310
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:29,380
own thing find your own slack i love that because that's what we talk about and it's it's amazing

311
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,900
it has

312
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,480
inspired lots of people to in fact repent quit their jobs and slack off

313
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:42,660
sometimes they have to get a another job but it's almost always a better job

314
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,540
you know that's what happens when you quit your job you get a better job usually

315
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:53,020
so that's exactly what happened to me and i did i quit my job for the man and now i

316
00:17:53,020 --> 00:18:00,600
have this justice job for bob but unfortunately that means i'm always at work you know my the

317
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,480
bedroom's just going to be like oh my god it's like you know i'm going to have to quiet down my

318
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:01,480


319
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
down the hallway there.

320
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:05,600
I have to give myself

321
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,680
permission to knock off

322
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:09,700
work and go watch

323
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,940
Rick and Morty or whatever.

324
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,800
Living for Bob out here.

325
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,560
Living for Bob. I love this, bro.

326
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,640
This is incredible, dude.

327
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,720
It really is, but you love what you're doing, Ivan,

328
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:20,540
right? And I mean,

329
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,640
the thing that I like about you is that you told people

330
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,660
like, listen, we came up with this

331
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,060
shit high as fuck.

332
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,720
Why are you taking it so serious? Because people take their

333
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:30,900
life too seriously sometimes.

334
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,960
Well, you know, we actually didn't do that until that movie.

335
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,100
Oh, really?

336
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,380
I stayed in character

337
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,700
for years and years.

338
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,720
A couple of things happened. Somebody outed me

339
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,620
on Facebook, and suddenly

340
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:45,500
I was Doug Smith instead of

341
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,680
Ivan Stang. And I kind of like

342
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,920
being Doug Smith again.

343
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,460
It was kind of new and different.

344
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,680
And I'd still be

345
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,940
Ivan Stang, you know,

346
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,860
but screw Facebook anyway.

347
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,780
The

348
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,340
secret hierarchy we

349
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,540
use Telegram,

350
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,260
but we have our special tiny

351
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,280
news group of like six

352
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:07,720
people.

353
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:11,100
A little insider secret there.

354
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,500
We use Telegram too.

355
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,500
All the original, you might

356
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,580
say there's about a dozen, maybe 15,

357
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:17,740
20

358
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,220
people who are really

359
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,220
contributing heavily in the 80s.

360
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,400
And almost all of them are still

361
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:24,680
alive.

362
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:27,860
A couple of them hate

363
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:29,660
the subgenius now.

364
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,200
It's too bad.

365
00:19:31,340 --> 00:19:32,600
Because one guy,

366
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,640
two guys that hate subgenius

367
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,160
have the biggest

368
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,300
Dobbs heads you've ever seen tattooed

369
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:39,960
on their back.

370
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,920
Or one guy has one and

371
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,260
takes up his whole arm and he just

372
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,140
hates it now.

373
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,920
Dumbasses. Anyway.

374
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,760
But most of us are

375
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,600
still friends and

376
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:59,540
almost all of them were in that movie.

377
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:00,960
Do you think that's a testament?

378
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,380
To living your life cultivating

379
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,300
slack? I think, you know, there's,

380
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,060
you know, proven scientific

381
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:09,100
data that shows in certain cultures

382
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,200
there's a, you know, correlation

383
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,400
there. But what do you think within this small

384
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,680
sort of subculture with slack

385
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,620
playing into people's mental

386
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,960
health as much as I hate using that term?

387
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,600
Well, I think a

388
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,140
sense of humor is a healthy thing

389
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,100
to have in this day and age.

390
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:28,380
They can't take it.

391
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,180
People don't have a sense of humor.

392
00:20:31,340 --> 00:20:33,340
They're really look bad.

393
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,400
They're like that all the time.

394
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,000
And they're usually morbidly obese and

395
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,740
full of anger.

396
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,800
Of course, that's what the Internet turned into.

397
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,040
Just an anger feeder.

398
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,480
It's such a shame.

399
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,580
You know, it was great when

400
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,480
only smart people knew about

401
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,600
it and subgeniuses, smart

402
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:54,780
people and also subgeniuses.

403
00:20:54,780 --> 00:20:56,900
But then, you know, then pretty

404
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,980
soon everybody's grandma was

405
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,100
on the Internet and all the girls that had been

406
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,940
topless the next day made us take their

407
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,680
pictures down.

408
00:21:04,540 --> 00:21:06,380
All their naked pictures.

409
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:08,220
What's the motto, Ivan?

410
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:09,840
If they can't take a joke, fuck them.

411
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,680
Is that how it goes?

412
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:13,220
That's the only the only real rule

413
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:15,320
in the church is fuck them if they can't take

414
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:15,680
a joke.

415
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:18,620
Or if you're if there's if

416
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,680
there's children in the audience, you can say

417
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,500
if they can't not see the

418
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,160
humor of it, let them

419
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,180
mount up upon themselves.

420
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,780
That's the polite.

421
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,320
The radio, the broadcast radio before 11 o'clock

422
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:34,640
version.

423
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:37,480
The term you use for

424
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,320
weed kind of reminds me of what the

425
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,680
monkeys called cannabis on their

426
00:21:42,680 --> 00:21:43,820
old TV show.

427
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,520
Is there any correlation there?

428
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:47,080
Any connection to the monkey?

429
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,100
What did they call it?

430
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:50,740
I think they called it frop or

431
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:53,580
froth or something along those lines.

432
00:21:53,780 --> 00:21:56,560
So no, frop was strictly from us.

433
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,740
OK, the monkeys did have a song

434
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:05,140
called Bob Dobalina calling Bob Dobalina.

435
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:05,340
Right.

436
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,320
Totally by coincidence.

437
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:11,420
I didn't really remember that song, although

438
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,240
technically I first record album.

439
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,940
It wasn't a movie soundtrack I ever bought

440
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:18,040
was a monkey sound.

441
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,740
But Bob's a real person.

442
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,520
What did Bob do?

443
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,820
He had Bob Dobalina on it, but that wasn't

444
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,400
where his name came from.

445
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,620
That was something somebody else pointed out

446
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,080
later.

447
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:28,320
You know, there's a lot of things like that.

448
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,160
It's just how do you do it?

449
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,260
You know, I think it's a great song.

450
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:29,260


451
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:29,300
I think it's a great song.

452
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:29,300


453
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,020
Wow.

454
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,640
He's a bobsman at this moment.

455
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:34,240
Do you think anybody else smoked

456
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,940
frop for the first time and was

457
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:39,440
transmitted to

458
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,700
a cave in Tibet?

459
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:44,140
Well, Philo says that's how it started for him.

460
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,540
So not just you.

461
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,520
Other others have had.

462
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:47,880
Oh, yeah.

463
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:51,240
That's the standard for all the early hierarchy

464
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,580
where we're higher up in that way.

465
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:55,340
Sort of like a gang jump in.

466
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,920
You notice we.

467
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,160
Yeah, you got to get some.

468
00:22:59,300 --> 00:22:59,540
We have to.

469
00:22:59,660 --> 00:23:00,240
That's right.

470
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,420
We have to use these special pillows with a little hole in.

471
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:07,220
What?

472
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:07,780
How much?

473
00:23:07,780 --> 00:23:07,920
Right.

474
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,520
Some stuff.

475
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,120
Are there different tiers in?

476
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:15,360
So if I buy in right at twenty nine dollars, I'm a deacon, right?

477
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,400
If I buy in.

478
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:16,980
Yeah, yeah.

479
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,240
There's a there's a here.

480
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,340
I'll pull out one of these doctorates in your in your marvelous pack.

481
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,140
It's these.

482
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:27,320
Wow.

483
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,280
I didn't know they were so hard to take apart.

484
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,280


485
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,940
Take your time.

486
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,780
Kind of looks like an older Bob, right?

487
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,640
I haven't.

488
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,280
Are you, Bob?

489
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,280
Are you kidding?

490
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,440
No, Bob kind of looks like Ward.

491
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:41,700
I don't like anything like Bob.

492
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:46,480
Yeah, this line here shows the or the high E pops.

493
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,640
That's what Bob is.

494
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,520
It doesn't really give a price.

495
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,880
Says, please inquire.

496
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,920
Be an over man for one hundred thousand bucks.

497
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:57,060
An X man for ten thousand.

498
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,380
I'm more of an X man.

499
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:04,700
High pope of the unpredictable five grand supreme supervisor for a thousand bucks.

500
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,640
We actually had a few supreme supervisor.

501
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:07,560
That's a deal.

502
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,200
That's a steel.

503
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:09,420
A plastic card.

504
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,500
Was that man?

505
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,240
Twenty five bucks.

506
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,340
Drone man.

507
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,000
Ten bucks.

508
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,100
High priest to the repeater ship.

509
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,920
Six bucks for one dollar.

510
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,340
You could be a whiz master.

511
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:21,560
I want whiz master.

512
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:25,380
So these are signed by Bob with a well.

513
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:27,540
It's printed.

514
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:28,360
What?

515
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,360


516
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,360


517
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,360


518
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,360


519
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,360


520
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,360


521
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,360


522
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:28,360


523
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:28,460
Yeah.

524
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:33,060
And even even it has my signature and phylo signature.

525
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,540
But they were actually rubber stamps.

526
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,320
They're printed versions of rubber stamps of our signatures.

527
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:42,960
So I've been double cheating there.

528
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:49,000
How much do you think Bob has had his hand in all of these ancient religions?

529
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,120
Because if we look back, we have these right.

530
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:56,420
You had a psychedelic experience where Bob revealed himself.

531
00:24:56,420 --> 00:25:01,260
So if you have Helena Blavatsky talking about the ascended masters, is Bob an ascended

532
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:01,660
master?

533
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,720
Is he some sort of?

534
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:07,140
Well, Bob himself is only about eighty eight years old.

535
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,720
We figure it.

536
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,320
But there's always been Bob's.

537
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,440
And of course, we also we let's face it.

538
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:20,160
I mean, we we created a monster from the parts of dead religions.

539
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:23,020
We dug up dead religions.

540
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,280
We took the best parts.

541
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,820
And we stitched them all together.

542
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:32,920
Frank and there's you know, there's your do it yourself religion.

543
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,520
One size fits all.

544
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,980
Now once and for all, can we can we settle blanks?

545
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:45,960
But there wasn't Bob that started all those religions.

546
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:50,160
But the alien that calls itself Jehovah one.

547
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,120
Right.

548
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:54,280
It has masqueraded as a god.

549
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:55,940
It's a retarded alien.

550
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,400
For sure.

551
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,360
It's a retarded alien.

552
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,260
It's an exist actually from Planet X.

553
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,460
But it's a kind of a differently abled one.

554
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,020
And it's lived on Earth for thousands and thousands of years.

555
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:18,240
It started the Zoroastrians and of course, the Hebrews and the Roman stuff is based on

556
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,500
Wotan is another name, Odin, so forth.

557
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:25,320
Now, they're all the same monster.

558
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,380
It's all big and big.

559
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,040
It's a visible space monster in the sky.

560
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:28,700
Right.

561
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,620
It is a monster.

562
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,600
Now, right.

563
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:32,160
This is definitely a mark.

564
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:34,140
Has this been not gone?

565
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,920
Has this been brought up before?

566
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,080
I've seen a group going by the name pasta.

567
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:40,820
Farians.

568
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,520
Are those guys just copying the Church of the subgenius?

569
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,700
Is there a beef between the two?

570
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,360
Oh, no, no, not at all.

571
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:54,780
They were they were well, you know, they were started as kind of a protest against something.

572
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,360
You know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like, you know, it's like,

573
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:56,360


574
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:56,360


575
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:59,260
you know, the flying spaghetti monster.

576
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:00,760
Believe the flying.

577
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:04,960
I mean, they did some guy just decide, okay, my religion is the flying spaghetti monster.

578
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,560
I'm going to stick with it.

579
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,120
I think he was at the DMV.

580
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,220
And it was, you know, a lot of people picked up on it.

581
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,160
And they've, you know, they've been going strong.

582
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:20,600
They're probably they may be better known to the normal world at large than the Church

583
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,660
of the subgenius is.

584
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,620
But, you know, they came along a lot later.

585
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:26,340
I mean, you know, there's a lot of people who are like, Oh, we're going to get a new

586
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,340


587
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,340


588
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,340


589
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,340


590
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,340


591
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:26,340


592
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:29,040
person and we do it all the time.

593
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,180
They're going to try to tell us the truth because the media everywhere is trying to

594
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:38,300
make people believe us, but they still cannot have some sort of basic truth.

595
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:38,300


596
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,380
And now we're talking about Ruby's issue B

597
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,800
finite number.

598
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:48,840
And so we cannot have that dunno if that was the only background.

599
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:49,100
You call families racist.

600
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:49,480
It was all completely anti racist.

601
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,840
That's the whole person.

602
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,100
Yeah.

603
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,020
Yes.

604
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,120
Right.

605
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:02,520
bob like it was actually chichi rodriguez the golfer but they they suddenly people you know

606
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:09,840
we were afraid that that oftentimes we came first but people got mixed up there's a talking heads

607
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:17,060
or david burns song called puzzling evidence well when he made his movie true stories he was going

608
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:23,060
to have a subgenius devival scene in it with and that was the song that was going to be in it and

609
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:30,820
i was supposed to do the collage image projections and our pope david meyer was going to be the

610
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:36,400
preacher but as soon as hollywood money came in suddenly oh we didn't have enough of a track

611
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:41,520
record and they had to change it all but so but they still had that song puzzling evidence

612
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:47,820
and there's a lot of similarity subgenius in that scene because it was supposed to be us originally

613
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:51,740
and he was shooting he shot that thing in the dallas area too

614
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:59,700
that that wasn't i mean i understand how that how that works when suddenly somebody else's foot in

615
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:05,100
the bill like they really get to call the shots and who gets hired and it wasn't us

616
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:13,100
that wasn't david burns good subgenius he bought two memberships outside of that one uh secret

617
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:19,460
service run in were there any other conspiracies that were covered within the pamphlet or talked

618
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,720
about that maybe ruffled some feathers or maybe broke

619
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:30,240
some news oh there have been fbi offices in in well like in cleveland there was some clueless

620
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:37,060
dipshit at the fbi office there who thought we were going to all heaven's gate ourselves in 1998

621
00:29:37,060 --> 00:29:42,840
and called the campground the sheriff actually called the sheriff at this little town where

622
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:49,740
where our events were held back down in new upstate new york western new york and the sheriff

623
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,300
listened to this guy go oh subgenius is older

624
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:57,980
he immediately called the campground owner goes frank you're not gonna believe this

625
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:06,240
fbi is so stupid i thought the subgeniuses are for real at the same time though i mean we are

626
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:11,220
for real there's thousands and thousands of ministers out there i really don't know how

627
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:16,940
so many have disappeared but i would say at least 40 000 people have sent us

628
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:22,760
that have actually sent the 35 bucks or whatever we were charging and this is a good

629
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:30,420
math for a long time it was like it's more like two a day now some years it was six a day

00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,040


665
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,240


666
00:33:23,040 --> 00:33:23,040

00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,060
érer

668
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:31,180
the war, Hedy Lamarr, who also appeared in the nude in Gustav Machgati's astonishing

669
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:35,940
film, Ecstasy, the sensation of pre-war Europe.

670
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:43,600
After she came to Hollywood, she starred with Bob Hope in a series of disgusting comedies.

671
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,680
No, actually, I'm not sure that is true.

672
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,480
No, that's not true.

673
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,460
Oh, okay, good.

674
00:33:47,540 --> 00:33:48,040
Thank God.

675
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,460
I'm glad that that didn't happen.

676
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,220
Well, she was pretty, she was very, uh...

677
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:53,820
How about Samson and Delilah?

678
00:33:54,020 --> 00:33:55,180
Wasn't she Delilah?

679
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,500
Yes, she was Delilah.

680
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:57,960
She was delightful.

681
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,680
Delilah, delightful.

682
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:00,860
Yeah.

683
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:03,260
Or Nancy Kovac dancing.

684
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,340
She was the inventor of frequency hopping.

685
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:06,480
That's what it was.

686
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:07,560
Is that like the Lindy Hop?

687
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,360
Hedy Lamarr's.

688
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,060
More frequent.

689
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:15,640
That was the precursor to cell phone towers, being able to...

690
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:16,620
Cell, cell, cell.

691
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:19,020
...drive between them and frequency hopping.

692
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,140
Yeah, she quit school at age 16.

693
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:25,180
And got a job working for director Max Reinhardt.

694
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,000
That's right.

695
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:29,700
Originally, her name was Heidi Kaisler.

696
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:34,280
But in Hollywood, she became Hedy Lamarr.

697
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,480
Ecstasy was a Czech film.

698
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,480
That's a Czech.

699
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,300
That's in Czechoslovakian.

700
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,620
It was not a Czech flick.

701
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,540
The young men liked it, though.

702
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:52,200
And then, her husband attempted to buy up all prints of the embarrassing film, which, over time, was sold out.

703
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:52,200


704
00:34:52,220 --> 00:34:54,680
He sold his wife, making love, and having them destroyed.

705
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:56,960
In this, he was unsuccessful.

706
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:02,120
And the film can probably be seen today on the Internet.

707
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,160
I haven't looked.

708
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
Everything can.

709
00:35:06,900 --> 00:35:13,380
When she was 20, she married a man 30 years her senior, who was an arms merchant, selling munitions to Germany.

710
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:18,000
Yes, he sold munitions for the coming war.

711
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:21,960
And he was the one who attempted to make money.

712
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,860
He was pretty dominant.

713
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:26,140
She had to escape by drugging her maid.

714
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:28,040
Hedy knew.

715
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,820
Bars and guns and calibers and projectiles and all of it.

716
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:44,060
And synthesized it into valuable technology used in the submarine warfare, which characterized the Second World War, particularly its early years.

717
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:51,100
Neither she nor Antheil were scientists, but one afternoon, she realized,

718
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:54,220
We're talking and changing frequencies all the time.

719
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:57,120
At that moment, the concept of frequency hopping was born.

720
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:00,260
I understand you're technical.

721
00:36:00,740 --> 00:36:10,960
They used a player piano, using a modified player piano roll, and both the torpedo and the transmitter, the changing frequencies could also be in sync.

722
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,300
The constantly changing frequency cannot be jammed.

723
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,420
Everything but the kitchen sink.

724
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:19,440
So his concepts came from the player piano.

725
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:26,020
Her concepts came from the weaponry, machinery, which you've become familiar with.

726
00:36:26,220 --> 00:36:29,600
So what a great marriage there.

727
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:36,380
And now, let's continue with the last of the Ask Dr. Howell Show, live on Puzzling Evidence.

728
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:44,660
Radio featuring Pete Goldie, Rusty Rebar, Michael Pepe, and Puzzling Evidence.

729
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:47,280
I'm Dr. Howell and Howell.

730
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,880
It feels really good to be back from the break.

731
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:52,920
The brink, you say?

732
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:53,980
No, the break.

733
00:36:54,220 --> 00:36:54,860
Oh, the break.

734
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,300
Yeah, right, the break.

735
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:57,240
The break that we had.

736
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:57,900
It was such a long...

737
00:36:58,540 --> 00:37:00,540
Yeah, you know, you gotta put the breaks on sometimes.

738
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,520
All right, all right, simmer down.

739
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,420
Now look...

740
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:06,820
We're all back now.

741
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,780
We all ran away for a while.

742
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:11,460
Well, then, stand up for yourself.

743
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:12,480
Be proactive.

744
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:13,980
Shoulders back.

745
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,060
Thumbs along the seams of the crowd.

746
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:18,080
And what are the...

747
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,780
You mean to say costumed superheroes are given awards for their costumes?

748
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:26,740
They're given awards for something or other.

749
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,640
I just work there.

750
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,400
I don't know exactly what it is.

751
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,020
Yeah, that's right, Michael.

752
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,060
They're not real superheroes.

753
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,300
I had read it out.

754
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,660
I'm thinking they're like the L.A. guys.

755
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:37,340
There's a guy dressed like Gumby.

756
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,620
You know, I get an award.

757
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,000
They're not gonna get an award for saving the planet.

758
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,740
No, nobody's doing that.

759
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,740
In fact, they're farming the planet.

760
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:45,120
All they didn't put a costume on.

761
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:45,660
They're doing it for the planet.

762
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:45,660


763
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:45,660


764
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:45,660


765
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,680
I don't think they should give any more awards.

766
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:48,120
I don't think they should give any more awards.

767
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,620
...and destroying the tranquility with the endless throbbing music that you thought

768
00:37:52,620 --> 00:37:54,840
you escaped by not being at Burning Man.

769
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:58,380
Now it's back and it's coming at you from every direction.

770
00:37:58,380 --> 00:37:58,580
Wow.

771
00:37:58,880 --> 00:37:59,480
Then...

772
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:00,120
Why wasn't I there?

773
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:02,940
...prepare for subliminal puzzling evidence.

774
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:03,860
Radio program.

775
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,460
Information burst.

776
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:05,980
Squirt.

777
00:38:06,120 --> 00:38:06,660
Boop.

778
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:12,040
You see, on this show, you're always in an action-packed movie.

779
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,120
Things happen.

780
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,100
And you're always in a movie.

781
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,100


782
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,100


783
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,180
So, you're not asking me to say anything.

784
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,180


785
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,180


786
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,180


787
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,180


788
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:17,740
And that's great.

789
00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:17,760
...a huge advantage of this show.

790
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:17,760


791
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,040
Thank you.

792
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,380
Now, return to your scheduled programming.

793
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:22,960
And you're listening to The Ask Dr. Hal Show.

794
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,680
...to shoot up all these...

795
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:23,680


796
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:24,440
...Live on radio.

797
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:24,540
...Live on radio.

798
00:38:24,540 --> 00:38:27,920
Well, there is no Soviet Union anymore, so we've vanquished them.

799
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,560
Thanks a lot.

800
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:28,740
They all show that.

801
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:29,780
All right.

802
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:35,760
You see, on this show, you're always in an action-packed movie.

803
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:38,140
And there's always parking.

804
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,620
Anything could happen while you can.

805
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,460
There's always parking.

806
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:45,620
It would be interesting to have some kind of puzzling evidence.

807
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,580
And this was offered as a gag.

808
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:49,080
Right.

809
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:58,320
And now reality once again has caught up to what was a silly jade back then, just a few short years ago.

810
00:38:58,500 --> 00:38:59,760
Very few short years.

811
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:02,100
And I couldn't believe it when I saw it.

812
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,860
I mean, but apparently they do pay attention.

813
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:09,280
I'm sure a lot of humans would like the puzzling evidence.

814
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:14,100
Channel one, too, because it's unthreatening and, you know, cute and everything.

815
00:39:14,380 --> 00:39:18,760
And I don't think they're necessarily the pampered ones in that you can think of it.

816
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,840
It's just a channel, I suppose.

817
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:26,980
How much does a channel cost for a month to rent?

818
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,860
A dollar a month or I don't know.

819
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:32,600
Well, and what you require is what we call an adapter in the radio.

820
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,820
You want both channels, do you?

821
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:36,640
Yeah.

822
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:39,260
I'll ask the front office about that.

823
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:42,540
Perhaps we'll see if in time that may be granted.

824
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,380
Can I call customer service?

825
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:46,180
She doesn't even have the number of this.

826
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,200
Maybe.

827
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:47,680
Yeah.

828
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,260
Let's call someone from India.

829
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:50,700
Your hearing is important to us.

830
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,100
Please stand by.

831
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:54,640
We can take phone calls here at the Ask Dr. Hal show.

832
00:39:54,780 --> 00:40:00,680
But on the other hand, they're mostly more trouble than they're worth and interrupt the flow of show.

833
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:07,340
That's one of the things a great show does is deals with the technical problems without necessarily talking about it.

834
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:08,220
Yes.

835
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:08,920
Next weekend.

836
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:14,060
With the US government, we will function after a nuclear war or a near earthquake.

837
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,380
Oh, this is good.

838
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,180
This is also.

839
00:40:17,020 --> 00:40:20,820
We have given our pledge our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor.

840
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:25,660
And we are coordinated with the North American Civil Defense Council.

841
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,380
Press it hard.

842
00:40:26,520 --> 00:40:27,820
Push it in all the way.

843
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,400
Yes.

844
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,300
Push it hard.

845
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,720
And the little switch on there.

846
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:36,920
She adjusted in your ears to the way you like it.

847
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:37,980
Just the perfect.

848
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,900
Now you've done it right.

849
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:42,740
Performed this incredibly arduous and difficult operation.

850
00:40:44,120 --> 00:40:46,760
The Witch of Kurose by Robert.

851
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,620
And this is, of course, going out over the air.

852
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,680
You can see this, folks.

853
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,340
I usually plug the Ask Dr. Hal show.

854
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:54,720
But my version.

855
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:55,400
Yes.

856
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,160
Live on radio.

857
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,680
At the Darkroom Theater.

858
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:00,340
Indeed.

859
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,060
On Mission Street.

860
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:01,980
Yes.

861
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,240
Our mission is educational.

862
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,720
At the Darkroom Theater.

863
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:06,640
I misspoke.

864
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,880
So you can do something else.

865
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:07,960
Yes.

866
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:09,000
It's cool on Saturday night.

867
00:41:09,080 --> 00:41:10,060
And still come.

868
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:15,440
You'll receive a better listen than the folks back home get.

869
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,020
Although that, of course, is optimal if possible.

870
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:18,780
Yes.

871
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:23,260
Anyway, now we can relax, settle back and enjoy.

872
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:24,420
But there.

873
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,140
Enjoy our discussion.

874
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:27,340
Where's the preacher presentation?

875
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,600
Well, the problem is that.

876
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:29,500
Now they're ruining.

877
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:30,720
Puzzling evidence.

878
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,540
They've made it a TV show, but it's all pulp.

879
00:41:34,580 --> 00:41:36,400
I don't think you can ruin it.

880
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:36,780
You can.

881
00:41:37,020 --> 00:41:37,780
I've seen.

882
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:40,760
I've seen two episodes of the TV show.

883
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,800
And the first one.

884
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:42,080
Your opinion.

885
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,040
The first one barely adequate.

886
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:46,040
The second one a terrible disappointment.

887
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,500
So it doesn't really fit that much into the puzzling evidence.

888
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:51,480
It will almost got it.

889
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,800
It's sort of like a sputtering engine that doesn't start.

890
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,160
Yeah, I'm surprised.

891
00:41:56,980 --> 00:42:01,940
Maybe they should have done what they did with everything else and start with a movie and then see.

892
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:03,720
No, I think they gave away all their story.

893
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,540
The first episode.

894
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,040
And everyone went, okay.

895
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:07,760
Well, we're going to have to.

896
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:12,660
Well, I had a lot of trouble a while back when Loki burst out of Asgard, but I think

897
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:13,860
they've got that under control.

898
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,900
But that's all been covered up.

899
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:16,620
Different movie.

900
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:19,060
They've covered all that up.

901
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,000
Oh, CIA.

902
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:22,220
It's called the Avengers.

903
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:23,640
It's what happened in New York.

904
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:24,780
You don't remember it to you.

905
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:25,300
I've got.

906
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:25,640
Yes.

907
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,400
They gave you a memory dusting.

908
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:28,480
So you wouldn't remember.

909
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:29,880
Of course it would be inconvenient.

910
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:31,320
I know.

911
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,600
I remember taking a test and I couldn't remember anything.

912
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:35,520
Yeah.

913
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,560
And I could go.

914
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:37,440
Well.

915
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,020
At least you've got the free show popcorn.

916
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:41,800
Yeah.

917
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,480
I got the popcorn and I didn't jump out of the window.

918
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,040
So.

919
00:42:46,180 --> 00:42:46,680
Right.

920
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:47,480
Not this time.

921
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,880
But did you have yours?

922
00:42:49,980 --> 00:42:50,680
All right.

923
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:51,220
Vanessa.

924
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,120
We have been had.

925
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:58,560
And so do all our brethren.

926
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:02,120
My brother had to take some of the CIA LSD tests.

927
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,120
You know, my very own brother who went to Vietnam.

928
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:06,200
Uh.

929
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:09,920
Came back in one piece because he went before the escalation.

930
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,420
Had to take in Boston.

931
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:18,780
Some tests that the CIA ordered him to take where they put him in a locked empty room.

932
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,160
And gave him LSD and looked at him through a one way window.

933
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:26,380
That's just the most unfun way to take LSD.

934
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:26,900
Exactly.

935
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:28,580
And that's why he had a chair and a table.

936
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:29,740
And.

937
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:31,120
Not much.

938
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:31,700
You can do.

939
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:32,420
LSD.

940
00:43:32,420 --> 00:43:34,340
They say they sell psychedelic chair and table.

941
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:34,700
Yeah.

942
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:35,620
I can't imagine.

943
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:41,060
I've I've tried several times to really get the full story and I can't get many details.

944
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,620
I don't think he remembers much.

945
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,520
Come sit down beside me and hear my sad story.

946
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,820
I think they paid him twenty five dollars.

947
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,200
He said something like that.

948
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:54,900
I've got to find out what I mean, because I can't imagine how horrible that might be.

949
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:57,920
Well, you put up with a lot in the service.

950
00:43:58,180 --> 00:43:58,640
Yeah.

951
00:43:58,900 --> 00:43:59,800
Holy smoke.

952
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:01,820
You can just experiment on me.

953
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,920
I'm just a guinea pig.

954
00:44:03,740 --> 00:44:05,680
I think it was a volunteer thing, though.

955
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:06,200
Well, yeah.

956
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,100
Yeah, I think it was.

957
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:09,480
I think he held his hand out and he got paid.

958
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:09,760
Yeah.

959
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,280
They paid him.

960
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:11,520
Yeah.

961
00:44:11,560 --> 00:44:12,840
Speaking of getting guinea pigs.

962
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:13,340
Yeah.

963
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:14,500
Fall in right now.

964
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:14,960
Yeah.

965
00:44:15,020 --> 00:44:16,320
You know, we'll pay you.

966
00:44:16,440 --> 00:44:16,920
All right.

967
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,020
I know that was a joke.

968
00:44:20,560 --> 00:44:21,360
NSA people.

969
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:21,860
Oh.

970
00:44:26,360 --> 00:44:26,760
Star.

971
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:27,960
Three headed northeast.

972
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,340
What did you stop for drive through?

973
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:29,780
No.

974
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,340
Which I'm unable to.

975
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:31,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

976
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:31,800


977
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:31,800


978
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:31,800


979
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:31,800


980
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:31,800


981
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:31,800


982
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,680
Yeah, yeah, it's pretty cool radio.

983
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:51,560
Well, at any rate, I was gonna say that speaking of warpין because I think that the

984
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:56,760
brave auxiliary gases went into his balls.

985
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,320
Now, let's get to this short clip.

986
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:01,320


987
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:03,260
are not quite creditable in what they do.

988
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:07,500
And the TV show didn't really have the fire.

989
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:08,840
Survivors show up.

990
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:09,780
He's still gone.

991
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,620
Something like that, yeah.

992
00:45:10,740 --> 00:45:11,240
He was there.

993
00:45:11,340 --> 00:45:11,640
Fortunately.

994
00:45:11,900 --> 00:45:12,920
But I'm not here.

995
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,160
Yeah.

996
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:15,940
And of course the...

997
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:20,240
And that's it.

998
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,460
I think they go to that place

999
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:25,740
where the soldier heaves the cannon

1000
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,220
in the bronze statue.

1001
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:29,300
Doesn't he feel well?

1002
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:30,760
Or is it the one...

1003
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,280
Or is he...

1004
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:32,740
Is he the one...

1005
00:45:32,740 --> 00:45:33,800
He's the...

1006
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:34,760
Trying to think now.

1007
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:38,080
No, he's steering the ship of state perhaps naked.

1008
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:39,140
He is.

1009
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:39,480
And you know,

1010
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:40,880
because Ed Holmes has

1011
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:44,740
the St. Stupid celebration there every year.

1012
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:46,980
It's not just St. Stupid,

1013
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,740
but everyone who crosses the line

1014
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,380
has to undergo a humiliating ritual at sea.

1015
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:52,980
You have heard of it, no doubt,

1016
00:45:53,060 --> 00:45:56,760
where one pays a call to the court of King Neptune

1017
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,900
and he's tormenting myrmidons.

1018
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:00,440
Really?

1019
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:02,620
I didn't know it was a one-way trip.

1020
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:03,840
You didn't know if you're a sailor,

1021
00:46:03,900 --> 00:46:04,840
you go over the line,

1022
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:06,340
they're going to paint your ass blue

1023
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,820
and make you do all sorts of things

1024
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,080
far worse than any fraternity initiation.

1025
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:11,700
Yeah.

1026
00:46:11,780 --> 00:46:14,760
Certainly an ancient tradition of the sea.

1027
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,200
Yes, indeed.

1028
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:17,380
Well, what do you remember...

1029
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:19,700
An old salty dog like you ought to remember,

1030
00:46:19,900 --> 00:46:20,660
a shipmate, eh?

1031
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:23,480
Considering the voyages we went on.

1032
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:25,600
You do remember some of those, right?

1033
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:27,940
Well, which voyages?

1034
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:29,460
The ones that we went on.

1035
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,540
You and I.

1036
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:31,240
Oh, of course.

1037
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:35,220
You surely remember the one that ended in a slapping contest

1038
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,660
where you and the girl were slapping each other's face

1039
00:46:39,660 --> 00:46:42,360
at first playfully and then less so.

1040
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:43,920
Aboard our ship.

1041
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:45,100
You remember that one?

1042
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:46,800
She was confined to a wheel.

1043
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:47,760
Her and Hedy Lamarr, yeah.

1044
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:50,020
There's a few actresses you can look at.

1045
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:52,840
Well, you know we were talking about Hedy

1046
00:46:52,840 --> 00:46:55,720
on the Puzzling Evidence show this morning.

1047
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,820
You ought to get a radio station show or something.

1048
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:00,340
And her many...

1049
00:47:00,880 --> 00:47:01,280
accomplishments.

1050
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:04,960
No, she'll be white, but then the next one will be...

1051
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:06,900
It will be the Puzzling Evidence show.

1052
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,980
And we're on the next one now.

1053
00:47:09,020 --> 00:47:09,620
Yes, Red Fox.

1054
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:10,480
...Evidence show.

1055
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,060
And there it is.

1056
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,400
Wow, power levels on the red here.

1057
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,240
Just like that.

1058
00:47:14,340 --> 00:47:14,360
Okay, that's fine.

1059
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:16,380
Fast song has occurred.

1060
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:18,700
And the show has begun.

1061
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,880
You know, Red Fox would make a great person.

1062
00:47:20,200 --> 00:47:21,840
You're in the middle of the night again.

1063
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,480
We're kind of...

1064
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,560
We're kind of...

1065
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:27,660
Who does this stuff?

1066
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:29,300
It's crazy or something.

1067
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,060
Oh, what is that weird noise?

1068
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,100
That's the sound of a...

1069
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:34,200
It's the connection.

1070
00:47:35,260 --> 00:47:35,880
...spaceship...

1071
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,680
...throttling its control mechanisms.

1072
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:43,660
Slightly.

1073
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:45,380
Just enough to stay in orbit.

1074
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:48,740
Hmm.

1075
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,240
Somewhere in that connection is that white noise.

1076
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:52,740
But it's...

1077
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,140
...it's so comforting.

1078
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:55,700
Oh, the white noise.

1079
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:08,260
I thought you were talking about the pink noise or the blue noise good morning testic yes

1080
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:14,340
that's and fabulous

1081
00:48:14,340 --> 00:48:14,820
yes

1082
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:27,640
had a statistics professor that used to use that term a lot fantabulous spooktacular

1083
00:48:31,840 --> 00:48:33,720
he would say fantastic

1084
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:41,940
generally while he was moving his ponderous ball across the

1085
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:51,200
the chalk tray on the blackboard dragging the chalk and then and the erasers and whatever

1086
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:57,840
else might be on that chalk tray dragging it off and knocking it onto the floor as he moved

1087
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:05,280
his way across the massively long formula he was riding on the on the wall there just to prove

1088
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:12,840
just to prove things he was always saying this is proof and then he would write a long long long

1089
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:21,160
that we were expected to write down and remember well not remember

1090
00:49:24,940 --> 00:49:33,840
put you to sleep too huh hey wake up over there buddy you can't do that on the puzzling evidence

1091
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:43,040
show what do you think you are are you doc dr how doctor house Lee where's Dr how he's on the show

1092
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:43,940
he's sleeping

1093
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:50,040
the show what he does he's right there he's got dr howe hooked up to the show and that's what we get

1094
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:55,120
tonight it's just yep he's just gonna sleep he's just hooked up to the show electronically yeah

1095
00:49:55,800 --> 00:50:02,240
this is a fart strike right so bart put wi-fi over the entire city he's making a strike and he's

1096
00:50:02,240 --> 00:50:08,560
afraid he's afraid because it's nice to put the fear in a lot of people and they don't know what

1097
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:12,820
they're going to do now and they're looking out the window now lonely and afraid and they're

1098
00:50:12,820 --> 00:50:17,760
eating cold toast with no butter right and they're gathering at the barge station but there's nobody

1099
00:50:17,760 --> 00:50:22,320
there they're just going to stand out front and with their little their little cards out just

1100
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:27,320
with their card out or their they'll have their arm in the air as if they're hanging from a strap

1101
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:33,700
looking at their iphone hoping and wishing that somehow through that through that symbolic action

1102
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:41,500
they will suddenly appear at their place of employment if i just emulate how i how i'm

1103
00:50:41,500 --> 00:50:42,260
supposed to be

1104
00:50:42,820 --> 00:50:50,800
when i'm riding the bark maybe that will transcend me into a plane of transitional movement

1105
00:50:51,780 --> 00:51:00,420
in my mind i'm consciously expanding this sound like molecular quote me bob 14 justification

1106
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:07,900
well whatever you need to quote to justify is something we need this morning

1107
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:12,740
we need your quotes because your quotes are like

1108
00:51:12,820 --> 00:51:35,920
money to america you get hit as a free man off a시고 crap we cut out all our people because

1109
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:41,520
we're too funny we're having problems the people we're humiliated are create issues

1110
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,140
and beyond what we have we use those quotes or the people we hatewoods the people of china

1111
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:42,800
or eric rising 1948 when plastic is replaced in the either west indiana there's a chemical

1112
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:48,640
to help the people, just like Bart wants to help the people, help the people get to work.

1113
00:51:50,940 --> 00:51:53,320
But not too much.

1114
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,420
I mean, we'll only have so much to help the people.

1115
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:00,060
Yeah, I don't want them to do too much work.

1116
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:06,060
I don't want them to have to work so hard that they don't feel like they're not compensated properly

1117
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:10,660
and feel like they don't want to help the people.

1118
00:52:10,660 --> 00:52:16,120
Well, that'd be a bummer, not having people that are supposed to help the people not want to help the people.

1119
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:16,660
Yeah.

1120
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:20,640
Especially when all the people want to do is get to work.

1121
00:52:20,740 --> 00:52:25,020
They just want to work, just like the Bart people want to work.

1122
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,700
They just want to work for more money, just like everybody else.

1123
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:30,860
Just like Michael Pepe.

1124
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:32,940
Just like me.

1125
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:36,180
I like to work less for more money, though.

1126
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:38,920
It's a little bit of a twist that I put on it.

1127
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:42,020
Work less for more money.

1128
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:43,660
Work less for more money.

1129
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:44,700
That's my slogan.

1130
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:45,340
Yeah, yeah.

1131
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,140
I agree.

1132
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,820
Work less and less for more and more.

1133
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:50,660
Less and less for more and more.

1134
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,640
That's a good slogan, I think.

1135
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:55,160
Yeah.

1136
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:58,520
Especially for 10 minutes to 4 in the morning.

1137
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:00,380
Yeah, if that's where you are.

1138
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:02,040
You should not be working.

1139
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:03,620
You're thinking, yeah, it's 4 in the morning.

1140
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:04,820
Less work, more money.

1141
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,340
And if you're working right now at 4 in the morning,

1142
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,360
I would implore you just to sit down

1143
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:14,720
and don't do anything for the next 5 minutes

1144
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:16,380
while you're on the clock.

1145
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:20,480
Tell them I told you that.

1146
00:53:20,740 --> 00:53:23,540
Say, that guy on the radio told me to do that.

1147
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,020
When your boss says,

1148
00:53:26,180 --> 00:53:27,800
hey, how come you're just sitting around?

1149
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:29,880
You're supposed to be screwing that nut on that bolt.

1150
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:33,360
How come you're not doing your job?

1151
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:37,260
Because that guy on the radio told me not to for 5 minutes.

1152
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:38,900
That's what you should say.

1153
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:41,100
And he'll go, oh, okay, I got you.

1154
00:53:41,140 --> 00:53:42,320
All right, well, hang in there.

1155
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:43,620
Thanks for being honest.

1156
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:46,420
And obey your radio.

1157
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,000
Obey your radio.

1158
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,260
Always do what the radio says.

1159
00:53:52,740 --> 00:53:55,760
Especially the puzzling evidence show radio show.

1160
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,900
Where we say show in the title at least twice,

1161
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:02,540
maybe sometimes thrice.

1162
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:02,760
Yeah.

1163
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,700
Just so people understand, don't get confused

1164
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,860
and drive off into the park.

1165
00:54:08,900 --> 00:54:10,320
The column that holds up the BART train

1166
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,860
because that would make things even worse.

1167
00:54:12,100 --> 00:54:14,720
Or not only that, they might even drive onto the BART track

1168
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:16,000
thinking they're a BART train

1169
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:17,500
and try to start carrying people.

1170
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,680
Yeah, come on, everybody.

1171
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:19,320
Let's oops.

1172
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:20,620
Yeah, what a nightmare.

1173
00:54:20,620 --> 00:54:23,060
They'll just drive their bus onto the BART track.

1174
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:25,360
Their home, their RV.

1175
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,700
They'll drive their RV onto the BART track.

1176
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:29,200
Because people always try to help.

1177
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:30,420
People try to help

1178
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,520
and they try to improvise where they can.

1179
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:34,320
And what a BART,

1180
00:54:34,340 --> 00:54:37,060
the RV is a lot like a BART train

1181
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:38,540
if it's on the track.

1182
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,400
That's the important distinction.

1183
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,920
It's got to be on the track.

1184
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,780
And the rims would send up lots of sparks.

1185
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:45,620
It'd be really pretty and really helpful.

1186
00:54:45,720 --> 00:54:47,020
It'd be great and helpful.

1187
00:54:47,620 --> 00:54:49,020
And the people on the BART,

1188
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,060
that are on the BART track,

1189
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:50,620
they would understand.

1190
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:52,840
that are waiting for the BART train

1191
00:54:52,840 --> 00:54:53,700
that's never come,

1192
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:55,120
they'll be so happy

1193
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:56,280
because they're going to be hungry

1194
00:54:56,280 --> 00:54:57,540
and they're trying to get some food.

1195
00:54:58,180 --> 00:54:59,400
They want to get some food

1196
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:00,640
they can put on their people.

1197
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:01,720
On their people.

1198
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:02,440
Yeah.

1199
00:55:02,780 --> 00:55:03,660
And they would say,

1200
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,340
look everybody, the BART is coming.

1201
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:06,780
I can get food on my people.

1202
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:07,260
I can get food on,

1203
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,760
put some food on my people.

1204
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:10,320
I'm trying to,

1205
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:12,560
I've been trying to put food on my people

1206
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:13,660
and BART won't help me.

1207
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:15,560
But now they do and I'm glad.

1208
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:16,840
But now, BART is helping.

1209
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:18,180
I'm glad.

1210
00:55:18,540 --> 00:55:20,940
Yes, we are all glad that BART is helping.

1211
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:22,600
And you are helping BART

1212
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:23,740
by driving on the tracks.

1213
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:25,220
And putting food on the people.

1214
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:25,860
Yep.

1215
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,060
Because people on,

1216
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:28,860
people with food on them is good.

1217
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,400
They would ride the BART

1218
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,660
if you're driving on the tracks in your RV.

1219
00:55:33,000 --> 00:55:34,060
Because they would trust you.

1220
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:34,520
They would say,

1221
00:55:34,580 --> 00:55:35,840
thank you substitute BART.

1222
00:55:36,020 --> 00:55:36,820
And they'd say,

1223
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:37,980
good morning, sir.

1224
00:55:38,900 --> 00:55:39,020
Okay.

1225
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:40,060
Where's my door?

1226
00:55:40,060 --> 00:55:40,540
We're happy.

1227
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:43,880
We're happy that we don't have to stand out front

1228
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,640
wishing and hoping that BART was open.

1229
00:55:46,740 --> 00:55:48,880
We're happy that you've taken up the slack.

1230
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:50,680
You've actually, you know,

1231
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:52,260
done some improvising here.

1232
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,180
You've been thinking outside the box.

1233
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:59,000
You've been thinking outside the circle too.

1234
00:56:01,380 --> 00:56:02,560
You've been thinking outside

1235
00:56:03,240 --> 00:56:07,020
somewhere that we can't even put a description on.

1236
00:56:07,880 --> 00:56:08,880
You've been thinking outside the circle.

1237
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:10,220
You've been thinking outside the amorphous,

1238
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,980
unnamed area.

1239
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:15,540
And there you said,

1240
00:56:15,660 --> 00:56:16,220
good morning,

1241
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:17,700
too many times.

1242
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,880
Way too many times.

1243
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:20,680
Really?

1244
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:21,680
Is that what happened?

1245
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,720
Yeah, but the important thing is,

1246
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:27,000
we support you,

1247
00:56:27,680 --> 00:56:28,540
whoever you are,

1248
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,460
and whatever your endeavor is.

1249
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,080
You got the support

1250
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,200
and the,

1251
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:38,060
well, not the endorsement.

1252
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:38,820
We can't actually,

1253
00:56:38,820 --> 00:56:39,980
we can't actually give you an endorsement.

1254
00:56:40,320 --> 00:56:42,640
You'd have to pay us a lot of money to do that.

1255
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:43,840
And we can't take money

1256
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,520
or talk about taking money

1257
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:48,740
or even things that have a cost.

1258
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:51,700
Beyond currency, we cannot go.

1259
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:52,780
Yeah.

1260
00:56:53,380 --> 00:56:56,140
We would just rather think about nut bits.

1261
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,120
We're going to start charging nut bits.

1262
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:01,040
Or nut bits.

1263
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:01,600
Bit nuts.

1264
00:57:02,140 --> 00:57:03,380
What, governance?

1265
00:57:04,740 --> 00:57:05,280
Governments?

1266
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:07,960
20 governments of slack

1267
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,640
is how much we're going to charge.

1268
00:57:12,780 --> 00:57:15,360
Can you pay your 20 governments of slack?

1269
00:57:15,460 --> 00:57:16,020
It's a lot.

1270
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:17,500
I know it's a lot to ask.

1271
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:19,520
I wouldn't ask it

1272
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,960
if I didn't think you could do it, though.

1273
00:57:21,040 --> 00:57:22,640
If you didn't think you had it in you

1274
00:57:22,640 --> 00:57:25,860
to reach down to the bottom of your bootstraps

1275
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:27,420
and pull yourself up

1276
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,180
by your own petards,

1277
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:30,980
standing in the air like that,

1278
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:32,800
hoisting yourself.

1279
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:35,760
Hoist away, I say.

1280
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,660
The puzzling evidence shows

1281
00:57:37,660 --> 00:57:38,420
that we're not just here to help.

1282
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:42,180
We'll hold those petards for you.

1283
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,360
Have you ever gone about your day

1284
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,340
and suddenly felt like sharing a link

1285
00:57:50,340 --> 00:57:51,460
on someone's timeline?

1286
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:55,900
Man, that feels great.

1287
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,120
Even if you don't do it.

1288
00:58:25,120 --> 00:58:26,320
I don't know what else to do but to write a good diary

1289
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1290
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1291
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1292
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1293
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1294
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1295
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1296
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1297
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1298
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1299
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1300
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1301
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1302
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1303
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:26,320


1304
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:27,180
Very shortly here,

1305
00:58:27,300 --> 00:58:29,060
there's gonna be a show idea,

1306
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:32,440
one that you're really gonna love,

1307
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,800
with the sweet dulcet tones of puzzling evidence,

1308
00:58:37,620 --> 00:58:37,640
and hopefully, like John Falseville,

1309
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:49,980
As he names the time coordinates here on this station, the station that you love so much,

1310
00:58:51,780 --> 00:59:00,000
even in the stormy weather of the tossed seas of life, the ups and downs and the shutdowns

1311
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:02,940
and shut-ups and the strike-downs and strike-outs.

1312
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:10,140
You walk down the hallway, waiting, waiting to know, what time is it?

1313
00:59:11,740 --> 00:59:13,540
Why, it's 4 a.m.

1314
00:59:15,940 --> 00:59:19,640
On the Puzzling Evidence Show.
