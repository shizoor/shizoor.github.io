1
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:02,360
Who's there?

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:06,940
The subgenius power of SWAT

3
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:11,220
Now I know all about everything

4
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:11,640
What?

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,000
Yeah

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:12,240
Yeah

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:12,520
Yeah

8
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:12,900
Yeah

9
00:00:14,660 --> 00:00:16,440
You say, what about your host?

10
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,920
I don't want to delve into that

11
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,900
I want to give you something that blesses my heart

12
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,720
This is independent radio in a democracy

13
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,360
Typical is this small independent station

14
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,680
On the air all day and most of the night

15
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,180
In the interests of the public

16
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:33,820
Its radio audience is composed of from 50 to 200 young people

17
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,620
To thousands of technicians, musicians and artists

18
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:39,060
These programs are produced live

19
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:40,860
In your own home of course

20
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:43,440
It must then be prepared for the ear of the listener

21
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,840
And recorded on a disc

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:48,180
Equipped with recorders, mics and shortwave equipment

23
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,140
Lonesome cowboy Dave

24
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,840
Interviews distinguished visitors such as this famous radio commentator

25
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,980
Professor Chaz Smith

26
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,660
It's so popular that the United Nations has recommended it all over the world

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:01,300
To students of social relations

28
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,560
Responsible for the policy and operation of the station

29
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,960
Is its president and owner

30
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,580
The Reverend Ivan Stang

31
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:11,600
Among his duties he acts in an advisory capacity to the salesman

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Bob Dobbs

33
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:16,420
He must conduct his business to warrant the trust placed in him by the government

34
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,140
Which grants him free use of the airwaves

35
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,480
This is silly isn't it?

36
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:20,720
No

37
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,320
This is independent radio in a democracy

38
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,420
Thank you to the bishop

39
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,280
Well if we can think

40
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,940
As long as we got our brains we can think

41
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,840
Oh they'll get that too George, you'll see

42
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,340
Did you know you are putting a cell phone right into your brain?

43
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,440
That's the truth

44
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,540
And that's why I'd use a cell phone

45
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,640
But guess what?

46
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,260
There's a brain phone called Ray

47
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:42,260
That's R-A-Y

48
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:45,660
Ray is a small chip that attaches right into your brain

49
00:01:45,660 --> 00:01:47,120
Right next to the antenna

50
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,720
Takes about 20 seconds

51
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,820
Once in place

52
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:52,260
Ray's patent pending subtle energy technology

53
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:55,260
Immediately begins to counter the effects of the government

54
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,680
Without affecting your brain

55
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:57,920
The cost of railway?

56
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,320
Only

57
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,560

58
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:01,960

It학교

64
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:24,040
It's amazing

65
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,920
We'll be right back

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,240
down i like it like that

67
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,040
oh

68
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:51,220
i asked that you be consecrated to the virgin mary my lady these people can't see or hear you as we

69
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,760
do many of them don't believe you appear to us some of them don't get the hour of slack

70
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:06,340
give them a sign that will make them believe a sign a sign the amino acids playing live at the

71
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:16,660
subgenius event 6x day at brushwood a sign the hour of slack featuring 6x day and the old media

72
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:20,240
broad number two ufos from 1981

73
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:29,720
and suzy the flizzy's most incredible recent x-day alien ufo collages and the music of so-so

74
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:41,040
daughter and eso radio and the collages of little little bird and all the rest praise bob praise

75
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:14,300
the princess is a creature of antiquity 10 million years at least in age and the monsters

76
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:19,560
are mutants of creatures that roamed the earth before the ice age it is likely that a super race

77
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,200
of humans existed sometime in the past and the monsters are mutants of creatures that roamed the

78
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:26,440
past also and somehow all of them humans and creatures went into hibernation far underground

79
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,560
where they survived they are intelligent they are smarter than the most up-to-date supercomputers we

80
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:38,500
cannot underestimate them the last few days they proved they're able to destroy our planet as we

81
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:49,140
know you mentioned that uh the uh advanced supersonic nazi hell creatures from inside the

82
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,200
hollow earth are conspiring to destroy our planet for no reason we have to overcome the dark matter

83
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,200


84
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,200


85
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,200


86
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,340
to take over the whole planet.

87
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:55,740
Yeah, we read about that in a pamphlet that was handed to us.

88
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,360
Oh, you did?

89
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:58,560
Uh-huh, and Bob confirmed it.

90
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:05,360
And there's only one organization that could possibly stop them.

91
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,640
They're the men from Planet X, and they'll be arriving in 1998.

92
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:13,220
And after the tribulation money starts to fall from the chariots

93
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,060
and the angels in the sky and coming up out of the ground

94
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,660
and spewing out of the back of them car exhaust pipes

95
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,900
and just magic everywhere,

96
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:27,500
and them tribulation times will be tearing those bad, evil,

97
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:31,660
demonic people up, and they'll be the subgenius people.

98
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,560
I think we should bring up...

99
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,960
That is Hitler's gem.

100
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,380
Waiting, waiting, waiting for you.

101
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,180
I don't know who it's from, but it's from his phone.

102
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,620
But if we yell through it real loud, we might be able to contact home base.

103
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:03,300
If we can get back to the home planet.

104
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,000
Remember, folks, which takes us to a planet of non-mortals

105
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,420
who are eons advanced in their civilization.

106
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,200
Our program is Underworld.

107
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,180
Hello, hello, I'm Star.

108
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm Earth.

109
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:17,780
And I'm Earth.

110
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,020
So scary, but we're the future.

111
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,340
Can you hear me?

112
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,300
Yes, Star.

113
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,780
This is Java.

114
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,620
Why do you call me?

115
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:33,120
I just turned on a Houston, Texas television channel

116
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,960
and they were interviewing a science fiction writer.

117
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,820
This writer has written a book called Tycho's World.

118
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:42,240
It's supposedly about our world.

119
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,680
You have been escaped, Sarah.

120
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,060
Yes, Sarah.

121
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,500
What?

122
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,640
What is your report?

123
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,460
Oh, no.

124
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,700
We are ready to take you down.

125
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,560
Java, I've had an unnerving experience today.

126
00:06:58,820 --> 00:06:59,720
What is it?

127
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,940
A young lady said she knew me.

128
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,440
She called me by my Earth name.

129
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,920
What did she want?

130
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,940
I don't know.

131
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:07,060
Recognition.

132
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:07,860
Acclaim.

133
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,420
I thought you might help me, Java.

134
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,500
You have been sent to the planet Earth to observe.

135
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,240
Not to have long feelings for Earthly details.

136
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:20,900
Which one, then?

137
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:20,900


138
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,600
Not me.

139
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:25,800
I will convince Earth and get back to you.

140
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,480
iyi yoo yo Biden Although the time is limited

141
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:38,120
I'm not looking after you.

142
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:43,000
I'll get in touch with you tomorrow.

143
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:48,740
The disasters you experienced are just small examples of our great power.

144
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,140
Either surrender to me or I'll destroy all humans.

145
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:55,780
I've spoken. It's all the warning you're going to get from me.

146
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:56,820
You'll be destroyed.

147
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,100
Other more incredible things are happening.

148
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,500
During a single year, for instance,

149
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:07,540
nearly 10,000 head of farmers' livestock have been mutilated

150
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,040
in an area from Texas to eastern Oregon and Washington.

151
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,160
Cattle mutilators.

152
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:14,820
Men's wearers.

153
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,380
Hanging out in your car.

154
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,680
Seven something among them.

155
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,340
I'm calling from...

156
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:21,500
Yes.

157
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,860
I'm a cattle rancher down here.

158
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:31,260
And I was wondering if these two guys might have any inside information on cattle mutilation.

159
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,120
Some of it in our place and some of the neighbors have been having that problem.

160
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,600
Well, that's sure an interesting question, and I'll bet they do.

161
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,260
One of them actually looks like a cow.

162
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,300
Go ahead.

163
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:41,940
Pardon.

164
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,580
Yeah.

165
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,340
Yeah, the cattle mutilation problem is getting to be pretty big.

166
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:47,860
A lot of people don't know about it.

167
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,460
It's not mentioned much on the TV because nobody has any answers about it.

168
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:54,920
But, yeah, the conspiracy is behind that.

169
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,600
They're doing it to confuse people.

170
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,060
They're doing it to discredit law enforcement agents

171
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,900
who can't figure out who's doing it to these cattle

172
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:05,780
and then taking off in their spacecraft or whatever.

173
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:08,460
For those who've never heard about cattle mutilation,

174
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:12,300
it's happening a lot these days out in the...

175
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,420
in the sticks, people will...

176
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:19,040
a farmer will come upon his prized cow or something like that with...

177
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,320
mutilated, but not by animals.

178
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,560
Done by professionals.

179
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,020
With certain organs removed and maybe the blood drained, things like that.

180
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,860
Surgically removed is what I heard.

181
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,780
Surgically removed.

182
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,880
Yeah, it's spooky.

183
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,120
It actually is kind of a...

184
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,200
Well, since you have this connection with the UFO people,

185
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,580
if somebody pays you to belong to your organization,

186
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:43,600
does that mean their cows will be left alone?

187
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,040
It would help.

188
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,560
It would help a whole lot.

189
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,320
Yeah, we can't make a whole lot of guarantees.

190
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,160
Have you had any cattle mutilations on your ranch?

191
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,220
Well, we've had one, and it was a pretty odd-looking sight.

192
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,100
Is that right?

193
00:09:58,320 --> 00:09:59,760
Some of the neighbors said the same thing.

194
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:04,360
Yeah, there's...

195
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:07,920
Maybe you'd better give your box number again for this fella.

196
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:10,220
Okay, yeah, you can get a lot of information.

197
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:15,420
Cattle mutilations from us at Box 140306, Dallas, Texas.

198
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,560
And, by the way, when you write,

199
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,460
I can tell you about some people who do some serious research into that thing.

200
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,100
And it's weird.

201
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,480
We can send you some of their literature if you'd like.

202
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:25,900
Yeah.

203
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,760
Okay, well, I'll send some money in for that.

204
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,280
Yeah, I would send a buck for information.

205
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,780
Okay, well...

206
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,380
Send ten if you want to be a member.

207
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:35,300
And thanks for calling.

208
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:39,680
Oh, by the way, enjoy the nuclear glow there in Glen Rose.

209
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:40,380
Yeah.

210
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:42,420
It does help feed the cows at night.

211
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,740
Yeah, it makes them grow big.

212
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,580
I understand you all have a lot of, you know, those six-legged frogs and so forth getting around there.

213
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:50,740
Wait until I kick on that power plant.

214
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,500
Boy, we'll see some giant farmers and so forth.

215
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:58,180
Another movie that's swept America is one entitled

216
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,700
The Encounters of the Third Degree.

217
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,900
Hey, may I tell you this?

218
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,520
I'm not so sure what UFOs are.

219
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,720
I don't know if I believe them or not.

220
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:16,740
But New Zealand Air Force was on alert recently because of the UFOs appearing over that nation.

221
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,120
Someone said, do you believe in flying saucers?

222
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,800
I said, of course.

223
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,520
I'm a married man.

224
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,080
If you don't get that now, you may in the morning over the breakfast table.

225
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,520
You say, what about UFOs?

226
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,840
I don't want to delve into that, but I want to give you something that blesses my heart.

227
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,120
I know there is life in the universe.

228
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,660
Why?

229
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,000
Why?

230
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:39,420


231
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:39,740
Why?

232
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:40,560
Why?

233
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


234
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


235
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


236
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


237
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


238
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


239
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


240
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


241
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


242
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


243
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


244
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


245
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


246
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


247
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


248
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:40,560


249
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,820
Evil spirits, demonic spirits fill the universe.

250
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:48,020
Lots of fun and romance on a special edition of The Love Boat.

251
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,140
What's he doing?

252
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:55,260
I'm an old phone training tape and some space science sound effects that I made with a synthesizer.

253
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,300
What's he doing?

254
00:11:58,900 --> 00:11:59,720
What's he doing?

255
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,100
Where are the UFOs?

256
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:03,940
Here they come.

257
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:04,240
Look out.

258
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,020
Look out.

259
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:07,040
Look out.

260
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,660
Look out.

261
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,020
Look out.

262
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:10,540


263
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,560


264
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,560


265
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,560


266
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,560


267
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,560


268
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,560


269
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,560


270
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,560


271
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,560


272
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,560


273
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,560


274
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,560


275
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:10,560


276
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:10,900
Look out.

277
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,680
Look out.

278
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:30,460
Look out.

279
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:37,320
Look out, Ito.

280
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:40,360
Didn't you hear that?

281
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,360


282
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,360


283
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,360


284
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,360


285
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,360


286
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:40,380
You need to wait.

287
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:40,380


288
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:40,500


289
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:40,500


290
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:40,500


291
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:40,500


292
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:40,500


293
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:40,500


294
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:40,560
Let's go.

295
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:41,660
I'm a soldier.

296
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,160
I'm a soldier.

297
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:57,240
I'm gonna shine my way.

298
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,940
I'm a soldier.

299
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,340
I'm a soldier.

300
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:07,320
I'm a soldier.

301
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,920
Change your fate.

302
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,340
I'm gonna change my fate.

303
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:11,480
I'm gonna change my fate.

304
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:17,440
My God, you won't believe what you're gonna see.

305
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:19,780
I'm gonna change my fate.

306
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:23,200
With my ray of shams on your forehead.

307
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:23,860
I'm gonna change my fate.

308
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:24,940
Thank you.

309
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:27,960
I'm gonna change my fate.

310
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:32,720
Little flying saucers are flying across the sky.

311
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,980
Little flying saucers are flying across the sky.

312
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:47,600
A little flying saucer came flying across the sky.

313
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:51,840
Says, oh, baby, I'm in the way now.

314
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:55,880
Little flying saucers are flying across the face.

315
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:04,060
All those little flying saucers are flying all over the place.

316
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,920
Little flying saucers.

317
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:16,260
Flying little, flying little, flying little saucer flying all over the place.

318
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:22,980
Little baby, like I was telling you, you ain't gonna believe now because we all do.

319
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,960
Flying saucer in the flying saucer.

320
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:28,940
Oh, hey.

321
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:31,160
Come down now.

322
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,260
Flying little saucer in the flying saucer.

323
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,060
Shining my rays.

324
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,780
Shining across your face.

325
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,440
Stand now.

326
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:39,040
Mm.

327
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:39,600
Mm.

328
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,180
Third 틴 Away the

329
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:23,580
Three Ch japanese

330
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:23,580

TO

336
00:15:26,420 --> 00:15:34,320
the wax paper and the foil and the wax and the foil were without form and void and darkness was

337
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:42,920
upon the face of the aluminum and the spirit of glad said let there be life and there was life

338
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,500
behold it is good

339
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,220
if they're not killed they'll take over the earth

340
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:58,900
there are a lot of theories on UFOs one of the theories says that that they are not from outer

341
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:04,300
space but they're from earth they could either be from the conspiracy uh the government putting

342
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:09,740
them out or they could be from the hollow earth yeah but it really makes sense you know

343
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:16,400
you already think about it how could there really be life on another planet well there could be

344
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,000
life life on other planets but there could also be life on this planet that's so advanced that

345
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,200
we don't know what's going on

346
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:22,200


347
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,280
don't even know about them yet.

348
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:26,380
Advanced supersonic Nazi hell creatures from the hollow earth

349
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:27,280
or something like that.

350
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,560
There's a serious indication of that.

351
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,940
We've heard quite a bit about that.

352
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:34,240
So it could be.

353
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:35,720
It gets pretty complicated.

354
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,140
The way we look at it is no matter

355
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,460
how complicated your conspiracy theory gets,

356
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,640
it still can't touch the complexity of the whole thing.

357
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,980
Generally speaking, most all conspiracy theories

358
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,120
are valid, wouldn't you say?

359
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,400
We're trying to tie every one of them together.

360
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:54,120
I've been into UFOs for a long time.

361
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:57,920
And the only thing I really come up with

362
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:00,000
is what I just told you.

363
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,320
Well, don't worry about where they came from,

364
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,300
but what they're going to do when they get here.

365
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,200
That's the secret.

366
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,400
But you know, don't tell us how long the human race will last.

367
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,360
Well, some people get benevolent messages from them,

368
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:14,460
and other people get their cows mutilated.

369
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,100
OK.

370
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:18,240
By the way, I've got blonde hair and blue eyes.

371
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:19,580
Is that right?

372
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:21,380
Well, you're not from the great.

373
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,640
Great white brotherhood, are you?

374
00:17:23,380 --> 00:17:23,700
Mm-hmm.

375
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,600
Not from the nowhere.

376
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:25,340
OK.

377
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:26,360
Ah!

378
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,140
God!

379
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:28,780
Hallelujah!

380
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,840
Angelic beings fill the universe.

381
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,420
I'm not talking about these little fellas

382
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,620
they talk about, you know, that have green skin and brown teeth.

383
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:42,980
Few of us have that from smoking too much cigarettes.

384
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,120
You know.

385
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:48,220
Hallelujah, there's all kinds of angels.

386
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,220
And then when Jesus was out there after he'd been tipped

387
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,120
of the devil 40 days and 40 nights, you know what it said?

388
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:58,560
A street ministering angel came unto him and ministered strength unto him.

389
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,260
So, Brother Tamplin, there's all kinds of angels.

390
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,600
We have the privilege of having these angels incapped around and about us

391
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:10,560
if we're born again children of God and if we're on our way to heaven.

392
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,720
I ain't see you lately, Lily.

393
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,320
How have you been?

394
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:14,320
Oh, fine.

395
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,500
I've been visiting my mammy.

396
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,460
She's waiting on the welcome table over by the throne of grace.

397
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:21,120
She always was pretty holy.

398
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,900
I guess the Lord took quite a fancy to her.

399
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:27,160
I declare your mammy's one of the finest lady angels I know.

400
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,040
She claim you the best one she know.

401
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,840
Well, when you come right down to it,

402
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,900
I suppose we all are pretty now, Puffy.

403
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,160
Why is that, Miss Jenny?

404
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:41,020
I suppose it's case the Lord don't lie so shady with the devil

405
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:43,240
anymore, so there can't be no more sin.

406
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:44,960
Oh, Satan.

407
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,400
I wonder what ever become of him.

408
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,020
I'm talking about what the Bible has to say when,

409
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,940
Satan was cast out of heaven.

410
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,500
It was only the third heaven of 2 Corinthians 12, 7,

411
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,680
where he was thrown out.

412
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:04,620
Do you know that Satan and his demonic host still fill heaven one and two,

413
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,480
the atmosphere and the stratosphere?

414
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:11,640
Do you know that Satan is the prince of the power of the air and airwaves,

415
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,700
Ephesians 2, 2?

416
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:17,980
That's why we Christians have such a battle in this Christian walk,

417
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:21,360
because we wrestle against Satan.

418
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:21,360


419
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:24,580
Satan is the one who has the power to destroy evil spirits in high places.

420
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,820
Demonic spirits.

421
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,920
And they can travel like a flash of lightning.

422
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,460
Of course, the world has never considered this.

423
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:38,160
After all, who could believe the strange ramblings of the Bible?

424
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,980
Suddenly, I've seen this happen many times, folks,

425
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,320
and I can't get that excited about it.

426
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,280
But I'm going to tell you what just happened.

427
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:49,780
The deacon just, the deacon just faded away.

428
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:52,480
He's still in here with me.

429
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,700
He's, he's standing.

430
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:55,720
No, he's laying down.

431
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:56,500
I can feel him.

432
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,300
He's laying down.

433
00:19:57,560 --> 00:19:59,400
The deacon, he's, he's picking it up.

434
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,100
And he's starting to fade back in.

435
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:06,480
Yes, friends, they talk of, they talk of invisible angels around you.

436
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:10,040
It ain't just, it ain't just angels that can be invisible, friends.

437
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:13,560
It's you, and you can be, you can be right where you are, and no one can see you.

438
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,920
And you can be right where you are someplace else, too.

439
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,360
And we can...

440
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:17,680
I don't know.

441
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:20,900
March on the air with Stang and Drummond.

442
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:21,300
Go ahead.

443
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:23,820
Yes, I just wanted to make a testimonial.

444
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:31,000
I was formerly a nimboid, and I found out about the Church of the Genius,

445
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,920
and they have been absolutely fantastic for me,

446
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,720
opening my life up to so many possibilities.

447
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,560
Why, they have taught me all the joy of alien contact,

448
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:48,660
and I have thoroughly just had wonderful experiences and found guidance in my life.

449
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:49,740
Would you share that with...

450
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:51,160
Recently, I contacted...

451
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,500
Alien life forces who instructed me,

452
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,460
do not eat the flesh of another living creature on your planet.

453
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,580
And it has made a tremendous change in my life.

454
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,380
So you really have changed from that former lifestyle, huh?

455
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:05,680
That's right.

456
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:09,360
And it's all due to the Church of the Subgenius.

457
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,000
Are you still the nimboid, though?

458
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,120
Well, once a nimboid, always a nimboid.

459
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,420
I've seen name only, right?

460
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:16,960
That's right.

461
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:17,580
Okay.

462
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:21,000
Well, we really appreciate the testimony.

463
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,320
And we'd like people to know that we can do quite a bit for them.

464
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:28,300
Listen, and for my information, sort of an outsider here,

465
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:34,040
would you explain to me in some detail really what an alien contact is, feels like, or looks like?

466
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:34,880
Well, certainly.

467
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:41,300
I was sitting around one night thinking about the possibility of, you know, being a vegetarian,

468
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,720
and all of a sudden I felt this wonderful direction to my thoughts,

469
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:49,960
knowing that I could stop them at any point in time if I wanted to,

470
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,160
but they were leading me along a path and I just let myself go.

471
00:21:54,300 --> 00:22:00,260
Then all of a sudden I reached this end of the path and it was very definite.

472
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:05,560
Do not eat the flesh of another living creature on your planet.

473
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:07,500
And I started thinking about that.

474
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:14,360
What if these superior forces from outer space came here and started eating us, humans?

475
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:19,120
Well, if they did that, we could protest no more.

476
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:27,080
Then, you know, we couldn't protest because we eat the flesh of lower life forms on this planet.

477
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:33,420
They, you know, would be perfectly, you know, moral in coming and eating us as life forms.

478
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,740
Well, they come every couple of hundred years and take you anyway.

479
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:38,020
Yeah, it hurts.

480
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,000
I've heard it from two people, but I'll tell you what, don't worry about the beaver

481
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:46,360
because the beaver was originally from Mars and you can eat as much of that as you want to.

482
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,000
Um, I might.

483
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,100
Okay.

484
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:49,600
From Mars.

485
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,240
Right.

486
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,980
I might point out that the reason...

487
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:53,260
Before their econoclastic...

488
00:22:53,260 --> 00:23:00,440
It may, it may be simply that the aliens don't think we taste good when we've been on a diet of meat.

489
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:06,820
So they want to make sure we eat vegetables and that way we perhaps are tastier to them.

490
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,840
Notice man doesn't eat very many flesh eaters.

491
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:13,460
Only, only the herbivorous animals.

492
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:13,920
That's right.

493
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:15,520
That's right.

494
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:19,100
I'm not, I'm not trying to imply that our friends in outer space are not.

495
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:26,180
They're not necessarily out to eat us, but you know, the possibility does exist.

496
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:29,020
They do some pretty strange stuff to cattle every now and then.

497
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,300
That is right.

498
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,640
Mutilation of cattle.

499
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,200
Yeah, that might be a different...

500
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:35,700
And in case you're tuning in...

501
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:40,420
That's a religious ceremony for them, which is entirely different from eating flesh of those animals.

502
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:41,500
But...

503
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,000
It's us that we're after, they're after.

504
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,620
Okay.

505
00:23:45,680 --> 00:23:48,760
Well, we only have a short time to wait before we find out.

506
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:49,080
So...

507
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:49,900
That's right.

508
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:50,260
Thank you.

509
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:51,960
18...

510
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:53,200
No, 1998.

511
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:57,340
Thank you for calling and I'm happy about your alien contact.

512
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:57,960
Bye-bye.

513
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,320
And your new lifestyle.

514
00:23:59,480 --> 00:23:59,760
Thank you.

515
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:00,380
Hail Nimboids.

516
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:01,600
Hail Nimboids.

517
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,060
Kids.

518
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,880
On the wings of a snow white...

519
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,160
Bob.

520
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,740
He sends his pure, sweet...

521
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,040
Come.

522
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:12,460
A sign from above...

523
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:15,540

Come.

527
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,060
One...

528
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,060


529
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,060

00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,060

00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,060

00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,060

00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:19,060

00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:38,000

Bob.

541
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:42,420
Chat.

542
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:43,280
Come and block out.

543
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:43,280


544
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:44,140

00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:48,820
drawseki

549
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,060
No!

550
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,200
Goodbye, Samantha Dundee.

551
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,220
No more.

552
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,860
Oh, who would have believed it?

553
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:59,180
Who would have dreamed that the aliens live right next door in the next trailer?

554
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,100
What will they be talking about?

555
00:25:01,260 --> 00:25:02,980
What plans for the future of mankind?

556
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,400
Will it be conspiracy or brotherhood?

557
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,980
Well, Seeker, we're about to find out.

558
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:11,000
This is the weirdest thing I've ever seen.

559
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,140
Oh, my God.

560
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:13,840
Are they going into the bedroom?

561
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,780
They've been screwing us for a long time.

562
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:18,040
Hey, look, I'm a super intelligent being.

563
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,220
My understanding is I have an IQ of 1600,

564
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:23,440
and I can't even understand what you expected from that relationship.

565
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,920
I'm so young.

566
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:33,260
Not from around here, but a real square little fella.

567
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,020
Oh, come now.

568
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,260
We've been through so much together.

569
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,440
Just call me Bob.

570
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:45,300
On July 12th, I took a trip in a flying saucer,

571
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:47,300
which I am pointing right here.

572
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:55,020
The saucer was well equipped with rooms, bedrooms, bathroom, toilets,

573
00:25:55,180 --> 00:25:59,160
and this saucer.

574
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:07,020
I went up in two Mars, over the moon, Venus, Clarion, and Orion.

575
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:10,220
When I say Orion, I do not mean Orion.

576
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:14,980
It is a planet outside of our galaxy.

577
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,500
So I thought I saw a UFO once.

578
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:17,880
Really?

579
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:21,040
Yeah, but I had taken a lot of mescal over time, so I don't know.

580
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,440
Well, that will do it to you.

581
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,700
Yeah, I was down in Mexico.

582
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,960
I was with my English professor.

583
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,780
We were having an affair, and he was married.

584
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,080
It was really terrible.

585
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,240
You thought you saw a UFO?

586
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,980
Yeah, we both, we really thought we did.

587
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:31,180
Wow.

588
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,500
It's an illusion.

589
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,900
Well, I won't go into any further details,

590
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,120
but she had a very interesting experience that she'd never remembered before.

591
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,660
The numbers who have had contacts with these aliens,

592
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:44,340
how has it affected their lives?

593
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:48,020
They very often have a religious context.

594
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:48,560
They're very much the same kind of conversion,

595
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,400
although not of a formal sort.

596
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,920
They're good people, and they've generally been influenced in good ways, maybe.

597
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:55,880
So naive.

598
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,080
And there are some people who've got glimpses of it perhaps, we hear.

599
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,180
And they yearn for something like that.

600
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:06,180
They're looking for the family that maybe in some vague way they've known about.

601
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,400
They join cult groups.

602
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,900
Friends, there's a force that runs through the universe.

603
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,020
We used to call that force God.

604
00:27:13,460 --> 00:27:16,100
We now call it the Church of the Subgenius.

605
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,580
I hear it.

606
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:17,820
God.

607
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,280
Bob.

608
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,120
Bob.

609
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,460
God.

610
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:48,460


611
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:49,380
Bob.

612
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,000
Bob.

613
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:51,300
Bob.

614
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:51,300


615
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:51,300


616
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:51,300


617
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,920
Can we get back to the subject of UFOs?

618
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,780
I mean, that's what this party's for, anyway, isn't it?

619
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:57,740
I can prove that if there's life anywhere else in the universe,

620
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,240
there will have a Marxist economy.

621
00:27:59,400 --> 00:27:59,960
Excuse me?

622
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,700
I'm an occult nutritionist.

623
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:05,080
No, I think mind control has been overemphasized.

624
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,120
See, if you were a truly benevolent alien and didn't want to invade Earth,

625
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:14,500
you'd also hold off delving into a person and making them do things that they're supposed to.

626
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,280
Sort of like the prime directors in Star Trek.

627
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,020
You were a truly benevolent alien, and didn't want to invade Earth, you'd also hold off developing into a person and making them do things that they're supposed to.

628
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:18,720
Stupid! Stupid!

629
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:19,880
You humans.

630
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:24,180
You've mentioned that there are many people who have been influenced by the extraterrestrials

631
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:30,900
and are not even aware of it, but some things like the movies we see, the TV shows, you

632
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:32,860
think there may be some influences there?

633
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:37,200
I have a friend who's a writer in Hollywood, and he told me when he was 21 years old he

634
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,420
was crossing in the out of the desert, and a UFO swooped down over his car and saw it

635
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:44,180
zooming away into the sky and he kept on driving. Nothing happened.

636
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:44,640
Yeah.

637
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:52,120
After that, his life took a different turn. He became more serious, and he had a goal

638
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:52,620
in life.

639
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:58,300
And that little boy, who nobody liked, grew up to be Roy Cohn.

640
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:58,740
Wow!

641
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,140
And now you know the rest of the story.

642
00:29:02,540 --> 00:29:05,660
You've identified at least two distinct groups of aliens.

643
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:08,380
There's not more than two groups, but you could put them in two camps.

644
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:08,800
Okay.

645
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:14,040
Now, Camp One have just recently arrived, doing their investigations from Square One.

646
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:14,620
So there's a lot of them.

647
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,860
I think Camp Two have been around a long time.

648
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:23,520
They're also the ones that induce a feeling of friendliness in part of the people they pick up.

649
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:29,980
I was picked up on a desert, in the California desert, and I was taken to the mothership

650
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:33,140
and they were flowing around, not too close to the moon, but with instruments.

651
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:37,740
Similarly, you might say, except it wasn't a camera, it was a regular sort of a telescopic

652
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,520
instrument, that we were able to see what was on the moon on the other side of it. See?

653
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,620
It looked like this.

654
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,480
It was a little bit of a

655
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,840
The people think of themselves as being picked up by old friends.

656
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:53,920
Came crawling out of a well wearing ladies' shoes.

657
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,940
Didn't know what milk was.

658
00:29:56,540 --> 00:30:00,980
Real little, smooth like baby's feet, with big friendly eyes.

659
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,100
He sounds like a real nice guy.

660
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:08,620
Took him to the Swiss picnic for a good time and he choked to death on a piece of cheese.

661
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:09,860
Yeah, yeah, right.

662
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:13,700
Now, of course, this may be a psychological manipulation, but so what?

663
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,640
It's nice to have them do that kind of psychological manipulation.

664
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,240
There are three extraterrestrials of humanoid Caucasian appearance.

665
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:27,540
The leader is male, about 31, 62, 190 pounds, pallid complexion, lank, greasy hair.

666
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:35,380
The second is of indeterminate sex, 28, 5'10, 145 pounds, short, dark hair, pale skin.

667
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:38,520
The female is 26, looks younger.

668
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:42,060
She has a delicate complexion and excellent bone structure.

669
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:46,100
Her eyes are hazel flecked with gray and sometimes a little sag.

670
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:51,980
Her voice is throaty, hands exquisite, and she's said to have a certain indefinable something.

671
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:55,160
They were highly intelligent and potentially dangerous.

672
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,960
We'll be going back to England for on the spot review of the continuous...

673
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,840
You've got it wrong!

674
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,900
They've got it wrong! They've got it wrong!

675
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:02,520
They've got it wrong!

676
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:06,100
They have been dealing with the, what you would call the real smart aliens.

677
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:09,560
Not the ones who have just been here recently and are kind of bumbling.

678
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:11,920
Here comes something.

679
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:15,780
Remember the story when newlyweds on our way to Earth's capital...

680
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:20,240
No jazz butt.

681
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:25,380
I don't wish to dwell on technical matters, but these visitors from outer space,

682
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:29,960
they are what we scientists call brainless.

683
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,500
Brainless?

684
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:35,960
They're thick, stupid, dumb-dumbs, crubs, twits, morons.

685
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,200
You don't invoke a very good amnesia.

686
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:42,040
Graduate students from Alpha Centauri on their first...

687
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:43,080
First mission, isn't that right?

688
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,740
They're still doing their PhD thesis on planet Earth.

689
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,200
Uh-huh.

690
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,380
No one could have guessed what was inside.

691
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,660
Hey look, they're drinking tea.

692
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,140
Hey look, it's on TV.

693
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,440
Turn on and see.

694
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,700
Two worlds collide.

695
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,520
We're morons.

696
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:00,260
Welcome to our pressure dump.

697
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:02,200
Welcome to our mobile home.

698
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,420
Up in the sky.

699
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,780
We're morons.

700
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,280
People say we've come too far.

701
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,340
But we don't know where we are and we don't know why.

702
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:11,960
We're not high-class.

703
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,020
We're not high-class.

704
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,020


705
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,020


706
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,020


707
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,020


708
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,020


709
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,020


710
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:12,020


711
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,920
You're a moron.

712
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:17,580
We have only three friends and this and that.

713
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,580
Where's the�

714
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,660
This whole pγr the five of that.

715
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,000
From everybody here is aُ

716
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:28,500
some of the characteristics? Well, a person who has been fascinated with no particularly good

717
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:35,180
reason, been fascinated with UFOs, science fiction, Star Trek, has a psychic streak in him,

718
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:40,940
and has fallen in love absolutely without any good reason with someone, and then finds afterwards he

719
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:46,460
has also had an interest in UFOs and psychic things. Now, not any one of these things, or not

720
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:52,660
all of them are necessary, but you can find a little profile there. Wing, wing, wing. Stateless

721
00:32:52,660 --> 00:33:02,520
wonders. UFO and its followers, perverts, monomaniacs, dipsomaniacs, artists of the fast

722
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:11,940
buck, true believers, objective believers, new age believers, kehoe believers, shushed by the three

723
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:22,200
men, or masturbated by spacemen. UFO is a bucket of shit, and I sit here writing while it drips

724
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,560
down.

725
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:31,820
My face in great rivel. I'm going to be very disappointed if UFOs turn out to be nothing more

726
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:35,360
than visitors from another planet, because I think they could be something much more interesting.

727
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:42,400
Something from another dimension of space or time. I think what the UFO phenomenon is teaching us

728
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:49,360
is that we don't understand time and space. I think we have to call them objects that are physical,

729
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,940
that interact with the environment, that cause

730
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:56,840
effects on the witnesses, on the psychology and the physiology of the witnesses, and leave traces

731
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:03,700
on the ground, and yet are capable of, appear to be capable of manipulating time and space in ways

732
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:10,320
that go beyond what our physics understands today. The Air Force investigated UFOs and issued a

733
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:17,720
report, couched in polite language, which translated means... Now, let's have no more curiosity about

734
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:18,740
this bizarre cover-up.

735
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,640
We'd like to ask you some questions. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask them in the

736
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:22,640


737
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:22,880
chat room.

738
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:40,700
Butaced In Clar warning that Lumia is a

739
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,280
UFO,

740
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,700
peculiarly

741
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:44,980
cockroach-like,

742
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:49,980
Traditional칠

743
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,900
Well, first I thought it was a big old dog

744
00:34:58,900 --> 00:35:00,740
Of course, the way it howled

745
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:03,020
And how it had them big friendly eyes

746
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,600
But I had to ask myself

747
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,280
What the hell was it doing up in the graveyard

748
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:11,160
Digging up the ground with a shovel

749
00:35:11,160 --> 00:35:12,620
I thought I was crazy

750
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,580
I'm not a drinking man on duty, Mr. Cox

751
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,040
Not me

752
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:17,920
You know, I figured it was one of them werewolves

753
00:35:18,460 --> 00:35:18,920
That were having

754
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,540
So I slipped a wooden load in my shotgun

755
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,800
And then all of a sudden

756
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,120
Now this is going to sound crazy

757
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:25,260
A big dark scene

758
00:35:25,260 --> 00:35:27,120
With flashing lights come up

759
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:28,980
Over the top of the hill

760
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:30,000
That one right over there

761
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,640
It was about 100 miles an hour

762
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,720
This dog or wolf or whatever it was

763
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,140
It took off like a bug wrap

764
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,600
With that dry hump over there

765
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:38,620
Hey, just a minute, will you

766
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,120
I'm not a drinking man, Mr. Cox

767
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:42,260
I swear to hell I saw it

768
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:44,500
That was no crazed sterno bum

769
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:47,560
But a respected law enforcement officer

770
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,720
Sheriff Lugar Axe Handle of Heater County, California

771
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:51,320
Ooh

772
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,240
Crumbling remnant of the old west

773
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,500
Or could it be the final resting place

774
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:59,840
Of a little guy from outer space

775
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,100
Could be, could be

776
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:06,540
All I know is everything you know is wrong

777
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,320
Oh, Christ

778
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,740
God, you're dumb

779
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,020
Dumb, dumb, dumb

780
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:14,340
Dumb, dum-dum-dum

781
00:36:14,340 --> 00:36:17,460
Enough of this deception and trickery

782
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,820
I admit it

783
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:20,500
I was taken in too

784
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,540
By clever fakes like this

785
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,180
Bob is back

786
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:26,640
And he's better than ever

787
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,000
Better than ever

788
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,580
Better than ever

789
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,240
Better than ever

790
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:30,800
Better than ever

791
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:31,840
Better than ever

792
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,580
Better than ever

793
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,380
Yes, friends

794
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,800
Bob has actually become a little better than ever

795
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,780
6X Day happened

796
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:45,540
And it was such a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful event

797
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,880
Even though Bob himself was better than ever

798
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,080
The subgenius franters were everywhere

799
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,000
And worse

800
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,900
Another new doctor who appeared on the stage at 6X Day

801
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,180
Actually, the previous 6X Day

802
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:07,340
It was a young crazy man named Cosmodear

803
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:13,080
Let's listen as Cosmodear interacts with the Minoan brain eaters

804
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:13,460
It was

805
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,440
Rhetorical tower

806
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:17,860
Yeah

807
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:23,640
Open your mouth and change the world

808
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,460
With what you take, the world's warmed

809
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:30,780
Yeah

810
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,960
Rhetoric, dialectic, categorical, prepositional magic

811
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,940
Know your words, explain your thoughts

812
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:46,080
Talk to people in the block

813
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,220
Yeah

814
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:50,740
Talk to our beauty

815
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:55,160
The increased stuff and life

816
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:01,340
The pooped community

817
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:04,940
Announce your future

818
00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:15,660
Ev act

00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:18,820

E Sally

821
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:19,480
Music

822
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:19,480


823
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:19,480


824
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:19,860
Fre Allowance for directly concerned for email training and months before就会

825
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,940
Oh yeah!

826
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:27,880
I see that President Bush will clone human embryos to kill them.

827
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:31,160
Some want to clone human embryos for those embryo feet.

828
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:32,900
But what about our two senators?

829
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:36,260
Yeah, they want to clone human embryos for those feet.

830
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,480
He warned that if this is not done quickly, we'll kill them.

831
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,880
Yeah, but some senators like embryo feet.

832
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,200
I can't see the difference between the U.S. Senate and human brats.

833
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,420
They want to defeat human embryos.

834
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,560
If you agree that humans should be banned, please call 13013.

835
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:18,200
What are you doing? Drawing a picture?

836
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,440
What are you getting so red in the face about?

837
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:21,460
Don't ever ask me.

838
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:21,920
Huh.

839
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:23,900
I got brothers, ain't I?

840
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,560
Long as you live, don't ever ask.

841
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:25,760
Huh?

842
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:26,800
Huh.

843
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:31,100
Look at the picture.

844
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,480
See the scum.

845
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,500
It's horrible. It's amazing.

846
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:43,920
And this is the amino acids live at 6X Day.

847
00:39:49,860 --> 00:39:53,560
They burn blue eyes and black hair before they're as red as the sky.

848
00:39:53,580 --> 00:40:01,100
Blue eyes are also brown.

849
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:01,860
It's what iPhone two Hack in the sand looks like.

850
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:02,480
Just like New York nicely painted.

851
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:03,140
They're some TOMS that wear a hat.

852
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,140


853
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,140


854
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,140


855
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:03,140


856
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,180
You watch two C won't be able to sign up for our concert.

857
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:09,180


858
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:09,740
I'm just boody about making that doodle dance I make.

859
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,020
Are you sure it's out of the game?

860
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,760
You're runway feeling drunk.

861
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:13,480
I'll do the same by crystal for 24 hours.

862
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,360
I'll bring home two guys who get preferential in this todo.

863
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:14,400
Football is сокaboo to people.

864
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:14,440
Delicious.

865
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,400
I can't describe it in words.

866
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,400


867
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:17,400


868
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:27,540
We'll be right back.

869
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:59,520
We'll be right back.

870
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:23,920
Like raw nerves to the amino acids who are already inside of you now.

871
00:41:24,140 --> 00:41:28,800
And who came from outer space.

872
00:41:31,860 --> 00:41:38,340
Not to be confused with our friends the X's or men from Planet X, whatever the news people want to call them.

873
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,740
Who we have complete faith will be here tomorrow at 7 a.m.

874
00:41:46,260 --> 00:41:47,380
We'll see if they show up.

875
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,560
If they show up, then they won't be able to see the amino acids.

876
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:51,820
Well, that's right.

877
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:57,000
And if the X's don't arrive, at least the amino acids will.

878
00:41:57,960 --> 00:42:03,040
Meanwhile, I think they must be finally geared up over there for ESO.

879
00:42:03,520 --> 00:42:04,900
Or whatever it is.

880
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,500
Einstein's secret band name.

881
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:09,680
Oh, yes.

882
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,160
Let's get back to partying with Dr. Drummond and Einstein's secret orchestra.

883
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,600
Yes, friends.

884
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:27,900
X Day, out of Crushwood anyway, is quite the amazing slack-filled event, actually.

885
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,900
It's amazing in that it's full of slack.

886
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:36,460
We do not promise anyone anything at 6X Day.

887
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:43,480
We provide a stage and some microphones and amplification and art supplies.

888
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:46,200
And the subgeniuses themselves.

889
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,800
We take care of all of the rest.

890
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,920
Sometimes helped by the pagans and the Crushwood staff,

891
00:42:53,380 --> 00:43:01,080
who now have gotten to where they build these wonderful giant Bob icons out of wood.

892
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,440
It's sort of a giant...

893
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:02,840
What?

894
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:04,780
Yes, Philo?

895
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,720
It's some vibration.

896
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,360
Bad vibes.

897
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:10,680
Bad vibration.

898
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,320
Heard of bad vibes.

899
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:14,860
This is the bad vibe.

900
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:15,840
Man, look at him.

901
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:16,360
I know what that is.

902
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:20,060
Someone asked, what the hell would that be?

903
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,280
What the hell would that be?

904
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:22,560
What the hell is that?

905
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:25,360
Someone, can I have a what the hell would that be?

906
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,320
What the hell would that be?

907
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,240
Can I get a what the hell?

908
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,340
What the hell?

909
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:32,500
What the heck?

910
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:34,140
Some people like to say heck.

911
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:34,960
What the heck?

912
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,720
Yes, yes, yes.

913
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:45,740
Religious worship music.

914
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:48,440
from the church of the subgenius

915
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:51,680
from one of our worship events at X Day.

916
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,080
Building up for the icon burning

917
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:59,540
when we burn a gigantic emblem of Bob's face,

918
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,380
our guru, Bob's face.

919
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,800
Every Saturday night of X Day

920
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:09,600
as the pagans drum and the subgeniuses

921
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:12,060
dance like little funny monkeys.

922
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:29,340
Uh-oh, here comes Jesus.

923
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:32,300
I think I hear Jesus coming, friends.

924
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,820
I think I hear Jesus a-coming.

925
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,260
Yes, Jesus is on his way.

926
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,660
What's the news, Lord?

927
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,000
It's ready to go.

928
00:44:40,520 --> 00:44:41,420
Yes, friends.

929
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,000
It is time for the icon burning.

930
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,120
You'll enjoy this ceremony.

931
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,140
We're going to burn Bob.

932
00:44:50,520 --> 00:44:54,340
Unfortunately, his followers will stay unburned.

933
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,120
Oh, yeah.

934
00:45:05,340 --> 00:45:06,020
Yeah.

935
00:45:07,020 --> 00:45:07,980
All right.

936
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:12,060
It's time for the icon burning.

937
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,020
Down at the hotel.

938
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:15,940
Down.

939
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,880
It's time for the icon burning.

940
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:20,840
Woo!

941
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:22,260
It's down.

942
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:23,000
Pass around.

943
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:23,400
Down.

944
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:23,800
Down.

945
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,600
Let's burn the fuck out of Bob.

946
00:45:27,680 --> 00:45:29,160
Let's burn that bastard down.

947
00:45:29,480 --> 00:45:31,540
Let's burn the fuck right out of Bob.

948
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:33,160
Let's burn that bastard down.

949
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:34,140
Oh, yeah.

950
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:41,420
Well, in the words of Reverend Ivan Stagg,

951
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:44,420
it's not good to drag this kind of shit out.

952
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:45,340
So,

953
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,940
let's get it over with.

954
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:49,880
Friends, look at that pile of

955
00:45:49,880 --> 00:45:51,600
habifrop ziplops.

956
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:53,840
The largest known.

957
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,880
Gathered here by the Brushwood staff.

958
00:45:57,180 --> 00:45:59,060
The largest known pile

959
00:45:59,060 --> 00:46:00,880
of incredibly expensive

960
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,700
habifrop ziplops,

961
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:04,200
known as FROP for short,

962
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:06,420
about to be destroyed.

963
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,680
Not senselessly, nay,

964
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:11,700
for we can stand downwind and inhale it,

965
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,680
but also symbolically.

966
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:18,880
Once again, we put up this symbol of Bob's face.

967
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:25,200
Why would we burn rather than worship this thing?

968
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:27,040
Why do we not throw ourselves down?

969
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:29,880
Well, why don't you throw yourselves down

970
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,980
and bow down to it?

971
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,800
Well, because, you know, actually the way you bow to Bob

972
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,340
is turn around backwards and bow down.

973
00:46:38,820 --> 00:46:41,940
But, Bob is a short-nuration personal savior

974
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:43,980
and most of us have probably had just

975
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:48,200
about the goddamn enough of Bob after this weekend.

976
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:51,760
Also, the face,

977
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,660
also the face of J.R. Bob Dobbs

978
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:56,600
is the most precious symbol to us

979
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,440
and a registered trademark of

980
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:00,040
Subgenius Foundation Incorporated.

981
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:02,180
And, as such,

982
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:03,960
our most cherished symbol.

983
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:07,460
And to symbolize how much we cherish symbols

984
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,380
and symbolization,

985
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,620
we will just now burn

986
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:13,960
the hell out of you.

987
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:16,500
We will not just burn it.

988
00:47:16,620 --> 00:47:17,400
We will not just burn it.

989
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:17,400


990
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,040
We will burn the

991
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:20,020
living

992
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:21,800
hell out of it.

993
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:24,880
And, as Jesus has informed us,

994
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:25,760
this is indeed

995
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,900
an accurate scale model representation

996
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,080
of that plain underground known as hell.

997
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,000
Hell is a real place

998
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,580
about a mile and a half down.

999
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:42,580
Endless caverns, actually seven levels of them.

1000
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,500
Finally ending up at the sun

1001
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:48,520
at the center of the hollow earth.

1002
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:51,260
And, friends, in that hell

1003
00:47:51,980 --> 00:47:55,640
is where those who do not achieve eternal salvation

1004
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:56,760
will go to party.

1005
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:03,000
Those who Xeroxed Subgenius pamphlets

1006
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,320
and said praise Bob

1007
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,100
and never sent in their thirty dollars.

1008
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,680
They shall experience a type of partying

1009
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,340
that this icon of Bob's face

1010
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:12,440
is about to experience.

1011
00:48:14,020 --> 00:48:16,540
Don't worry, it can't feel pain.

1012
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:19,260
We don't think.

1013
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,760
Just an inanimate chunk of wood,

1014
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,620
once alive, perhaps possessed of the spirit

1015
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:29,680
of brushwood in the woods around here

1016
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:33,420
where the owls are not what they see.

1017
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,260
They spotted it.

1018
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,840
Ah, it's reaching up.

1019
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:41,040
It's reaching up.

1020
00:48:41,060 --> 00:48:43,040
It's licking his cheekbones, friends.

1021
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,320
Isn't this where we're supposed to chant?

1022
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,220
Do we have a chant?

1023
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,500
B-O-B, what's our chant?

1024
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,300
What is our chant?

1025
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,580
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

1026
00:48:56,320 --> 00:49:00,580
B-O-B, Bob, B-O-B, Bob.

1027
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:02,940
Fuck Bob.

1028
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,100
Fuck Bob, fuck Bob.

1029
00:49:10,760 --> 00:49:12,920
Fuck Bob, buddy, honey.

1030
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,680
In the old days, they burned

1031
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,740
every kind of minority group they could find,

1032
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:19,880
depending on where you were.

1033
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:24,500
Uh, you know, they, they, they,

1034
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:27,620
they burned witches, they burned Jews,

1035
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,620
they burned even, yes, Republicans at one time.

1036
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:35,960
Friends, this is where you let the hypnotic drums

1037
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,860
of the expert pagan hypnotist

1038
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:40,620
take over your mind and heart.

1039
00:49:41,860 --> 00:49:43,960
I would caution you, however,

1040
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:47,820
as you, the subgeniuses, dance around this bonfire

1041
00:49:47,820 --> 00:49:52,360
and find strange memories of your Neanderthal ancestors returning,

1042
00:49:53,560 --> 00:49:54,680
be careful.

1043
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:56,320
Don't go pagan.

1044
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:59,880
Don't let what happened to Ed Strange happen to you.

1045
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:03,640
Boys, you'll be sitting around pounding on little drums

1046
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:05,900
and wearing skirts in no time at all.

1047
00:50:06,820 --> 00:50:09,300
Yes, it's true, the pagan women are beautiful,

1048
00:50:09,440 --> 00:50:09,980
but,

1049
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:11,600
they are treacherous.

1050
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,840
Oh, Woody Nergay!

1051
00:50:19,340 --> 00:50:24,080
Einstein's Secret Orchestra finally got to do their big concert

1052
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,560
at 6X Day on Saturday night,

1053
00:50:26,760 --> 00:50:33,820
just as the rainstorm heard in the background was rolling in.

1054
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,420
Listen closely.

1055
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:43,360
And you'll hear a camera dive.

1056
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:46,380
.

1057
00:50:57,740 --> 00:50:59,140
.

1058
00:51:02,060 --> 00:51:03,460
.

1059
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:03,460


1060
00:51:03,460 --> 00:51:33,460


1061
00:51:33,460 --> 00:52:03,460


1062
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:33,460


1063
00:52:33,460 --> 00:53:03,460


1064
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:33,460


1065
00:53:33,460 --> 00:54:03,460


1066
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:33,460


1067
00:54:33,460 --> 00:55:03,460


1068
00:55:03,460 --> 00:55:33,460


1069
00:55:33,460 --> 00:56:03,460


1070
00:56:03,460 --> 00:56:33,460


1071
00:56:33,460 --> 00:57:03,460


1072
00:57:03,460 --> 00:57:33,460


1073
00:57:33,460 --> 00:58:03,460


1074
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:33,460


1075
00:58:33,460 --> 00:59:03,460


1076
00:59:03,460 --> 00:59:33,460


1077
00:59:33,460 --> 01:00:03,460


1078
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:12,840
